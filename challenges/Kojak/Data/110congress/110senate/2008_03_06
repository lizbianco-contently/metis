Madam President, we had the opportunity last year to \ndebate, at great length, immigration. We spent weeks of Senate time on \nimmigration. I appreciate the concern of those interested in moving \nthose bills we reported. We knew it was coming. There was a big press \nfanfare that these bills were coming.\n  What we tried to do last year, and there was bipartisan support, we \ncould not get 60 votes, but we had bipartisan support. We wanted to \nmake sure our northern and southern borders were secured. That was \nwhere we directed our first attention with our legislation.\n  We also recognized that all over the country there are issues \nrelating to the need for temporary workers. There are people who would \nsay: Well, why would someone from Nevada be concerned about temporary \nworkers?\n  Well, the Presiding Officer comes from a State where agriculture is \nbig. But agriculture in certain parts of the State of Nevada is big. We \nare the largest producer of white onions in America; we produce the \nlargest amounts of garlic, and, of course, huge amounts of alfalfa.\n  With corn being used so much as it is for the production of \nalternative fuel, alfalfa is becoming a very high-quality, very \nimportant product. So we need temporary workers in the farm communities \nthroughout Nevada, but we also need them, on occasion, with our resort \nindustry.\n  So, No. 1, secure our borders, north and south. No. 2, we need to \ntake a look at guest workers, not in Nevada but the whole country. \nThere is a need to take a look at them.\n  Thirdly, our legislation said what are we going to do with the 11 or \n12 million people who are here who are undocumented? Our legislation \ndirected toward that, was it amnesty? Of course not. But what it did \nwas set up a process that people who were in the country who were \nundocumented could come out of the shadows. Would they go to the front \nof the line? Of course not. They would go way to the back of the line.\n  After having paid penalties and fines, learned English, stayed out of \ntrouble, paid taxes, it seems quite fair, after some 13 years or 14 \nyears, they would be able to have their status readjusted. It is \nimportant we do that. It is very clear we cannot deport 12 million \npeople. I am not sure--maybe some want to do that, but I think, \nrealistically, that is not part of what this country is about.\n  Finally, what we need to do is take a look at what we did in 1986; \nthat is, we established a new setup for immigration, and it was where \nwe would have employer sanctions; we shifted it from the Government to \nemployers. So we had four basic things in our immigration legislation: \nBorder security, temporary workers, path to legalization, and do \nsomething about employer sanctions that was more meaningful.\n  This was a good, strong piece of legislation. There were other things \nin that. But those were the four main parts. So I would hope this \nlegislation, which was supported by the President, is legislation we \ncould move forward on at some time.\n  Everyone has a right to offer whatever legislation they wish to \noffer. I acknowledge that. But I would think that rather than trying to \npiecemeal this legislation with little bits and pieces here, as \neveryone knows, if anything to do with immigration comes to the floor, \nother people who are concerned about certain aspects of border \nsecurity--temporary workers, pathway to legalization, employer \nsanctions--would offer amendments.\n  The difficulty we have had getting bills to the floor and having \nlegislation proceed has been very difficult. So I wanted everyone to \nknow this legislation which was brought to the Senate today, and as I \nrepeat, with great fanfare, big press events, if people want to do \nsomething about legislation on immigration, I do not think this is the \nright way to go. I hope the American public sees this for what it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1662-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, for the last few days, I have come to \nthe floor to propose a number of potential remedies Congress could \nemploy to address the current housing downturn; remedies aimed at \nhelping those who are struggling most and at creating new opportunities \nfor others.\n  In this economy, Congress certainly has a role to play. And that role \nis to help those in urgent need, while at the same time taking a longer \nview of the economy and its future strength.\n  Taxes are an area where Congress can clearly play a helpful or a \nharmful role. So the debate over the looming AMT tax, which is set to \nhit millions of middle-class Americans with an average tax hike of \nabout $2,000 this year, is extremely important.\n  Last year, at a time when there was less concern about the economy \noverall, both parties agreed that a tax which was never meant to hit \nthe middle class should be blocked. More than 170,000 families in my \nState are in danger of being hit with the AMT tax this year.\n  Nearly 900,000 taxpayers in Florida are in danger of getting hit by \nit. It is about the same number in Texas and Illinois, and \nMassachusetts, and Pennsylvania. In Ohio, nearly 900,000 taxpayers are \nexpected to get hit. And then there is New York and California. In New \nYork, more than 3 million families are in danger of getting hit with \nthe AMT this year, and in California nearly 4\\1/2\\ million families and \nindividuals are in danger of being stuck with this tax.\n  Last year, Republicans insisted that if we were going to protect \npeople from a tax they were never meant to pay in the first place, this \nmeant not raising some other tax on them somewhere else. Senate \nDemocrats came to share that view as well.\n  This year, Senate Democrats wisely opted in their budget resolution \nto take the same approach that prevailed last year: No new taxes, no \nnew taxes to cover the AMT patch.\n  House Democrats, on the other hand, have opted for a different \napproach. They want to raise taxes by more than $60 billion to pay for \nthe AMT. And they want to do it by circumventing the legislative \nprocess. They should know from the outset that Senate Republicans will \noppose this stealth and unfair tax hike, and we fully expect it will \nfail.\n  As the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, has said: \nRaising taxes to pay for the AMT is ``not the will of the Senate.''\n  Republicans stood strong for two basic principles last year when it \ncame to the budget: The tax burden is already too high for working \nfamilies and the businesses that create jobs in this country. And \nspending needs need to be kept in check to the President's top line.\n  We not only insisted on these principles, we fought for them. And on \nbehalf of the American taxpayer, we prevailed. I have no doubt we will \nhave similar success this year.\n  Republicans fought hard for fiscal discipline last year at a time \nwhen the\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\neconomy was not the central concern of the American people. At a time \nwhen it is the central concern of the American people, we cannot be \ntalking about raising taxes by tens of billions of dollars. We need to \nbe expanding the family budget, not the Federal budget. The House \nshould know that in this economy, this is a principle Senate \nRepublicans will defend aggressively.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1663-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill).

Madam President, today I am here to talk about the \nobstructionism across the aisle and how it is hurting our country, \npreventing progress, preventing change at a time when Americans demand \nchange. This chart says it all: 73 Republican filibusters and counting.\n  The Republican Party, Leader McConnell, and others have pointed out \nthat a handful of the filibusters may have been started by Democrats. \nWe can look at the circumstances of those. Maybe those were done \nbecause there was no choice, because somebody else was delaying in \nanother way. But let's say there were 10 of these that are Democratic. \nThen we will change this number from 73 to 63. It is still \noverwhelming. It is still the record.\n  The point we are making is very simple: This Republican minority, \nunable to put forward its own agenda, unable because they are not in \nsync with America, can only obstruct. If you had a single word to \ndescribe the tenor of the Republican minority this year and last year, \nthis session of Congress thus far, it would be ``obstruct.'' If you \nneeded two words, it would be ``obstruct, obstruct.'' If you needed a \nfew more words, it would be ``obstruct, obstruct, and then obstruct \nagain; get in the way.''\n  Admittedly, this body was designed, in the wisdom of the Founding \nFathers, to be the cooling saucer. This body is supposed to take a \ncareful look and slow things down. But there are times when history \ndemands change. There are times when the minority has understood that, \nand even though they would modify the way change occurs, they don't \nstand in the way and just say no. This is one of those times.\n  Technology has changed our world. It is not the same world it was \neven 10 or 15 years ago.\n  Technology has created terrorism. Why? Small groups of bad people \nhave been enabled by technology to strike at New York or London or \nMadrid and innocent civilians.\n  Technology has created one global labor market in so many different \nareas. It means the kids in the schools of New York or Arkansas or \nMissouri have to compete with the kids at schools in Berlin and Beijing \nand Bangor. It means that jobs are competing. It used to be New York \nState would compete with Connecticut and New Jersey and Pennsylvania \nand Missouri and Arkansas. Now we compete around the globe. That is \ntechnology, nothing else.\n  Technology has allowed us all to live longer. Praise God. The average \nlife expectancy goes up and up and up. I have a Dad who is 84. He plays \ngolf. Thirty years ago, a man 84 was rare, and when someone was 84, \nthey were old and frail. My dad, who led a hard life--so happy he now \nhas a nice, happy life--is active. He drives all around, argues with my \nmother about how far he can drive, and all of that.\n  We live longer, but that creates new strains on us as well. What \nabout health care for our elderly people? The costs go up, and every \none of us would give our right arm to see our mother or father have \nanother good year of health, or husband or wife or child. It means \npensions and what we do with later-life changes. It also means we live \nlonger and things get stretched out. People get married later. They are \nnot in a rush to get married and have a family. They find careers \nlater. They experiment. In the day when you had to just get a job \nquickly--a lot of people don't do that anymore. So it has changed that.\n  Technology has even changed little things. Our parents felt very much \nin control of us. I would get home at 3 o'clock from grade school, and \nI would go out on my street to play. It was baby boom time. There were \n50, 60 kids. We played all kinds of games and ran around. These days, \nmore likely, the children stay home. They are on the Internet. Lord \nknows what they are seeing. It is a different world.\n\n  Technology has changed everything, and technology demands that the \nU.S. Government help people adjust to that technology so they can \ncontinue to have the great American life. That is what America is \ndemanding--change. Look at the polls. They are unprecedented. How many \npeople think our country, under George Bush's leadership, is moving in \nthe right direction? A smaller and smaller percentage. How many people \nthink we need significant change? A larger and larger percentage. We \ncan argue about what that change should be, but change we must or our \nchildren and even ourselves in later years will not have the same good \nlife we have today.\n  We on the Democratic side are seeking to bring about some of that \nchange. Some of it is quite large--change the course of the war in \nIraq, change our health care system, change our energy policy. Some of \nit is smaller but important.\n  What do we face from the other side? The word ``no'' and the word \n``no'' again and the word ``no'' again. Using the Senate rules, which \nallow them to require 60 votes on even the smallest measures, they have \nslowed everything down. Again, the exact number is not the point; it is \nthat they have set the record. Republican filibusters are rampant. A \nfew of these are ours, many are theirs. They will get to 73 soon, I \nassure you.\n  Why do they do it? I will tell you why. I try to study history a \nlittle bit. I am hardly a Ph.D. in history, but I like to read about \nit, think about it. There are times when there is a paradigm shift in \nour politics. The year 1980 was one such time. Most of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle came in in that 1980 Ronald Reagan \nparadigm: strong security, shrink government, family values. Those were \nvery attractive. Now the times have changed. The old way doesn't work. \nBut their base--20 percent of the electorate but half, maybe more, of \nthe Republican base--is stuck in that old world. So they have one foot \nin one camp. They see where the public is, but they can't move. Their \nbase and their inability to break with that base have them paralyzed. \nSo there is only one choice--obstruct, say no. When you can't say yes \nabout anything, say no. That is what they have done--63, 65, 67, 68, \n69. Again, we are busy calculating how many, but it is a whole lot, and \nit is a record.\n  Let me talk about one example, the housing crisis. Our economy is \nheading south. The numbers are not good. Unemployment is going up. Job \ncreation is meager, anemic almost. The amount of income people have is \ndeclining, and expenses are going up. Just to continue to buy energy--\noil, gas, heating oil--food, with prices that have gone through the \nroof because of energy in part, eats up all of most average families' \nextra income. So our economy is hurting.\n  What is at the bull's-eye of that economic downturn? It is housing, \nall kinds of problems. Again, the old philosophy, Reagan philosophy--\ndon't regulate these new mortgage brokers--has led to a disaster. The \nbanks were pretty regulated. They are not to blame in this crisis by \nand large, the initial\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\nbanks that made mortgages, the community banker, for instance, \nregulated by the Federal Government. But the mortgage brokers who are \nnot affiliated with banks, unregulated, are clearly at the nub of this. \nThey were unregulated, and that was the old philosophy on that side of \nthe aisle--no regulation, let the buyer beware. Well, the buyer got \nhurt. But as we learned in economics, the person in the house next \ndoor, who is fully paid on his or her mortgage, got hurt because his or \nher housing values went down.\n  Now we even have a credit freeze because people so miscalculated--the \ngreat financial moguls so miscalculated the value of these mortgages, \nit has now cast into doubt the way we evaluate credit everywhere. The \nPort Authority of New York just paid 17 percent for a short-term bond. \nEveryone knows the Port Authority is going to pay it back--they have a \ngreat revenue stream--but still, people are worried.\n  So the only way we are going to get to turn this economy around is do \nsome things with housing. We on the Democratic side proposed a modest \npackage of five measures, many of which had bipartisan support--raising \nthe mortgage revenue caps was proposed by President Bush--and every one \nof them was designed to be focused, not that expensive--some money but \nnot a huge program, designed to bring support from the other side.\n  Then Senator Reid went to the floor and said: There are good ideas \nfrom the other side of the aisle. Senator Isakson has a very \ninteresting idea about a credit for first-time home buyers for a while \nto encourage people to buy homes and get this housing market going. \nSenator Reid offered Senator McConnell the opportunity--you offer your \namendments, modify the housing package, and let's move forward.\n  Again, what did we get? I don't know what number it was: another \nblock, another filibuster, another requirement that we are not going to \nlet this go forward. We are either going to delay and delay and delay \nwith countless amendments, irrelevant amendments, or we will not let \nyou move forward on any of your amendments--either one fitting into \nthis category of ``filibuster.''\n  Why don't they join us? Here the economy is sinking, and yet we had \none vote, I believe it was, on the other side of the aisle saying: \nLet's move forward and get a housing package.\n  We are willing to entertain your amendments--not amendments that have \nnothing to do with housing: the estate tax--you know, the old saws. \nLet's do that another time. We have done it before. I am sure we will \ndo it again, probably on the budget that is coming up next week. But \nlet's move forward on housing.\n  Senator Reid was extremely generous in his offer. What was the \nanswer? No. This chart, in other words, says: No.\n  Our country demands change. Housing is in crisis. The housing crisis \nhas spread like ripples outward on a pond, hurting--hurting--our \neconomy, hurting it as a whole. Here we have a smart, well-designed, \nthoughtful, and not overly broad package of housing reforms, and \ninstead of debating, the other side obstructs. Is it because there are \nfew on that side of the aisle who say: No Government involvement, and \nthey are able to exert their will on the whole Republican minority and \nsay: Just stop it? Is it because most of the other side is scared of \nthe Republican base that says: No Government involvement, let the \neconomy sink?\n  We heard that from Herbert Hoover. We heard that from William \nMcKinley. We have learned about the economy since those days. We have \nlearned that smart government involvement, particularly when there is \nan economic downturn--people are hurting, jobs are not being created--\nis the right thing to do.\n  Again, we can debate what the right way to do it is. I am sure most \non the other side would more prefer tax cuts. Some of us prefer some \nmoney for CDBG or mortgage counselors--some Government spending. But \nlet's debate it, and let's come up with a result. And instead: No. \nFilibuster. Again, maybe it is No. 73, maybe it is No. 69, maybe it is \nNo. 67. I don't know what number it is. They are busy calculating that \nupstairs. But it is a big two-letter number.\n  The only thing I can say, putting on my political hat--I will tell \nyou, the public is demanding change. The times, they are a-changing. If \nyou do not seek to make that change, you will be called accountable in \nNovember. I do not want that to happen. I want to see a good, robust \nelection. I want to see Democrats pick up seats. But given the choice, \nI would much rather have us join together in constructive legislation \nand each get credit for it.\n  But that is not going to happen unless we have a change in attitude, \nunless we go back to the old ways when filibusters were used on issues \nof major import but not used routinely to block every single piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let us hope the membership on the other side of the aisle will see \nthe light. Let us hope they will see that mere obstructionism is not \nwhat the country wants. Let us hope they understand there is a demand \nfor change out there in the country. And let us hope they will join \nwith us in seeking that right degree of change with open debate, with \ndiscussion of relevant amendments, and moving forward to heal some of \nthe economic wounds the country is now facing.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday 12 Senators announced their \nintention to file 15 bills that would deal with the broken immigration \nsystem we have--15 responsible pieces of legislation that would be \neffective, in discrete, separate ways, to close some of the loopholes \nthat are making our immigration system not work.\n  This is important. It is important for the Senate to undertake this. \nI believe we should follow through, in the wake of last year's defeat \nof the massive amnesty proposal, with what so many Members have \npromised: real reform and real enforcement and border security first. \nThat was what we decided last summer, I think, by most observers. We \ndecided that amnesty before enforcement was backwards, and we needed \nenforcement first. That is what we talked about, and that is what the \nvote indicated when there was a massive defeat of that comprehensive \nbill.\n  Now, the majority leader this morning, to my dismay, called that \ndiscussion yesterday fanfare. He said he hoped the American people can \nsee what is going on here. Let's be frank about what is going on here. \nThe majority leader, by those words, indicates to me he has no \nintention of moving forward with enforcement legislation. The leader of \nthe Democrats in the Senate has indicated he does not want to go \nforward with it and that he is still in last year's and the year \nbefore's philosophy that the way to handle immigration is to refuse to \npass anything that impacts positively enforcement until he is able to \nforce through a massive amnesty.\n  I will not go into the details of that discussion last year, but it \nwas honest and detailed and long. When the debate was over, the \nAmerican people and this Senate voted it down. We rejected it because \nit will not work that way. We must have the enforcement first. There \nare so many loopholes out there.\n  It is disappointing. That is, frankly, where we are. Fourteen of his \ncolleagues on the Democratic side voted to reject that plan. There were \nonly 46 votes for it. You needed 60 to pass it. The suggestion that we \nare going to go back to a comprehensive plan such as that is not sound.\n  These bills that have been offered by a fine group of Senators are \nexcellent, responsible pieces of legislation. They help control some of \nthe problems we have. I am disappointed it looks as though we are going \nto have to work hard to force an opportunity to even get votes on some \nof these critically needed pieces of legislation.\n  Of the 15 bills that are in the package that was announced yesterday, \nover half of them have had prior votes in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\n  Senator DeMint's fence completion bill, S. 2712, has been the subject \nof four votes. The fence completion bill--and we voted on it, voted on \nit, and it wins every time--but you look out here, and all we have is a \nbroken virtual fence that will not work, and very few miles of fence, \nvery little of the double border. It is not occurring.\n  Senator Domenici's bill, to keep the National Guard there longer, has \nbeen voted on twice.\n  My bill requiring mandatory minimums for those who enter the country \nillegally has been voted on twice. It is a pretty tough bill. Somebody \nsaid we introduced a tough package. It would require 10 days detention \nat a minimum if you come here illegally. How extreme is that? If you \ncome back a second time, a longer period. My legislation would also \nestablish new worksite enforcement measures. That has been voted on at \nleast twice in the Senate.\n  Various forms of the Chambliss-Isakson bill, creating effective \npartnerships between law enforcement and the Federal Government in \nState and local agencies, has received numerous votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes. There are a \nnumber of other bills from Senator Vitter, Senator Inhofe, Senator \nLamar Alexander, Senator Arlen Specter--and I have his remarks, which I \nwill submit for the Record, and all of these things we voted on, many \nof which passed and some of which were in last year's comprehensive \nbill.\n\n  I see my colleague is here, Senator Elizabeth Dole, who is so \nthoughtful on these issues and is a superb Senator and who has given a \nlot of time and interest in trying to do this thing right. I know she \nhas a piece of legislation she would like to discuss.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, in the time remaining in the 110th \nCongress, there is still much that can be done to address critical \npieces of the massively complex immigration issue. As my good friend, \nthe Senator from Alabama, who made such kind comments, has related, we \nare offering solutions to demonstrated problems--measures that have \nbipartisan appeal and broad public support.\n  I have introduced legislation which would repeal President Bill \nClinton's Executive order requiring the Federal Government to provide \nservices in languages other than English. It is impractical and \nfiscally irresponsible to provide services in the hundreds of languages \nspoken in the United States at an estimated cost of up to $2 billion \nannually. My bill would also help ensure that Federal funds to local \nand State governments are not jeopardized because they provide English-\nonly services. Moreover, proficiency in English should be encouraged, \nas it is required for citizenship and essential for maximizing \nopportunities in this country.\n  My other bill, the Safe Roads Enhancement Act of 2008, would amend \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act to make a drunk driving conviction \na deportable offense for illegal aliens. It also would classify a third \ndrunk driving conviction as an aggravated felony and therefore a \ndeportable offense for nationals of a foreign country.\n  In my State of North Carolina, there have been a number of fatal \nautomobile accidents caused by an intoxicated person who was in the \nUnited States illegally. In several of these incidents, the illegal \nalien has a record of DWI but has been caught and released. For \nfamilies, the pain of losing a loved one is compounded by the knowledge \nthat the person responsible for these fatalities was not even in this \ncountry legally.\n  A tragic example occurred in Charlotte last spring when a man \nattempted to cross the street and was struck and killed by a drunk \ndriver who then fled the scene. Fortunately, police were able to \napprehend the driver, an illegal alien with a previous DWI conviction, \nbefore he could harm anyone else. Cases such as this are not isolated, \nand they are not specific to North Carolina. Across our Nation, similar \nsenseless tragedies occur on roads and highways.\n  My bill would help ensure that undocumented aliens who have self-\nidentified themselves by drunk driving are removed. Likewise, \nindividuals who abuse their legal status in the United States by \nrepeatedly breaking drunk driving laws would lose their privilege of \nliving in our country. Sadly, as we have seen repeatedly, we sorely \nneed to strengthen immigration laws with regard to drunk driving \nconvictions.\n  Furthermore, our Government urgently needs to be laser-focused on \nremoving undocumented aliens who are self-identifying themselves by \ncommitting other crimes, such as drug trafficking and gang-related \nactivities. Most of us can agree that criminal aliens who are obviously \nhere for the wrong reasons should be removed. If we are not safe in our \nown communities and in our own homes, then what else is going to \nmatter?\n  I am very proud that as a result of my many months working with \nFederal officials and sheriffs across our 100 North Carolina counties, \nours is the first State in the Nation to have a statewide partnership \nplan for sheriffs to coordinate with ICE, part of the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security. This plan will ensure that all North Carolina \nsheriffs can readily access, if they choose, the tools such as 287(g) \nto identify and help process undocumented aliens who have self-\nidentified themselves by committing crimes.\n  This plan is being implemented by the steering committee of North \nCarolina sheriffs and adopts a regional approach to ensure statewide \naccess to 287(g) databases and other resources to determine the \nimmigration status of apprehended individuals. The State is being \naudited as we speak. I welcome the work of my colleagues from Georgia \nfor their bill that recognizes that local law enforcement officers are \non the front lines fighting crime in their communities, and it directs \nadditional resources for these types of Federal partnerships that can \nhelp bring criminal alien problems under control.\n  The No. 1 lesson learned from the Senate's failed immigration bill is \nthat Americans simply don't have confidence their Government is serious \nabout securing our borders and enforcing our laws. Real action, real \nresults on this front are long overdue. People don't want promises \nanymore, they want proof. We now have a chance to put the horse before \nthe cart and enact the border security and enforcement policies that \nwill bring about the political will and support to further address our \nbroken immigration system. I urge my colleagues' support of this \ncommonsense approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina \nand the Senator from Alabama for their leadership on this immigration \nissue. Thanks for a few moments to speak on a bill that I will be \noffering related to the immigration debate that is called the Complete \nFence Act.\n  Last year, I think we took on a noble task of trying to solve the \nimmigration problem with one grand bill, but what we have learned in \nthe Senate is that it is very difficult to focus on one issue and get a \nbill through without a lot of add-ons for special interests. We are \ncertainly seeing it with the consumer product safety bill that we are \ndebating now.\n  The House passed a bill that was bipartisan and unanimous and was \nsupported by consumer groups as well as industry groups. It was a bill \nthat was ready for us to take and pass and send to the President. But \nwe in the Senate needed to add in a number of special interest \nprovisions that have nothing to do with consumer product safety. We \neven discovered last night, as the bill was put into a managers' \namendment, they had added some new things that apply to one State and \nthings that have nothing to do--no germaneness--with consumer product \nsafety that we have to deal with.\n  Certainly, that is what we ran into on the immigration issue. So much \nwas added to the bill, it was like trying to swallow an apple when that \napple needs to be eaten with a number of different bites.\n  That is what we are trying to do with this series of immigration \nbills which recognize that in order to have a real solution to the \nimmigration problem in the country, we need to build a platform for \nreform one plank at a time. Even those who were pushing the \ncomprehensive bill now realize we need to begin with border control and \nenforcement, the type of enforcement internally that the Senator from \nNorth\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\nCarolina was talking about: a worker verification program so employers \nknow who is legal and who is not. If we build this system that way, in \na way the American people can trust, we can get to the point where \nAmerica will trust us to develop new immigration policies, how to deal \nwith those who are already here, and how to accept immigrants in the \nfuture who are needed for our economy.\n  But the very first step, as all of us have recognized, is to have \nborder control. This body has passed several times legislation that \nwould build a 700-mile fence along the border that would support our \nBorder Patrol in stopping illegal immigrants. It is not just an issue \nof illegal immigrants themselves; it also involves drug trafficking, it \ninvolves human trafficking, and it also involves security from \nterrorists who might be smuggling weapons into this country. It is \nessential that we control our borders.\n  In 2006, Congress passed the Secure Fence Act which required 700 \nmiles of fencing, and this is metal fencing--this is not virtual \nfencing; this is metal pedestrian fencing along the southwest border--\nand a deadline for 370 miles of this to be completed by the end of this \nyear. At this point, only 167 miles of real metal fencing has been \ncompleted, but we have been assured by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity that they will meet their goal of 370 miles of fencing before \nthe end of this year.\n  The bill I am introducing would set a deadline for 2010 for all 700 \nmiles of pedestrian metal fencing to be completed. This is essential to \nmove ahead with the immigration reform process so the American people \nwill know we are serious about protecting the border and having a \nworkable immigration system.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to urge the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and comfort the American people with the fact that we are \nserious about completing this fence and to support the Complete Fence \nAct of 2008.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today in support of a piece of \nlegislation that my colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, and I have \nfiled. I compliment my friends and colleagues from South Carolina, \nNorth Carolina, and Alabama for their leadership. I look forward to \nsupporting their commonsense measures toward doing what we said we were \ngoing to do, which is secure the border.\n  The one thing we learned last year, as the Senator from North \nCarolina alluded to earlier, during the immigration reform debate is \nthe American people don't have confidence in Congress that we are going \nto do what we say we are going to do when it comes to border security. \nThere is good reason for that. Credibility on this issue is simply \nlacking, both with the administration, as well as with Congress. Now we \nhave an opportunity to come back and take a commonsense approach from a \nlegislative perspective on truly securing the border. The legislation \nSenator Isakson and I are introducing does this.\n  A lot of people have said: Senator, why don't you just enforce the \nlaws that are on the books today? Why don't you get local law \nenforcement officials involved in helping secure the border and in \ndealing with people who are here illegally?\n  Well, the fact is, local law enforcement officials have very little \npower when it comes to dealing with folks who are in violation of a \nFederal immigration law, particularly when it comes to being here \nillegally. So what our particular piece of legislation does is, it puts \nthe tools in the hands of those folks who are going to have the primary \ncontact and are more likely to have the initial contact with folks who \nare here illegally, and that is local law enforcement officials versus \nsomeone from ICE or any other part of the Federal Government from a law \nenforcement standpoint.\n\n  All of us remember that three of the 9/11 hijackers were stopped on \nroutine traffic stops by local law enforcement officials. \nUnfortunately, those local law enforcement officials did not have the \nmeans whereby they could check to determine whether those individuals \nwere in this country legally or illegally. If they would have had the \ninput--not access but the input--by the Federal Government into the \nNCIC, which is the national identification tracking mechanism for \nvehicles and drivers of vehicles that is used nationwide, then those \nlocal law enforcement officials would have known and understood those \nindividuals were here illegally. And if they would have had the tools \notherwise given in this piece of legislation, they could have dealt \nwith and detained those individuals.\n  So what we seek to do with this commonsense piece of legislation is \nto, first of all, clarify the authority that local governments have in \nthe normal course of carrying out their duties to help enforce our \nimmigration laws. Secondly, it will expand the National Crime \nInformation Centers Immigration Violators File to include those \nindividuals who are known to be here illegally, or known to be here \nlegally, so they can be cross-referenced in an instant and not have to \nworry about getting incorrect information or making assumptions.\n  This piece of legislation expands the 287(g) program, which is a very \npopular program with our law enforcement officials. Three of my \ncounties in Georgia are already utilizing this program. What it does \nis, the Federal Government steps in with a county anywhere in the \ncountry to provide the law enforcement officials in that county with \ntraining and instructions as to how to deal with folks who are found to \nbe violating our immigration laws.\n  Lastly, it will compensate State and local entities for immigration-\nenforcement-related expenses.\n  Madam President, common sense is what we are asking for here when it \ncomes to enforcing the border and providing our law enforcement \nofficials with the tools necessary to assist in making sure our borders \nare secure.\n  With that, I look forward to working with my other colleagues on \ntheir particular pieces of legislation as we move forward to make sure \nwe restore confidence with the American people when it comes to border \nsecurity, and we will be able to truly say we have secured the border, \nand here is how we have done it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise today to join several of my \ncolleagues to continue to focus on the enormous problem facing our \ncountry of illegal immigration. I am proud to not only rise with these \ncolleagues, some of whom have been on the floor this morning, but also \nto actively work with them on important enforcement and other measures \nthat we can and must push forward this year to make significant \nimprovements, to take significant strides in moving forward to solve \nthe problem.\n  Yesterday, I announced, along with others, two things--first of all, \nthe formation of a brand-new caucus in the Senate, which I organized. I \nam proud to say that now I believe the number is 12 Members have joined \nthe caucus. It is the Border Security and Enforcement First Caucus. The \npurpose behind the group is exactly as the name implies: to push border \nsecurity and enforcement first as the key, necessary first step in \nsolving this enormous problem.\n  We have tried the other approach over and over for decades, and that \nis the so-called comprehensive approach. All that has yielded is gaps \nof time--3 to 5 years--and then there is a comprehensive approach that \nwas tried and completely rejected by the American people. That approach \nhas only led to failure because it doesn't jibe with what the American \npeople know is the right approach, which is taking this in steps and \nstarting with crucial enforcement, proving to them that Washington is \ngoing to do what it has never done before--have the political will and \nget real about enforcement.\n  Most recently, of course, the American people rejected that approach \nlast July when they chimed in and had the Senate view its will to kill \nthat last so-called comprehensive bill--a large amnesty bill with which \nthey disagreed vehemently. So this is a new approach that can lead to \nprogress, achievement, and success--enforcement first.\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\n  Also, yesterday a broad group of Senators introduced a package of \nbills that moves us in that direction. I have two bills in that \npackage, which I will briefly mention.\n  The first bill would say that so-called sanctuary cities--local \njurisdictions that set as official policy that they are not going to \ncooperate in any way with immigration enforcement and with our Federal \nimmigration enforcement officials--will not get COPS funding. Instead, \nthat COPS funding will go to the rest of the local jurisdictions in the \ncountry who do work with us in immigration enforcement.\n  The second amendment simply says that matricula consular cards issued \nby the Mexican Government to their citizens in this country--\noftentimes, their citizens who are here illegally cannot be accepted by \nU.S. banks, to allow them to do things like open bank accounts and have \ncredit cards. That is clearly a vehicle that is used now by millions of \nillegal aliens, allowing them to operate freely and effectively in this \ncountry. It should end for many reasons, security reasons and for \nenforcement reasons. My bill would do that.\n  Again, I am proud to join with a number of Senators in this important \npush toward enforcement first and the formation of our new caucus, the \nBorder Security and Enforcement First Caucus, and in introducing this \nimportant package of bills, which we can move and pass this year.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to reject and defy the conventional \nwisdom that we cannot do significant things in a big election year. We \ncan and we must because we face significant challenges, and certainly \nillegal immigration is near the top of that list.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Who yields time?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for talking about \nsome of the legislation that was announced yesterday in a press \nconference--15 pieces of legislation, offered by 12 Senators, that they \nbelieve would help create a lawful system of immigration and that they \nwould like to discuss and debate and vote on this year.\n  My friend, the Democratic leader, said he didn't like it, apparently \nbecause a number of those Senators gathered and announced at a press \nconference their ideas. He called that ``great fanfare, a press \nevent,'' with a little bit of a sniff, I think. And then he said these \nwords: ``I hope the American public sees it for what it is.''\n  That kind of hurt my feelings. Can we not have a press conference to \nannounce legislation that is going to improve America and talk about \nit? Is he suggesting that there is a nefarious plan afoot here? What is \nit that he is not happy about?\n  I just suggest that it was a revealing comment by the majority \nleader, with his inside-the-beltway hat on. What was revealed by that \ncomment? He is suggesting that we should not bring it up because a lot \nof people in the media and the ``masters of the universe,'' I call \nthem, who want to control all this immigration and make it do what they \nwant it to do--and they realize the American people do not agree with \nthem, but they want to do it anyway. So I think it was a revealing \ncomment when the majority leader said that something is afoot here. \nWhat he is concerned about is that these bills might actually be \nbrought up, as Senator Vitter has announced, as a good piece of \nlegislation--may actually be brought up and, heavens, they might be \nasked to vote on it with an election coming up; that it is unfair to \nask the U.S. Senate to vote on legislation that the American people \nwould like to see pass, that could help create lawfulness in the \nimmigration system, with an election coming up. He hopes the American \npeople ``see it for what it is.''\n  Well, if the fact that an election is coming up helps our colleagues \nto be more alert to the real need for reform, the real need to end \nunlawfulness in immigration, then so be it; maybe that is a good thing. \nI don't see anything wrong with asking a Senator, who is paid by the \ntaxpayers of America a decent wage, a good wage, to vote on important \npieces of legislation that the public cares about.\n  I suppose the majority leader, who would oppose, apparently, the \nlegislation--or at least some of it--that we are talking about here \nwould prefer that we wait until early next year, after the election, \nand he would have a better chance then of cobbling together the votes \nto kill the reforms that are needed. Maybe that is what he has in his \nmind. But we are entitled as Senators to have votes on bills. \nHopefully, we will move forward with some good legislation that will \nwork.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to discuss the \nAccountability in Immigrant Repatriation Act of 2008, S. 2720.\n  This bill addresses the reality that aliens who have been ordered to \nbe removed from this country are often released back onto U.S. streets \ndue to the refusal of their home countries to repatriate them. \nMoreover, many of these aliens are criminals who have served time in \nour Federal, State, and local jails. As of February 11, 2008, eight \ncountries--such as Vietnam, Jamaica, China, India, and Ethiopia--are \nrefusing to repatriate a total of over 139,000 aliens. Over 18,000 of \nthem are convicted criminals who have been released back into U.S. \nsociety. Secretary Chertoff testified this week that his counterparts \nin Europe are facing similar problems repatriating dangerous aliens.\n  We must increase the pressure on foreign countries to take back the \naliens that have been ordered deported. The Supreme Court in two \ncases--Zadvydas v. Davis and Clark v. Martinez--adopted a presumption \nthat it is only reasonable to continue to detain aliens ordered to be \ndeported for up to 6 months. So at the end of that time, if the home \ncountry steadfastly refuses to repatriate, we are forced to release \nthem.\n  This is of obvious concern to the citizens of this country, who are \nput at risk by criminal aliens who are released. In Pennsylvania, there \nare 700 to 1,000 undocumented criminal aliens that could end up out on \nour streets if their home countries refuse to take them back when we \ntry to deport them. The recidivism rate among this population is \nextremely high. Studies show that the average criminal illegal alien \nwas rearrested an estimated six to eight times--most often for drug \ncrimes, robbery and assault, and, to a lesser degree, for murder and \nsexual offenses. Moreover, not only does refusal to repatriate often \nput convicted criminals with no right to be here out on the street, but \ndrawn-out repatriation negotiations divert scarce Federal resources \naway from identifying and deporting other criminal aliens.\n  Therefore, this bill imposes sanctions on countries that refuse to \nrepatriate aliens who have been ordered deported. First, the bill \nrequires the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress \nevery 90 days on the countries which refuse or inhibit repatriation. \nThe receipt of this report automatically triggers denial of foreign aid \nas well as suspension of visa issuances to the listed non-cooperative \ncountries. This will send a clear signal to those countries unwilling \nto take responsibility for their citizens that they will no longer \nbenefit from U.S. largess--in the form of money and visas.\n  It also grants standing to enforce the bill to victims of crimes \ncommitted by nonrepatriated criminal aliens. Current law, which gives \nthe administration discretion to deny visas to uncooperative countries, \nhas been sorely underutilized. This bill eliminates such discretion.\n  Section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act directs the \nState Department not to issue visas to nationals of countries \nidentified by the Attorney General--now the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity--as countries that deny or delay repatriation. Congressional \nintent was clear, and the remedy was potent when applied against Guyana \nseveral years ago. However, the Congressional Research Service has not \nidentified any other instance in which Homeland Security elected to \nissue the triggering notification to the State Department.\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\n  On February 15, I wrote letters to the Secretaries of State and \nHomeland Security as well as to the Attorney General to find out why \nthis authority is seemingly unutilized. On March 4, I reiterated my \nconcerns to Secretary Chertoff in person, when he testified before the \nAppropriations Subcommittee. He committed to working with us to find \nways to extend the 6-month detention in appropriate cases rather than \nsimply releasing all deportable aliens. This is a welcome step--one \nthat will complement the bill I am introducing\n  Foreign relations are complex and there is a need to balance \ncompeting interests; however, ensuring the public safety is a \nGovernment's primary duty and must be its first priority. Also, we must \nensure that prolonged repatriation negotiations do not drain scarce \nresources. It makes little sense to continue admitting persons if we \ncannot be sure that their countries will take them back in the event \nthey are ordered removed from this country. Similarly, it makes little \nsense to continue rewarding such countries with U.S. taxpayer dollars \nin the form of foreign aid.\n  This bill addresses the problem by imposing sanctions on non-\nrepatriating countries that refuse to cooperate and take \nresponsibility. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I referred to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 15, 2008.\n     Hon.

Moreover, most of these aliens are released back into \n     the population, as extended detention is untenable due to a \n     lack of resources and the Supreme Court's Zadvydas decision.\n       Many of these recalcitrant nations receive substantial U.S. \n     aid, and their citizens are regularly issued U.S. visas. The \n     Congress has already attempted to address this problem, in \n     section 243(d) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, and \n     I am curious as to why it is not utilized to greater effect. \n     According to the statute, upon notification from the Attorney \n     General that a country denies or unreasonably delays \n     repatriation (such notification is now provided by the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security), the Secretary of State \n     ``shall'' suspend visa issuances until notified by the \n     Attorney General that the country has accepted the alien.\n       This tactic is potent in theory, and was successful in \n     practice when applied against Guyana several years ago. While \n     I appreciate that foreign relations is a delicate affair \n     involving balancing numerous interests, surely public safety \n     in the United States is a priority of the highest order. Not \n     only does refusal to repatriate often put convicted criminals \n     with no right to be here back on the street, but drawn out \n     repatriation negotiations divert scarce federal resources \n     away from identifying and deporting other criminal aliens--as \n     many as 300,000 of whom were incarcerated in 2007 and will be \n     released rather than deported at the conclusion of their \n     sentences.\n       It seems incongruous for the United States to continue \n     admitting the citizens of an uncooperative country that \n     refuses to take back those who are convicted criminals.

I thank my colleagues for the fact that every single amendment \nthat has been offered has been germane. That is great. The fact that \neverybody stayed focused on the subject matter has helped.\n\n  I know Senator Stevens, who is on the floor now, will concur that it \nhas been exemplary how Senators have conducted themselves on this bill. \nWe thank everyone, all the Senators and the staff, for keeping the \namendments germane. It is very important to getting this bill done this \nweek.\n  The other good news is, our staffs burned the midnight oil last \nnight, Democrats and Republicans. We have been putting together a \nmanagers' package, to give a quick status report on that. We think \nthere are about 12 or so amendments in that managers' package right now \nthat have been agreed to. It looks as if maybe we have around eight \namendments that are pending. We are hoping we can work out some issues \non some of those amendments. We understand there may be a small number \nof amendments still coming, but we have run our traps here, so to \nspeak.\n  Again, the good news is we think we have a manageable number of \namendments. We know we are going to have a vote in about 15 minutes. It \nwill be on an amendment that is pending. Again, that is great. We will \ntry to dispense with that amendment, however it comes out. Then we will \nmove on to have further amendments throughout the day.\n  We are very encouraged. I thank Senator Stevens for his leadership \nand his staff. They have been great. We appreciate their efforts to try \nto shepherd this bill through.\n  I do not want to make a prediction because I don't know and I don't \npretend to know how this is going to turn out, but it appears to me \nthat it is possible we could easily finish this bill today. It is \npossible--I don't want to jinx myself--but maybe even this afternoon. \nInstead of going into the late evening hours tonight, it is conceivable \nwe might be able to finish it this afternoon if we work hard and stay \non task.\n  I wanted to give the Senate an update. We look forward to the \ncollegial spirit everyone has shown so far. We hope it continues today. \nI thank everybody for their cooperation and assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are scheduled \nfor a vote at 11 o'clock; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The time is divided between Senators Vitter \nand Pryor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be pleased to yield that time to the Senator from \nOklahoma. I only control half of the time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will postpone my remarks until after the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise again today in strong support of my \namendment No. 4097. My amendment is very simple and very \nstraightforward and, in fact, it conforms to present law, as well as to \nprovisions in the House bill, with regard to the awarding of reasonable \ncosts and attorney's fees.\n  My amendment simply says that a judge can award reasonable costs and \nattorney's fees from the loser to the winner no matter which side wins \nand loses. So if an attorney general brings an action and prevails on \nthat consumer product safety action, then it is in the judge's \ndiscretion to award costs and attorney's fees from the losing private \nparty to the attorney general. But fairly, if the opposite happens, if \nthe private party is vindicated, if the private party goes through this \nlitigation, which is always significant, lengthy, and costly, and wins \nand is vindicated, then it is also within the discretion of the judge--\nit is not mandatory--it is within the discretion of the judge that the \nprivate party be awarded reasonable costs and attorney's fees from the \nlosing side; in that case, the attorney general.\n  That, again, is essentially present law. It can go in either \ndirection. It is up to the court. The words are a little different, but \nthat is essentially the policy embodied by the House bill. I think that \nis even and that is fair. That does not create an undue push in either \ndirection.\n  Unfortunately, the underlying bill, the bill before the Senate is \nvery different. It says that only the attorney general in prevailing \ncan get reasonable costs and attorney's fees. The private party, even \nif it goes through very lengthy, very protracted, and very expensive \nlitigation and is completely vindicated, can never get reasonable costs \nand attorney's fees, even if the judge thinks that is appropriate.\n  I think that is wrong. I think it is imbalanced and unfair. It is \nvery important that we act to promote consumer safety. It is very \nimportant that we pass some of the measures in this bill and many of \nthe measures in the House bill which I supported as an alternative. In \ndoing that, we need to not make certain problems worse, and one of the \nproblems that has existed is a clog of activity before the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission and also in the courts.\n  I feel this underlying provision in the Senate bill, which is all in \none direction, could make that clog worse, could\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\nencourage lawsuits which are not thought through, and could encourage \nfrivolous lawsuits. That adds to the workload of the courts and \npotentially the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We want to \nencourage lawsuits which are needed--not frivolous ones, ones which are \nfully thought through. The Vitter amendment will establish the even \nplaying field that will encourage that rather than encourage lawsuits \nwhich have very dubious merits and could be frivolous.\n  It is very reasonable, common sense to say that we are going to leave \nthis all up to the discretion of the court, nothing is mandatory, but \nthe court can award reasonable costs and attorney's fees to either side \nthat prevails and not only in one direction, so that a private party \nwho is completely vindicated after a long, expensive, and protracted \nlitigation, can never, even if the judge thinks it is appropriate, be \nawarded reasonable costs and attorney's fees.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to accept this very reasonable approach, \nthe policy of which is embodied in both present law and the House bill, \nand reject creating the imbalance which I think would only clog our \nsystem with lawsuits of very questionable merit.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, we think--we are not sure--that the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee may be on his way. I know he \nhas a hearing and some other pending business. I know he feels strongly \nabout this amendment.\n  I rise, in his absence, in opposition to the Vitter amendment. I \nunderstand the rationale and the reasons Senator Vitter is offering for \nthis amendment. In fact, when I saw this amendment, I hearkened back to \nmy days in law school. This is a classic moot court competition \nexercise on who should pay the attorney's fees. The classic English \nsystem is that the loser pays, but the American system has been \ndifferent. It has been different since the founding of our Republic. It \nhas been a bedrock of the American judicial system for well over 200 \nyears that each side pays their own attorney's fees.\n  There are a lot of reasons for that system. I don't have to go into \nthe history of it. Again, this is a first-year law school topic. I do \nthink it is important in this specific instance that the Senate not \nbreak with American jurisprudence, not break with American tradition, \nand not change this law. It is very important for several reasons. One \nis, in this case, if the loser has to pay the attorney's fees, we know \nwho the loser is, don't we? It is the State taxpayers. It is not the \nFederal taxpayers. It is the State taxpayers, our people. Our people \nwill have to pay these attorney's fees.\n  When you have a matter as important as the public safety and welfare \nof the people of your State, the attorney general should be allowed to \npursue getting these dangerous products off the shelves, keeping their \nStates safe for their people without having to be concerned about this \nchange in the American legal system that Senator Vitter is \nrecommending.\n\n  The other point we all need to remember is that there is something in \nthe world of civil litigation called rule 11. Rule 11 is not only under \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but it is in almost every single \nState's rules of civil procedure I am aware of--maybe every State. I \nhate to say that without knowing exactly. I am sure it is in the vast \nmajority of States. Rule 11 allows judges to penalize a lawyer for \nbringing a frivolous lawsuit. That is a very important balanced \nstandard and balanced process, that the legal system has to make sure \nthat no one brings a frivolous lawsuit, but most of all the attorney \ngeneral.\n  We also have to remember, as we said yesterday, these attorneys \ngeneral are not like some lawyer off the street. These are, by and \nlarge, elected officials. Mr. President, 42 or 44 State attorneys \ngeneral are elected by the very same people who elect us. There are a \nhandful who are appointed by a Governor, I think one or two by a \nlegislature, and one by a State supreme court. Regardless, the vast \nmajority are elected by the very same people who elect us. So let's \nallow the State attorneys general to have the discretion in their \nStates to try to keep their States safe and free of dangerous products.\n  In closing, there is a compelling interest that these State attorneys \ngeneral have the ability to get these dangerous products off the \nshelves. We have seen this, we have talked with a lot of people about \nthis, and we all know that the Consumer Product Safety Commission is \noverworked. They work hard to do these recalls. Sometimes they take a \nlong time to do them, but, nonetheless, they work very hard to do these \nrecalls. It is beneficial for the whole system to allow the State \nattorneys general to get these dangerous products out of the \nmarketplace in their States. With all due respect to the CPSC, they do \nnot have the resources to do this, they do not have the people to do \nthis, and they are focused on other issues. They are looking at \npresent-day concerns, not what they dealt with yesterday.\n  It is very important that we have a strong attorney general \nenforcement mechanism. I would hate to see it weakened by changing this \nlongstanding American rule of law. I ask all my colleagues to oppose \nthe Vitter amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Vitter has submitted an amendment \nto the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, Reform Act that would \ndiscourage State attorneys general from bringing enforcement actions \nagainst those who violate consumer product safety regulations. This \namendment goes even further than the Cornyn amendment that we voted on \nlast night to gut the enforcement provisions in the bill. The Pryor-\nStevens legislation wisely gives State attorneys general the power to \nprotect their citizens from harmful products by pursuing such \nlitigation. We should not gut that important enforcement power by \nadding a threat that could shift enforcement costs to taxpayers.\n  Senator Vitter's amendment would allow the prevailing party in a \ncivil action to recover costs and attorney's fees. This means that the \ntaxpayers would bear the costs and attorney's fees of corporations sued \nby a State attorney general if the suit is unsuccessful. Absent \nevidence that State attorneys general are pursuing frivolous litigation \nagainst corporations, this amendment is not only unnecessary, but it \npresents a departure from our established legal system. The measure \nwould have a chilling effect on State attorneys general who would like \nto pursue possible violations of consumer product safety regulations \nbut may fear incurring the legal costs of doing so.\n  The purpose of the CPSC Reform Act is to ensure that American \nconsumers have access to the safest products. By allowing State \nattorneys general to bring enforcement actions against corporations \nthat violate consumer safety laws, States are able to pursue those who \nthreaten the safety of consumers, even when Federal regulators fail to \ndo so. However, Senator Vitter's amendment would tie the hands of State \nattorneys general by making them choose between enforcing the law and \npotentially burdening the taxpayers with corporations' legal fees or \ndoing nothing when faced with products that have the potential to harm \nconsumers.\n  I will oppose this amendment because it discourages enforcement of \nconsumer product safety measures.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana would permit parties sued by State attorneys general \nunder authority of this bill to recover attorneys' fees and costs if \nthey are successful. This amendment would undermine the purpose of \ngiving those State officers that authority. We want their help in \nprotecting the citizens of their States. To create the specter of a \nlarge cost to the taxpayer if a case is unsuccessful will only deter \naggressive enforcement action.\n  There are, of course, situations where litigants against the \ngovernment are given the chance to collect attorneys' fees if they \nprevail in a lawsuit. As both a State legislator in Wisconsin and a \nU.S. Senator I have supported legislation like the Equal Access to \nJustice Act, ``EAJA'', which gives this right to small businesses and \nindividuals of modest means. I have even introduced a bill in several \nprevious Congresses to amend EAJA to make it easier to collect \nattorneys' fees.\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\n  That EAJA statute, however, applies to a limited class of individuals \nand small businesses. Whether or not we should extend EAJA to apply in \nthose cases where State attorneys general are acting on behalf of the \nFederal Government, we certainly should not impose a broader rule on \nthe Attorneys General than we currently apply to Federal agencies. For \nthese reasons, I oppose the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since I have \nyielded back my time, to have 30 additional seconds to clarify my \npoint, and then I will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I have one very quick point of \nclarification. My amendment does not mandate that the loser pays in \nevery case. That would be a significant departure from tradition in \nAmerican law. My amendment does not do that. My amendment gives the \njudge discretion to decide if the loser pays, only in both directions, \nnot just in favor of the direction of the attorney general, as the \nunderlying bill does. That is a very simple clarification. It is not a \nmandatory ``loser pays'' rule.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Reserving the right to object--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I yield back the remainder of my time. I move to table the \nVitter amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have gone through a lot of activity and \na lot of anguish on the floor concerning the immigration bills. There \nwas a comprehensive immigration bill that did not work. It was \nsomething some people thought would be a good idea and, frankly, I \nopposed it.\n  But there is something that is happening right now that is a very \ngood idea. There are 15 of us in the Senate who have taken different \nelements of concern having to do with illegal immigration, areas of \nspecialty, if you will. It happens that 15 of us had a news conference \nyesterday, wherein we talked about approaching this differently--each \none having his or her own legislation, and then you can support other \nlegislation as you see fit.\n  It happens that there will be 15 bills that will be introduced. I \nwill have one of those, and I will be supporting 14 of the other 15, or \n13 of the other 14. So I think the way we are approaching this is good.\n  My area of specialty, that comes as no surprise, is in making English \nthe national language. We have been talking about this for a long time. \nThe approach we are talking about is a very simple approach. It is \nsomething that is popular.\n  I have had this on the floor of the Senate twice. In 2006, it was \namendment No. 4064. It passed the Senate by a vote of 62 to 35. Again, \nin 2007, the support was even greater. That was amendment No. 1151. It \npassed--that was last year--by a vote of 64 to 33. So it is something \nthat clearly is popular.\n  Let me explain the problem we have. One of the last things that was \ndone in the Clinton administration was Executive Order 13166. This was \nan effort to make anyone who is receiving any kind of Government \nservices to have the documentation in any language of his or her \nchoice. It could be Swahili, it could be French, it could be any other \nlanguage.\n  Now, the effort to make English the national language is not purely \nsymbolic, as some of my colleagues might believe; rather, it will have \na tangible impact.\n  After Executive Order No. 13166, there has been a high burden on \nGovernment agencies to provide translations for documents for services \nin virtually every language.\n  The cost is tremendous. It is quite a range. The U.S. Office of \nManagement and Budget estimated the cost of providing these services to \nbe between $1 and $2 billion each year.\n  The cost is not the only drawback of the entitlements of Executive \nOrder No. 13166. It ultimately enables immigrants to avoid learning \nEnglish which, regretfully, hurts their chances of effective \nassimilation into American culture. Historically, one of America's \ngreatest attributes is the unity provided by having a language that is \ncommonly used throughout the country. It is important for new legal \nimmigrants to learn this language so they might communicate and achieve \nsuccess.\n  As President Bush said in one of his messages, learning English \n``allows newcomers to go from picking crops to opening a grocery \n[store] . . . from cleaning offices to running offices . . . from a \nlife of low-paying jobs to a diploma, a career, and a home of their \nown.''\n  I can't think of any issue we have had before the Senate during the \ntime I have been here that is more popular than this. A 2006 Zogby poll \nfound that 84 percent of Americans, including 71 percent of Hispanics, \nbelieve English should be the national language of government \noperations. According to a 2002 Kaiser Foundation survey, 91 percent of \nforeign-born Latino immigrants agreed that learning English is \nessential to success. We have polling data going all the way back to \n1996. In each case, 84 to 90 percent of the American people want this \nto take place.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these polls be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\n                    National English Amendment Polls\n\n       All types of pollsters of all groups, liberal and \n     conservative, immigrant and non-immigrant, with all wordings \n     show consistently high levels of support for making English \n     the official language of the United States:\n       (1) An April 2007 McLaughlin & Associates poll showed 80% \n     of all Americans indicated that they would support a proposal \n     to make English the official language.\n       (2) A December 2006 Zogby International poll showed that \n     92% of Americans believe that preserving English as our \n     language is vital to maintaining our unity.\n       (3) A June 2006 Rasmussen Reports poll showed that making \n     English the nation's official language is favored by 85% of \n     Americans; this figure includes 92% of Republicans, 79% of \n     Democrats, and 86% of those not affiliated with either major \n     political party.\n       (4) A March 2006 Zogby International Poll showed 84% of \n     likely voters support making English the official language of \n     government operations with common-sense exceptions.\n       (5) A 2004 Zogby poll showed 92% of Republicans, 76% of \n     Democrats and 76% of Independents favor making English the \n     official language.\n       (6) In 2000, Public Opinion Strategies showed 84% favored \n     English as the official language with only 12% opposed and 4% \n     not sure.\n       (7) A 1996 national survey by Luntz Research asked, ``Do \n     you think English should be made the Official Language of the \n     United States?'' 86% of Americans supported making English \n     the official language with only 12% opposed and 2% not sure.\n       Latino immigrants support the concept of Official English:\n       (1) An April 2007 McLaughlin & Associates poll showed that \n     80% of all Americans, including 62% of Latinos, would support \n     a proposal to make English the official language.\n       (2) A March 2006 Zogby poll found that 84% of Americans, \n     including 71% of Hispanics, believe English should be the \n     official language of government operations.\n       (3) My favorite poll is this one: In 2004 the National \n     Council of LaRaza found that 97% strongly (86.4%) or somewhat \n     (10.9%) agreed that ``The ability to speak English is \n     important to succeed in this country.''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. People need to understand the significance. When I \nbrought this up before, there were three objections. They were really \nabsurd. It is almost laughable. One was, we will have to change all the \nState flags because some of them have other languages.\n  This has nothing to do with that. This merely says it is not an \nentitlement. It has nothing to do with State flags.\n  Another Member said: Inhofe, you will not be able to speak Spanish on \nthe Senate floor. I have given several speeches in Spanish on the \nSenate floor. I will not go into why that is good. It has been very \nhelpful. This has nothing to do with that.\n  Another said: You will have the blood of Hispanics on your hands.\n  I said: How is that going to happen?\n  They said: There are some strong currents down there in the Potomac, \nand we would not have ``no swimming'' signs in Spanish, so they \nwouldn't be able to read those. So they will go in there and drown.\n  If we look back historically, we see that many Presidents had things \nto say about this matter, dating all the way back to Theodore \nRoosevelt, and as recently as a statement by Hillary Clinton in her \ncampaign in Iowa in 2007, less than a year ago, where she said: \n``You're going to have to learn English.''\n  This one goes back to 1916:\n\n       Let us say to the immigrant not that we hope [they] will \n     learn English, but that [they have] to learn English.\n\n  Theodore Roosevelt was clear on this.\n  Bill Clinton said in 1999 in his State of the Union message:\n\n       We have a responsibility to make [our new immigrants] \n     welcome here, and they have the responsibility to enter the \n     mainstream of American life. That means learning English and \n     learning about our democratic system of government.\n\n  So everyone is in agreement. I don't know of anyone, nor any past \nPresident, who doesn't believe we are doing a great disservice by not \nhelping our immigrants learn the English language.\n  We will continue to promote this bill until it passes into law. It \nshould be one of the easiest of the 15 bills that are going to approach \nthe problem of illegal immigrants. It is my intention to continue.\n  One of the interesting things about this is, there are 52 countries \nthroughout the world who have English as their national language, \nincluding Ghana in West Africa. All of these countries have it except \nus.\n  The bill is very simple. I can tell in one sentence what it does:\n\n       Unless specifically provided by statute, no person has a \n     right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of the \n     United States or any of its officials or representatives act, \n     communicate, perform or provide services, or provide \n     materials in any language other than English.\n\n  This is the law of some 52 countries around the world, almost \neverywhere except in the United States. It would save ultimately \nsomewhere between $1 and $2 billion. And there are the other logical \nreasons for doing this. We will be pursuing this as 1 of the 15 efforts \nto have not a comprehensive bill, but to address the problem of illegal \nimmigration. I look around and I see others who have good programs too.\n  The Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, has one that would utilize \nelectronic evidence for employers so employers don't find themselves \nbreaking the law as would have been the case on the previous bill. \nThere are others wanting to finish the bridge. We will have 15 bills \nthat we will be introducing or we have already introduced. If we can \nget all 15, that would pretty much resolve the problem. But it does \nafford the opportunity for any Member of this body to object to any \narea of interest in terms of these 15 bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to follow the \ncomments made by the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma concerning a \ngroup of Senators who met yesterday with a variety of proposals on \nimmigration reform. One of those proposals was mine, S. 2720. This bill \nseeks to deal with a very serious public safety problem where illegal \naliens who have been convicted of crimes of violence are permitted to \nwalk free on the streets of America where their native country will not \naccept them for deportation.\n  This is the factual situation where the matter arises. A person is \ncharged, for example, with aggravated robbery, serves 10 years in jail, \nis released from jail on the service of a maximum sentence, then is \nturned over to authorities from the immigration service for \ndeportation. Then the efforts to deport the individual are not \nsuccessful because his native country will not take him or her back. \nUnder court rulings, the maximum that person can be held in detention \nis 180 days. That means after the service of the sentence, after being \ndetained for 180 days, that person is then back on the streets of \nAmerica where the statistics show a very high degree of recidivism or \nrepeat offenses.\n  The legislation I am introducing would put pressure on native \ncountries to take back for deportation their citizens under \ncircumstances where they now refuse to do so by denying to those \ncountries visas for their people who want to come to visit the United \nStates.\n  There are currently some discretionary provisions on the books which, \nsimply stated, have not worked. This would mandate that procedure. That \nkind of pressure is calculated to at least ameliorate the situation.\n  The second provision of the bill provides that foreign aid would be \nconditioned on countries accepting back their native citizens under \nthe circumstances which I have just described. The United States has a \ntremendous foreign aid program where allocations are made for a variety \nof what we consider to be in our national interest or in humanitarian \ninterest. Here again we have a potentially effective tool for dealing \nwith countries who refuse to accept back their own citizens where they \nhave been ordered deported by the United States.\n\n  In analyzing the problem further, no matter what we do under these \ncircumstances, it is not possible to compel all foreign countries to \naccept their nationals back when they are subject to deportation. We \nare currently examining the possibilities of having some additional \ndetention. Candidly, it is difficult to structure consistent with \nconstitutional rights, which apply to these individuals, and consistent \nwith due process of law. There are some provisions, for example, when \nsomeone is\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\narrested on a charge to be held in preventative detention, where there \nis reason to believe that individual will flee. So the presumption of \ninnocence still applies, and detention can be held for a relatively \nbrief period of time.\n  We are also looking at some possible alternatives under sexual \npredators, where some legislation has been passed, where even after the \ncompletion of a full sentence there is a form of civil commitment. We \nare examining the ramifications of that kind of legislation to be sure \nit comports with due process and with constitutional protections.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4094 and 4097\n\n  While I have the floor, I will comment about the vote we just had on \nthe Vitter amendment and the vote we had yesterday on the Cornyn \namendment. Both amendments raise similar issues.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, would \nbar attorneys general from retaining outside counsel on a contingency \nfee basis. The amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. \nVitter, would impose costs on State attorneys general who lose cases \nbrought under the pending legislation. Both amendments have similar \nelements. I believe the underlying reason Senator Cornyn has advocated \nfor his amendment is not sufficient for such a broad legislative \nchange. Senator Cornyn's amendment arises from a case in Texas where \nthe attorney general went to Federal prison for corruption when hiring \na friend on a contingency fee basis. It may be that the Senator from \nTexas has a valid point. He served as the attorney general for the \nState of Texas and has considerable experience in the field.\n  I have had some experience as a prosecuting attorney myself with \nsimilar kinds of discretion. It is my view that before we undertake \nsuch a fundamental change in procedure, there ought to be some \nextensive consideration and deliberation.\n  The Senate is, by reputation, the world's greatest deliberative body. \nFor those who may inadvertently be watching on C-SPAN, a short \nstatement of the legislative process is in order. The way we function \non legislation is that a Member has an idea and puts it in a bill and \nfiles it. The bill is then referred to a committee. In this case, \nlegislation involving courts and attorneys would be referred to the \nJudiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee holds hearings and hears \nfrom witnesses who are experienced in the field: attorneys general, \ndefense lawyers, lawyers who have been retained by attorneys general, \njudges, and scholars. We listen at length, and we ask the witnesses \nquestions.\n  Unfortunately, you can't see all of those hearings live because they \nare preempted. However, maybe you can see it on rerun on C-SPAN 3. But \nthose are hearings which provide some basis for a judgment as to what \nshould be done in the Senate.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas was not referred to \ncommittee. I think it is a matter which ought to be considered and \nanalyzed. Under Senate procedure, any Senator may offer an amendment to \nthe bill which he or she chooses. There is a brief time for argument--\nit could not have been more than several hours yesterday. I was \ninvolved in other matters and could not come to the floor. Following \ndebate, a vote is called. The first time many of us in this body \nconsider the issue is when we are en route from our offices to the \nChamber to vote.\n  For those of you who watch C-SPAN2, you will notice that in the \ncourse of a 15-minute vote--which is extended by custom to 20 minutes, \nand sometimes beyond--most of the Senators do not arrive here until \nlate in the process. Those watching will notice a big huddle by each \ndesk. You may wonder, what is going on? Well, what is going on is that \nthe Senator walks in the Chamber and takes a look at a yellow or white \npad with a one-paragraph description of the bill or amendment.\n  There is some hasty discussion, sometimes by the proponent of the \nbill and sometimes by the opponent of the bill. There is hardly what \nyou call deliberation and not what you have when the legislative \nprocess is followed. When the legislative process is followed the bill \nis introduced. Following introduction, there are hearings on the bill \nand there is what we call a markup. For example, at the Judiciary \nCommittee markup, there have to be at least 10 of 19 members present in \norder to vote the bill out of committee. At the markup there is an \nopportunity for discussion, analysis, and even modification of the \nbill.\n  After consideration by the committee, the bill comes to the Senate \nfloor with a committee report. The committee report describes the bill. \nSenators have a chance to read the committee report or, to be more \ncandid, staff has a chance to read the committee report. It is not \nphysically possible to read all the committee reports and all the \nmaterials that come across a Senator's desk--it just cannot be done. \nBut at least you have a staffer who writes you a memorandum \nhighlighting the essential points and have a chance to question the \nstaffer. You then come to the floor on the debate with some notice \nabout what the debate is about.\n  It seems to me on matters of importance that we ought to go through \nfull Senate procedure. It is my view that Congress has to be very \ncareful in what we do by way of mandates to the States. We also need to \nbe careful when telling the States how to run their business and by \ntelling attorneys general what is best for their State. There are some \noffices of attorneys general in the United States which are not \nelaborately staffed.\n  When I was DA of Philadelphia, I had 170 attorneys. I don't know how \nmany attorneys general have limited staffs, nor do I understand their \nworkload or their backlog. There is no reason for me to get involved in \nthe business of state attorneys general. State attorneys general are \nelected by the people of their State or appointed under State \nconstitutional provisions. It is up to them to make a decision as to \nhow they run their offices. As a basic matter of federalism, we should \nleave it up to the state attorneys general. We ought to consider the \nmost serious problems of national import. We cannot get into the \ndetails of all the State attorneys general offices.\n  The Senator from Texas talks about creative ways for lawyers to \nstructure contingency fee agreements. Perhaps the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas would be improved if the attorney general had to go \nto court to get judicial approval to hire outside counsel on a \ncontingency fee basis. At this time, the attorney general would inform \nthe court of his office's resources and his reasons for needing to \nenter into a contingency fee contract. This would allow the matter to \nbe decided on a case-by-case basis.\n  Now, moving to the amendment by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. \nVitter. There is an effort to have the losing party pay for the costs \nof litigation and costs of reasonable attorneys' fees. It is designed--\nas the brief one paragraph said--to avoid frivolous lawsuits. I think \nit is a very good idea to avoid frivolous lawsuits.\n  The existing rules in Federal court provide for the handling of \nfrivolous lawsuits by imposing costs on the losing party. Following a \nmotion by the party who is being sued, the judge determines whether to \ndismiss the case under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  Senator Vitter wants to impose a blanket rule, where in every case, \nthe loser pays. It may be that the United States ought to go to the \nBritish system, which is a ``loser pays'' system. However, that would \nbe a very drastic change in our court procedure. It is even possible \nthat we ought to go to a ``loser pays'' system in the conditions \ncontemplated under the pending legislation. But that would be a very \nmaterial change if we were to make that sort of a shift at this time.\n  Again, we ought to be following the regular Senate procedures. Let \nSenator Vitter introduce the bill. Let it be referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee. There will be hearings and thorough analysis. Following \nhearings, there will be a markup and the bill will come to the floor \nwith a committee report. The appropriate deliberation would take place.\n  If Senator Vitter's amendment were to be adopted, perhaps it ought to \nbe modified on a discretionary basis. The court could impose costs on \nthe losing party if the judge determines that the case is frivolous.\n  You might have a meritorious case with a very close question. That is\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\nwhat we do in America with our differences of views between parties. \nDifferent sides are presented in court and a determination is made. \nThere is a necessity for a lot of room.\n  The Senate wisely defeated both of these amendments. On their \nsurface, there is a great deal to commend Senator Cornyn's amendment to \neliminate contingency fee arrangements. There is the situation where \nthe Texas State Attorney General went to jail for corruption. Of \ncourse, it is more than contingency fees in that case. People who read \nan abbreviated statement in the newspapers might think the Senate made \na mistake in rejecting the Cornyn amendment. We need to examine the \nissue closer.\n  Here again, on the surface, you might think the amendment by Senator \nVitter has merit to impose costs on the losing party. After all, if \nthey lost, why shouldn't they pay for it? But you have to go beyond \nthat and examine the issue further.\n  I am prepared to consider both amendments. I am prepared to consider \nthe ideas of my colleagues in the Senate. But I want to do that in the \ncourse of the legislative process, where we follow regular order: a \nbill is introduced, goes to committee, the committee has hearings, the \ncommittee hears witnesses, the committee sits down with a majority of \nits members, and the bill comes to the floor with a committee report.\n  I know the votes have already been cast on the amendments I have \nspoken about, but I thought it might be useful to take the floor and \ngive the public a fuller understanding of what we do in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the bill \nthat is pending on the floor. I am very pleased this bill is advancing, \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission bill, that involves so many \nimportant provisions.\n  But in my State, I will tell you this: We are very focused on the \nprovision dealing with the toxic toys. I can tell you, after being in \nthe Senate for only a year, it is truly an inspiration to see we were \nable to get a bill through our committee--thanks to the leadership of \nSenator Pryor and Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens--and get it to the \nfloor.\n  The reason it is so important in our State is we had a little boy who \ndied, a 4-year-old boy who swallowed a charm that was given to him with \na pair of tennis shoes. He did not die from choking on the charm. He \ndid not die from his airway being blocked. He died when the lead went \ninto his bloodstream day after day after day. When that charm was \ntested, it was 99 percent lead. It was from China. His own blood, when \nhe died, had three times the normal amount of lead.\n  It is a very sad story. But it is some solace to the people in our \nState that after only being here a year, and as a member of the \nCommerce Committee, I was able to work to make sure we have a Federal \nlead standard in this bill. It is rewarding, indeed, that it looks like \ntoday we may be completing our work.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I know you have seen this in Ohio. We \nhave seen toy after toy recalled in this country. In fact, 29 million \ntoys--look at this chart--were recalled in 2007 alone. Look at this: \nThis is a calendar of the various dates with the various toys that were \nrecalled in the year 2007 and into January and February of 2008.\n  We saw the Thomas the Trains that were recalled. We saw Dora the \nExplorer, we saw SpongeBob SquarePants being recalled--these toys that \nare so near and dear to people's hearts. You get a sense of it with the \ncalendar, but this list is an actual documentation of all the toys that \nhave been recalled in the last year and 3 months.\n  You have things such as necklaces, Rachael Rose Kidz rings. You have \nthe trains, the Cub Scout badges, ugly teeth that you put in your mouth \nfor Halloween, of course, the Aqua Dots that morphed into the date rape \ndrug. You can go on and on and on.\n  I think it is stunning at this time in our history we would still \nhave something such as this happening. I think many people thought in \nthe 1970s--when we got our act together in this country about consumer \nprotection and we strengthened the laws and we realized kids were dying \nfrom problems, with everything from cribs to dangerous toys, to \nflammable pajamas--this country got its act together.\n  Well, look what happened instead. We have seen a record number of \nimports coming in from other countries that do not have the safety \nstandards we do.\n  This was brought home to us--and it was more than toy recalls and \nnumbers--when a few days ago Senator Pryor and I met with the families \nof two children who almost died from toxic toys.\n  The first is Jacob--or Jack, as his family knows him. His mother \nShelby came from Arkansas to the Capitol. She told her story in a way I \nwill never do justice to--a very touching story--where she talked about \nthe fear she had on this day. It was a normal day. Any parent can \nimagine this. You start out. You are in the kitchen. It was October 30, \n2007. Jack was 20 months old at the time.\n  What happened was, his older sister had these Aqua Dots that you put \nin water and they transform into an animal or something like that. He \nswallowed some of them. All of a sudden, this little boy was standing \nthere, throwing up and stumbling around. She immediately took him to \nArkansas Children's Hospital, where he was treated by a doctor, Dr. \nJaeger.\n  Suddenly, this little boy, Jacob--Jack--went into a coma. They had no \nidea what caused it. Kids swallow things, as we know, all the time. \nThey will swallow a penny. They will swallow something. It is not a \ngood thing, but they do not immediately go into a coma. He was in a \ncoma for about 6 hours. They thought they were going to lose him \nbecause no one could figure out what happened.\n  Well, she said, just like this, he came out of the coma and he was \nfine. The doctor was in shock. The doctor said if he had not been \nthere, he would not have even believed it had happened.\n  So they got him home. No one figured out what happened. She got on \nthe Web site herself--the mom did--trying to figure out what was in \nAqua Dots. She called the company. Everyone was trying to figure it \nout.\n  Finally, they did some testing in the next few days, and they found \nout the coating that was put on these particular Aqua Dots metabolized \ninto a chemical compound known as the date rape drug. As a former \nprosecutor, I can tell you we have handled cases involving date rape \ndrugs. This is not a little thing. These are used to knock people out \nfor hours so crimes can occur, and they take vulnerable victims and try \nto put them to sleep. That is what happened with these Aqua Dots.\n  These simple little toys--that are supposed to be pet pals--morphed \ninto a date rape drug right in this little boy's stomach. So she came \nand told us this story.\n  On November 7, Spin Master--the company that makes Aqua Dots--\nrecalled the product. The chemical that is in these little beads could \ncause children--they figured out--to become comatose, develop \nrespiratory depression or have seizures. Luckily, this little boy \nsurvived. This is what we were dealing with.\n\n  Then, another family came and talked to Senator Pryor and me. This is \nColton, also a little boy. He is a little older than Jacob. Their \nfamily lives in Oregon. The mom told us this story:\n  In 2003, when Colton was only 4 years old, he swallowed a little \ntrinket they had gotten out of a gumball machine. It was later \ndetermined--they couldn't figure out why he was so sick. He was having \ntrouble. He was not himself. They took him to the doctor. They figured \nout he swallowed this lead. They got the toy out of him, but they \nfigured out later that this toy was 39 percent lead. His lead levels--\nthis little boy, Colton--at the time were considered fatal, but he \nsurvived. This led, actually, to the recall of 150 million pieces of \ngumball machine jewelry.\n  Now, this is not that different from the story I told you about \nJarnell. This mom told me when we met earlier in the week that when she \nheard about Jarnell, it all came back to her. She spent the last 2 \nyears trying to be an advocate, all by herself--Colton's mom--to get \nsomething done on this, and then imagine how she felt when she read \nthat this little boy, Jarnell, in Indianapolis had died from exactly \nthe same kind of charm, these lead charms;\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nsomething like that went into his system. The one Jarnell had was 99 \npercent lead. Luckily for little Colton, the piece he had was only 39 \npercent lead. But now, even today, Colton's lead levels, even when he \nis much older, are at 17. They are not where they should be, and they \nare constantly on alert for what might go wrong. If he has a growth \nspurt or if he breaks his bones, his lead levels will increase, and \nthey don't know the effect that will have. We all know it is very \ndangerous, the brain damage in children and other things it does.\n  The other thing about these charms--and we are very focused on little \nkids swallowing them, but the other thing about them is that necklaces \ncan also affect teenage girls because they put these necklaces on, and \nthen they are sitting in class or they are with their friends, and they \nchew on them. I have seen little girls actually do this--teenage girls. \nThey are cheaper jewelry charms, and they start to chew on them. Well, \nin January 2007, 114,000 necklaces were recalled because the pendants \ncontained high levels of lead, these kinds of pendants that continue to \nbe recalled throughout this year.\n  Another example: In February of 2007, almost 300,000 Rachael Rose \nrings, which were worn by very young kids who wanted to try on a ring \nand have a ring on, were recalled.\n  In June of 2007, we had the Thomas & Friends, which was the first \nbatch of 1.5 million recalls. This story is one that is worth noting. \nThe Presiding Officer will be interested in this one.\n  These were toys that were manufactured and painted in China. The RC2 \nCompany, when they found out about it, called for a recall. They were \nvery embarrassed about the safety record. They appropriately apologized \nto their customers, saying they would make every effort to ensure this \nwouldn't happen again, and to help encourage customer loyalty and to \nprompt customers to return the trains, they actually said: You know \nwhat, we will give you a bonus gift. We are going to replace the toys, \nand we will send you a bonus gift if you send in your toys that have \nbeen recalled. So all of these parents sent in their recalled toys. As \nyou can imagine, they are trying to figure out which toy is recalled \nand which isn't. Is it the caboose or the boxcar? They end up sending \nit back to get this bonus gift. Guess what. This bonus gift backfired \nin a big way. It was discovered that 2,000 of these bonus gift items \ncontained lead paint levels 4 times higher than legally allowed, \nleaving the parents of these toddlers to deal with what we call the \ndouble recall.\n  Then, in August 2007, almost 1 million Sesame Street and Dora the \nExplorer toys were recalled by Fisher-Price. In October 2007, 1,600,000 \nCub Scout badges were recalled for extremely high lead levels. Just \nthis last Halloween, just a few days before Halloween, 43,000 Ugly \nTeeth toys were recalled that kids put in their mouths for Halloween.\n  This is just what I call the ``greatest hit list.'' There were over 9 \nmillion toys recalled by hundreds of different companies in 2007, with \na total of 27 million toys recalled.\n  Yet we have known about this danger for 30 years. That is what is so \nshocking about this. As we advance in this country with technology, \nwith BlackBerrys and cell phones, it is unbelievable that we would be \nstepping back. The science is clear. It is an undisputed fact that lead \npoisons children. It should not have taken us this long to take lead \nout of the hands of our children, out of their mouths.\n  It is the Consumer Product Safety Commission's job to do this. When \nthey started seeing all of these imports coming in, they should have \ndone something. They should have come to Congress and said: We think we \nsee a problem here. We are going to need more people. We are going to \nneed more toy inspectors. It was Congress that had to take the lead to \nget this moving. The burden should not fall on parents or kids to tell \nif a toy train is coated with lead paint. Who is going to be able to \nfigure that out? You figure that if you buy a toy from a reputable \nstore, it is going to be OK. I think it is shocking for most parents \nwhen they realize there has never been a mandatory ban on lead in kids' \ntoys in this country--never. Until this legislation, there has never \nbeen a mandatory ban.\n  In response to a series of letters I wrote to Chairwoman Nord in \nAugust about the dangers of lead in children's products, the Chairwoman \nresponded on September 11. In this letter, Chairwoman Nord acknowledged \nthat:\n\n       The CPSC does not have the authority to ban lead in all \n     children's products without considering exposures and risks \n     on a product-by-product basis.\n\n  Chairwoman Nord went on to say that were the CPSC--the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission--to attempt banning lead in all children's \nproducts:\n\n       It would likely take several years and millions of dollars \n     in staff and other resources.\n\n  This response makes it clear that Congress cannot wait for the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission to act. They have had years. They \nhave known this was increasing, these imports and what was going on for \nyears, and they didn't act. That is why we need this bill. According to \nthem, to give them the benefit of the doubt, they didn't have the tools \nor the resources to do their job. Now, it would have been nice if they \nhad come earlier than this year to act, but they didn't have the tools \non the books. So that is what this bill is about.\n  To talk a little bit more about the specifics, this legislation \neffectively bans lead in all children's products by classifying lead as \na banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substance Act. \nThis was a part of the bill that incorporates the bill we wrote out of \nour office. The reason I, of course, was so focused on this was because \nof the fact that this little boy died in our State.\n  The bill sets a ceiling for a trace level of allowable lead at .03 \npercent of the total weight of a part of children's products, or 300 \nparts per million. Some States across the country have put these in \nbecause of inaction by the Federal Government. Some are set at .04. \nCalifornia has .04 for toys and .02 for jewelry. We decided the best \nway to do this is to set it at .03 for the first year, a year after the \nbill takes effect, and then, actually within a few years, go down to \n.01 because the science supports that we should be able to get it down \nto .01 percent of the total weight of kids' toys for lead. The idea is \nthat, in fact, as some of the pediatrician groups believe, we can do \nthis and we can maybe go lower than that, to trace levels of lead, and \nwe allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission to do a rulemaking so \nthat if they would like, and the science supports it, they can actually \ngo down to zero or go lower if they would like. But these are trace \nlevels of lead that are actually more aggressive than you see in some \nof the States.\n  The legislation also sets an even lower threshold for paint. Under \nthis bill, the allowable level of lead paint would drop immediately to \n90 parts per million. This lower threshold is critical because science \nhas shown that as children put products in their mouths, it is the \npainted coatings which are the most easily accessible to kids. Every \nparent of a toddler knows this to be true. On these lead-tainted Thomas \ntrains, you can always see, on the ones I have seen that have been \nbrought into my office by parents who are worried, those little teeth \nmarks of kids who are chewing on these toys.\n  I will tell my colleagues that people say: Well, what is the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission doing now? They have a voluntary standard at \n.06. So the standard is higher. The key is that it is voluntary, so \nthey have to call and negotiate with the companies if they want to do a \nrecall. A lot of our retailers in Minnesota, including Target and Toys \n``R'' Us, have been very frustrated by this because they are \nnegotiating with the manufacturer, so it is not clear. They want to get \nthe products off their shelves, but they haven't been recalled yet. So \nthis makes it much simpler because it is a mandatory Federal lead \nstandard.\n  The other part of the bill that came out of a bill we drafted and \nwhich is very important to me--and I think it comes from being a mom, \nand it is practical--is making it easier when there is a recall to be \nable to identify the toys.\n  Now, when I talk to my friends, they say: What am I supposed to do? I \nhear about this recall. I go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nWeb site. I can't tell which caboose, which train. Is it the boxcars? \nIs it the caboose?\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\nWhich brunette Barbie? Which blond Barbie?\n  Big surprise: They don't keep the packaging. I don't think anyone but \nmy mother-in-law keeps packaging for toys, because she saves \neverything.\n  What our bill does is basically says the batch numbers, when \npractical, should be on the toys. They won't be on Pick-Up Sticks, \nobviously, but they can be on the foot of a Barbie or on the bottom of \nthese little toys which actually say on the bottom ``caboose'' or \n``boxcar,'' and there can be a batch number. So it will be easier for \nparents to identify which toy they can get out of their kid's box.\n  We also have put in this bill a requirement that the numbers be on \nthe actual packaging. Even though parents will throw the packaging \naway, we think that is important because the mom-and-pop retail stores, \nthe little retail stores, and also the Internet--people will still have \nthe packaging. So Target, Toys ``R'' Us, and Wal-Mart are going to be \nable to put into their computer system when a toy is recalled \nimmediately so you can't sell it through the line. That is not as easy \nfor smaller stores. It may not be as easy for a little drugstore or \ngrocery store and also certainly not easy for people buying on eBay or \nselling on eBay. So we also require that the batch numbers be on the \npackaging.\n  As we all know, the Consumer Product Safety Commission's last \nauthorization expired in 1992, and its statutes have not been updated \nsince 1990. That is why what Senator Pryor has done as the chair of the \nconsumer subcommittee--and I am proud to be a member of that \nsubcommittee and to have worked with him on this bill--is so \nsignificant.\n  You think about how the marketplace has changed in these 16 years and \nwhat we have seen in the growth for imports from countries that don't \nhave our same standards. Yet, at the same time, the Commission is a \nshadow of its former self. Although the number of imports has tripled--\ntripled--in recent years and the number of recalls, as I noted earlier, \nhas been increasing by the millions, the number of Commission staff and \ninspectors at the Consumer Product Safety Commission has dropped by \nmore than half, falling from a high in 1980--as my colleagues can see \nright here--falling from a high of 978 to 393 today. Look at that \nchange. Maybe that wouldn't have mattered if we suddenly had fewer toys \nin this country, maybe if we had a third of the imports coming in. In \nfact, we have seen a tripling of imports from countries that do not \nhave the same safety standards as we do. In total, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission has only about 100 field investigators and compliance \npersonnel nationwide.\n  What this legislation does--and we already started, actually, back in \nDecember, where we gave the Consumer Product Safety Commission, through \nour omnibus budget bill, some funds to hire more inspectors--this \nlegislation more than doubles the Consumer Product Safety Commission's \nbudget so that they can get those toy inspectors on board.\n  This bill provides some needed help to increase the inspection, the \nresearch, and regulation staff. It puts 50 more staff at U.S. ports of \nentry in the next 2 years. Some were announced just yesterday as a \nresult of the work of this Congress.\n  Not only does this bill give the necessary funding and staff to the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, but it gives the Commission the \nability to enforce violations of consumer product safety laws. This \nbill finally makes it criminal--criminal--to sell recalled products.\n  We have seen too many headlines this year to sit around and think \nthis problem is going to solve itself. As a Senator, I feel strongly \nthat it is important to take this step to protect the safety of our \nchildren. When I think about that little 4-year-old boy's parents back \nin Minnesota and I think about the children all over this country who \nhave been hurt and the parents who have lost sleep just trying to \nfigure out if what they are doing is right or what are they going to \nbuy their kids for Christmas or what are they going to do about this \nproblem--they shouldn't be thinking about those things in this day and \nage. We can beef up this agency that has been languishing for years. We \ncan put the rules in place and make it easier for them to do their \njobs.\n  So this isn't just a matter of banning lead in children's toys. This \nbill is a matter of implementing consumer safety laws and regulations. \nIt is a matter of protecting kids from more harmful products. It is a \nmatter of helping parents to understand what to do when something has \nbeen recalled. It is a matter of keeping customers informed and safe \nwhen purchasing products in the United States. And it is a matter of \nbringing the CPSC back into the 21st century. As I said, all of the \ntoys were overseen by a guy named Bob, with a back office full of toys. \nHe would be dropping them to see what happened and what didn't. He is \nretired now.\n  We are moving into the next century. This is a matter of getting \nserious about consumer safety. We have to say Congress cares about the \nfamilies in this country. People get mad about the Congress because it \ntakes so long to get things done. This is a bread-and-butter bill, \nabout helping families.\n  With the bipartisan help of our Senate colleagues, we can pass this \nmeaningful bill that gives the CPSC the tools they need to do their \njob, and it also sets clear and unequivocal standards of what is safe \nand what is not in this country.\n  The current system has been broken by years of neglect, by an agency \nthat hasn't told the truth about its problems, and by an administration \nthat has closed its eyes to what has been going on. This Congress can \nfix this. The Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act represents \nsome of the most sweeping reforms we have seen in 16 years for consumer \nsafety.\n  The Wall Street Journal said:\n\n       The Consumer Product Safety Act is the most significant \n     consumer safety legislation in a generation.\n\n  We can pass this legislation today, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The PATH Act\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, about an hour ago, I was presenting a \nbill that we had introduced as part of 15 bills to resolve the illegal \nimmigration problem. It is one that I have done many times before, \nwhich is making English the official language, or national language, \nfor the United States. I think it is one that has enjoyed a great deal \nof popularity. It has passed this body before by almost a 2-to-1 \nmargin, in 2006 and in 2007.\n  At the conclusion of my presentation on this legislation, I neglected \nto ask that a copy of the bill, S. 2715, be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks. I will soon ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  Madam President, I am joined by several colleagues, including \nSenators Cochran, Wicker, Domenici, Shelby, and others, in introducing \nthe Preserving Access to Hospice Act, a bill to ensure that America's \nterminally ill seniors have access to hospice care by providing \nimmediate relief for hospices that are impacted by the Medicare hospice \ncap, through the establishment of a moratorium on the calculation and \ncollection of the hospice cap for fiscal 2006, 2007, and 2008, and the \nauthorization of a MedPAC study on the cap issue.\n  My fellow Oklahoman in the House of Representatives, John Sullivan, \ntoday introduced the same companion bill on the House side.\n  Because of a flawed law, the Federal Government is requiring hospices \nto repay the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, for \nserving eligible patients in prior years. Many small family and \ncommunity-owned hospices will be forced to close, patients will lose \naccess to hospice care, and local jobs will be lost. In Oklahoma \nespecially, hospice care companies of all sizes service a large number \nof Oklahomans.\n  In 1982, Congress initiated hospice as a Medicare benefit for \nterminally ill patients. In the 1980s and 1990s, Congress worked to \nbroaden hospice coverage to ensure each eligible beneficiary has access \nto unlimited days of hospice care, regardless of their diagnosis.\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\n  Medicare pays hospice a flat fee per patient per day regardless of \nthe actual cost. The hospice is then responsible for all costs related \nto the care of its patient until their death, regardless of how long \nthey remain under their care. However, under the hospice Medicare \nbenefit, Medicare caps the number of days they will pay per patient. \nHospices cannot manage this cap without rationing access of care to \nthese terminally ill patients who elect the hospice benefit for however \nlong they remain eligible.\n  I have to say at this time that some of the best spent money in this \ntype of care is the hospices.\n  At the end of the care, CMS has been recalculating how much they have \npaid the hospice per patient and what the eligible cap days were for \neach patient. This is something done after the patient has already \nreceived care. If they paid the hospice more than was allowed under the \ncap, the hospice is required to repay Medicare. Therefore, hospices are \nbeing contacted by CMS and asked to repay millions of dollars used to \ncare for these dying patients. In 1999, very few hospices were hitting \nthe cap because Medicare had strict restrictions on who was eligible \nfor the benefits. As the eligibility and longevity has increased, \nhospices started to go over the cap.\n  In 2005, 41 percent of the hospices providing care in my State of \nOklahoma received letters from CMS demanding repayment. Obviously, the \nrecalculation is unfair and will result in patients being denied \nhospice care, and many Oklahoma hospices are going bankrupt. As \nCongress and CMS examine this issue, temporary relief is needed so that \nthe patients can continue to have access to hospice care and hospice \nproviders do not face bankruptcy. My legislation provides immediate \nrelief for impacted hospices by establishing a moratorium on the \ncalculation and collection of the hospice cap for fiscal years 2006, \n2007, and 2008, and authorizing a MedPAC study to determine the best \nway to address this hospice cap issue.\n  I have been working since early 2007 to help small community hospices \nin Oklahoma as they face repayment letters from CMS for millions of \ndollars. Without a moratorium, these Oklahoma hospices, as well as \nhospices in numerous other States, will be unable to meet demands for \nrepayment.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Oral Health\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, around this time last year, we heard the \nnews story of Deamonte Driver. He was a 12-year-old living in Prince \nGeorge's County, MD, a short driving distance from this building.\n  Deamonte had a toothache. His family was poor and they didn't have \nhealth insurance. They could not afford to pay out of pocket for dental \ncare. Although in the past they had Medicaid coverage, it was nearly \nimpossible, as it is in most places--Missouri, Ohio, Arkansas, and most \nplaces--to find a dentist who took Medicaid patients. The infection \nfrom Deamonte's tooth spread to his brain. His family took him to the \nhospital, only to find out that his Medicaid coverage had lapsed \nbecause the paperwork to confirm eligibility was mailed to a homeless \nshelter where the family had spent some time. Deamonte died after \nsurgery, after 2 weeks in the hospital and $200,000 in medical bills.\n  Deamonte's death was tragic and needless and that is unconscionable. \nFamilies across the country were shocked by this story.\n  This story illustrates what is wrong with our health care system. \nSeveral years ago in Cleveland, an 11-year-old girl was missing. She \nhad disappeared for some time. When they discovered her body, they \ncould not check her dental records because she had never been to a \ndentist. It took some time to identify who she was.\n  The story of the girl in Cleveland and the story of Deamonte in \nPrince George's County, MD, illustrates what is wrong with our health \ncare system. It also provides a map for how we can make it better.\n  This week, with a Congressman from Maryland, I am introducing the \nDeamonte Driver Dental Care Access Improvement Act. The goal of the \nbill is simple: to increase access to dental care for the underserved \nin our country and to tackle access problems for dental care from \nmultiple angles.\n  This bill strengthens our system of care by providing grants to \ncommunity health centers--they give terrific care in communities that \nare underserved all over the country--so they can expand the dental \nservices they provide--not all of them do at this point--including \nmobile dentistry and teledentistry services.\n  The bill also provides grants to create dental health professionals \nwhose mission is to work with communities to provide care for the \nunderserved. People who are not dentists get some training, significant \ntraining, so they can help dentists and dental hygienists do their job.\n  To create incentives for dentists, the bill provides tax credits to \ndentists who serve Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nand uninsured populations.\n  The bill invests also in prevention. Half of the battle will be to \nincrease dental health promotion activities among families.\n  Other provisions address maternal health and Medicaid reimbursement.\n  In Ohio, dental care is the No. 1 unmet health care need among \nchildren, unequivocally. In the last year, as I have traveled around \nthe State, I held 85 roundtables where I sat down with 20 or 25 people \nfrom the community and asked them questions about their community and \nwhat we can do together in this community with the Senate office. I \nhave done it in about 55\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\ncounties. I hear stories about how families are struggling with dental \nproblems. A lot of these stories are similar to that of Deamonte \nDriver.\n  Recently, I learned about the story of Tyler Panko, a 5-year-old with \nautism who lives in rural Ohio. His father is self-employed. He took \nTyler to four dentists to try to get care for his son who suffered from \ndebilitating tooth decay and poor weight gain. No dentist within a 100-\nmile radius would accept Tyler as a patient due to his medical \ncondition and Medicaid coverage.\n  Tyler was ultimately referred to the Ohio State College of Dentistry \nwhere he was treated under general anesthesia due to the severity of \nhis disease.\n  Tyler's parents were so distraught about their son's well-being that \nthey wanted to stay in Columbus the night before the surgery so as to \nnot miss the appointment. They live in a trailer in rural Ohio. They \ncould not afford both transportation and lodging, so the pediatric \ndentistry faculty at OSU College of Dentistry covered the family's \nlodging costs.\n  Since then, Tyler has been eating, gaining weight, and no longer \nwakes up crying, holding his mouth. Imagine that. The parents of a \nchild cannot do anything for their child, and the child wakes up crying \nat night holding his mouth.\n  Tyler's story ended well. But how many other children and adults in \nmy State and around the country are suffering from lack of dental care.\n  Yet it is typically overlooked when policymakers turn to the issue of \nhealth care access. People often think of health care in terms of the \nphysical body from the neck down, and they overlook the importance of \ndental health.\n  It is almost as if including dental health in the health care debate \nis a luxury or an afterthought, a minor concern that doesn't merit our \ntime. It is a foolish, and sometimes even deadly, misperception.\n  Addressing dental care also helps our workforce.\n  It is not obvious to most of us in most of our lives most of the \ntime, but dental health is an indicator of socioeconomic status in our \nsociety. Those with beautiful teeth, those who have had the luxury of \nbraces, those who have gone to regular dental appointments because \ntheir families can afford it or their families have dental insurance \ncan have the confidence of smiling at a potential employer at a job \ninterview.\n  For people with missing teeth, many of them at amazingly young ages, \nor crooked teeth or other problems related to the lack of access to \ndental care, their economic struggle shows, and it causes them to be \ntreated differently from those who can go to the dentist regularly.\n  Again, think about a job interview: You are 24 years old; you are \nlooking for a job; you have bad teeth; you know how that makes \neverything much harder.\n  People with painful dental problems are also more likely to miss \nschool and later on miss work. We need to remove barriers to care for \nevery American. We need to address the entrenched racial and economic \ndisparities that exist in dental health. I want to keep families from \nrelying on emergency rooms for dental care. There is simply no reason \nfor that to happen. I want people to know how to prevent cavities and \ngum disease. I want to find ways to encourage dentists to accept \nMedicaid and CHIP and uninsured people. I don't want anyone to be held \nback from their ambitions because of their dental problems.\n  I hope my colleagues will help me in reaching these goals by \nsupporting this bill. I thank the senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. \nCochran, for his cosponsorship of this bill. It is bipartisan. It is \nlegislation whose time has come. It is legislation for those whom we \npretty often ignore in this Chamber.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I wish to give my colleagues a sense of \nwhere we are on the bill. Generally, we have good news. I mentioned an \nhour or so ago, maybe 2 hours ago, the fact that Senator Stevens and \nhis staff and my staff have worked through a series of amendments. \nThere are 12 or more amendments in a managers' package. There is \nlanguage that is being worked on now to maybe add more to the managers' \npackage. Various Senators on both sides of the aisle have had \nconstructive amendments, and all amendments have been germane. That is \ngreat news. We thank all Senators and their staffs for keeping every \nsingle amendment germane. That is very constructive and very positive.\n  At the moment, we are waiting on some language on some amendments \nthat maybe can be agreed to further without rollcall votes. We would \nlove to set up some rollcall votes at some point in the next few hours.\n  As I said earlier, I do not want to say this and regret it, but the \nway things are going, certainly this has the feel that we could \npossibly finish this bill this afternoon rather than this evening. If \nwe have to work into the night or even into tomorrow, we will do that. \nGiven the cooperative spirit and the nature of the amendments and the \ncollegiality of Senators on this legislation, I think we can definitely \nfinish today. As I said, I know a lot of Senators who would love to be \nable to wrap this up and get out of here earlier than they expected. \nThat would be great news if we could pull that off. We are working very \nhard for that result.\n  Again, I thank the staff of all the Senators who have been working on \nthese amendments with us. I thank the Senators because it has been a \nvery productive week and a very constructive process.\n  I wish to talk about one of the issues that is outstanding. We may \nhave a vote on it later today. We don't know yet. It is a whistleblower \nprovision. I wish to inform my colleagues of the goal we had of writing \ninto the bill whistleblower protection. We want to make sure that when \npeople come across a safety violation and they tell the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission about it, they not be punished for doing the \nright thing.\n  We tried to find a balance in this issue. This provision has changed \nquite a bit throughout the course of the life of this bill. We have to \nremember there is a compelling Government interest in the public's \nsafety and welfare. So we are trying to find that balance. We are \ncertainly trying to protect the public's safety and welfare. We want to \nkeep these dangerous products out of the stream of commerce, but at the \nsame time, we have heard the concerns and the objections mostly by the \nbusiness community.\n  Let me say this about whistleblower protection: I know this has been \na source of much debate and many votes in the Senate over the last \nseveral Congresses. I remind my colleagues that whistleblower \nprotection is not a novel idea. This is not a new concept. We actually \nsee whistleblower protection in many Federal laws this Congress has \npassed.\n\n  Since the year 2000, Congress has passed several whistleblower laws \nthat have been very similar to what we have drafted in S. 2663, \nincluding Air 21, for airline workers; Sarbanes-Oxley, for employees of \npublicly traded corporations; the Pipeline Safety Act, for oil pipeline \nemployees; the Energy Policy Act, for nuclear workers; the Implementing \nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act, for railroad and public \ntransportation workers; and even as recently as this year in the \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  We have drafted our provision based on existing law. The Surface \nTransportation Assistance Act is the model we use to try to extend \nwhistleblower protection under narrow circumstances in this act.\n  I will give a few examples. I will limit it to two real-life \nexamples. In 2002, a product designer for a lighting manufacturer was \nfired after he informed management about the dangerous conditions of \ncertain lighting products, and he refused to violate the law by passing \nthe products on to the customers before they were thoroughly tested. \nThat person did not have any recourse when he was terminated by his \ncompany.\n  We understand, we are very sensitive to a company's desire to have \nemployees who can follow instructions and can be productive, but at the \nsame\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\ntime, there is a compelling public interest in the fact that we are \ntalking about the safety of our citizens in this country.\n  Another example from 1995: An employee of a wire and cable company \nreported there was a shipment of defective wire. He reported that to a \ncustomer because he was concerned the wire would be used in fire alarms \nin hotels, residences, and high-rise buildings. The employee refused \nthe company's directive to ignore the problems with that wire, and he \nwas fired.\n  Not to get into the details of that case, but we see that \nwhistleblower protection, if we build in the right parameters, might \nmake sense. What we did through this process is we tried to listen to \nthe business community's concern. There has been a myth floating out \nthere that if this law passes, then a business will never be able to \nfire a disruptive employee. That is not true. Certainly, we are trying \nto find that balance. Whistleblower protections would not protect an \nemployee who is going to be fired anyway. It would not protect a \ndisruptive employee who is not a good employee. The employee has the \nburden of proof of establishing a prima facie showing. They have to \nmake a prima facie case that they were terminated because they had told \nthe CPSC about a problem. The employer has an affirmative defense of \nshowing they would have done the same thing with this employee \nregardless of the fact that he or she informed the CPSC of a violation.\n  Also, there is a provision in the bill that if the employee files a \nfrivolous claim and tries to hide behind this whistleblower protection, \nthat employee may have to pay up to a $1,000 penalty throughout the \ncourse of the whistleblower process.\n  We have tried to listen to the concerns of the business community. We \nare trying to get the proper information to the CPSC to make sure that \nif there is a problem out there, it is brought to their attention as \nearly as possible. And if an employee wants to do the right thing, with \nthese safeguards built in place, he or she will not be terminated \nbecause they are trying to make sure these products are safe in the \nU.S. marketplace.\n  Senator Stevens has walked into the Chamber. So far the news today \nhas been good. We are disposing of matters. We encourage any Senator \nwho wants to come down and speak on their amendment or any Senator who \nwants a vote to please let us know. So far it has been a very \nconstructive process. I thank all my colleagues for their spirit of \ncooperation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4132\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 4132 and to set it aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Hearing no objection, the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Brown], for himself and Mr. \n     Casey, proposes an amendment numbered 4132.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the temporary refusal of admission into the \n      customs territory of the United States of consumer products \n manufactured by companies that have violated consumer product safety \n                                 rules)\n\n       On page 103, after line 12, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 40.

Mr. President, as I address the Senate for the first time \ntoday, I could not be prouder of the people I represent. From the \nnortheast Mississippi hills and De Soto County suburbs, down through \nthe Delta, and from metro Jackson, across to east central Mississippi, \nand down through the Piney Woods, from southwest Mississippi to the \nGulf of Mexico, my native State of Mississippi is on the move, having \nadded over 50,000 jobs in the past 4 years. But we are also in the \nprocess of recovering from the most devastating natural disaster ever \nto hit North America--Hurricane Katrina. With its nearly 30-foot storm \nsurge, its winds of over 125 miles per hour, and an eye that stretched \nthe entire coastline of Mississippi, Hurricane Katrina reshaped not \njust the landscape of our Gulf Coast; Katrina reshaped how our public \nofficials must approach every quality of life issue in our State, be it \nhousing, insurance, economic development, education, health care, or \npublic safety.\n  While there are a number of issues, accomplishments and challenges \nfacing my constituents, today I will speak about the most pressing \nissue facing my State, the rebuilding and renewal of the Mississippi \nGulf Coast and the ongoing need for this Congress to follow through \nuntil recovery is indeed a reality.\n  Steady progress has been made, but great challenges remain that \ncannot be overcome without a partnership from the Federal Government. \nContinued Federal resources are needed before our State can truly \nrecover.\n  For most citizens on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina is not just \none issue; it is virtually every issue.\n  Every Mississippian remembers what they were doing on August 29, \n2005. My wife, Gayle, and I were at home in Tupelo, in the path of a \nstorm that would cause damage 300 miles inland and in the path of \nthousands of Mississippians and Louisianans fleeing Katrina. Like \ncitizens across the country, we joined our community in opening arenas \nand churches, preparing Red Cross shelters and organizing gifts of \nclothing and supplies. Our family and friends were among the foot \nsoldiers in the army of compassion that responded to the devastation in \nsouth Mississippi.\n  Days after Katrina's landfall, Gayle and I had the opportunity to \ndeliver an 18-wheeler full of supplies to Jackson County. What we saw \nwas indescribable to those who had seen the coverage only on \ntelevision. Tens of thousands of homes obliterated. Businesses and \nschools destroyed with no trace of previous existence. Bridges wiped \naway, cutting cities off from one another. And an eerie silence because \nof the lack of electricity for hundreds of miles.\n  The Federal Government's response to this disaster has come under an \nimmense amount of criticism, much of which is justified. But it would \nbe irresponsible for us to ignore what went right.\n  The night of the storm, Coast Guard helicopter crews saved hundreds \nof my fellow Mississippians.\n  Katrina generated twice as much debris as any hurricane in history, \nbut it was picked up in half the time.\n  Our school superintendents, principals, teachers, and parents led the \neffort to get every one of Mississippi's public schools open as quickly \nas possible.\n  Our business community responded, reopening shops, restaurants, and \nmanufacturing plants so our people could get back to work.\n  And our citizen volunteers and the faith community shined. Mr. \nPresident, 500,000 volunteers have offered help to Mississippi since \nKatrina, and that number continues to climb.\n  Over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, a lot of progress has been made. South \nMississippi is not just recovering; south Mississippi is on its way to \nbuilding back from the worst natural disaster in American history \nbigger and better than ever before.\n  As a Member of the other body, I was glad to be a part of the team \nthat worked to produce much needed appropriations and economic \ndevelopment incentives for our State and others impacted by Hurricane \nKatrina. Our governor, Haley Barbour, our senior Senator, Thad Cochran, \nmy predecessor in this body, Senator Trent Lott, and our entire \ncongressional delegation--Republican and Democrat--were a part of this \neffort. Katrina was not a partisan storm and in Mississippi, we are \nworking in a bipartisan way to rebuild our communities.\n  On behalf of a grateful State, I thank the Senate for its support of \nour rebuilding efforts. In return, Senators--and the taxpayers--deserve \na report on our progress.\n  Housing is still being rebuilt, as evidenced by the shrinking number \nof families in FEMA-provided temporary housing.\n  The CDC recently announced that those still living in FEMA trailers \ncould be exposed to formaldehyde levels 40 times the normal level. This \nnews only serves to underscore the fact that while FEMA trailers were \nnecessary immediately following the storm, we must redouble our efforts \nto move the remaining citizens from them.\n  The State of Mississippi is deploying ``Mississippi cottages,'' which \nare real homes built to HUD standards that are free of formaldehyde \ncontamination.\n  It is imperative that FEMA work with the State of Mississippi to \npurchase and deploy Mississippi cottages for all individuals along the \ngulf coast who live in FEMA trailers.\n  We are also rebuilding our infrastructure. The bridges connecting Bay \nSt. Louis to Pass Christian, and Biloxi to Ocean Springs have been \nrebuilt, literally and spiritually reconnecting communities to one \nanother.\n  The GO Zone economic development incentives have been an essential \nboost to our job creation initiatives. Our State's largest employer, \nNorthrop Grumman, has made great progress and is working to get back to \npre-Katrina employment levels; Chevron has announced an expansion of \nits refinery in Pascagoula; PSL has announced its first plant in North \nAmerica in Hancock County where they will manufacture steel pipe; and \nTrinity Yachts has a new facility in Gulfport.\n  Much has been done, but there is much left to do.\n  Chairman Donald Powell, the Federal coordinator for the Office of \nGulf Coast Rebuilding, acknowledged these challenges last week when he \nannounced- he was stepping down. He said it would be ``some time before \nthe area recovered.''\n  I say this to my colleagues in the Senate: Katrina is not over. There \nare tall hurdles still to overcome. And there is more the U.S. Congress \nmust do.\n  The most urgent issue facing the Mississippi Gulf Coast is insurance. \nIf you can't insure it, you can't build it or finance it. The rising \ncost of insurance cripples the efforts of small businesses, increases \nthe cost of home ownership, and drives rental rates beyond \naffordability.\n  This is not just an issue for Mississippi. From Bar Harbor, ME, to \nBrownsville, TX, millions of Americans live near the coastline, in the \npath of a future hurricane. For many years, insurance companies have \nrefused to offer insurance protection for water damage caused by \nhurricanes; this led to the creation of the National Flood Insurance \nProgram, which is up for reauthorization soon. After Katrina, the most \nimportant question for a homeowner or a small business person was \n``wind or water?''\n  Wind versus water. That is the debate which still occurs today in \ncourtrooms on the Mississippi Gulf Coast between insurance companies \nand storm victims.\n  This debate is what necessitated the multibillion-dollar supplemental \nappropriations package this body approved after Katrina, and unless \nCongress changes the law, the wind versus water debate will result in a \nmultibillion-dollar supplemental appropriations package after the next \nbig hurricane--wherever it may land.\n  Even worse, since Katrina, it is also common practice for insurance \ncompanies to not offer wind insurance at a rate that is even close to \naffordable. This is driving more and more homeowners and business \nowners into a State-sponsored wind pool, which acts as an insurer of \nlast resort. But this is not a reasonable long-term solution, because \ntoo much risk is being placed in a too small of a pool.\n  The best solution available is to allow homeowners to purchase wind\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nand flood insurance coverage in the same policy.\n  This will not only help the storm victims so they can know their \nhurricane damage will be covered; it also will protect the U.S. \ntaxpayer. The American people are the most generous in the world, and \ntheir elected representatives will continue to respond to natural \ndisasters, whether it is a hurricane on the east coast or an earthquake \nin California, with supplemental disaster appropriations packages. But \nthe size of these packages will be smaller if more people have \ninsurance.\n  As a Member of the House, I voted for Congressman Gene Taylor's \nmulti-peril insurance legislation when it passed last September. I am \ncommitted to achieving the same success here in the Senate.\n  Another key initiative we must focus on in order for the gulf coast \nto continue rebuilding is the extension of tax provisions included in \nthe GO Zone legislation. I mentioned earlier the boost this legislation \nhas given the gulf coast, and I want to ensure this body that it has \nprovided much-needed help.\n  However, in order for the legislation to be fully utilized by \nfamilies and small businesses who have not yet been able to begin \nrebuilding, these important tax provisions should be extended.\n  Other issues remain, especially at Katrina's ``Ground Zero.'' Hancock \nCounty, and the cities of Pass Christian and Long Beach in Harrison \nCounty, bore a direct hit from Katrina, and their issues are not the \nsame as the rest of the gulf coast.\n  With their property tax base decimated, basic government operations \nare still run out of trailers. Hancock County has no jail, an essential \npart of maintaining public safety. Mayors, supervisors, and other \ncommunity leaders now are forced to completely rethink their economic \ndevelopment and planning strategies because the new FEMA flood plain \nmaps will make rebuilding next-to-impossible in many areas.\n  Ground Zero needs extra help. In many cases, Congress has provided \nthe necessary resources, but the Federal Government's current rules and \nregulations do not recognize the reality on the ground. The Federal \nGovernment needs to be flexible, and if it can't or won't, Congress \nneeds to step in. At some point, as Chairman Powell stated, \n``commonsense has to come to the fore.''\n  My Senate office has been in existence for only a few weeks, but we \nare already at work trying to help constituents wade through the \nbureaucratic process to receive the permits from Federal agencies, such \nas the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that are necessary to rebuild.\n  This is, obviously, not the first time the Federal Government redtape \nhas needlessly caused real problems, and it will not be the last. But \nthat does not make the problems any easier, particularly when people \nare hurting. For example, affordable housing initiatives developed by \nthe State are being delayed needlessly because Congress has refused to \ngive the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development the authority \nto waive environmental regulations which require an archaeological dig \nfor remnants on each piece of property, property that already had a \nhome on it before Katrina. Such redtape does not make sense.\n  In this case and in others like it, Congress and the Federal \nGovernment's bureaucracy needs to get out of the way so the States, \ncities, and counties can use the resources already provided to them. \nBut there are other cases where this Congress needs to provide more \nresources.\n  Off the coast of Mississippi lies a chain of barrier islands and \ncoastal wetlands which provide a first line of defense against the \nstorm surge of a hurricane. According to the Corps of Engineers, a \nstorm surge is reduced by 1 foot for every 1 acre of wetland. Without \nthe barrier islands, the storm surges would be 8 to 12 feet high.\n  Hurricanes such as Katrina and Camille before it, two of the most \npowerful storms ever recorded, have caused significant damage to \nMississippi's natural defense systems. If they are not restored, this \nproblem will only get worse, putting more people and property at risk \nduring future storms.\n  Gulf coast ecosystems are also threatened. The barrier islands and \nwetlands provide a natural regulator of salinity levels, which is vital \nfor shellfish and other marine life to have a vibrant habitat.\n  I do not hail from Louisiana, but I strongly support the restoration \nof levees in New Orleans. These levees are necessary for the \nrestoration and protection of a great American city. Our barrier \nislands provide the same purpose to the Mississippi gulf coast as the \nlevees do to New Orleans.\n  In the coming months, I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe gulf region to provide the funding necessary to restore the natural \nhabitats that protect not just the environment and its ecosystems but \nalso protect our citizens who are in harm's way.\n  Through the leadership of many in this body today, the Congress has \nstepped up to the plate and time and again provided assistance to the \npeople of the Gulf States after Katrina. It is appreciated, but I must \nsimply remind my fellow Senators that we are not finished. We should \ncelebrate our progress but keep our eyes on the work that needs to be \ndone. When there is a clear and compelling case for additional Federal \ninvolvement, I will be persistent in making that case. The people of \nthe Mississippi gulf coast, who have demonstrated such untiring \nresilience and strength over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, deserve no less.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to commend our \nnew Senator from Mississippi for what we typically refer to around here \nas his maiden speech. He obviously has chosen a topic that is at the \ntop of the list of concerns for the people of Mississippi and addressed \nthem very effectively.\n  I also wish to say not only to the Senator from Mississippi but to \nhis constituents, what a spectacular start he has gotten off to in the \nSenate. He is an active and an aggressive member of both the Armed \nServices Committee, which is important to his State, and the Commerce \nCommittee as well.\n  I commend him for that outstanding speech today and thank him for all \nhe is doing for the people of Mississippi.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I join the leader in commending my \ncolleague for an excellent statement about the challenges faced by our \nState of Mississippi in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. There could \nbe no greater need of any State than to confront the realities of the \nchallenge we face to rebuild and recover fully from Hurricane Katrina.\n  We have had a tremendous amount of support from the Federal level. We \nhave the approval of appropriations bills, seeing the leaders of both \nHouses--the House and the Senate--coming together, joining with the \nadministration in crafting a recovery package of changes in laws, as \nwell as the appropriation of funds that will help speed the recovery. \nBut it has been very frustrating to see how long it has taken to truly \nget back on the road to foreseeable recovery. Many of the communities \nare still without Federal, State, and county services that existed \nbefore the hurricane.\n  Although every effort is being made to overcome these challenges, the \npath ahead is filled with many new challenges. I am very confident that \nthe presence in the Senate of my friend Roger Wicker will help us \nidentify and succeed in meeting this enormous challenge. I congratulate \nhim on his remarks and thank him for his strong effort in meeting this \nvery important challenge our State faces.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in welcoming \nofficially the new Senator from Mississippi and thank him for his \nservice in the House and his service in the Senate. Certainly, it was \ngreat to hear his maiden speech today.\n  One of the aspects that is so true about the Senate is every Senator \ncan\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nmake a difference. That is one of the challenges I think all 100 of us \ncarry with us every day--to go out there and make a positive difference \nfor this country and for the world.\n  I welcome Senator Wicker to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I will give a very brief status report on the consumer \nproduct safety bill. Right now, we have been working through amendments \nall day. There have been several agreements. The managers' package is \ngrowing, which is good news. We are hopeful that we can have just a few \namendments to be voted on and then have final passage. We do not have \nan agreement on that, but we are trying to reach an agreement right \nnow. I wanted to alert Senators and their staffs that we would love to \nwrap this up, again, this afternoon. If we have to go into this \nevening, we can. But the sense right now on the floor, in talking with \neveryone who has been on the floor, Senators and staff who have been \nworking through amendments, working through issues, we are still \nhopeful we can finish this bill this afternoon. We hope that is good \nnews for Senators.\n  We, once again, encourage any Senator who wants to come to the \nChamber and speak on this bill to try to come down as soon as they can \nbecause hopefully we will get to final passage this afternoon at some \npoint.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska.) Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to again inform Senate colleagues \nand staff on the Hill that we are making great progress. I know we have \nbeen in a quorum call for some time, but the truth is, we have been \nmaking very steady and solid progress.\n  We are hoping to get this bill to final passage this afternoon. There \nare a couple of amendments that we are still working through. We would \nlove to reach an agreement with both sides to have a specific time to \nstart a series of votes to get us out of here this afternoon. Again, \nfor all of the staff and the Senators who are watching, now is the \ntime, if you want to make one last pitch for either an amendment or a \nchange in something, because everybody has been working very hard today \nand this week to get this done.\n  So we do not have anything locked in, but certainly we would love to \nstart this last series of votes sooner rather than later. I have talked \nwith several Senators and they have worked very hard. They would love \nto see us wrap this up as quickly as possible. I think we are very \nclose to doing that.\n  Again, we are talking cloakroom to cloakroom, manager to manager, \nstaff to staff, trying to get the last details worked out. So we are \nvery hopeful we will have good news very shortly. We are very proud of \nthe work that all of the Senators and staff have done to get us to this \npoint on this important piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4130\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Nelson-\nSnowe-Klobuchar amendment to S. 2636. I commend the good work of my \ncolleague, Senator Nelson, that we have done on the bill as a whole, \nwith Senator Pryor's leadership. The three of us as members of the \nConsumer Subcommittee have worked together to make this as strong a \nbill as possible. I especially applaud Senator Nelson's efforts to make \nsure the strong third party testing requirements were included in this \nbill.\n  As we have seen over and over again in the past year with the \nissuance of each new recall, independent testing plays a critical role \nin ensuring that the products on our shores and in our stores are safe. \nSo I commend Senator Nelson for his good work in making sure \nindependent third party testing will now be done using a more \nsystematic approach under the bill.\n  The amendment we are sponsoring that will be brought to the Senate \nfloor today would further strengthen the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission Reform Act by addressing very real dangers that infants and \ntoddlers face with durable goods. To clarify, when you hear the words \n``durable goods,'' what does than mean in a mom's or parent's or kid's \nlife?\n  Well, durable goods are nursery products that are those products that \nno new parent can go without: cribs, car seats and strollers and high \nchairs, the most basic of all children's products.\n  Unfortunately, what we have seen in recent years, in this past year \nin particular, is that these nursery products are leading to the most \nsevere and the greatest number of product-related injuries for \nchildren.\n  In 2007, 48 percent, almost half, of nursery product recalls were \ninitiated because the use of the product has led to some type of child \ninjury or even death.\n  According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an estimated \n64,000 children, 64,000 children under the age of 5 were treated in \nemergency rooms across the country for injuries associated with nursery \nproducts in 2003, at a cost of $2.5 billion. That is $2.5 billion.\n  This figure has certainly risen over the last 5 years. And even more \ntragically, more than 50 children under the age of 5 have died since \nthat time in incidents associated with nursery products.\n  I would like to take a moment and talk about one of the too many \nchildren who died tragically as a result of a defective crib, and that \nis 16-month-old Daniel Keysar. In May of 1998, little Danny was \nstrangled to death in his licensed childcare facility when a Playskool \nTravel-Lite portable crib collapsed trapping his neck in the V of the \nrail.\n  Danny was the fifth child to die while sleeping in the Playskool \nTravel-Lite crib from 1990 to 1997. More than 1.5 million portable \ncribs with similar dangerous designs were manufactured. A total of 16 \nchildren have been killed by this type of crib. This is just a crib, a \ncrib that you would put up in your house, and that many children have \ndied in. And while these cribs were all eventually recalled, in 2007, \nwe saw the largest recall of cribs in our Nation's history. You can see \nright here this is one of the more than 1 million cribs that were \nrecalled last year; 1 million cribs recalled in 2007.\n  But these cribs never should have been brought to the market in the \nfirst place. It is not just cribs. Last year, when recalling the \nEvenflo Embrace infant car seat, the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nrevealed that 160 infants were injured as a result of using this \nproduct. Many of these injuries were quite severe, ranging from skull \nfractures to concussions to lacerations.\n  Let me be clear: 160 babies were seriously hurt by a product that \ntheir parents bought for the sole intention of keeping them safe. That \nis why you get a car seat. I still remember. My daughter is 12, and I \nwould never admit she had ever been in a car seat, but we all buy car \nseats to keep our kids safe. Just to think, for 160 households, it was \nthe car seat that injured their baby. It is clear we must strengthen \nour safety standards and make them stronger for nursery products. Right \nnow the safety of the Nation's nursery products depends on a system of \nvoluntary standards. And while voluntary standards are a good first \nstep, we have seen over and over again that they are not enough. The \namendment Senators Nelson, Snowe, and I are offering would direct the \nCPSC to evaluate and revamp these safety standards and give them the \nforce of law. It is telling the CPSC, you have to do your job. Revamp \nthese standards and make them better.\n  This amendment directs the CPSC to work with consumer groups, child \nproduct manufacturers and engineers and safety experts to examine and \nassess the effectiveness of our current system of voluntary safety \nstandards for nursery products. We had voluntary guidelines for lead \nand look where that got us. The amendment then directs the CPSC to \nissue regulations aimed at reducing injuries and deaths from these \nkinds of nursery products.\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\n  This amendment is not controversial. Strengthening safety standards \nfor nursery products is a winning proposition for everyone. This \nlanguage was included in the House-passed bill by an overwhelming \nmajority. It is my understanding that this amendment will be adopted in \nthe manager's package. I thank Senators Pryor and Stevens for accepting \nthis amendment.\n  I thank the Senate for their support for the amendment I offered with \nSenator Menendez to ban industry trade travel. Industries the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission is supposed to be regulating should not be \npaying for Consumer Product Safety Commission personnel to fly all \naround the world. I was glad we had bipartisan support for our \namendment. We look forward to working on this bill through the day and \ngetting this bill passed. It is incredibly important, the most sweeping \nconsumer product safety reform in 16 years.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment to this \nbill that would ban certain uses of a chemical that poses serious \nhealth risks to the lungs of consumers and workers.\n  In recent years, scientific evidence has mounted that this chemical, \ncalled diacetyl, seriously harms the lungs of workers in the factories \nmaking microwave popcorn. It causes an awful disease called ``popcorn \nlung'' in which the tissue inside of the lungs gets clogged with scar \ntissue and inflammation, leaving the victims struggling to breathe. \nThere is now evidence that it also may pose risks to consumers.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, \nthe effects of popcorn lung include:\n\n                              Popcorn Lung\n\n                       (Bronchiolitis Obliterans)\n\n       The main respiratory symptoms experienced by workers \n     affected by bronchiolitis obliterans include cough (usually \n     without phlegm), wheezing, and worsening shortness of breath \n     on exertion.\n       The severity of the lung symptoms can range from only a \n     mild cough to severe cough and shortness of breath on \n     exertion.\n       These symptoms typically do not improve when the worker \n     goes home at the end of the workday or on weekends or \n     vacations.\n       Usually these symptoms are gradual in onset and \n     progressive, but severe symptoms can occur suddenly.\n       Some workers may experience fever, night sweats, and weight \n     loss.\n       Before arriving at a final diagnosis, doctors of affected \n     workers initially thought that the symptoms might be due to \n     asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, pneumonia, or smoking.\n\n  Last year, Dr. Cecile Rose, the head of environmental and \noccupational health sciences at National Jewish Medical and Research \nCenter, one of the most respected lung disease hospitals in the \ncountry, wrote to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Food and \nDrug Administration, EPA, and the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration regarding the possible risk of popcorn lung for heavy \nconsumers of microwave popcorn as well as for workers.\n  Dr. Rose informed the agencies that she had a patient ``with \nsignificant lung disease whose clinical findings are similar to those \ndescribed in affected [popcorn lung] workers, but whose only \ninhalational exposure is as a heavy, daily consumer of butter flavored \nmicrowave popcorn.''\n  Dr. Rose concluded that while we ``cannot be sure'' that heavy \ninhalation exposure to butter-flavored microwave popcorn caused the \npatient's popcorn lung, ``we have no other plausible explanation.''\n  This report by Dr. Rose, a leading lung disease expert, caused a stir \nin the health community and the public because previously the concern \nhad been focused primarily on the workers, not consumers.\n  Many of the major manufacturers of microwave popcorn have responded. \nAccording to published accounts, four of the leading makers and sellers \nof microwave popcorn--Con Agra, General Mills, American Pop Corn \nCompany, and Pop Weaver--have said they will stop using diacetyl in \ntheir microwave popcorn. Their brands include Jolly Time, Orville \nRedenbacher, Pop Secret, Act II, and Pop Weaver.\n  However, there is no enforceable requirement that these or other \npopcorn makers stop using this chemical in their butter flavoring.\n  My amendment would simply level the playing field for all microwave \npopcorn makers, including importers and small manufacturers, by banning \nthe intentional addition of diacetyl to microwave popcorn.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, in order to protect \nAmericans from this unnecessary risk. We should be able to regularly \nenjoy the simple pleasure of watching movies at home and eating a bag \nof popcorn without having to worry about whether we are harming our \nlungs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a letter in support of this amendment \nprinted in the Record.\n                                                    March 5, 2008.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The undersigned consumer organizations \n     write in support of your amendment to the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission Reform Act bill, S. 2663, to ban the use of \n     the butter-flavoring chemical diacetyl in the production of \n     microwave popcorn.\n       Our groups believe that both workers and consumers should \n     be protected from harmful and even deadly exposure to \n     diacetyl, a chemical found in thousands of food products \n     containing added flavorings, including microwave butter-\n     flavored popcorn.\n       Exposure to airborne diacetyl has been linked to the \n     disease bronchiolitis obliterans, also known as ``popcorn \n     lung.'' Problems with diacetyl first surfaced in 2000. Eight \n     years later workers have become ill and died from exposure to \n     this chemical. Last fall, the first case of a consumer \n     contracting ``popcorn lung'' surfaced. This man developed \n     lung disease after making microwave popcorn multiple times \n     every day for a number of years. Further testing indicated \n     that levels of airborne diacetyl in his home were comparable \n     to levels found in microwave popcorn facilities where workers \n     were diagnosed with ``popcorn lung.'' Diacetyl clearly poses \n     a serious health hazard and must be banned.\n       We understand that several leading manufacturers of \n     microwave popcorn have voluntarily pledged to discontinue the \n     use of diacetyl in their popcorn production. While we are \n     supportive of these actions, it is essential that Congress \n     act more formally to ensure that the comprehensive \n     elimination of the use of this chemical happens immediately. \n     Your amendment would accomplish this by making the ban on \n     diacetyl in all microwave popcorn mandatory for all \n     manufacturers.\n       Thank you for your support for this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sally Greenberg,\n       Executive Director, National Consumers League.\n     Edmund Mierzwinski,\n       Consumer Program Director, U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group.\n     Rachel Weintraub,\n       Director of Product Safety and Senior Counsel, Consumer \n     Federation of America.\n     Ellen Bloom,\n       Director, Federal Policy, Consumers Union.\n     Ami Gadhia,\n       Policy Counsel, Consumers Union.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish today to support S. 2663, the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act. The leadership of \nSenators Pryor and Stevens in negotiating this bipartisan compromise \nbill allows the legislation before the Senate today to move an \nimportant but beleaguered agency in the right direction. S. 2663 \nauthorizes the appropriate level of resources and provides the new \nauthorities necessary for the agency to do the job it was created to \ndo: protect consumers.\n  Mr. President, today the CPSC is broken. It is broken from years of \nneglect coupled with growth in volume and complexity of products and \nfrom a dysfunctional commission. Year after year, this agency is \nsubjected to budget cuts and forced attrition of personnel. Today, it \nhas less than half the budget and half the staff it had in its \ninaugural year of 1973. As a result, the CPSC is no longer properly \nequipped to carry out its essential mission of monitoring the \nmarketplace and enforcing product safety standards. Making matters even \nmore difficult, the number of products under its jurisdiction has grown \nexponentially in size and complexity.\n  The commission is responsible for the safety of more than 15,000 \nproducts, including everything from infant cribs to computer \ncomponents. Most of these products are safe. However, those that are \nnot safe can be deadly. Each year, more than 28,000 Americans die and \nan additional 33 million are injured by\n\n[[Page S1684]]\n\nconsumer products. To say these numbers are much too high is an \nunderstatement. We must have an effective CPSC, one with increased \nfunding, staff, and authority, to reduce these losses.\n  This bill addresses the weaknesses of our Nation's product safety \nsystem in several ways, but I would like to highlight some of the \nessential changes. S. 2663 puts the responsibilities of product safety \nsquarely on the Government's shoulders. First, the act authorizes \nneeded resources over a 7-year period to provide the agency the \nmanpower and the technology it needs to police a complex global \nmarketplace. The act would restore the CPSC to a full complement of \nfive commissioners to maintain continuity and to avoid the losses of \nquorum that have plagued the agency in recent years.\n  To help buttress the resources needed to monitor the market and keep \nconsumers safe, the act would authorize State attorneys general to \nbring civil actions to seek injunctive relief for clear violations of \nstatutes enforced by the CPSC. Creating a joint enforcement \nrelationship with the States has proven to be successful in the area of \nconsumer protection, and this collaboration would provide the CPSC a \npartner to protect American families in a meaningful way.\n  S. 2663 also would require manufacturers to use independent labs to \ntest children's products and to certify their compliance with mandatory \nsafety standards, including the mandatory toy safety standard \nestablished in the act. This new toy standard would provide the CPSC \nand industry with a fast, flexible way to address emerging hazards. It \nwill serve to protect children from dangers such as strangulation, \nintestinal perforation, or blockage hazards.\n  While new authority and regulatory structure is needed for this \nagency, providing accurate and up-to-date information about product \nhazards to Americans would allow consumers to help themselves and make \nbetter decisions about the products they buy. In order to help \nconsumers, S. 2663 would create a database of information from \nnonindustry sources, such as hospitals, childcare providers, public \nsafety agencies, as well as consumer reports about product hazards \ncollected by the CPSC itself. This database would provide consumers \nwith potentially lifesaving information, in an organized fashion, which \nwould better equip them to assess product safety risks and hazards.\n  Finally, this legislation would allow the CPSC to share product \ninformation with governments around the world. Since our economy is \nglobal, faulty products do not just end up in our homes but in homes \naround the world. By reaching out to and coordinating with other \ncountries, the ability of the CPSC to interdict and keep unsafe \nproducts off of store shelves would be improved.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, some Members in this Chamber believe \nthat regardless of the dire picture supporters of this bill have \npainted as it relates to the lack of resources and existing \nauthorities, last year's ``summer of recalls'' proves that the \ncommission is working just fine.\n  These members may cite statistics showing that in 2007, the agency \nannounced 231 children's product recalls, of which 58 were toys. They \nwill point out that last year set a record for the most toy recalls in \na single year. However, anyone who understands the agency and the work \nthat it does will know that in fact, this statistic is further evidence \nof the need to reform the CPSC.\n  Specifically, the slow nature of the current recall process left more \nthan 46 million recalled items in the stream of commerce, including \nmillions of toys sitting on store shelves, waiting to be sold to \nunsuspecting parents. I think it is safe to say that in the opinion of \nparents, this is a system failure. Unfortunately, the prospects for \n2008 look much the same.\n  The agency has already announced 40 voluntary toy recalls. At this \npace, the number of recalls announced this year will surpass all \nrecords. However, these recalls are voluntary, not mandatory.\n  Further, many of the recalls were not the result of a proactive \nagency; rather, they were the response of a reactive agency to an \ninvestigation conducted by members of the press. That is not how \nGovernment should work.\n  S. 2663 reflects a good bipartisan compromise led by Senators Pryor \nand Stevens. Children are dying and suffering grievous injuries because \nof unsafe products. This bipartisan bill is a good step forward in our \neffort to keep harmful products off of store shelves.\n  For America's families, and especially for America's children, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this meaningful consumer safety legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S. 2662, the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act. The reforms that this \nbill makes to the Consumer Product Safety Commission are long overdue.\n  S. 2663 takes important steps to shore up a weak and ineffective \nConsumer Products Safety Commission, CPSC. As a grandfather and \nconsumer, I am appalled at the lack of resources and enforcement \nauthority of the CPSC and its inability to adequately protect our \nchildren, our food supply, and the general public from harmful or \ncontaminated products.\n  We can and should be doing much more to protect the American \nconsumer. As was recently underscored by the alarming number of \nchildren's products with high lead content, contaminated pet food, and \ndefective imported tires, there are a lot of cracks in the systems that \nwere supposed to be watching out for consumers.\n  We need to know our children's and grandchildren's toys are safe. We \nneed to know that the food we import is not tainted with harmful \nchemicals. We need to know the products we buy will not harm us or our \nchildren. I believe it is the Government's basic responsibility to \nprotect the public.\n  Those who work for the companies that make these products may often \nbe in a position to detect and prevent serious problems or injuries \nbefore they occur. I am pleased that this bill includes important \nprotections for corporate whistleblowers that will encourage employees \nto come forward about violations and defective products without the \nfear of retaliation by their employer.\n  Many of the defective and contaminated products are imported. Even \nwith its current limited resources and reach, CPSC recalled \napproximately 150 tainted products from China in 2007, including tires, \ntoys, baby cribs, candles, bicycles, remote controls, hair dryers, and \nlamps. Imagine how many more contaminated or defective products are \nslipping through the cracks and reaching American consumers without \nbeing detected.\n  We are being deluged by cheap imports from China and elsewhere. We \nshould at least be making sure the products we import are not \ncontaminated or dangerous. In this vein, last summer I wrote to \nPresident Bush requesting that his administration investigate dangerous \nproducts that have been imported from China. We need to strengthen our \nagencies and laws so that products that do not meet our health and \nsafety standards are stopped at our borders. To do this we need to give \nthe CPSC the necessary tools and resources, including more manpower to \nadequately inspect imports.\n  Like most of my colleagues, I was shocked by CPSC Acting Chair Nancy \nNord's claims that no additional funding was needed for her agency. To \nme this claim implied there was no desire by this administration to do \nmore to protect American consumers. That is absurd given the recent and \nalarming incidents of contaminated products reaching consumers. The \nSenate's consideration of S. 2663 and the House passage of a similar \nbill is proof that Congress strongly disagrees with this point of view \nand will make the legislative changes needed to give the CPSC the \nnecessary tools to improve on its past poor performance and reassure \nconsumers that there will be more oversight of the marketplace in the \nfuture.\n  This bill will increase overall funding for the CPSC by 50 percent \nover 7 years, increase CPSC staffing to at least 500 employees over the \nnext 5 years, streamline product safety rulemaking procedures, ban lead \nin children's products and require certification and labeling, increase \ninspection of imported products so we are not allowing recalled or \nbanned products to cross our borders, increase penalties for violating \nour product safety laws, strengthen and improve recall procedures, and \nban the sale of recalled products.\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\n  The legislation has the support of the following, among others: \nThomas H.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the bill to \nreform the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC. Over the last 7 \nyears, the Bush administration has weakened the CPSC by cutting its \nbudget and staff. In fact, the CPSC has hired just one full-time \nproduct tester since 2001. This led to fewer inspectors and more toxic \ntoys and products on store shelves. This is unacceptable.\n  The CPSC legislation that passed the Senate today provides much \nneeded resources and enforcement powers to the CPSC so that more staff \ncan be hired and oversight can be more vigorous. The CPSC legislation \ncreates a consumer database for recalled products so that consumers can \nlearn about potentially unsafe products without waiting for a public \nrecall that can take months. Further, this bill would create new \nsafeguards on lead in toys and other products and require mandatory \nindependent testing of goods before they go to market.\n  This bill also prohibits CPSC Commissioners and staff members from \naccepting trips paid for by industries and lobbyists with business \nbefore the Commission. Taken together, CPSC legislation will improve \nour product safety system and ensure that children's toys, household \nappliances, and other consumer products that contain lead will never \nreach consumers.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on my amendment to \nthe Consumer Products Safety Commission, CPSC, bill that the full \nSenate is now debating. I applaud the steadfast efforts and leadership \nof Chairman Inouye, Ranking Member Stevens, and Senator Pryor in moving \nthis critically vital bill to the Senate floor and to passage--and for \nincluding my amendment by unanimous consent as part of this bill.\n  My amendment would perfect this bipartisan measure by ensuring that \nthe CPSC fully considers potential small business impacts when it \nestablishes through a rulemaking, as it is required to do under the \nbill, criteria for imposition of penalties. As ranking member of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have long \nworked to ensure that the Federal Government takes measures and \nprecautions to protect the interests and viability of small businesses, \nwhile at the same time rigorously enforcing our Nation's consumer \nprotection laws.\n  Under the bill that we are now considering, the maximum civil \npenalties for violations would be increased from $8,000 to $250,000 for \nindividual violations; and up to $20 million for aggregate violations. \nWithin 1 year after enactment, the Commission would establish, through \na Federal rulemaking, the criteria for imposition of civil penalties.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would make clear that the Commission \nconsider the size of a small business when establishing a penalty \ncriteria through a rulemaking. My staff has discussed this issue with \nthe Commission, which has raised an issue with Section 16(c)--``Civil \nPenalty Criteria''--of the bill. This section does not specifically \nreference the size of a small business as a criteria.\n  The Commission's attorneys suggested that a minor change--adding the \nword ``additional''--would resolve ambiguity to ensure that the \nCommission considers the size of a small business--as it is required to \ndo under section 20 of the Consumer Product Safety Act. This would help \nto ensure that this new penalty provision remains consistent in how the \nCommission factors in small business size in proportion to penalties.\n  My amendment would also ensure that the Commission appropriately \nconsiders, during its rulemaking, ``how to mitigate undue adverse \neconomic impacts on small businesses.'' I firmly believe that requiring \nthe Commission to consider undue adverse economic impacts when \nestablishing the new penalty criteria, would help to ensure that small \nbusinesses can remain viable while at the same time increasing \npenalties for violations under the act--a win-win.\n  In closing, my amendment would help to ensure the continued viability \nand competitiveness of our Nation's small businesses--while protecting \nthe strong regulatory enforcement included in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of my \nremarks be included in the Congressional Record.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 2663, \nthe CPSC Reform Act, and I would like to thank Chairman Inouye and Vice \nChairman Stevens for their leadership on this important and \ngroundbreaking bill. I also want to thank Senator Pryor for his \nextraordinary work in crafting this outstanding bill which has strong \nbipartisan support.\n  The CPSC Reform Act will provide the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission with the authority and resources it needs to be more \neffective in its critical mission to protect consumers. Quite frankly, \nthe current product safety system is broken, and the CPSC is in \ndesperate need of reform. Too many unsafe goods are reaching the shores \nof the United States. Too many dangerous products are finding their way \ninto the hands of American consumers, and all too often, young \nchildren.\n  It seems that over the past year, nearly every week we have had to \nfrantically pull Chinese and other imported goods off store shelves as \nwe learn of each new tainted product. The bottom line is that our \nsafeguards are failing and we need to act fast to fix them. We worry \nabout our kids when they are in class, when they are walking or driving \nhome alone, even when they surfing the Internet. We should not have to \nworry that the toys they play with might be hazardous to their health \nor even fatal. From children's costume jewelry to toy trains, these \nrecalls call in to question our ability to keep dangerous toys out of \nthe hands of our kids.\n  For years, CPSC has been starved of funding and plagued by budget and \npersonnel cuts. As a result, the effectiveness of the CPSC has been \nseverely undermined and the agency, despite its efforts, has been \nunable to keep up with globalization of the marketplace. This bill will \nreverse those trends and give the CPSC the budget and the tools it \ndesperately needs to again become an effective force for consumer \nprotection. These important tools include $40 million to upgrade CPSC's \nlaboratories and 50 additional personnel to inspect goods at U.S. ports \nand overseas product facilities. The bill will also give consumers \nbetter access to vital safety information by creating a searchable \ndatabase that has information including reports of injuries, illness, \nand death related to the use of consumer products.\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\n  It is essential that we take strong steps to protect all consumers, \nbut especially our children. This bipartisan bill takes a tough \napproach to cracking down tainted products and seeks to restore \nAmerica's faith in the mechanisms we have in place to safeguard our \nkids against these dangerous products. First, the bill prohibits \nimporting untested children's products. Second, it also requires \ntracking labels for children's products that will help parents tie \nsafety recalls and alerts to their prior purchases. Third, the bill \nprohibits the sale of recalled products so that as parents and \nconsumers, we don't continue to see these hazardous products on the \nshelves. Finally, this legislation bans all children's products \ncontaining lead.\n  The CPSC must do a better job of getting hazardous products off the \nshelves and out of consumers' reach, and these provisions will give the \nCPSC the tools to do just that. It is essential that manufacturers, \nimporters, and retailers do their part to ensure product safety and \nkeep tainted products out the market. This bill seeks to hold companies \naccountable by increasing criminal and civil penalties for those who \nknowingly and willingly violate product safety laws. It also gives \nState attorneys general the power to crack down on companies by \nenforcing Federal safety standards and provides them with the authority \nto get dangerous products off the shelf. Furthermore, the bill gives \nprotection to whistleblowers so that employees who identify dangerous \nproducts along the supply chain can come forward with vital health and \nsafety information without fear of reprisal.\n  As you can see, these are important commonsense solutions that will \nkeep consumers informed and safe from dangerous products. Passage of \nthis bill is vital if we hope to rebuild, reform, and revitalize the \nCPSC and restore America's faith in the agency's ability to protect \nconsumers and their children from unsafe products. I urge my colleagues \nto support this critical legislation that restores the CPSC and gives \nit the much needed authority to put an end to the alarming trend in \ntainted products faced by this country in recent months.\n\n\n                             proposition 65\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, over 20 years ago, the people of \nCalifornia enacted a landmark ballot measure known as proposition 65. \nProposition 65 prohibits exposures to chemicals like lead that are \nknown to cause cancer or reproductive harm without a clear and \nreasonable warning. Proposition 65 enforcement actions by the State and \nby private attorney generals have played a crucial role in reducing \nchildhood exposure to harmful chemicals, such as lead. For example, the \nCalifornia attorney general recently brought a proposition 65 case \narising from unsafe levels of lead in children's toys. It is my \nunderstanding that nothing in this bill is intended to preempt or \notherwise diminish the protections of proposition 65. I would like to \nask the distinguished Senator from Arkansas and lead author of this \nlegislation: is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes, it is. Compliance with proposition 65's warning \nrequirements would only complement the CPSC Reform Act.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it the intent of this bill or the rules promulgated \nthere under by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to preempt \nproposition 65?\n  Mr. PRYOR. No. First, the CPSC Reform Act bans lead in children's \nproducts beyond trace amounts. Under section 22, any children's product \nthat contains lead ``shall be treated as a banned hazardous substance \nunder the Federal Hazardous Substances Act.'' While the Commission is \ndirected to examine whether it is possible to lower the trace levels \npermitted under the bill, no action is required with respect to \nlabeling requirements that might inadvertently trigger a preemption of \nproposition 65. It is the intent of the CPSC Reform Act to get rid of \nlead from children's products, not to inadvertently preempt a consumer-\nfriendly and valuable law such as proposition 65.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kerry be added as a \ncosponsor to the Feinstein amendment No. 4104.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to support the legislation we \nare debating. I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Arkansas \nwho has led this effort and has done so with such aplomb on a bill that \nwill, I hope, pass on a strong bipartisan vote later today because it \nis a bill America needs. Americans don't need to be convinced that we \nneed stronger protections to keep dangerous products from entering our \nhomes.\n  Abigail Hartung, a 13-month old girl from New Jersey whose crib \ncollapsed on her one night, doesn't need to be convinced. Her parents \nwho awoke to the terrifying sound of a child in screaming pain do not \nneed to be convinced either.\n  I know even many of my colleagues who do not like Government \nintervention on the other side of the aisle do not need to be convinced \nthe meager measures we have in place to protect consumers from \nhazardous products are not enough.\n  That is why I rise today in strong support of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission Reform Act. It is long past time for us to act.\n  Madam President, 2007 was a disastrous year for product safety. There \nwas a record number of safety recalls. Over 400 different products had \nto be pulled, and more than half--more than half--of those 400 products \nwere for children. That adds up to an astonishing number of dangerous \nitems--almost 46 million items.\n  Now, we saw toxic toys shipped in from China laced with lead paint \nthat could cause permanent neurological damage or death. We saw car \nseats dump out the kids who sat in them. We saw beads that contained a \nchemical that could put children into a coma if swallowed.\n  Too often, the recalls were too late. Last year, recalled products \nkilled 6 children, they injured 657 more, and they destroyed the \nconfidence of the entire Nation.\n  So the question is, can they trust the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission as it exists today? I think the answer to that is no.\n  Issues of product safety are not going away by themselves. In \nJanuary, there was a recall of toys with magnets that could cause fatal \nintestinal blockages if swallowed. Last month, we had a scare about \nchildren's sketchbooks coated with potentially fatal--fatal--levels of \nlead paint.\n  When dangerous products keep getting introduced, when 46 million \nitems so unsafe that they have to be recalled are allowed to reach \nconsumers' hands in 1 year, we have to believe those are not 46 million \ncoincidences. We have to think there is at least one Government \nwatchdog agency that is falling far short of what it needs to be. That \nagency is the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  Now, sadly, the Consumer Product Safety Commission is nothing more \nthan a hollow shell at this point. We talked about those 46 million \nunsafe products recalled last year. If you had a robust commission, as \nthe bill will provide for, with all of the pertinent powers and \nresources, then we should not see that reality.\n  Years of budget and personnel cuts have left it badly equipped for \nthe job we are counting on it to do. Poor leadership and unethical \nbehavior have undermined what little power and authority the Commission \nhas.\n  No watchdog can effectively regulate if they cozy up to the industry \nthey are supposed to be regulating. That is why I am proud the Senate \nagreed to the amendment the Presiding Officer, Senator Klobuchar, and I \noffered to prohibit members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nfrom accepting travel paid for the industries they regulate.\n  It seemed to us--and I am so glad an overwhelming vote of the Senate \nsaid the same--how is it that you can accept such travel paid for by \nthe very\n\n[[Page S1687]]\n\nentities you seek to regulate, who, in that travel, ultimately are \ntrying to influence you so that those regulations are not as \nprescriptive and as onerous as they need to be in pursuit of the \ninterests of consumers?\n  It was a great first step. Now we have to finish the job.\n  It is time to reform the Consumer Product Safety Commission so it can \nstrongly enforce safety standards, prevent deadly imports from entering \nour Nation's borders, and restore confidence to parents that it is OK \nto do something as simple as give a toy to their child.\n  Again, let me thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Pryor, for \nhis tremendous leadership on this issue. And right by his side has been \nChairman Inouye and Ranking Member Stevens, along with Senator Collins, \nand many Senators from both sides of the aisle.\n  The effort to keep consumers safe should be a truly bipartisan \neffort. I am confident the bill we have before us is going to win some \nvery broad-based support.\n  Here is what the bill finally does.\n  First, it gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission the resources \nit needs to do its job, boosting its budget, and expanding its staff.\n  Second, when it has the staff and resources it needs, the Commission \nis going to have a greater presence at our Nation's ports. For the \nSenator from New Jersey, which has the Port of Elizabeth in Newark, the \nmegaport of the east coast that sees the incredible amount, the \nbillions of tons that come through from all over the world, I \nunderstand very clearly how this element is so critically important--to \nstop deadly imports from coming in and enforce a comprehensive ban of \nlead in children's products.\n  Children's products will have to be independently tested and verified \nto be safe. Toys will have tracking labels, so if there is a problem, \nwe will know who is responsible.\n  The bill gets tough on violators. Not only does it ban the sale of \nrecalled products, it makes sure companies face the possibility of real \nfinancial consequences if they break the law, so they don't simply see \nthe fines for hawking dangerous products to our families as another \ncost of doing business.\n\n  Right now, I am sure there are those companies that say: Well, that \nis fine. I will just bring this in because I am going to make more than \nthe consequence of a fine. That is fundamentally wrong.\n  The bill protects employees who report violations of safety standards \nso people will not be afraid to come forward with information that \ncould save lives.\n  Not only will employees be better able to speak out, consumers will \nbe better able to speak out and listen to each other. For the first \ntime, the bill would create an online product safety database, so we do \nnot have to wait until tragedy strikes close to home to hear about \nsafety concerns other consumers have already discovered.\n  So if I know about that crib, and I go on line, and I put it on, and \nnow another family looks and says: Let me figure this out, let me find \nout if this is the type of product that has any problems, and they see \nthat information, it is a warning and preventive measure that is \npowerful because information is powerful. This bill will give that \ninformation to consumers in our country.\n  Those are just a few of the specifics. But the bottom line is, this \nbill is about keeping our children safe and bringing us all a little \npeace of mind.\n  When a parent puts a toy in the hands of a child, it is a beautiful \nmoment--a moment we should never allow to be undermined by fear. If we \ntake action today, if we sign this pledge, to look out for American \nfamilies as conscientiously as we should, then we will be helping to \nsee to it that nothing takes the joy of that moment away.\n  So I urge strong support of the measure.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nfirst speak to my support for the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nbill which is before us. I want to also honor my colleague from \nArkansas, who has led these efforts on behalf of the Commerce Committee \nin the Senate. He understands from his background as the attorney \ngeneral for the State of Arkansas that it is important to protect \nconsumers.\n  Attorneys general are known across the country for their role in \nserving as protectors of the people. This legislation is in fact a \n``protector of the people'' because what it will do is it will allow us \nto deal with those unsafe products that are finding their way into the \nhomes of Americans, into the hands of children, and into the hands of \nall Americans in a way sometimes today which is unsafe.\n  There are many stories that have been untold about young people who \nhave been victimized by a lack of oversight with respect to all these \nimports that are coming in at levels we have never seen before, from \nplaces such as China and other places around the world, which are \ncausing significant damage to young people.\n  Last year alone, 27,000 Americans died because of some illness that \nwas related to an unsafe product. That is 27,000 Americans who lost \ntheir lives. Yet when we look at CPSC today, the Commission which is in \ncharge of enforcing consumer protection standards and measures to \nprotect Americans, there is one inspector on the job to get this all \ndone on behalf of 300 million Americans.\n  I think that is woefully inadequate. It is an inadequacy which this \nSenate and this Congress has a responsibility to address.\n  In my own home State of Colorado, there was a young man by the name \nof Tegan Leisy. Tegan is only 4 years old. But because of a defective \ntoy that was brought into his household, he ended up going to the \ndoctor with a pain in his stomach. Three days later, it was discovered \nthere were six magnets that had come off this toy which had got into \nhis intestines and had created a problem, which required his intestines \nto be torn apart in order for the young man to undergo the operation.\n  So we need to make sure we have the right consumer protection \nstandards. We need to make sure we have the ability to enforce those \nstandards. The CPSC legislation which is before us will allow us to do \nthat. So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of this \nlegislation when, hopefully, we get to it in the next several minutes. \nIt is important for us as Americans. It is imperative for us to make \nsure we are protecting the consumers of our country.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Housing Crisis\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I come to the floor today to address \nthe issue of our economy and the need for us in Washington, DC, to \nunderstand the pain that Americans are feeling across the board, \nespecially when it comes to the issue of housing.\n  Last week, Majority Leader Reid brought to the Senate floor the 2008 \nForeclosure Prevention Act, which was filibustered on this floor. It \nshould not have been because the pain that people are feeling across \nAmerica with respect to this housing crisis is a pain that goes across \nall of America. It is not a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent \nissue. The housing crisis is a problem which is creating pain for a lot \nof people in our country.\n  I want to demonstrate how, in my view, this is an issue that ought to \ncontinue to be at the top of the totem poll for us to consider in the \nSenate and for the Congress to act upon and for the President and the \nexecutive branch to show leadership in addressing this problem.\n  This is a chart I have in the Chamber which we have brought to the \nSenate floor on other occasions, which indicates what Moody's sees as \nthe possible future outcome with respect to what is happening with this \nunprecedented housing downturn. This unprecedented housing downturn is \nthe worst the United States of America has seen since the Great \nDepression.\n  We look at the first graph on this chart, which shows that housing \nprices are expected to decline by almost 16 percent. That amount of \ndecline is not just related to those homes that are going into \nforeclosure. They are related to homes in neighborhoods where\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\nwe are seeing this foreclosure crisis spread across the country. It is \nkind of like a disease; it hits one home, and all of a sudden it \ncreates a major downturn in terms of the value of homes throughout that \nneighborhood, throughout that block, and throughout those communities.\n  Now, when we talk about this as being a foreclosure issue, it is an \nissue that creates pain for those families who are being forced out of \ntheir homes because they cannot afford to make mortgage payments, but \nit is a pain that spreads to all of American households, as we see this \nhuge decline in American values.\n  Another figure, another metric that demonstrates the extent of this \nproblem: When you look at housing starts, housing starts are projected \nto go down, with a 60-percent decline in housing starts, with no end in \nsight. The economists cannot even predict how far down we will go in \nhousing starts before we hit the trough of this problem.\n  When you compare that to other housing crises which we have had in \nthe past--in the 1980s and the 1990s and last year--we are looking at a \nproblem which is much more extensive, much more prolonged, much deeper \nthan we ever had. So that, from my point of view, at the national \nlevel, shows we ought to be doing a lot more to address this issue.\n  Today, in some of the television and newspaper reports we are seeing \naround the country--we have one out of CNN where they are reporting \nthat foreclosures have hit an all-time high. The report says over \n900,000 households are now in foreclosure, which is up 71 percent from \na year ago, according to this news article. There are 900,000 \nhouseholds in foreclosure, up 71 percent from a year ago.\n\n  According to this, it also says that it represents over 2 percent of \nall mortgages. That is a higher rate of mortgages in foreclosure than \nat any time in the 36-year history of the reports provided by the \nMortgage Bankers Association. There is no end in sight to the problem \nwe are seeing. These problems we are seeing with respect to \nforeclosures hitting an all-time high are especially acute in States \nsuch as the States of Florida and California, Nevada, Arizona, Ohio, \nand Michigan.\n  In addition to what is happening with these high levels of \nforeclosures is that we also know we have these declining home values, \nand we end up seeing a tremendous slip in the amount of home equity \npeople have in their homes. According to the Federal Reserve, \nhomeowners' debt on their houses exceeds their equity for the first \ntime since 1945. For the first time since 1945, homeowners' debt on \ntheir houses exceeds their equity.\n  Now, in my State of Colorado, when I try to bring this back home to \nthe 5 million people whom I represent in the Senate every day, I see \nthe same problem we are seeing all across the country. Between this \ntime in 2008 and next year, 2009, there is a projection from the Center \nfor Responsible Lending that we will see almost 50,000 homes in \nforeclosure. That is 49,923 homes in foreclosure in the State of \nColorado.\n  As I have said before, it is not just the pain that is felt by people \nwho are losing their homes through foreclosure; it also is the \nspillover effect that occurs when you have massive foreclosures taking \nplace in my State. The spillover effect means that surrounding home \nvalues will decline in 748,000 homes. Almost half the homes in the \nState of Colorado are going to see a significant decline in their \nvalue, because we are going to have about 50,000 homes that are going \nto go into foreclosure in the years 2007 and 2008. As my colleagues \nsee, when you have that kind of decline in individual home values and \nyou aggregate those home values, there is a huge decline in the \naggregate equity people will have in their homes throughout my State of \nColorado--some $3.2 billion.\n  Those are the facts. Those are the facts. There ought to be a wake-up \ncall, it seems to me, not only to the White House but also to the \nCongress, that we need to move forward with legislation that addresses \nthis issue.\n  Senator Reid came to the floor of the Senate a week, 10 days, ago and \nset forth the components of the Mortgage Foreclosure Prevention Act, \nand it was based on the input he had from the chairs of many \ncommittees, including Senator Leahy and Senator Baucus and others who \nhave jurisdiction over these issues. I think he put his finger on the \nright button. He put his finger on the button that is of great concern \nto the people of America, and that is what is happening with the \nhousing crisis today.\n  I am hopeful as we move forward to do our work in the Senate, as we \nare doing it so well today on consumer protection, we are then able \nsoon to pivot back to addressing the housing crisis we face here in \nAmerica today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nfor 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2730 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nbills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, it has come to my attention \nthat the Senator from Minnesota who sits in the chair right now was \nvery kind in her comments a few minutes ago about one of the additions \nto this overall consumer products bill that this Senator had a little \nhand in. We are going to add another, because it is my understanding \nthat we now have it accepted on both sides--it is in the managers' \npackage--another major component of the bill to address the fact--and \nthis is surprising. Last year, we had the largest crib recall in \nhistory--almost 1 million baby cribs--because three infant deaths were \nnoted in the recall announcement. After the announcement, even more \ncame to light.\n  Most of us would be shocked to learn that most of the safety \nguidelines for durable infant and toddler products are not set by the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, but they are only voluntary \nstandards that are set by manufacturers making the products. So, for \nexample, full-sized cribs, half-sized cribs, rattles, and bottles are \nthe only infant and toddler products that have required safety \nstandards.\n  Well, it is time to change that. Happily, we are going to change that \nright here with this bill. Through the kind of comments made by the \nPresiding Officer, and thanks to the chairman of our subcommittee, the \nSenator from Arkansas, it has been included in the managers' package. \nWhat it requires is that all infant and toddler durable products be \ntested and certified according to mandatory safety standards before \nthey are put out on the market.\n  I thank Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine. She has come on as a \ncosponsor of this amendment. The minute she saw this, she said: I want \nto be a part of that. Because infant and durable products subject to \nthis requirement include such a wide array of products such as cribs, \ntoddler beds, high chairs, booster chairs, hook-on chairs, bath seats, \ngates, play yards, stationary activity centers, child carriers, \nstrollers, walkers, swings, bassinets, cradles--all things that when we \nbuy them, we assume they have been checked for safety. Yet it has been \nup to the manufacturers to check for the safety.\n  What we are going to do in this bill when it becomes law, it is going \nto be as a result of safety guidelines that they are going to have to \nconform to independent testing. Standards would be established through \na consensus process involving the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nconsumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and experts in the \nfield. The standards will be promulgated on a rolling basis, with no \nless than two sets of durable product rules per year. This timeframe \nwould allow for input by all of the interested parties.\n  It is time to put a stop to these senseless deaths from unsafe \nproducts such as unsafe cribs. I am very grateful\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\nthat the managers of this legislation have now included this as a part \nof the bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I know we are in the midst of \nconsidering the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reauthorization Act. \nI thank Senator Pryor, Senator Collins, Senator Stevens, Senator \nInouye, and so many others for their efforts to bring us to this point. \nWe hope to pass it very soon this afternoon. We are waiting for a \nlittle paperwork to be finished.\n  I am going to use this opportunity to speak as in morning business, \nand I ask unanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Peace In Sudan\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise at this moment to discuss a \nresolution that the Senate enacted last night by unanimous consent \nrelating to the situation in Darfur. Darfur is a region of Sudan that \nhas been in the newspaper for years because of the genocide that has \nbeen sadly unfolding in that part of the world.\n  I introduced this resolution because I think we have reached a \ncritical point where we must act to stop this genocide in Sudan. I am \nproud that 40 Senators from both sides agree it is time to say ``no \nmore.''\n  For more than 4 years, the world has watched this humanitarian crisis \nunfold--thousands have been murdered, tortured, raped, and displaced. \nThousands more are languishing in refugee camps.\n  Leaders from around the world--including President Bush, Prime \nMinister Gordon Brown, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, former U.N. \nSecretary General Kofi Annan, former President Jimmy Carter, Bangladesh \nmicrofinance champion Muhammed Yunus, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu--have \nall called for an end to this violence.\n  Here at home--and it has been gratifying as I traveled around my \nState to find this--thousands of people, including many high school and \ncollege students, are well aware of this genocide. Church leaders and \nother activists have helped raise awareness of the horrible human \nsuffering that has occurred in Darfur. Senators on both sides of the \naisle have spoken out passionately about this crisis.\n  Last year, the U.N. Security Council voted to deploy a historic \npeacekeeping mission to Darfur, but that was last year. Under \nsignificant international pressure, the Sudanese Government agreed at \nthat time to the deployment. The 26,000-member U.N. African Union \npeacekeeping force is to be deployed to Darfur to halt the violence and \ncreate conditions for peace and a long-term political settlement.\n  There was speculation about whether we can get the peacekeeping force \nin place before the end of last year. Sadly, despite all of the \npromises of last year, the Sudanese Government has done everything they \ncan to stop the deployment of the peacekeeping force. It has brazenly \nobstructed this full deployment. I will give you an example: Sudan's \nleaders balked at the deployment of non-African forces. Last month, \ngovernment forces in Sudan actually fired upon a peacekeeping convoy.\n  In recent months, the regime has even appointed notorious figures who \nwere knowingly complicit in this genocide in Darfur--including two \naccused of war crimes--to senior government positions. It is almost a \nbrazen defiance to the rest of the world that Sudan, on one hand, would \nagree to a peacekeeping force, and on the other hand, shoot at those \nwho come and try to bring peace to their country, and then exalt to the \nhighest levels some of the worst characters in their country.\n  Many of you have seen the article on the front page of last Sunday's \nNew York Times about the latest devastating violence in Sudan. This \nisn't yesterday's genocide or yesterday's moral challenge; this \nchallenge goes on today. The article in the New York Times highlighted \nhow the Sudanese Government continues to defy the international \ncommunity and murder its own people.\n  I am going to show you an aerial photograph that appeared in the New \nYork Times, which shows the torched Sudanese village of Suleia. \nGovernment forces and allied militias burned the village only a few \nweeks ago. As you can see, there is nothing left. I don't know if a \nlong view of this, for those observing it, will do it justice. But \nthose who have flown over the area say it looks like cigarette burns \nacross the landscape. Each of these so-called cigarette burns reflects \na fire that was lit to a small thatch hut where people were living, \npeople who were forced out, some who were captured, tortured, \nmutilated, and raped, and some who were taken away. Many had to run \naway, leaving behind this blighted landscape as a stark reminder that \ndespite all of the speeches and resolutions and all of the \ndetermination, genocide in Darfur continues, sadly, to this day.\n\n  Witnesses said militiamen in that town laid waste to the town, \nburning huts, pillaging shops, carrying off any loot they could find, \nand shooting anyone who stood in their way--men, women, or children.\n  The attack included aerial bombing and Sudanese Government army \nground forces. That the Sudanese Government has returned to these \nbrutal coordinated attacks shows its utter contempt for the \ninternational community and its own people.\n  Rich Williamson is an attorney in Chicago who has served in a \ncapacity with the Department of State in previous years and now has \ntaken the place of Andrew Natzios as a special envoy to deal with this \nsituation in Darfur. We certainly have different political views, but \nwhen he came to visit my office, we found that we are of the same mind \nabout this particular crisis and the need for an urgent response to the \nSudanese Government. We cannot allow Darfur to slide back into the \nhorrible situation that we know took place over the last several years.\n  While much of the world's attention has been on Darfur, the \ncomprehensive peace agreement between north and south Sudan has also \nbecome increasingly at risk. This agreement, signed in 2005 with the \nstrong support of the United States, brought an end to two decades of \ncivil war between north and south Sudan that had left 2 million dead. \nYet the government in Khartoum appears to be backing away from its \ncommitment to this agreement and instead preparing once again for war.\n  Remember what fuels this war: Oil fuels this war--oil sold by the \nSudanese to the Chinese, to the Indians, and to a handful of other \nnationalized oil companies. It is the profit of those sales that is \nfueling this war that is killing so many innocent people.\n  We cannot allow the agreement to bring peace in Sudan to be \nundermined, and we cannot ignore what is happening again in Darfur. It \nis time to bring an end to this violence and time to set conditions for \na long-term peace. I salute Senator Biden for leading a resolution last \nmonth calling on the President to immediately address any equipment \nshortcomings with the peacekeeping force. I completely agree with \nSenator Biden. The White House must not allow a modest shortage of \nequipment to prolong the suffering in Darfur.\n  Last night, the Senate passed my resolution, with the support of 40 \nSenators from both sides of the aisle, to call for an immediate halt to \nthis violence and a commitment from both sides to participate in a new \nround of peace talks.\n  The resolution also calls upon the Government of Sudan to facilitate \nthe immediate and unfettered deployment of the U.N.-African Union \npeacekeeping force, including any and all non-African peacekeepers. \nSudan and Khartoum gave their agreement last year. They must be held to \ntheir promise. It calls upon the diverse rebel movements to set aside \ntheir difference and start to work together in order to better \nrepresent the people of Darfur. It condemns any action by any party--\ngovernment or rebel--that undermines or delays the peace process. It \ncalls upon the Government of Sudan to enable humanitarian organizations \nto have full unfettered access to populations in need, and it calls \nupon all parties to\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\nthe comprehensive peace agreement between north and south Sudan to \nsupport and respect all terms of the agreement.\n  We have allowed the genocide in Darfur to continue for too long. We \nhave allowed a brutal regime to repeatedly obstruct and ignore the \ninternational community. It is time, once and for all, to bring an end \nto this violence in Sudan.\n  It was my high honor to serve as the successor to Paul Simon, from \nIllinois, who served in this body for 12 years. He was my closest \nfriend in politics and my mentor, and he helped me along to win this \nSenate seat and to represent this great State. Paul Simon was at a \ncritical place at that moment in history. He was chairman of the \nAfrican Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee when the \ngenocide in Rwanda broke out. His ranking Republican member was Jim \nJeffords of Vermont. The two of them, when they noted what was \nhappening in Rwanda, decided to step up and try to persuade the Clinton \nadministration to send even a small peacekeeping force in to stop the \nkilling in Rwanda. They reached out directly to the President, as well \nas the Secretary of State and other officials in the Clinton \nadministration, with no results. The net impact, of course, was we did \nnothing and 800,000 people died.\n\n  I was in Rwanda a year or two ago with Senator Brownback. We stayed \nat the hotel made famous by the movie ``Hotel Rwanda.'' Don Cheadle \nplayed the actor's role of the hero, the manager who stepped up and \nsaved so many innocent lives by making his hotel a refuge. We stayed in \nthat same hotel. I was haunted walking through the hallways and \ncorridors of that almost-empty hotel. I think of the thousands of \npeople who wondered if they were going to be attacked or killed as they \nwaited there, hoping the genocide would end.\n  At the end of the day, after weeks of bloodshed, over 800,000 people \nwere murdered in the streets of Rwanda--innocent people murdered simply \nbecause of their tribal affiliation.\n  President Clinton did many good things, and he now reflects on his \nservice and said this is one thing he did not do well; he could have \ndone better. He has returned to Africa and visited Rwanda and has said \nas much. I think it is courageous of him to make that admission and to \nrealize a little effort could have made a difference.\n  How many speeches have we heard in this Chamber and in this town \nabout Darfur, over and over again. Yet the simple reality is, despite \nall the speeches by the President, by Senators, by Members of Congress, \nlittle or nothing has been done. This genocide has unfolded on our \nwatch. When we are critical of previous generations for not doing \nenough during the Nazi Holocaust or during some of the other horrendous \nevents that occurred around the world--certainly the Rwanda genocide--\nwe say: How could they have been blind to the reality of what is \nhappening here?\n  We still cannot be blinded to the reality of what is happening in \nDarfur, and each of us, either by our church groups or schools or \nMembers of Congress making a statement on the floor or calling in the \nappropriate ambassadors or calling in the U.N. General Secretary, have \nto urge them to take action now to bring an end to this genocide.\n  I wish to make certain this Senate is on record, and I thank all \nthose who helped last night to pass this resolution, but it is not \nenough, and it will not be enough until we make significant strides to \nend this bloodshed in Darfur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, in response to the widely publicized \nproduct recalls of last year, the Congress appropriated $80 million for \nfiscal year 2008 to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which was \nan increase of 28 percent. The CPSC was instructed to use the \nadditional money to increase staff, workspace, and information \ntechnology resources. In December, the House of Representatives passed \nthe Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act, H.R. 4040, by an \noverwhelming vote of 407 to 0. It seems like that would have been a \nreasonable place to start. In fact, during this debate, a number of us \nvoted in favor of Senator DeMint's amendment to completely substitute \nthe bill we are now considering with the House-passed bill. H.R. 4040 \nincrementally increases CPSC's budget to $100 million for fiscal year \n2011, requires third-party and pre-market testing of many children's \nproduct for lead and other hazards, and creates new lead standards for \nproducts.\n  However, instead of focusing on product safety, we are now focusing \non legislation seeming to simply benefit lawyers. Lawyers who, under \nthis legislation, would have higher civil penalties and new punitive \ndamages to pursue in whistleblower claims.\n  The bill also allows State attorneys general to file lawsuits and \nenforce rules against manufacturers, conceivably creating 50 different \nstandards of product safety laws; in other words, lawsuits as far as \nthe eye can see. In fact, this week, a Wall Street Journal editorial \nreferred to the Senate bill as ``Lawyers 'R' Us.''\n  We have tried to amend this bill and improve the problematic aspects \nof it, and have achieved very few positive changes. I will miss the \nvote on final passage. However, since I would be opposing it anyway, it \nwould make no difference in the outcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, once again, I hope I have good news. I am \nhoping the next time I address the Senate on this microphone that we \nwill be asking unanimous consent for votes or a vote, maybe in this \ncase, on final passage.\n  I again alert Hill staff and Senators that we are very close. I thank \nall my colleagues. I could go through a long list. While I have just a \nmoment while they are literally wrapping up the final i's and t's on \nthis document, I thank Senator Stevens for his great leadership in \nhelping shepherd this bill through; Senator Inouye, of course, for his \nleadership and what he brings to the table and how he runs his \ncommittee is fantastic; Senator Collins--I mentioned her yesterday--\ncame in at a critical time and made the bill better; Senator Bill \nNelson of Florida who spoke a few moments ago--Senator Bill Nelson in \nsome ways started this whole process. He filed a bill over the summer--\nJune, July, September, I am not quite sure. He filed a bill about \nthird-party testing for toys. We had already been working on a bill. He \nwent ahead and put his bill out there publicly and spurred a lot of \ninterest. And Senator Klobuchar, who is presiding right now, has been \nworking on this bill every step of the way. Senator Durbin, of course, \nhas made a lot of improvements. Senator Schumer has played a vital role \nin trying to get this bill shaped and ready to go.\n  I again thank all my colleagues for their hard work. There are too \nmany to go through right now because almost all 100 Senators had some \nrole in this bill and have helped in some way or another. I wished to \nacknowledge them and hopefully the next time I stand up here, we will \nbe propounding a unanimous consent request on votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I understand we are working toward \nfinal passage on the bill. I congratulate the Senator from Arkansas for \nthe tremendous job he has done on this legislation. While everybody is \nputting together the last of this bill, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Outsourcing Aerospace Technology\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I have come to the floor this afternoon \nbecause we have to wake up the country. We are at risk of losing a \nmajor part of our aerospace industry to the Europeans forever.\n  I am outraged the Pentagon is not only going to stand by and let it \nhappen, but it is the Pentagon itself that made the decision in the \nfirst place. I am referring, of course, to the Air Force's decision \nlast Friday to award one of the largest military contracts in history \nto the French company Airbus over the American company Boeing. With \nthis $40 billion contract, our Air Force is beginning the process of \nrebuilding our aerial refueling tanker\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\nfleet, and the planes we are purchasing are going to be used for the \nnext 30 years or more.\n  As we learn more about this decision, I have to say I grow more and \nmore astounded at the shortsightedness. As I speak today, Airbus does \nnot actually supply this military capacity to any government. The \ntanker that the administration wants Airbus to build is unproven. In \nfact, in my home State of Washington, the machinists call it a paper \nairplane because it only exists on paper. Right now, the company that \nsupplies those real planes is Boeing, and it has built them for almost \n50 years. Up until now, we have in this country controlled our own \nmilitary refueling capabilities, but with this decision we are now \nhanding Airbus that control.\n  What makes this so disturbing is we are now outsourcing those jobs to \na company that has spent years blatantly working to dismantle our \nAmerican aerospace companies. Airbus is controlled by foreign \ngovernments which follow the social welfare model. Those countries \nsubsidize Airbus, allowing it to sell planes at discounted rates, as \nlong as it creates jobs for European workers.\n  Our Government is concerned enough about that practice that we have a \nWTO case pending at the EU, but apparently that does not matter to the \nadministration, because by giving Airbus this contract, we are laying \nout the welcome mat to walk all over our military production \ncapability. What is the incentive to buy an American tanker if they can \nget an import at fire-sale prices? With this contract, we are allowing \nAirbus to take over our military technology, and we are actually paying \nthem to do it.\n  Airbus has now launched a very slick marketing campaign to try to \nconvince us in Congress and the public that this decision will actually \nbe good for the United States. I spoke on the floor at length yesterday \nabout Airbus's long history of exaggerating the number of jobs it has \nproduced, and it is very interesting that while Airbus has put its \nsupporters on radio and TV over here--and you have heard them--to talk \nabout how excited they are about the number of U.S. jobs this deal is \ngoing to create, the news in Europe is about 180 degrees different. \nReuters ran an article, the dateline out of Paris yesterday, reporting \nthat Airbus's parent company, EADS, was scrambling over there to \nclarify that no jobs would be relocated from Europe to the United \nStates. And a British publication earlier this week reported that \nalmost all of the construction work will be done in Europe and then \nAirbus will fly that plane to the United States for ``finishing.''\n  If Boeing had won the contract, it would have created 44,000 real \nUnited States jobs. By awarding this contract to Airbus, the U.S. \nGovernment is leading those jobs to the guillotine.\n  The most frustrating part about all of this is the Air Force has \ninsisted on defending their decision. Yesterday, according to the \nAssociated Press and other news outlets, one official testified in the \nHouse that the Pentagon did not have to consider the location of \nassembly and manufacturing facilities for those planes; all it needed \nwas a promise by Airbus that it would team with Northrop Grumman and \nU.S. suppliers. In other words, the Air Force did not consider at all \nAirbus's record of playing unfair on trade. It did not consider at all \nthe number of jobs we will certainly lose because of this contract. And \nit did not consider at all what this would mean for our ability to \nproduce our own military technology.\n  When we are at war across the globe, we should at least consider what \nit means to give a company owned by a foreign government control over \nour military technology, and I think we should do it before we finalize \nthis deal.\n  Airbus and EADS have already given us plenty of reason to worry about \nhow hard they will work to protect our security interests. Let me give \na couple of examples. Back in 2005, EADS, the parent company of Airbus, \nwas caught trying to sell military helicopters to Iran. And in 2006, \nEADS tried to sell transport and patrol planes to Venezuela. That is a \ncircumvention of U.S. law.\n  Suppose in the future that Europe and the United States have a major \ndisagreement over foreign policy. Do we want France or any other \ncountry to have the ability to slow down our military capacity because \nit does not like our policies?\n  That is a serious question we should consider. With one contract, we \ncould wipe out 50 years of experience of aerospace in the United \nStates, and once it is gone we are not going to get it back. It is not \ngoing to come back. Shouldn't we in Congress at least have a serious \ndebate about this before we give it all away?\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Obstruction and Filibusters\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this morning, our colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, came to talk about \nthe Republican obstruction and filibusters, and I guess I have been \naround here just a few years now, but I have learned that a charge that \nis unrebutted is a charge that is believed. In the interest of making \nsure people understand what the facts are, I would like to address his \nallegations.\n  This morning, Senator Schumer repeated a myth, which is the \nallegation that there have been 73 Republican filibusters in the 110th \nCongress. He said, ``This Republican minority can only obstruct.'' \nBased on what I believe is a complete distortion of the facts, he said \nthe Republicans ``will be held accountable in November.''\n  Well, I might note that Senator Schumer, in addition to being the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, is also the chairman of the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. And I would hope we would \nhave better things to do than to use the floor of the Senate for \npartisan attacks when we have so much important work that needs to be \ndone.\n  He said he wished we could ``go back to the good old days when \nfilibusters were used for issues of major import but not used routinely \nto block every single piece of legislation.'' Well, it is evidence \nenough that is an overstatement and I think just a downright \nexaggeration, in that we are working right now on a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation on the consumer protection issue to make sure American \nconsumers are protected from dangerous products, particularly those \nthat may be imported from abroad. But let me just say what the facts \nare.\n  Under the definition that Senator Schumer--and the majority leader \nbefore him--calls a filibuster, Republicans would be obstructing \nmultiple times in 1 day on many occasions. What they are actually \nreferring to is a record number of times that the majority leader has \nattempted to prevent debate and block Senators from offering \namendments. What happens is he will come to the floor and he will call \nup a bill and then he will fill the amendment tree, which is a \nprocedural device designed to block the offering of amendments. It \nbasically imposes a ``my way or the highway'' approach to legislating \nin the Senate. You don't have to be around here very long to know that \nnothing happens around here unless there is some bipartisan agreement \nand work, and this bill we are on today is a perfect example of how it \ncan work and how it should work.\n  Now, I would say that the majority leader is setting a record of his \nown, moving to cut off debate the first day a bill or resolution \nreaches the floor more than any other majority leader, whether they be \nRepublican or Democrat. During the first session of the 110th Congress, \nSenator Reid filed cloture--that is, he filed to cut off debate--on the \nsame day a bill or resolution was introduced on nine separate \noccasions. Before we have had a chance to even talk about it, before \nanybody has even had a chance to offer amendments, he filed to cut off \ndebate, cut off amendments, nine times. That is three times more than \nMajority Leaders Frist, Daschle, Lott, Mitchell, or Byrd ever did in \nthe first session of Congress and nine times more than in the first \nsession of the 109th Congress.\n  Among these 73 Republican filibusters, so-called, Democrats include\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\ntimes when members of their own party actually filibustered issues of \ngreat importance to the American people. Here are a couple of examples.\n  Senator Dodd, from Connecticut, filibustered the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, which allows us the authority to listen to terrorists \nwho are conspiring to harm the American people; the so-called \nfilibuster by our Democratic friends of the McConnell-Stevens troop \nfunding bill last November, which was designed to provide funds to our \ntroops in harm's way, which had been delayed for far too long; and \nthen, of course, the filibuster of Judge Leslie Southwick, a circuit \ncourt nominee.\n  Cloture motions that were filed by Republicans in an effort to avoid \nobstruction were also included.\n  Of the more than 73 so-called filibusters, Senate Democrats either \nvoted to ``filibuster'' or voted with Republicans, and the vote was \nunanimous on five occasions.\n  Well, let me just say that I know sometimes the nomenclature and the \nprocedures get awfully confusing here on the Senate floor, but the \nAmerican people clearly would like to see us work together more to \nsolve problems. We are not talking about people giving or taking leave \nof their principles or their firmly held convictions, but everybody who \nworks here on the Senate floor knows that the only way things happen is \nby bipartisan cooperation because neither side has the 60 votes to cut \noff debate and get what they want, as you could if you had a majority \nin the House of Representatives.\n  I even read today that the distinguished majority leader compared so-\ncalled filibusters to aggravated assaults. He said: It doesn't make any \ndifference whether it is 72 or 65 stabbings, it is still the fact you \nhave been assaulted. Well, I just think that kind of rhetoric is over \nthe top.\n  What we need to do is, rather than make false charges about \nobstruction, we need to come together and try to solve problems. I \nbelieve that is what the American people want us to do.\n  So rather than have this unrebutted allegation out there, lest people \nbelieve it, because it is being repeated over and over, I think it is \nimportant to set the record straight.\n  I think everybody in this body knows what the deal is; that is, if we \nare going to solve problems, we are going to have to work together. \nThis CPSC bill is the perfect example. The majority leader did not have \nto file cloture in order to bring us to conclusion. We sat down and we \nhave negotiated amendments, we have offered amendments, and we have had \nvotes. That is the way this place works.\n  But I think what is fair is fair, and we need to make sure the story \nis accurately told. As Senator McConnell said earlier--quoting Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan--everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but \nnobody is entitled to their own set of facts.\n  Facts being what they are, people can then decide what their opinion \nis. But it is clear this is not a case of obstruction--unless, of \ncourse, you are talking about blocking tax increases on the American \npeople, and I will be honest, we did block those tax increases because \nthey are bad for the economy, bad for the American people. But by and \nlarge, when we have been met halfway, we have worked together to try to \nsolve problems.\n  I thank the chair very much for the time that I have had to respond. \nI think it is important that the full context of the record be clear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I happened to pass by, and I am glad I did \nbecause my friend, the Senator from Texas, the junior Senator from \nTexas, is talking about facts that do not exist.\n  The comment about the 72 stabbings came from me. The fact is, in \nlooking very closely at this, it appears that there were not 72 \nRepublican-led filibusters but only 65. I used an illustration that \nsomeone who is charged with a crime--I know the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer was a prosecuting attorney--comes in after having stabbed \nsomeone 72 times and says: No, I only did it 65 times.\n  The American people know what is going on. The American people know \nwhat is going on. Every step of the way, we have had to work around \nprocedural obstructions put up by the Republicans--every step of the \nway. The result of that has taken a lot of time. We have spent 76 days \nof Senate time on filibusters led by Senate Republicans.\n  Now, the American people have seen what is going on. They have had \nmore than a year to look and see what is going on. They are going to \ncontinue to see. But what I said last Friday, I say today: The \nRepublicans in the Senate should enjoy their time because they are not \ngoing to be able to do this after November 4. The American people have \nseen what they have tried to do and been able to accomplish on many \noccasions. And we are going to continue to do the best we can in spite \nof the obstacles put up by the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I could not disagree more with the \ndistinguished majority leader. But I will tell you that when it comes \nto increasing taxes, bigger Government, and higher spending, sure, we \nare going to stand our ground. We are going to try to block the \nincreased rates on the taxpayers' check and growing the size of \nGovernment beyond our capacity to sustain it and failing to meet the \nobligations we have to pay for things such as Medicare and Social \nSecurity and passing those down to our children and grandchildren.\n  We are on the verge of the debate on the 2009 Federal budget. One of \nthe problems we need to work on together rather than merely accuse each \nother of malfeasance or misfeasance is $66 trillion in unfunded \nobligations we are passing on to our children and grandchildren.\n  I am on the Budget Committee. We had a vote on the budget that will \ncome to the floor next week. There is nothing in the budget--nothing in \nthis budget--that addresses the concerns I know we have on a bipartisan \nbasis about this unsustainable growth of entitlement spending.\n  So that is the kind of thing we ought to be working on on a \nbipartisan basis--how can we protect the family's budget rather than \nwreck the Federal budget. But instead of that, we find there is this \nback-and-forth for partisan gain.\n  The majority leader said: Wait until the election day in November. \nWell, people know what this is about. This is about partisan politics. \nThis is not about trying to solve problems. I hope we can do so.\n  Again, I compliment the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from \nAlaska for addressing on a bipartisan basis consumer safety in this \nbill. This is a good example of what we ought to be doing, not engaging \nin partisan sniping that I think does nothing but continue to bring \npublic opinion of Congress to the lowest levels in recent history.\n  That is why the approval rating of this Congress is at the 18-\npercentage rate.\n  So we ought to try to find ways to work together, not engage in this \nsort of partisan sniping in an effort to gain advantage, electoral \nadvantage, in November. It does not work, for one thing. I think the \nAmerican people listening to this say: A pox on both your houses. What \nthey want to do is see us work together to solve the problems.\n  We are going to have a chance on the budget to try to keep spending \ndown, to try to make sure we do not raise taxes and we deal with the \nobligation we have to meet on unfunded liabilities that will be passed \non to our children and grandchildren. That is what I hope we spend our \ntime doing rather than partisan politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, any time we have a President as unpopular as \nour President, the numbers of all people who serve in Government are \ndown, and Congress is part of that.\n  I would say that the facts are what they are. We have been obstructed \non virtually everything we have tried to do.\n  These are just a few of the motions to proceed that we have had to \nwaste up to 48 hours on, 2 days for cloture to ripen, 30 hours after \nthat. Those are just a few of them. Now, look how they passed: 90 to 0; \n94 to 3; 93 to 3; 89 to 7; 91 to 0; 80 to 0; 80 to 4; 86 to 1. It was \nonly an effort to stall what we do here.\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission, we had to file a motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to go to that. The Intelligence \nauthorization bill, intelligence authorization, to give our \nintelligence agencies the tools they need to go after all the bad guys \naround the world, we had to file cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthat. The court security bill, that was important to me because we had \nsome vicious man, at 200 yards, shoot through the judge's window and \nkill him after he had slit his wife's throat. We need court security. \nIn Georgia, we had a situation there where a number of people were \nkilled. We had to invoke a motion to proceed to that issue. The water \nresources bill, the chairman of the Environmental and Public Works \nCommittee is here. She worked on a bipartisan basis. That bill had \noverwhelming support, Democrats and Republicans. We had to file cloture \non a motion to proceed to it; Clean Energy Act, 91 to 0; Children's \nHealth Initiative, to reauthorize that, 80 to 0. Just a stall. That is \nall it was about.\n  Economic stimulus package, and then housing, a stimulus package on \nhousing, having five simple issues in it. One is transparency on \ndocuments that you have to fill out when you buy a home. No. 2, we \nwanted to make sure the homebuilders all across the country get what \nthey want--tax provisions for loss carryback. That is in our bill; \nsomething the President called for in his State of the Union Message \ncalling for issuance of bonds to buy homes that are in foreclosure, \nused homes--now it is you can only buy new homes. We have a CDBG \nprovision in that bill to allow people from all over the country to \nwork through their Government to renovate some of the neighborhoods \nthat are devastated by these foreclosures. And then we had a provision \nin the bill dealing with bankruptcy.\n  Now, the Republicans have cried volumes that they want to do \nsomething about the housing crisis. They would not let us legislate on \nthat. We cannot do that. We cannot get 60 votes. But they say they want \nto legislate on it.\n  I told Senator McConnell long before we got on the bill: Let's do \namendments. If you want to look at our amendments, fine, look at them; \nwe will look at yours. They said they did not like the bankruptcy \nprovision. Offer an amendment to strike it. I know there are some \nDemocrats who do not like it. Maybe they could get enough votes to get \nrid of that. They are not willing to legislate. They are stalling. This \nhas been going on all year.\n  So I have great respect for my friend from Texas, but I do not need \nto be lectured on what is procedurally obstructionism. We can bring out \nchart after chart to show what they have done. And do not suggest to me \nthat there has not been obstructionism. They have broken all records of \nthis Congress. They have broken all records of any Congress. They broke \nin 1 year how many filibusters were filed in a normal 2-year period.\n  So I extend my appreciation to the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor. \nHe is a great Senator. He takes right after his dad. I had the good \nfortune of serving with his father. I said in an interview I had \nrecently: Who is the Senator you admire most for his legislative \ncapabilities? ``David Pryor of Arkansas,'' I said, ``because he was a \nwonderful man and a great Senator.'' His son is doing just the same \nthing his dad did. This bill is a result of tremendous participation.\n  The Senator from Texas is right, the Senator from Alaska, the Senator \nfrom Hawaii have worked on this. This is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation led by Senator Pryor. Senator Pryor is a great public \nservant. He has had significant experience as attorney general in the \nState of Arkansas. He was one of the instrumental members of the Gang \nof 14 who stopped the use of the filibusters in the Senate, as is the \nPresiding Officer.\n  So I want the Senator from Arkansas to know how much I appreciate the \nexample he has set in working through the process here. Everyone here \nshould understand that legislating is a compromise. ``Compromise'' is \nnot a bad word, it is consensus building, and Mark Pryor has done a \nwonderful job working on this piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, just briefly, roughly half the votes on \nthis chart that the distinguished majority leader has described as \nfilibusters were actually successful votes where cloture was invoked \nonce the majority worked with us, allowed full consideration of the \nbills, and those bills actually moved forward and became law.\n  On roughly half of the instances--I have not looked at the entire \nchart; this is the first time I have seen it here. But that is a \nperfect example of how we ought to be working together and not an \nexample of obstruction, but it is actually a means that the Senate has \nbeen allowed to do what the Senate does, and that is to have full \ndebate, a fair opportunity to offer amendments and then up-or-down \nvotes on amendments and then pass legislation that goes to the \nPresident and is signed for the benefit of the American people.\n  So I disagree with his characterization on at least half of those \nvotes. They resulted in successfully passed legislation, not an example \nof obstructionism but of this Senate actually working the way the \nSenate should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is another example of the Orwellian \nlanguage we get from the White House and this administration, and now \nobviously some of my friends have picked it up on the Republican side.\n  These were efforts to stall what we were trying to do. You can say \nwhatever you want. Sure, these passed. That is the whole point. We have \nchart after chart that shows this whole thing. Of course they passed. \nHow could you, in good conscience, not vote for the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations? They stalled us going to it because as long as they \nare here on a 30-hour postcloture do-nothing, it means we cannot go to \nother things, we cannot go to patent reform, to energy reform--all \nthese things that need to be done.\n  This Republican President and his Republican Senators want the status \nquo. They are fighting for the status quo. It is very clear they are \nfighting for the status quo. They want us to stay the way we are.\n  We want change to take place. The country needs change. The American \npeople demand change. That is what is going on with the Presidential \nelection out there. That is why you get crowds on the Democratic side, \nour candidates, tens of thousands of people, 15,000 in Boise, ID. \nPeople are looking for change. That is what we are going to bring, and \nwe are going to see that in November. The American people know what the \nRepublicans have done to us, but we are going to continue to work \nhard. We are going to continue to work hard in spite of that to get \nthings done for this country.\n\n  It is my understanding we have a vote set up, and we are getting \nclose. We know a number of people have things to do. We thought we \nwould be able to have it at 4:30. We have been unable to do so. We are \ngetting close, I have been told. Whether we finish this in 10 minutes \nor tomorrow sometime, congratulations are in order for my friend from \nArkansas. He has done a great job.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4104\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I do have good news. This is similar to the \nold Bob Dylan song, ``Slow Train Coming.'' It has been a slow \nafternoon, seemingly, but there has been a lot of activity.\n  I ask unanimous consent to agree to the Feinstein amendment by voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4104.\n  The amendment (No. 4104) was agreed to.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 4088; 4092, as Modified; 4101; 4112; 4120; 4123; 4128; \n 4130, as Modified; 4113; 4114; 4141; 4136; 4137; 4138; 4143; 4116, as \n Modified; 4118, as Modified; 4090; 4103; 4098; 4109, as Modified; and \n                       4108, as Modified En Bloc\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, we are in a period of morning business. I \nwant to pause for 1 minute and thank all of the cosponsors on this \nlegislation. There was a committee bill and the bill that passed the \nfloor a few moments ago. I thank everybody who helped work on this, \neven those who voted against it. Many of them offered very constructive \nsuggestions and amendments.\n  Let me start by thanking Senator Collins. She has been fantastic \nthroughout this whole process. Senator Harkin, Senator Klobuchar, \nSenator Bill Nelson, Senator Schumer, Senator Durbin, Senator Lincoln, \nof course Senator Salazar, Senator Brown, Senator Menendez, Senator \nCasey, Senator Wyden, and even though I don't think Senator McCaskill \nwas ever a cosponsor, she helped in the last few days on some drafting.\n  There are two whom I need to single out, and one is Senator Ted \nStevens of Alaska, who went to bat and worked through a lot of issues \nthat made this vote today possible, as well as our chairman Senator \nInouye, first because I appreciate very much him giving me the \nopportunity to manage the bill. He designated me a year ago to try to \nwork on this legislation, and I will always be grateful to him for his \nleadership and giving me this opportunity.\n  I also thank members of the staff. We all know we get the credit, we \nget the publicity, and we are sort of the face, but we could not do \nthis job we do without great staff. So I have a little bit of a long \nlist, but they all deserve some recognition: Alex Hoehn-Saric, David \nStrickland, Mia Petrini, Jared Bomberg, Mellissa Zolkeply, Margaret \nCummisky, Lila Helms, and Jean Toal-Eisen.\n  These are all members of the Commerce staff on the Democratic side. I \ncannot tell my colleagues--I cannot exaggerate how many hours they put \ninto this legislation.\n  Then on my staff: Price Feland, Andy York, and many others helped, \nbut those two went the extra mile, especially Price, who was fantastic.\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\n  On Senator Durbin's staff: David Lazarus, Tom Faletti, Dena Morris, \nand Chris Kang, all of whom helped in many ways.\n  On Senator Reid's staff: Mike Castellano and Mark Weitjen.\n  On Senator Klobuchar's staff: Tamara Fucile and Katie Nilan.\n  On Senator Nelson's staff: Chris Day.\n  Then on the Republican side of the Commerce Committee, I will tell my \ncolleagues they were fantastic and they spent hours and hours and hours \nworking through issues and through this process. They played an \nimportant role.\n  So my thanks to Paul Nagle, Megan Beechener, Mark Delich, Peter \nPhipps, Rebecca Hooks, and Christine Kurth.\n  Again, oftentimes the Senators get the credit for things, but we do \nnot give the staff enough credit.\n  On Senator Collins' staff: Asha Mathews was critical, and she was \ngreat in helping in many different ways with Senator Collins who played \na very important part in this legislation.\n  I thank my colleagues for this week. I know we worked very hard and \nwe were very persistent. But one of the great things about this week is \nwe saw what the Senate can do. We saw if we make up our minds that we \nare going to do something good for this country, the Senate can do it. \nWe worked together. We kept all the nongermane amendments off the bill. \nWe had several on our side, and there were a few over here. We had more \non our side, but we kept all of those nongermane amendments off the \nbill. We had a spirit of cooperation and collegiality and it was great. \nIt was fun to be a part of it. It reminds me, once again, how great an \ninstitution the Senate is.\n  I again one last time thank all of my colleagues for their support \nand all the floor staff here for doing all the great things they did to \nget us where we are today. This is a great day for the Senate and a \ngreat day for the American people. Now this bill will have to go to \nconference and the hard work starts. But I feel confident that we will \nbe able to work with our House colleagues, who worked so hard on their \nlegislation to get something done, and hopefully in the next several \nweeks, whenever that may be, it will come back to the Senate for the \nfinal vote and we can get it to the White House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1698-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1698-S1699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, if one watches the Presidential campaign, \none finds that virtually all of those who have run for President and \nthose who remain in the campaign are talking about change, change, and \nchange. While I think each of them may differ with the other as to \nexactly what they mean by change, what they are picking up is the very \nserious unhappiness of the American people in terms of the direction \nthis country is going.\n  What people perceive and what the candidates are picking up on is \nthat the middle class is shrinking. We have tens of millions of people \nwho wake up in the morning, they go to the gas station, they are paying \n$3.20 for a gallon of gas. Home heating oil is soaring. In many cases, \nthe wages of workers are going down. People are losing their health \ninsurance. They are losing their pensions. They are seeing their jobs \ngo to China and other low-wage countries. The people in our country do \nnot feel good about the state of our economy. They want changes. They \nwant to move this country in a different direction. Fundamentally, I \nbelieve, what they want is a new set of national priorities.\n  As my colleagues may know, this afternoon the Senate Budget Committee \nvoted on and passed a new budget. This budget, appropriately enough, \nrejects President Bush's incredibly bad budget, which continues the \nprocess of providing huge tax breaks to people who don't need it and \nthen cutting back on the needs of the middle class and working families \nin terms of massive cuts in Medicare, in Medicaid, eliminating \ncompletely the weatherization program, and cutting back significantly \non LIHEAP at a time when the need for heating assistance is greater now \nthan ever before. Altogether, it is a budget which puts money where we \nshould not be putting money and cuts back on those programs which \npeople desperately need.\n  Next week, as I understand it, the budget will be coming to the \nSenate floor. We will be debating the budget that was passed by the \nBudget Committee this afternoon. While I happen to believe the budget \nwe passed was a good budget--certainly a major, major, major \nimprovement over what President Bush gave us we can make significant \nimprovements upon what we passed this afternoon. So I will be offering \nseveral amendments. The major one will essentially be asking the Senate \nto change the national priorities of this country and to begin \nresponding to the millions of working families who know that something \nis wrong in America. They know that while poverty increases, while the \nmiddle class shrinks, the people on top have never had it so good. They \nknow that ordinary people understand there is something strange when \nthe wealthiest Nation in the history of the world cannot provide \nquality health care to all of its people; that our infrastructure is \ndeteriorating before our very eyes; that we have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty in the industrialized world; that all over our \ncountry food shelves are being descended upon--not by unemployed people \nalone, not by disabled people, not by poor people but by people who are \nworking 40 or 50 hours a week and can't afford with their wages to \nprovide the nutrition their families need. People understand there is \nsomething deeply, deeply wrong in this country, and that we have to \nmove in a new direction.\n  My amendment is very simple. It is going to give the Members of the \nSenate a very stark choice about whether we want change, about whether \nwe want to move this country in a new direction. This is what it does. \nIt couldn't be simpler. It says that at a time when the wealthiest \npeople in this country have never had it so good since the 1920s in \nterms of a huge increase in their income, in terms of the fact that we \nnow have by far the most unequal distribution of income and wealth of \nany major country, where the top 1 percent now earn more income than \nthe bottom 50 percent, what we are saying is that it is time we rescind \nPresident Bush's tax breaks that go to people who make at least $1 \nmillion. That is the top three-tenths of 1 percent; 99.7 percent of the \npeople would not be impacted by this amendment. It says: Let us rescind \nthose tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, and when we do \nthat, we will raise about $51 billion.\n  Now, what can we do with that $51 billion, and what does this \namendment include? First, it says that since President Bush has been in \noffice, we have had record-breaking deficits. We now have a $9 trillion \nnational debt. We are fighting a war we are not paying for, but that \nour kids and our grandchildren will be paying for. So in this \namendment, of the $51 billion we raise by rescinding tax breaks for \nmillionaires, we are going to put $10 billion into deficit reduction. \nThat leaves $41 billion.\n  This is what this amendment would do. It would provide $15 billion \nfor special education. The Presiding Officer may remember that some \nyears ago the Congress--the Government of the United States--made a \ncommitment to school districts all over America and said: If you \nmainstream kids with disabilities, if you put them into public schools, \nif you treat them as every other kid, we will provide 40 percent of the \ncost of that special education. That is what the Government said. \nUnfortunately, the Government did not keep its word.\n  So what we see in Vermont--and I suspect in Colorado and all over the \ncountry--is the school districts are paying enormous sums of money out \nof local taxes, often regressive property taxes, to fund special \neducation. All over America, what we are seeing is more and more kids, \nfor whatever reason--and that is a long discussion we need to have--are \nhaving problems, are being seen as having special ed needs. It is an \nexpensive proposition. We are saying, let's begin to keep our word to \nschool districts all over America. Let's relieve the pressure of local \nproperty taxes. Let's put $15 billion into special education.\n  In addition, what this amendment would do is provide a $7 billion \nincrease for Head Start. One of the great scandals in our Nation today \nis that we\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\nhave the highest rate of childhood poverty--far higher than any other \nindustrialized country; that working parents are finding it almost \nimpossible to acquire quality, affordable child care; that Head Start \nopenings are much greater than can be accommodated all over the \ncountry. We are saying Head Start is a program that works. It provides \nan opportunity for early childhood education for low-income kids.\n  Let's expand that program to make sure working families can take \nadvantage of that program and let's put $7 billion into expanding Head \nStart.\n  We also, for the same reasons, put $2.2 billion into the child care \nand the development block grant program that will ensure every eligible \nfamily receives access to child care.\n  I know in my State--and, again, I suspect in most States in this \ncountry--people are being weighed down by very high local taxes, \nincluding regressive property taxes.\n  What this amendment does is provide $5 billion for school \nconstruction, modernization and repairs, to fix our crumbling schools. \nWhat this does is not only help local property taxes and not only help \nour school kids get modern buildings in which to learn, it also creates \na lot of jobs as we rebuild one of the long neglected areas of our \ninfrastructure, and that is our crumbling schools.\n  This amendment would also provide an additional $3 billion for \nLIHEAP, the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program. I just, this \nafternoon, spoke to the directors of various community action programs \nin the State of Vermont. In my State--and my State may be a little bit \ndifferent than some because it gets pretty cold there. We have had 20 \nbelow zero weather in the last couple weeks. There is a real level of \nstress regarding the availability of LIHEAP because the cost of home \nheating fuels is soaring. There is just not that availability. There is \nnot enough money in the LIHEAP fund. We would put $3 billion more into \nLIHEAP, which helps, by the way, not only low-income families and \nsenior citizens in the wintertime in cold-weather States, but it helps \nother families in States where the weather gets to be 110 degrees.\n  As I mentioned earlier, in this great country, the wealthiest country \nin the history of the world, we must be embarrassed that we have large \nnumbers of people who literally go hungry, who don't have enough food. \nThat number is growing. I know Senator Harkin, among others, has called \nfor a significant increase in the Food Stamp Program. That is exactly \nwhat we should be doing. This amendment would provide $5 billion for \nfood stamps to make sure millions of families with kids have enough \nfood to sustain them.\n  Lastly, this amendment would provide $3.8 billion to allow the \nspecial supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants, and \nChildren, the WIC Program, to provide nutritious food to over 4 million \nfamilies. Kids whose mothers have good nutrition and good prenatal \nexperience, obviously, will do better in life. We want to make sure the \nWIC Program has the resources they need.\n  So, ultimately, what this amendment is about is pretty simple: We say \nthat in a time when millions of Americans, low- and moderate-income \npeople, are in need, it is the obligation and the right of the U.S. \nGovernment to reach out and address those serious problems facing the \nmiddle-class and working families of our Nation. And at a time when the \nwealthiest people in this country have never had it so good and at the \nsame time have been given huge tax breaks by the Bush administration, \nwe say it is appropriate to rescind those tax breaks in order to help \nmillions of people in need. That is what this amendment is about. It \ncalls for a fundamental change in national priorities, and it moves \nthis country in a very different and, I think, more moral direction. I \nlook forward to the support of my colleagues for this amendment that we \nwill offer as part of the budget debate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1699-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1699-S1700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THANKING SENATORS AND STAFF\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to thank the many \nSenators and staff who worked on this sweeping consumer protection \nreform. This is going to mean so much for so many children across this \ncountry. It is going to make a difference, and we are really never \ngoing to know it.\n  I can tell you from the parents I have met who have had to deal with \ntheir kids ingesting Aqua Dot that morphed into a date-rape drug, or \nanother whose child swallowed a charm that was 39-percent lead, those \nmothers came to the Capitol because they did not want it to happen to \nanyone else. Today, we told them we are listening to them, and we are \nmaking a difference in the lives of families throughout the country.\n  The difference started with the Commerce Committee and the very good \nstaff we have on that committee. Before I acknowledge them, I wish to \nacknowledge my own staff.\n  I am so proud of the work they did. Tamara Fucile took this issue on \nas a personal matter. Her children actually had some of the Thomas the \nTrain sets. I cannot tell you to how many hearings she carried those \ntrains, chewed on by her own children, and I would hold them up to show \nSenators this was a real thing. I thank Tamara, and I also thank her \nchildren for parting with their toys, although they are recalled toys.\n  Kate Nilan has been doing a wonderful job with our office working on \nthese consumer issues. In the last week, Kate was very involved in \nmaking sure that our amendment, which banned industries paying for \ntravel, industries that the consumer protection agency is supposed to \nbe regulating, the amendment that Senator Menendez and I did got voted \non in this body 94 to 0. It is because of the good work of Kate Nilan \nin putting that amendment together and working out the procedural \nissues.\n  I thank both of my staff members for their fine work on this bill. \nTamara was also very involved in the lead standard. She originally \nworked with me when we said: Why would we not have a Federal lead \nstandard for toys? Why would we have State-by-State standards and some \nStates do not have them and they are different all over the place? We \nfinally have an aggressive lead standard that basically bans lead in \nchildren's toys, the first year allowing some trace levels and going \ndown after that. That was Tamara's good work.\n  I wish to acknowledge the Commerce staff who worked hard on this bill \nfrom the beginning: David Strickland was there every step of the way, \nas well as Alex Hoehn-Saric for his work, and Price Feland, a member of \nSenator Pryor's staff, as well as staff of Senator Durbin who got \ninvolved in this issue early on when Senator Durbin and I met in \nChicago with a number of the toy retailers and manufacturers that were \nconcerned about this and knew something had to change in Washington in \nterms of the funding for this agency, as well as the tools they have to \ndo their jobs.\n  Senator Nelson has played such an instrumental role when it came to \nmaking sure we had third-party verification, as well as the durable \ngoods standard in the bill; then, of course, Senator Stevens and \nSenator Collins, who assisted in getting bipartisan support for the \nbill, and Senator Pryor, who managed it during this week flawlessly.\n  We are very excited about the change today, that I can go home \ntonight and tell my 12-year-old daughter--who, I have to tell you, was \nrather embarrassed about this whole thing when her mom was involved \nwhen it was about SpongeBob SquarePants, but when the Barbies started \ngetting recalled, she came into the kitchen and said: Mom, this is \nreally getting serious. So I am going to be able to go home today and \ntell her we did something good in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to celebrate the life of a woman \nwho has greatly affected the lives of so many throughout the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky, Mrs. Frances Gaddie Clinkscales. For 78 \nyears, Mrs. Clinkscales loved and invested wholeheartedly in everyone \nshe met.\n  Known to those around her as ``Miss Frances,'' Mrs. Clinkscales was \nan inspiration. Her time was devoted to caring for individuals, \npredominantly through her role as a nurse. She graduated from Durham \nHigh School in Campbellsville, KY, in 1949 and continued her education \nat Howard University in Washington, DC, receiving her degree in \nnursing. Thus began her dedication to caring for others.\n  Mrs. Clinkscales served at North Point Hospital in Long Island, NY, \nbefore returning to Ft. Knox, KY, to work at the Ireland Army Hospital, \nwhere she served the military community for 31 years. Mrs. Clinkscales \nspent her time loving those around her, not only through her nursing \ncareer but for decades after. Her devotion to her faith was expressed \nthroughout every aspect of her life. As a community and civic leader, \nshe worked to assure Taylor County and central Kentucky was a quality \nplace for everyone to live.\n  Her participation in a plethora of organizations only contributed to \nthe love she spread. She was a member of the Campbellsville City \nCouncil, Greater Campbellsville United, and held long terms of service \non the Lake Cumberland Development Board, Habitat for Humanity, and the \nCampbellsville Family Resource and Youth Services Council.\n  Along with service to organizations such as these, Mrs. Clinkscales \nspent many of her later years fighting for patients receiving dialysis. \nIn June 2007, Mrs. Clinkscales suffered from complete kidney failure \nand underwent dialysis. Her treatment was conducted at the Taylor \nCounty Dialysis Center; a facility that she was instrumental in \nopening. Mrs. Clinkscales's commitment to organizations like these and \nthe people she worked with and loved exemplified her genuine care for \nthe community.\n  Regretfully, on February 27, 2008, the Commonwealth of Kentucky lost \nthis most respected member of our State; yet her legacy will not go \nuntold. Mrs. Clinkscales's constant love for those around her will \ncontinue to resonate. Her infamous words to anyone she met--``pretty, \npretty'' and ``I love you''--will be remembered. Mrs. Clinkscales \ngenuinely dedicated her life and service to her faith and her town. She \nleaves behind her granddaughter and her grandson-in-law, LaQuita and \nChristopher Goodin; two grandsons; and seven nieces.\n  Mrs. Clinkscales served as an important citizen of Kentucky for \ndecades. This service is assuredly not to be forgotten and will carry \non as an example to all. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nFrances Gaddie Clinkscales for her dedicated service, her example to \nthe community, and in honoring the legacy she has left us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1700-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1700-S1701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ENFORCEMENT-ONLY IMMIGRATION BILLS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I regret to see that the Republicans are \nat it again--offering unworkable solutions to complex immigration \nissues that only make the problem worse and cater to the basest \ninstincts of the far right fringe.\n  For 7 years, Republicans have failed to fix the broken immigration \nsystem, offering only empty rhetoric and unrealistic proposals. \nDemocrats recognize that our country deserves better--we need to \noverhaul our broken system, uphold our values as a nation of \nimmigrants, ensure our national security and protect American jobs.\n  It is unacceptable to have 12 million people in our country who are \noutside the system. Our illegal immigration problem has skyrocketed \nbecause employers know they can get away with breaking the law and \nabusing illegal workers. And the past 7 years have shown us that \ndeportation alone is not the solution.\n  It is time to stop coddling employers who break our laws and undercut \nAmerican workers. It is time to make sure employers follow our \nimmigration and labor laws so that the law is respected, wages are \nfair, working conditions are decent, workers' rights are valued, and \nunscrupulous employers are punished. And it is time to treat immigrants \nwith the dignity and respect that they deserve.\n  I have to ask why the Republicans have failed to address these very \nreal problems. They controlled Congress for 6 years. They have occupied \nthe White House for almost 8 years. Where have they been this whole \ntime?\n  I can tell you where they have been. They have been cynically using \nthe immigration problem to stir up local resentment and fear to divert \nattention away from their inaction. They have vilified immigrants, \nespecially Latinos, making them the new unwanted class, the new \nuntouchables. They have tried to convince Americans that declaring \nEnglish the official language will solve our problems, when in fact \nEnglish is already our national language, but the Government sometimes \nneeds to use other languages to respond to health care and law \nenforcement emergencies. They have engaged in targeted attacks on \npeople who are contributing to our communities.\n  I urge them to drop their rhetorical attacks that cater to the \nextreme right wing of their party. I urge them to listen to the \nAmerican people, who want real solutions. Americans understand that \nimmigration is a complex challenge that requires a comprehensive \nsolution. They know that we need to address the situation of the 12 \nmillion illegal immigrants in the country, requiring them to register \nwith the Government or face deportation; that we need to deport those \nwho have committed serious crimes or represent a threat to our national \nsecurity; that we need to meaningfully go after employers who flaunt \nthe law by hiring those who are not authorized to work; and that we \nneed to ensure that American workers are not harmed by U.S. immigration \npolicy.\n  We can do this. We can uphold the rule of law. And we can do it \nwithout sacrificing our proud tradition of immigration.\n  The American people understand the issues. Why can't the Republicans?\n  Instead, they are proposing to deny local communities funding for \ncommunity policing because such communities recognize that working with \nimmigrant communities helps combat crime and lawlessness. They would \nforce all American workers to prove eligibility to work based on a \ndatabase that is so flawed it will result in denial of employment to \nmillions of authorized workers, including American citizens. They would \nimpose jail sentences on illegal immigrants who have not committed \ncrimes, further overloading U.S. prisons. Those are just a few of the \nunworkable proposals they have introduced today, blithely ignoring the \nuntold harm such ideas will cause to the American public.\n  This Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform in 2006. That \nbill faced head on the many aspects of the immigration system that are \nbroken. It recognized that it is impractical to deport 12 million \nillegal immigrants. And it is undesirable--the majority of these people \nare playing a key role in the U.S. economy, taking care of our \nchildren, mowing our lawns, and harvesting our crops.\n  But that legislation also recognized that the Government must seize \ncontrol of our immigration system. Border enforcement that is both \neffective and humane must be implemented. Employers who knowingly break \nthe law and hire illegal immigrants must be punished. By hiring people \nwho are not authorized to work, these bad actors are also violating \nlabor protections in place to protect American workers.\n  The 2006 bill failed in the House, where the Republican majority \ninstead chose to grandstand the issue and push an enforcement-only \nbill. Now we are seeing our Republican colleagues in the Senate do the \nsame.\n  Let's stop the sham. Let's negotiate a real solution. Let's go back \nto the table, roll up our sleeves, and give the American public what it \ndeserves: an immigration system that works, that is orderly, and that \nensures that the system works for Americans. Anything\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nless is unworthy of the people we represent, and that is why I oppose \nthis effort launched today by my Republican colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1701-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On the afternoon of December 4, 2007, 30-year-old Gilbert Aguilar was \nwalking to a friend's house in Yucaipa, CA, when he was accosted by \nfour Caucasian men. According to a witness, one of the men called \nAguilar a racial slur, and after a brief exchange of words Aguilar \ncontinued on his way. Later that night, Aguilar and two friends, Joshua \nMorales and Ryan Couture, passed by the area where the confrontation \nhad taken place. The four were still there waiting for Aguilar. \nAccording to a witness, one of the men in Aguilar's group threw a punch \nat one of the Caucasian men, provoking Christopher Fulmer to pull out a \ngun. A witness says Fulmer fired two or three rounds, hitting Couture \nin the arm and fatally wounding Morales. Fulmer, who has a swastika \ntattooed on his chest, will stand trial on counts of murder, attempted \nmurder, and a hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1701-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SCHOOL SOCIAL WORK WEEK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to publicly recognize School Social Work Week, which is taking \nplace March 2-8, 2008. This important week honors school social \nworkers, who play a vital role in the development of our young \nstudents.\n  My wife Barbara was a school social worker for more than 18 years, so \nI understand the critical importance of the services they provide to \nchildren, families, and schools. Not only do school social workers \nprovide family and student counseling, crisis intervention, family \nadvocacy, truancy prevention, assistance with basic needs, and \ncommunity referrals for long-term needs, but they also assist already \noverwhelmed and underfunded schools in finding ways to assist their \n``at risk'' students. The presence of school social workers has helped \nincrease attendance rates, academic performance, appropriate behavior, \nand parental involvement.\n  I believe the best way we can honor school social workers is by \nproviding them with the resources they need to accomplish their jobs \nand serve our students. Children often must seek help at school for \nproblems they are experiencing personally, as well as at home. Experts \nnote that early identification and intervention can be beneficial in \nhelping distressed young people cope with and handle the problems in \ntheir lives. Without school social workers and the wonderful services \nthey provide, far too many children's needs would remain unaddressed.\n  For these reasons and countless others, proudly I stand today and \napplaud the wonderful work of these dedicated individuals. I am pleased \nthat their tireless efforts are being publicly celebrated. It is with \ngreat honor that I share their impressive commitment to helping and \neducating our youth with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1701-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECORD CORRECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize a nonprofit \norganization that has been making a difference in the lives of Mid-\nSouth and Delta small business men and women for the last 10 years, \nalt.Consulting. Founded in 1998, alt.Consulting has been providing \nsmall business owners and entrepreneurs with the tools and advice \nneeded to build their businesses and provide jobs in a region of the \ncountry in need of a boost.\n  When one reads their mission statement, you quickly gets a sense of \nwhat makes alt.Consulting different. It reads as follows:\n\n       alt.Consulting works with local business owners and \n     entrepreneurs in rural Delta and minority communities to \n     examine, diagnose, start and rebuild businesses. We provide \n     tailored support, skill building, and access to capital to \n     enhance business performance leading to growth and self-\n     defined success.\n       We act on our ethical and social principles, empowering \n     entrepreneurs to overcome racial, gender, socioeconomic and \n     geographic barriers. We believe this leads to vibrant, \n     entrepreneur friendly and just communities.\n       Through its comprehensive, affordable assistance to small \n     businesses, alt.Consulting raises the standard of living by \n     enabling profitability for new and growing businesses and \n     preventing business failures. We demonstrate the \n     contributions of healthy small businesses to growing \n     communities with more jobs, wealth building opportunities and \n     a stronger tax base.\n\n  With offices in Pine Bluff, AR, and Memphis, TN, alt.Consulting has \ngone into some of the most impoverished communities in Arkansas, \nMississippi, and Tennessee and provided the support and assistance \nneeded to get businesses off the ground. The average poverty rate in \ntheir target market is a staggering 24 percent. Average unemployment is \n8 percent. Even more daunting is that less than 13 percent of the \npopulation has a bachelor's degree in the areas they work.\n  Due to their methodology, though, alt.Consulting has been making a \nbig difference in the Mid-South and the Delta since its inception. In \n2006, 195 businesses received one-on-one assistance. As a result, \nalt.Consulting was responsible for 75 new jobs in a region of the \ncountry that had been experiencing negative growth. Moreover, 10 \nbusinesses on the verge of failure were saved which protected 700 \nexisting jobs. The sales growth of companies they assisted resulted in \n$12.7 million in new economic activity. And their technical assistance \nresulted in $430,000 in SBA community express loans to 39 businesses. \nThis gave those existing businesses the working capital to grow and \nreach new customers.\n  alt.Consulting is also working with selected communities to train \nbusiness specialists to replicate their services at the local level. \nThanks to support from U.S. Department of Agriculture, the rural \ncommunity development initiative program, and the Enterprise \nCorporation of the Delta, they have launched new, nonprofit \nmicroenterprise programs to provide continuous resources to rural \ncommunities throughout the Mid-South.\n  One such effort, the Pine Bluff Entrepreneurship Collaborative, was \nstarted in June 2006 and was comprised of 47 community leaders. Their \ngoals were to create an equity pool to start and expand businesses, \nidentify local resources for small businesses, make health insurance \naffordable for small businesses, and develop marketing and training \nworkshops.\n  Youth is also a major focus for alt.Consulting. Recognizing that \nyouth entrepreneurship builds a lifetime of opportunities, \nalt.Consulting works with partners to help ``at-risk'' youth start and \nbuild their own small businesses. Through one-on-one mentoring and \nassistance, alt.Consulting has worked to turn their young ideas into a \nreality.\n  As a native of Helena, AR, who grew up in the heart of the Delta, I \nam proud of the impact that alt.Consulting is making in communities \nthroughout my State. They serve as an example of what we can do when we \nfocus on what\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\nwe can be, not what we don't have. This program, and others like it, \nallows us to build on our strengths, to enable our citizens to make a \ndecent living, to encourage our young people to stay at home, and to \nultimately build the tax base and enhance the quality of life for us \nall.\n  I commend alt.Consulting on their vision and hard work. I am honored \nto recognize them on 10 great years, and I look forward to seeing the \nfruits of their labor for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1702-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING KELLY'S CLOSET\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Kelly's Closet \nof Waterford, ME, a woman-owned small business that has helped reinvent \na traditional product in a new and environmentally friendly way.\n  When Kelly Wells founded Kelly's Closet in 2001, there were few \noptions for parents looking for cost-effective, sanitary, and \nenvironmentally friendly diapers for their children. Like any good \nenterprising businesswoman, Ms. Wells identified this underserved \nmarket and then moved to supply the demand. At first, Ms. Wells's \nventure failed to attract the customers for which she had hoped and no \norders arrived for 4 months. Despite these early difficulties, Ms. \nWells persevered, and eventually her tenacity paid off. The orders that \nhad started off slow rose exponentially, and her business had grown to \nsuch an extent that the most significant problem she and her two \nemployees now face is keeping the ``shelves'' of their virtual store \nstocked with the company's products. Today, Kelly's Closet combines the \nInternet's tremendous marketing platform with good old-fashioned Maine \nfriendliness to create a customer experience second to none.\n  Kelly's Closet offers many different diaper and diaper liner options \nin a wide variety of fibers, from flannel, fleece, and organic cotton, \nto more unique choices like rice paper and bamboo. Ms. Wells's notably \nwide variety of merchandise is easy to identify with catchy names like \n``Rumpsters,'' ``Knickernappies,'' and ``Tiny Tush.'' Kelly's Closet \nalso sells additional products from other trusted and well-known \ncompanies, including accessories for strollers, diaper bags, and other \nchildren's apparel, such as swim diapers for the summer and baby boots \nand shoes for any time of year.\n  In addition to a varied selection, Kelly's Closet also helps to \neducate parents about cloth diapers. For parents, making the right \ndiaper choice can sometimes be a confusing process. To help these \nparents, Ms. Wells publishes a newsletter and has a special easy-to-use \nsection on her Web site that is dedicated to answering parents' \nfrequently asked questions about diaper fabrics, size, and care, as \nwell as the history of the cloth diaper movement. These additions to \nher Web site ensure that consumers are well informed before they make \ntheir first purchase.\n  Maine is a State known for its innovators and entrepreneurs, and \nKelly Wells is a member of that proud group. Her perseverance, \ntenacity, and business acumen are a testament to what a small business \ncan accomplish. In 8 years, Ms. Wells has helped transform the way \nparents purchase diapers and has expanded their possibilities to a \ngreat degree. I wish Kelly Wells and all the employees of Kelly's \nCloset continued success as they grow, innovate, and expand their \nbusiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1702-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:25 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1084.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 6892 Main Street in Gloucester, Virginia, as the \n``Congresswoman Jo Ann S. Davis Post Office''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on October 6, 2007, the people of \nVirginia's First Congressional District lost one of its most respected \nand admired leaders, a dedicated Member of Congress and loyal friend, \nRepresentative Jo Ann Davis.\n  Today, I am proud to have Senator Jim Webb join me in introducing a \nbill to honor our dear colleague. This legislation would designate the \nUnited States Post Office at 6892 Main Street in Gloucester, Virginia, \nas the ``Congresswoman Jo Ann S. Davis Post Office.'' Representative \nRobert Wittman has introduced companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Born in North Carolina, Jo Ann Davis attended Hampton Roads Business \nCollege in Virginia and later obtained her real estate license and real \nestate broker's license over the next several years. In 1990, she \nstarted her own company, Jo Ann Davis Realty, and followed this \nsuccessful endeavor with a run for public office in 1997. Serving as a \nDelegate in the Virginia General Assembly for 4 years, Jo Ann Davis \nbecame the first Republican woman to serve Virginia in the U.S. \nCongress after winning her election in 2000.\n  Representative Davis was a relentless champion for the needs of the \nFirst District. It was my privilege to work with her on many matters, \nranging from national defense to the environment, and in that regard, \nshe worked hard to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay. Also, I \ncommend her diligent leadership in the removal of the James River \nReserve Fleet from Newport News. From her support for the Rappahannock \nRiver Valley National Wildlife Refuge to her concern with the \npreservation of Dragon Run or providing funding for oyster restoration, \nshe always put the quality of Virginia's environment above politics.\n  With sincere passion and concern, Representative Davis worked to \nimprove our Nation's armed services and the lives of the men and women \nwho bravely answer the call to duty. She provided strong representation \nfor the communities in and surrounding the Naval Surface Warfare Center \nat Dahlgren and the Marine Corps base at Quantico, ensuring that these \nfacilities continue to make important contributions to protecting the \nnation and to the economic foundations of their respective areas. Her \ninitiative to increase the life insurance benefit paid to survivors of \nmilitary members and her advocacy on behalf of the rights and benefits \nof Federal employees will continue to be appreciated in the years \nahead.\n  I have always admired Representative Davis for her strong convictions \nand the tenacity that she brought to bear in acting on them. She fought \na courageous struggle against cancer, and I will miss her insights and \nher friendship in our Virginia Congressional Delegation.\n  I am pleased to offer this small token of recognition and gratitude \nfor someone who has given so much to the Commonwealth and her country.\n  I close with a personal note that we both shared interests in \nequestrian activities. There is an old English saying that ``the \noutside of the horse is good for the inside of the man.'' As an avid, \naccomplished rider, she often quipped with me that the saying applies \nequally to a woman. She loved the noble horse.\n  I join with my colleagues from the Commonwealth and from the entire \nU.S. Congress in expressing my deepest sympathies to her husband, her \ntwo sons, and her extended family. They remain in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2726. A bill to amend the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to \nrequire the Secretary of Agriculture to help offset the costs of \nintrastate transportation, storage, and distribution of bonus \ncommodities provided to States and food assistance agencies under the \nemergency food assistance program; to the Committee on Agiculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a crisis that is \nfacing a growing number of Americans every day. That crisis is hunger. \nIn this country, as food prices continue to rise, more and more \nAmerican families find themselves desperately in need of help just to \nput food on the table for themselves and their families.\n  In 2006 alone, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, reported \nthat 35.5 million Americans did not have enough money or resources to \nget food for at least some period during the year. This figure was an \nincrease of 400,000 over 2005 and an increase of 2.3 million since \n2000. And, with the fragile state of our economy, we can only assume \nthat these figures for 2007 and 2008 will be even more disturbing. The \nonly recourse for these millions of people is to turn to Federal food \nassistance programs and emergency food banks for their basic food \nneeds.\n  Unfortunately, as recent articles in national publications like the \nUSA Today and the New York Times have highlighted, there is a critical \nlack of food inventories available in local food pantries across the \ncountry. Rising demand, sharp drops in Federal supplies of excess \ncommodities, and declining donations have forced food banks to cut back \non rations, and in some cases, close their doors. In short, America's \nfood banks are facing critical shortages now.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, I had a hand in helping to create a new farm bill. This bill, \nas passed by the Senate, will help food banks by providing additional \nannual funding to shore up food bank supplies. But, as we continue to \nconference this bill with the House, there are further steps we can \ntake to help ensure that food banks can continue to fulfill their \nmission.\n  That is why today I am pleased to join with Senator Snowe to \nintroduce the Bonus TEFAP Assistance Act of 2008. This act will provide \ncritical support needed to ensure food assistance agencies, already in \ndesperate need of supplies, can take full advantage of the \ndistributions of bonus food commodities supplied by USDA through the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program, TEFAP. By helping to offset the \nintrastate storage, transportation, and distribution costs the food \nassistance agencies incur to distribute these bonus food surpluses, the \nact will ensure the commodities will be able to reach the greatest \nnumber of needy individuals.\n  The Emergency Food Assistance Program began in 1981 as a temporary \nprogram with dual purposes; it was intended to help reduce the Federal \nfood inventories and storage costs while also assisting the needy. \nBecause of the program's success in helping distribute food to those in \nneed, in 1988, after much of the Federal inventory was depleted, the \nHunger Prevention Act authorized funds to be appropriated to purchase \nfood for TEFAP.\n  Under current-day TEFAP, the USDA provides States and food assistance \nagencies with food commodities bought specifically for the program and \nwith funding to help cover distributing agencies' intrastate storage, \nhandling, and distribution costs. In addition, when available, USDA \nprovides any excess food not needed to fulfill other\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nprogram requirements to States for allocation to local food assistance \nagencies. This excess food is otherwise known as ``bonus TEFAP.'' \nUnfortunately, while the USDA generously distributes these bonus TEFAP \ncommodities to the States, many of the State and food assistance \nagencies are unable to accept the bonus TEFAP commodities because they \ndo not have the resources to store, transport, or distribute them.\n  The Bonus TEFAP Assistance Act of 2008 that I am introducing today \nwith Senator Snowe alleviates this problem by providing offsetting \nfunds to recipient agencies to assist with the costs of storing, \ntransporting, and distributing bonus TEFAP commodities. The funds \nprovided through this legislation will help to provide more food to \nthose in need through food banks, food pantries, emergency shelters, \nsoup kitchens, and other organizations that directly provide these \nresources to the public.\n  To solve the problem the inadequacy of local resources causes, the \nbill authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to use existing funds \ngranted under section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1935. \nCurrently, section 32 funds are used to fund child nutrition programs \nand other programs to support the farm sector at the discretion of the \nSecretary. Through this legislation, a small portion of section 32 \nfunds would be allocated to each eligible recipient agency in the \nlesser amount of $0.05 per pound or $0.05 per dollar value of bonus \nTEFAP commodities. With this modest increase in funding, the States and \ntheir food assistance agencies will be able to accept more food \ndistributions from the USDA through TEFAP, benefitting the many low-\nincome recipients who rely on the program for emergency food and \nnutrition assistance.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join Senator Snowe and me in ensuring \nthat the States and food assistance agencies can accept the available \nexcess commodity foods the USDA provides under the Emergency Assistance \nFood Program. Food assistance agencies are in dire need of funds, food, \nand supplies and we owe it to them to ensure that they can take full \nadvantage of every opportunity to serve those in our nation who are in \ndesperate need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmodify Medicare physician reimbursement policies to ensure a future \nphysician workforce, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, you don't have to be an expert in health \ncare policy to know our health care system is in need of reform. Today, \nwe spend over $2 trillion on health care, almost $7,500 per person. In \n10 years, national health care expenditures are expected to reach $4.3 \ntrillion, or $13,000 per person, which would comprise 19.5 percent of \nour gross domestic product. Clearly, this rate of increase is \nunsustainable. We must work together to develop creative solutions that \nwill change the way we deliver health care. The goal should be to allow \nhealth care providers to develop treatment plans based on what is in \nthe best interest of the patient. But the current system under which we \npay physicians neither puts patients first nor reduces costs.\n  A decade ago, instead of creating a mechanism that changed the way \nphysicians deliver care, Congress attempted to curb rising health care \ncosts through an arbitrary annual expenditure cap on physician \npayments. And what has the result been? Physicians have seen their \nreimbursements lag far behind their costs, in Texas and nationally--a \n15-percent gap. In order to recoup lost revenue, physicians often \nincreased the number of patients they were seeing per day, meaning they \nwere spending less and less time with their patients, lowering the \nquality of care delivered. Moreover, we are starting to see problems \nwith beneficiary access. At an increasing rate, beneficiaries across \nthe country are reporting difficulties in scheduling appointments with \ntheir physicians.\n  But declining reimbursements are also influencing the development of \nfuture generations of physicians--especially in primary care--as there \nis a disincentive to enter the profession or an incentive to forgo \nprimary care for more lucrative specialties. This is especially \nalarming, as the Medicare population grows and many physicians will be \nretiring. For example, my State of Texas already has a below-average \nphysician-to-population ratio, while 39 percent of practicing \nphysicians are already over 50.\n  There are over 30 health care reform plans floating around inside and \noutside of Congress. Few of these plans address the fundamental \nquestion: What good is coverage without access to that coverage?\n  If we are serious about changing our health care system, we need to \nstart with changing the way we pay physicians--that would send a strong \nmessage not only about the need for better quality care but also the \nneed to ensure a future generation of American physicians.\n  I am pleased to introduce the Ensuring the Future Physician Workforce \nAct of 2008. This bill will provide positive reimbursement updates for \nproviders; eliminate the ineffectual expenditure cap; increase \nincentives for physician data reporting; facilitate adoption of Health \nInformation Technology, HIT, by addressing cost and \nlegislative barriers; educate and empower physicians and beneficiaries \nin relation to Medicare spending and benefits usage; and study ways to \nrealign the way Medicare pays for health care.\n\n  Every few years, Congress goes through the same rituals of trying to \nfix the physician reimbursement mechanism. First, CMS tells us the \nexpenditure cap requires Medicare physician reimbursements to be cut by \na certain percent. Next, Congress struggles to find a way to prevent \nthis cut, knowing how harmful it would be. Yet delaying this cut is \nextremely expensive. Congress then swears that this is the last time \nthey will go through this process and that it must come up with a \ncomprehensive fix. Ultimately, Congress never seems able to fix the \nproblem. This bill stops the charade, resets the baseline for the next \nyear and a half, and then eliminates the expenditure cap thereafter. \nRather than pretending like we are going to adhere to an arbitrary cap \nof $80, for example, only to spend more later, this bill puts up front \nthe true cost that we are really going to spend $100 or $101. The \neffect on spending is the same, but physicians and beneficiaries have \ncertainty.\n  If Congress fails to act, Texas physicians will lose $860 million \nbetween July 2008 and December 2009, which is a cut of $18,000 to each \nTexas physician. That figure balloons to $16.5 billion by 2016 due to \nnearly a decade of scheduled cuts.\n  Two widely identified ways of moving toward lower costs and better \nquality stem from the collection of health care data and the \nimplementation of health information technology.\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\n  First, increasing incentives for the reporting of data will improve \nour ability to assess how we deliver care and the level of that care. \nIn this bill we go beyond general reporting and focus on the most \nexpensive diseases. The director of the Congressional Budget Office, \nPeter Orszag, likes to ask the paradoxical question: ``How can the best \nmedical care in the world cost twice as much as the best medical care \nin the world?'' It does because we deliver care in vastly different \nways and at vastly different costs. By focusing our data collection \nefforts, we will better understand how these differences occur.\n  Second, there are few who would argue with the notion that \nimplementation of HIT is beneficial from a cost and quality \nperspective; HIT provides transparency, efficiency, portability, \nsafety, and reductions in duplicative and wasteful procedures. However, \nvarious cost and legislative barriers have inhibited widespread \nadoption. There is a large cost associated with implementing HIT \nbecause of the cost of hardware, software, and time needed to train \nstaff. Additionally, there is a disincentive to invest in HIT because \nthe Department of Health and Human Services has yet to finalize its \nstandards. Providers are stuck in neutral.\n  Under the current regulatory environment, doctors have limited \nability to accept hardware, software, or help in training from \nhospitals. Not only does this unfairly harm patients in these \npractices, it negatively impacts community health. This bill provides a \nsafe harbor to that regulation but maintains the spirit of the law by \nallowing hospitals to help physicians in their implementation of HIT--\neither in the purchasing of hardware or software or in training--as \nlong as these hospitals do not restrict the physician's \ninteroperability, clinical practice, or referral system for their own \nfinancial benefit. This bill provides the incentive to voluntarily \nimplement HIT and commonsense regulations that move communities into \nthe 21st century. Once beneficiaries begin to see the benefits HIT will \nhave on the quality of their care and in their wallets, providers will \nnot be able to ignore the demand.\n  Finally, this bill would provide comparative reports to physicians on \ntheir billings and to beneficiaries on their usage of services. \nPhysicians want to do the right thing for their patients, but we need \nto ensure that they have the tools necessary to appropriately deliver \nthat care. When physicians look at these reports and see how they \ncompare to other providers in their area or across the Nation, they \nwill take that report seriously and evaluate why their practices \ndiffer. Similarly, beneficiaries will have a tool to evaluate their \nlevel of care and a tool to engage the physician-patient relationship.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that the path Medicare is on is \nunsustainable. So far, our only recourse has been to prolong the \ninevitable collapse, rather than reforming the doomed system. This bill \nis a small step toward righting the Medicare ship, and with it, \nAmerica's health care system as a whole. It is time we move forward in \nhealth care and help create a system that provides the best care at the \nbest prices. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill \nand ensuring a better future for American health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Craig, Mr. Alexander, and Mrs. \n        Dole):\n  S. 2730. A bill to facilitate the participation of private capital \nand skills in the strategic, economic, and environmental development of \na diverse portfolio of clean energy and energy efficiency technologies \nwithin the United States, to facilitate the commercialization and \nmarket penetration of the technologies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a report by the Energy Information \nAdministration released this week confirms that we have made real, \nmeasurable progress in our efforts to reduce our dependence upon \nforeign oil. The best estimating group in the world, the Energy \nInformation Administration of America, made this determination. I know \nthe occupant of the chair will be interested, because what we have done \nin the past 3 years with the passage of three major pieces of energy \nlegislation is, for the first time in modern history, we have reduced \nthe amount of consumption of crude oil from overseas to America by \nAmericans here at home. In other words, during the next 30 years, we \nwill finally get to the point where, instead of that importation going \nup, it will begin to reverse itself and start coming down.\n  Now, the bad news for Americans is you can't do that overnight, but \nwe have done it with the passage of the CAFE standards, meaning smaller \ncars in the future for everyone, and with the passage of two or three \nother big bills, we have made a lasting impact on how much we use of \nthis dread imported product that we call crude oil.\n  Over the last several years, as I indicated, Congress has passed \nthree major pieces of legislation: the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the \nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, and the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act. We put these together, and the estimates are that as a \nresult of this action I just spoke about, more than 2 million barrels \nof oil per day will be saved by America by 2030. In addition, our \naction will lead to--and get this--5.3 billion fewer metric tons of \nenergy-related carbon dioxide emissions by that time--the equivalent of \n71,500 megawatt coal-burning electric plants. Imagine that. By reducing \nthat amount of oil consumed, we will reduce the amount of carbon \ndioxide by 5.3 billion fewer metric tons used.\n\n  Nevertheless, our work is not nearly done. I have been encouraged by \nthe growth of clean energy technologies, but I have come to believe \nthat in the long run, we will fall far short of the amount of financial \nresources necessary to move these projects along at a fast enough pace. \nConsider that nearly half of our current electric generation fleet is \nover 30 years old. Nearly a third of our overall generation comes from \ncoal-fired plants, the majority of which are not equipped with emission \ncontrol technology. Yet investor-owner utilities are not large enough \nto carry several multibillion dollar projects, and competitive \nelectricity markets don't have an effective mechanism to encourage \ninvestment in larger, expensive new capacity. I come to the floor to \npropose at least a partial solution to this challenge.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to establish a clean energy \ninvestment bank. This bank will be a government corporation, modeled \nafter the Export-Import Bank, designed to promote investment in \ndomestic energy projects. I am pleased to have a number of cosponsors, \nincluding Senators Landrieu, Murkowski, Martinez, Bunning, Craig, \nAlexander, and Dole. I haven't worked very hard because I haven't had \ntime, but I think I can get many more Senators to be cosponsors as \nwell.\n  According to some analysis, over $350 billion will be needed over the \nnext 15 years to meet our increased demands for energy. Not only do we \nface the challenge of needing to get more power on line, we also are \ntrying to do it in a way that results in less pollution. By investing \nin clean energy technology, we will reap enormous benefits when it \ncomes to energy, economic, environmental, and national security.\n  Investors have shown a willingness to support clean energy \ntechnology. A United Nations report recently revealed that investment \nin sustainable energy has nearly doubled since 2005. Additionally, \nprivate sector research and development has risen to over $16 billion. \nYet the growth we have seen primarily comes from equity investment and \nventure capital, not long-term debt financing.\n  The clean energy industry faces unique challenges. Unlike traditional \nfossil fuel energy projects, which are able to more easily secure long-\nterm debt financing, clean energy markets have a greater level of risk \nboth economically and technically. That is why the certainty provided \nby Federal Government support would be beneficial. Our goal moving \nforward should be greater increases for all types of clean energy \ngeneration projects through secure financing.\n  Right now, we are lacking an institution able to undertake this kind \nof activity and fill this gap. The clean energy investment bank that \nwill be created by the legislation which I introduce today has a real \nchance of filling that gap.\n  The bank will engage in investment activities to encourage long term \ndebt\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\nfinancing of clean energy projects. It will take responsibility for \nmanagement of the Department of Energy's title 17 loan guarantee \nprogram, and have the authority to offer loans, insurance products, and \ntake positions in commercially viable projects.\n  The clean energy investment bank will be a governmental corporation, \nwith a bipartisan board of directors that will have significant \nautonomy in choosing the projects they believe are most worthy.\n  In this legislation, we do not seek to tell the bank exactly which \nspecific types of projects to support. Our requirement is that the \nprojects provide clean energy and that the bank considers a reasonable \ndiversity of projects, technologies, and energy sectors. We give \nflexibility to the bank's board of directors and management so that \nthey can provide support for the latest technologies, some of which may \nnot even be under consideration right now.\n  The sole mission of the clean energy investment bank will be to \nadvance the deployment of clean energy technologies. The bank will be \nstaffed with investment professionals who will make informed decisions \non loans, loan guarantees, and other investments.\n  Initially, we anticipate that the clean energy investment bank will \nbe given a similar level of financial support as the Export-Import \nBank. The Export-Import Bank assists financing the export of U.S. goods \nand services to international markets. By enabling companies in our \ncountry to turn exports into sales overseas, the bank helps create jobs \nand ensures a level playing field.\n  Export-Import provides a worthy and useful service to our economy and \nto growing economies overseas. Last year, Congress provided $68 million \nto the bank to subsidize its costs, and another $78 million for \nadministrative expenses. But we must ask ourselves: shouldn't domestic \nenergy diversification receive at least as much support as U.S. \ncompanies investing overseas?\n  The bank will be financed in part through the appropriations process, \nbut in greater measure through a revolving fund. The goal would be for \nthe bank to be self-funding through its investment of activity as soon \nas possible.\n  Congress will soon be embarking on a debate about climate change. It \nis simply a reality that much of that discussion will largely fall on \npartisan lines. Senators have diverse views about global climate change \nand the proposed solutions to handle it.\n  The clean energy investment bank, however, is something that we all \ncan support. It gives us a chance to make real progress in a bipartisan \nway on our shared goals of increasing energy production and reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Despite the odds, we have demonstrated that \nwhen we work together to find common ground on energy, we can succeed \nand pass legislation that will help make America stronger. In times of \neconomic uncertainty, we need pro-growth strategies that incentivize \nlarge private investment, not complex regulatory structures that \nincrease the cost of energy. The clean energy investment bank is such a \npro-growth proposal that stands tall on its own.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle on this bill, and I hope the Senate will adopt it. We have made \ngreat strides in recent years to diversify our energy supply, but we \nshould not rest on our laurels.

Res. 475\n\n       Whereas Iowa State University of Science and Technology was \n     established by the Iowa General Assembly on March 22, 1858, \n     as the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm in response \n     to the State of Iowa's desire to provide higher education \n     opportunities to farm families and working classes in Iowa, \n     predating the passage of the Federal Morrill Act by 4 years;\n       Whereas on September 3, 1862, Iowa became the first State \n     in the Nation to accept the terms and conditions of the \n     Morrill Act creating the land-grant system of colleges and \n     universities;\n       Whereas the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm, known \n     today as Iowa State University of Science and Technology \n     (Iowa State), received Iowa's land-grant charter on March 29, \n     1864, making it one of the first land-grant institutions in \n     the Nation;\n       Whereas Iowa State was a pioneer in all 3 parts of the \n     land-grant mission, including--(1) access to all, regardless \n     of race, gender or social class, being the first land-grant \n     institution to be coeducational from its opening, with 16 \n     women in its first class and later students including future \n     suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt, an 1880 graduate, and George \n     Washington Carver, the first African American student, who \n     earned a bachelor's degree in 1894 and a master's degree in \n     1896, and was also the institution's first African American \n     faculty member; (2) practical research, establishing the \n     Nation's first Engineering Experiment Station and domestic \n     economy experimental kitchen, and one of the first \n     agriculture experiment stations;

(2) pioneering work on soybean oil \n     extraction and producing ethanol from corn and other plant \n     materials by Professor Orland Sweeney in the 1930s; (3) the \n     invention of the electronic digital computer in the late \n     1930s by Professor John Atanasoff and graduate student \n     Clifford Berry, whose Atanasoff-Berry Computer was the first \n     to incorporate the 7 basic principles of modern computing; \n     (4) the foundation for the modern plastics industry laid by \n     polyethylene research by Professor Henry Gilman; (5) \n     development of the process still used today to refine pure \n     rare-earth materials, including reactor-grade uranium, by \n     Professor Frank Spedding and Harley Wilhelm, as a result of \n     Iowa State's key role in the Manhattan Project during World \n     War II; (6) development of modern livestock animal genetics \n     by Professor Jay Lush; and (7) the first field-testing of a \n     genetically altered plant (tobacco) in 1987 and genetically \n     altered tree (poplar) in 1989 by Professor Robert Thornburg;\n       Whereas Iowa State hired one of the first permanent campus \n     artists-in-residence, with sculptor Christian Petersen \n     holding that position from 1934 to 1955 and providing \n     hundreds of sculptures and other art objects to the \n     university, whose Art on Campus collection today includes \n     more than 600 major public works of art;\n       Whereas Iowa State has had a technology transfer office \n     since 1935, longer than all but one other university in the \n     Nation, and is acknowledged today as a national leader in \n     putting technology to work, being cited as a ``model of \n     economic development'' and ``licensing powerhouse'' in a 2007 \n     study commissioned by the National Science Foundation;\n       Whereas Iowa State University is today spearheading new \n     advances in science and technology, including new materials, \n     information sciences, green architecture, biological \n     research, and the development of biorenewable fuels and other \n     resources to support the bioeconomy and the Nation's \n     independence from nonrenewable petroleum resources;

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a resolution \nhonoring the legacy of Harriet Ross Tubman, the abolitionist, \nhumanitarian, Union spy, and daughter of Maryland whose selfless \nefforts throughout her lifetime helped hundreds of slaves realize \nfreedom. My resolution supports the goals and ideals of a national day \nof remembrance for this American hero.\n  Araminta Ross was born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland, \naround 1820 and worked as a slave for several families throughout her \nchildhood. Abused and beaten, she suffered a serious head injury that \nwould affect her for the rest of her life. In 1844, she married John \nTubman and took the first name of her mother, Harriet.\n  In 1849, Harriet Tubman escaped to Philadelphia. She launched her \nwork as a ``conductor'' on the Underground Railroad soon after, making \nseveral trips back for family members and friends. Tubman continued to \nrisk capture for more than a decade, delivering enslaved people from \nbondage to freedom in New England and Canada. Referred to as ``Moses'' \nbecause of her courage and sacrifice, she personally led more than a \ndozen expeditions, helping approximately 70 slaves escape. Her efforts \nand extensive network of contacts along the Underground Railroad \nprovided instruction for dozens more slaves to make the journey to \nfreedom. She once stated, ``I never ran my train off track, and I never \nlost a passenger.''\n  In 1859, Harriet Tubman purchased a home for her family in Auburn, \nNew York. While there, she continued her role as an abolitionist, \nmaking several trips to Boston to speak alongside Frederick Douglass \nand others.\n  When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Tubman volunteered. She worked \nfor the Union Army as a nurse, scout, spy, and recruiter, and became \nthe first woman to lead an armed expedition in the war, resulting in \nthe liberation of hundreds of slaves. Traveling through Maryland, South \nCarolina, and Virginia, Harriet Tubman risked disease, capture, and \nphysical injury to support the Union Army.\n  After the war, Harriet Tubman returned to Auburn. She became active \nin the women's suffrage movement and worked alongside Susan B. Anthony \nand Emily Howland. She continued to fight for human dignity, human \nrights, and equal justice throughout her lifetime.\n  In 1896, Harriet Tubman purchased 25 acres of land in Auburn to \ncreate a home and hospital for indigent, aged, and sick African-\nAmericans. Opened on June 23, 1908, the Harriet Tubman Home for the \nSick and Aged was the State's only charity outside of New York City \ndedicated to the shelter and care of African-Americans. Harriet Tubman \ndied from pneumonia in the home that bore her name on March 10, 1913, \nsurrounded by family and friends. In recognition of her service to this \ncountry, she was buried with military honors at the Fort Hill Cemetery \nin Auburn.\n  Harriet Tubman's legacy is one of selflessness and dedication to \nhuman rights. She inspired generations of African-Americans struggling \nfor equality and civil rights and she has been praised worldwide.\n  Harriet Tubman has received innumerable commendations for her role in \nAmerican history. In 1944, the Maritime Commission launched the SS \nHarriet Tubman, the first Liberty ship ever named for an African-\nAmerican woman. In 1978, Harriet Tubman was the first honoree of the \nPostal Service Black Heritage Stamp Series. She is also designated as a \nsaint in the Episcopal Church's Book of Common Prayer.\n  Public Law 101-252 designated March 10, 1990, as Harriet Tubman Day. \nMy home State of Maryland, as well as Delaware, Georgia, New York, and \nTexas host annual celebrations on March 10 to honor the life of Harriet \nTubman.\n  Harriet Tubman's dedicated pursuit of the American ideals of equality \nand liberty continues to inspire all who cherish freedom.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 475.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 475) congratulating Iowa State \n     University of Science and Technology on its 150 years of \n     leadership and service to the United States and the world as \n     Iowa's land-grant university.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of my alma \nmater, Iowa Sate University, and recognize it upon its 150 years of \nleadership and service to the United States and the world as Iowa's \nland-grant university.\n  Iowa State has a colorful and progressive history. The university was \nfounded under the Morrill Land Grant College Act of 1862. \nRepresentative Justin Smith Morrill, who wrote the bill, and Abraham \nLincoln, who signed the act into law in the midst of the Civil War, had \nthe vision to establish a public institution that provided and still \nprovides a top flight, affordable education for people of all walks of \nlife.\n  Iowa was the first State to accept the terms of the Morrill land \ngrant and pioneered all three parts of its mission. The act calls for \nschools that provide ``access to all, regardless of race, gender, or \nclass.'' The act also limits funding to only schools that conduct \n``Practical Research.'' Finally, the Morrill Land Grant Act calls for \nthe schools provided for to serve significant ``outreach'' in the \nsurrounding community.\n  Iowa State has certainly lived up to those lofty words of the Morrill \nAct. Iowa State University has been home to some of the most important \ntechnological and agricultural advances in history. Professor John \nAtanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry of ISU have been credited \nwith the invention of the electronic digital computer in\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\nthe late 1930s. When they constructed the Atanasoff-Berry computer, \nthey were the first to incorporate the seven basic principles of modern \ncomputing.\n  Professor Henry Gilman laid the foundation for the modern plastics \nindustry with his research in polyethylene materials. In the 1920s, ISU \nwas home to the development of hybrid seed corn. Professor Orland \nSweeney conducted pioneering work on soybean oil extraction and \nproducing ethanol from corn and other plant materials in the 1930s.\n  Iowa State has produced such esteemed graduates as George Washington \nCarver, a man who shattered the glass ceiling for minority inventors, \nwomen's rights activist Carrie Chapman Catt, and astronaut Clayton \nAnderson, just to name a few.\n  John Garang, who earned a Ph.D. in economics from Iowa State, not \nonly went on to serve as vice president of Sudan, but in his role as \nleader of the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army worked to end his \ncountry's violent civil war.\n  One cannot forget to mention that Mildred Day, the inventor of Rice \nKrispies treats, also graduated from Iowa State. In addition to \nMildred, former CEOs of Boeing, Dow Corning, 3-M, and Lockheed Martin \nhave all claimed Iowa State University as their alma mater, as do I.\n  I attended ISU on a Naval ROTC scholarship. The program covered my \nbooks and tuition, as well as $50 a month to cover extra expenses. I \nwas well taken care of at ISU. With NROTC and a loan from the National \nDefense Scholarship Program, started under President Eisenhower, I was \nable to make it through college and flourish.\n  It is my honor today to stand in support of my resolution honoring \nIowa State for its long and storied history of graduating men and women \nwho are creative, productive, and innovative. As the ISU fight song \ngoes, ``Loyal sons forever true, and we will fight the battle through. \nAnd when we hit that line we'll hit it hard ev'ry yard for I.S.U.''\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I support this resolution to honor \nthe service and leadership of Iowa State University. I am cosponsoring \nthis resolution because I know firsthand the substantial contributions \nthat Iowa State has made to both Iowa and the Nation as a whole. In \nfact, as one of the first land-grant universities, it has led the way \nin technology advancement and outreach.\n  Iowa State University will celebrate 150 years of service to the \nUnited States this month. The university is a leader in agricultural, \nengineering, and computer science technologies. They have been pioneers \nin the education of minorities and women. Because of these \nadvancements, Iowa State University is recognized throughout the world \nas a standard for excellence in education, practical research, and \noutreach through extension.\n  Iowa State is a great representative for the people of our State and \nwill continue to leave an important legacy for our Nation. It is with \ngreat respect that I introduce this resolution in honor of Iowa State \nUniversity's 150th year anniversary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 475) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 475\n\n       Whereas Iowa State University of Science and Technology was \n     established by the Iowa General Assembly on March 22, 1858, \n     as the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm in response \n     to the State of Iowa's desire to provide higher education \n     opportunities to farm families and working classes in Iowa, \n     predating the passage of the Federal Morrill Act by 4 years;\n       Whereas on September 3, 1862, Iowa became the first State \n     in the Nation to accept the terms and conditions of the \n     Morrill Act creating the land-grant system of colleges and \n     universities;\n       Whereas the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm, known \n     today as Iowa State University of Science and Technology \n     (Iowa State), received Iowa's land-grant charter on March 29, \n     1864, making it one of the first land-grant institutions in \n     the Nation;\n       Whereas Iowa State was a pioneer in all 3 parts of the \n     land-grant mission, including--(1) access to all, regardless \n     of race, gender or social class, being the first land-grant \n     institution to be coeducational from its opening, with 16 \n     women in its first class and later students including future \n     suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt, an 1880 graduate, and George \n     Washington Carver, the first African American student, who \n     earned a bachelor's degree in 1894 and a master's degree in \n     1896, and was also the institution's first African American \n     faculty member; (2) practical research, establishing the \n     Nation's first Engineering Experiment Station and domestic \n     economy experimental kitchen, and one of the first \n     agriculture experiment stations; and (3) outreach, including \n     some of the earliest land-grant institution outreach \n     activities such as the establishment of the Farmers \n     Institutes in the winter of 1869-70 by Iowa State President \n     Adonijah Welch, and the organization of the Nation's first \n     county Extension Service in 1903 in Sioux County in northwest \n     Iowa by Professor Perry Holden;\n       Whereas some of the most important technological \n     advancements of the modern world were the result of research \n     at Iowa State, including--(1) the development of hybrid seed \n     corn in the 1920s; (2) pioneering work on soybean oil \n     extraction and producing ethanol from corn and other plant \n     materials by Professor Orland Sweeney in the 1930s; (3) the \n     invention of the electronic digital computer in the late \n     1930s by Professor John Atanasoff and graduate student \n     Clifford Berry, whose Atanasoff-Berry Computer was the first \n     to incorporate the 7 basic principles of modern computing; \n     (4) the foundation for the modern plastics industry laid by \n     polyethylene research by Professor Henry Gilman; (5) \n     development of the process still used today to refine pure \n     rare-earth materials, including reactor-grade uranium, by \n     Professor Frank Spedding and Harley Wilhelm, as a result of \n     Iowa State's key role in the Manhattan Project during World \n     War II; (6) development of modern livestock animal genetics \n     by Professor Jay Lush; and (7) the first field-testing of a \n     genetically altered plant (tobacco) in 1987 and genetically \n     altered tree (poplar) in 1989 by Professor Robert Thornburg;\n       Whereas Iowa State hired one of the first permanent campus \n     artists-in-residence, with sculptor Christian Petersen \n     holding that position from 1934 to 1955 and providing \n     hundreds of sculptures and other art objects to the \n     university, whose Art on Campus collection today includes \n     more than 600 major public works of art;\n       Whereas Iowa State has had a technology transfer office \n     since 1935, longer than all but one other university in the \n     Nation, and is acknowledged today as a national leader in \n     putting technology to work, being cited as a ``model of \n     economic development'' and ``licensing powerhouse'' in a 2007 \n     study commissioned by the National Science Foundation;\n       Whereas Iowa State University is today spearheading new \n     advances in science and technology, including new materials, \n     information sciences, green architecture, biological \n     research, and the development of biorenewable fuels and other \n     resources to support the bioeconomy and the Nation's \n     independence from nonrenewable petroleum resources; and\n       Whereas more than 257,000 degrees have been awarded by Iowa \n     State, and its graduates include heads of State, leaders of \n     industry, great humanitarians, and gifted scientists, whose \n     work has improved the quality of life for people worldwide: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates Iowa State University of Science and \n     Technology on its 150 years of outstanding service to the \n     State of Iowa, the United States, and the world in fulfilling \n     its mission as a land-grant university; and\n       (2) thanks the State of Iowa for its visionary leadership \n     in the beginning of the land-grant movement in the United \n     States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/06/senate-section/article/S1717-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1717-S1718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1084, H.R. 1424, AND H.R. 5159\n\n  Mr. REID.
