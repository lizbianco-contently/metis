Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business for 1 hour, the first half controlled by the \nRepublicans, the second half under the majority's control. Following \nmorning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the ethics \nbill, S. 1. Last night, the Senate invoked cloture on an amendment \nstrengthening the gift and travel restrictions. I understand that \nseveral second-degree amendments to the amendment are now pending. It \nis my understanding there are four. I anticipate that we will be in a \nposition to dispose of any germane second-degree amendments later today \nand then we will dispose of the underlying amendment. Once the Senate \nhas concluded action on the gift travel amendment and any amendments in \nrelation thereto, there will be a cloture vote on the substitute \namendment on which cloture was filed last Friday.\n  I said yesterday, and I say today, we are going to work through this \nbill as quickly as we can. We were able to get through the first part \nof the ethics legislation in good fashion. It is my understanding, once \nwe move to the substitute, if cloture is invoked on that, there are \nabout 24 amendments that are germane as of last night. There were a few \nother amendments filed. I don't know if they are germane. I have been \ntold by staff that 30, 40 percent of those amendments Senators Bennett \nand Feinstein will agree to accept. The others we will take a look at \nand see if they are campaign finance related and try to work through \nthem the best we can. I am also in contact with my distinguished \ncolleague, the Republican leader, to see if he feels that there are \nother amendments we need to vote on, and we are working on that. Even \nif they are not germane, if the distinguished minority leader and I \nhave some belief that they will help movement of this bill, I would be \nhappy to work with him in that regard.\n  We are going to be in recess today for our respective party \nconferences from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. If we need to use the whole 30 \nhours, it would be about 10:30 tonight before we could dispose of the \namendment--something like that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S631-8", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the leaders for the time this \nmorning.\n  I recently returned from a trip looking into what is taking place in \nthe war on terrorism. I was in Afghanistan in Kabul and also went to \nthe Afghanistan-Pakistan border, had a brief meeting in Pakistan with \nour Ambassador and military leadership in Pakistan and also in Kuwait. \nI then went from there to Iraq. I was in Baghdad for a period of 24 \nhours plus. I went to Irbil in northern Iraq in the Kurdish region, met \nwith Barzani, head of the Kurdish region, and traveled to Ethiopia to \nthe current front, the expanded front in the war on terrorism, saw what \nthe Ethiopians are doing in Somalia. I met with the Prime Minister of \nEthiopia, Meles Zenawi, about what he is doing in Somalia. I had a very \ngood meeting with him and also with our military commanders in that \nregion, with the recent strikes we have done against terrorism in \nsouthern Somalia and work we have done with the Ethiopians.\n  All of this was very informative. There is a mixture of news to \nreport as to what is taking place in the war on terrorism. There are \nsome very positive things happening, particularly the recent events in \nSomalia, what the Ethiopians are pushing for, and some very positive \nthings happening in Afghanistan, some difficulties we are still having \nwith Pakistani leadership going after some of the threats on the \nPakistan-Afghanistan border.\n  Northern Iraq is booming, the Kurdish area. Investment is flowing. \nThere are cranes and people are building. Baghdad is in great \ndifficulty.\n  I, also, wish to talk about my suggestions for the route forward. I \nthink the President, in his address, was saying he is proposing a route \nforward, and if others might oppose or have a different view, all I ask \nis that you put forward a proposal yourself. That is fair. That is what \nwe ought to do. We are all in this, and we need to see the route \nforward.\n  There is good news in Iraq, certainly. We have 140,000 of America's \nbest and brightest working hard every day. I flew on troop transport \nplanes in and out of various places with the troops and met and visited \nwith them along the way. They are impressive. Their dedication and \ncourage and commitment is impressive to feel. It is inspiring. It is \ninspiring to see. I have a niece and nephew who have signed up to join \nthe Marines. So they are going into this as well. I am proud of them, \nas is the whole family.\n  The irrepressible spirit of our soldiers--from new recruits to \nveterans of multiple--is inspiring. I even saw a father-son team from \nKansas in Kuwait. They are enthusiastic, determined, and we depend on \nthem for the success we will achieve in Iraq. I know firsthand it is \nnot just a good sound bite to say we have the best Armed Forces in the \nworld. There is simply no other place in the world that can boast of so \nmany courageous, committed, and talented volunteers so willing to make \nsacrifices, whenever the country calls upon them. They continue to \ndeserve our great respect and admiration for performing so ably under \nsuch difficult circumstances. And the circumstances are that.\n  Baghdad still feels similar to an occupation zone. I was physically \npresent in Baghdad for about 24 hours. It is hard to say that I saw the \ncity. I left with an enduring image of concrete barriers and convoys of \nSUVs. I last visited Baghdad in March 2005. The environment is no \nbetter than it was at that period of time. Three mortar rounds exploded \nin the green zone while I was there meeting with the Iraqi Vice \nPresident. No one was harmed. They were launched from somewhere way \nout, but still they hit. It shows how insecure the city remains.\n  We all wish the situation would get better, but I am particularly \ndisappointed. I have had a long-term interest in Iraq. When I first \ncame to the Senate in 1996, I served on the Foreign Relations Committee \nand chaired the Middle East Subcommittee that held some of the first \nhearings on what to do about Saddam Hussein's regime. I carried the \nIraq Liberation Act on the floor of the Senate that was signed into law \nby President Bill Clinton. I helped get the initial $100 million for \nthe Iraqi National Congress. I, also, attended the first INC meeting \nwith Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. We both went to New York City to \nmeet with the opposition about what to do about Saddam Hussein. I, \nalso, attended the first Iraqi National Congress meeting in London. I \nhave been committed to a free, safe, and secure Iraq from the very \nbeginning.\n  During my meetings last week, I found less reason for optimism. Sunni \nleaders blame everything on the Shia, and the Shia leaders likewise \nblame everything on the Sunnis. The Kurdish leadership pointed out that \nthe Sunnis and Shia only meet when the Kurds call the meeting. All of \nthis suggests that, at the present time, the United States seems to \ncare more about a peaceful Iraq than the Iraqis do. If that is the \ncase, it is difficult to understand why more U.S. troops would make a \ndifference.\n  One other bright spot was my visit to the northern part of the \ncountry, the Kurdish region. The security situation is stable and \nbusiness is booming, as some number of people moving out of Iraq are \nmoving into northern Iraq into the Kurdish region. The Kurds are \ndemonstrating what is possible for the rest of Iraq when violence \nrecedes. The Kurds are pragmatic. They are worried about committing \nKurdish forces to Baghdad. I asked Brazani, would he commit Kurdish \nforces for the peace in Baghdad? He declined to do so. They don't want \nto get caught in the middle of a sectarian fight. If Iraqi Kurds feel \nthis way, why should we feel any differently? Simply put, the Iraqis \nhave to resolve these sectarian differences. We cannot do it for them.\n  This does not mean we should pull out of Iraq and leave behind a \nsecurity vacuum or safe haven for terrorists. I do not support that \nalternative. It does mean that there must be a bipartisan agreement on \nour military commitment to Iraq. We cannot fight a war with the support \nof only one political party, and it does mean that the parties in \nIraq--Sunni, Shia, and Kurds--must get to a political equilibrium. I \nthink most people agree that a cut-and-run strategy does not serve our \ninterests, nor those of the world, nor those of the region, nor those \nof the Iraqi people.\n  So I invite my colleagues all around, particularly on the other side \nof the aisle, to indicate what level of commitment they can support. We \nneed to come together in Congress, and as a nation, on a strategy that \nwill make real progress in Iraq and gain as much support as possible \nfrom the American people. Only a broadly supported, bipartisan strategy \nwill allow us to remain in Iraq for the length of time necessary to \nensure regional stability and to defeat the terrorists. That is our \nobjective. Make no mistake, we may need to be in Iraq for some period \nof time, as we are in Bosnia, as we were in Europe, as we still remain \nin Korea. Iraqis should patrol their own streets, but we must continue \nto hunt down the terrorists. We must balance the aggressive moves by \nIran, operating inside of Iraq, which seeks to exploit Iraq for its own \ngain.\n  These missions will take time to achieve on our part. It is vital we \nget a bipartisan way forward on Iraq as soon as possible. I invite \npeople on the other side of the aisle to put forward their proposals. \nAs we refine our military posture, we should also enlist the support of \nIraq's neighbors, through a diplomatic initiative similar to the \nrecommendations of the Baker-Hamilton Commission. Although I don't \nsupport all of those initiatives, I thought they had some good ideas, \nparticularly engaging Iraq's neighbors. Each of Iraq's\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\nneighbors can benefit from a peaceful Iraq, and they can assist us in \nreaching a political equilibrium among Iraq's various groups. These \ninclude Iran and Syria, which are clearly meddling in Iraq but whose \ncooperation will be necessary for any political solution in Iraq to be \nrelevant for the long term.\n  To be successful, such a diplomatic initiative will require a great \namount of attention and hard work. Thus, I recommend Secretary Rice and \nVice President Cheney go to Iraq and practice shuttle diplomacy. They \nshould lay the groundwork for a meeting of leaders from all three major \nIraqi groups to take place outside of Iraq. This kind of a meeting \ncould be similar to the Dayton Accords that helped resolve the conflict \nin Bosnia. It would allow for intense, sustained discussions aimed at a \ndurable, long-term political settlement amongst the Iraqis. One \npotential political settlement could involve a three-State, one-country \nformula. Each of Iraq's major groups would have its own autonomous \nregion with Baghdad as a federal city.\n  Each group can manage its own affairs while preserving Iraq's \nterritorial integrity. This is something the Iraqi Constitution allows, \nthat the Kurdish people are practicing, and that the Iraqi leaders, I \nbelieve, should pursue to get to a political equilibrium. We have made \nour share of mistakes in Iraq. Still, we have invested the lives of \nmore than 3,000 of our best and brightest for our Nation's future.\n  The mission for which they died is not yet complete. We still need \npolitical equilibrium if we are to achieve a stable, united Iraq that \ncan be an ally in the war on terrorism. We must win in Iraq, and we \nwill. We must win for the future of the region and for the future of \nthe world and for the future of Iraq. We must win for the future of \nAmerica. That victory will require more than bullets; it will require \npolitical arrangements inside Iraq and around Iraq to end the sectarian \nviolence and move toward a peaceful future for the Iraqi people and \nstability for the region. We are in a tough time, but I believe we have \nsolutions that can work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S633-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S633-S634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S PERSPECTIVE ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kansas, who made \nthe point well that we cannot afford to lose in Iraq. I thought my \ncolleagues, and maybe those who may be interested--if anybody is paying \nattention and watching the floor--may be interested to hear what the \nintelligence community said in public. It is rare we have public \nhearings in the Intelligence Committee, but once a year at least we \nhave the worldwide threat hearing.\n  Last Thursday, we had that hearing and we spent about 5\\1/2\\ hours. \nIt was very informative and mostly dealt with Iraq. Present were the \nDirector of National Intelligence, Ambassador Negroponte; Director \nHayden of the CIA; Director of the DIA General Maples; Mr. Foote from \nthe State Department INR; and FBI Director Robert Mueller. Much of the \nquestioning was about what is going on in Iraq. I think the consensus \nof the intelligence community was that while things have not gone well, \nthe new commitment by Prime Minister Maliki and the rest of his \nGovernment--not just the Shia Prime Minister but the Kurds and the \nSunnis--was to take over and take ownership of ending the insurgency in \nIraq. That gave us the best hope of achieving a peaceful solution that \nwould leave Iraq a stable country--not perfect by any means, with no \nguarantee of success, but this was the opportunity to get the three \nmajor elements in Iraq--the Shia, Sunnis, and the Kurds--to come \ntogether on what we believe will be and should be a long-term solution.\n  Frankly, one of the real problems we have had has been the reluctance \nof the Iraqi Government to let us go in and eliminate Shia militia, \nsuch as the Moqtada al-Sadr Mahdi army. This has been a serious \nproblem. The American forces have been held back. Now it is our \nunderstanding--and the intelligence community believes what they have \ntold the policymakers in the executive branch--that this is now the \nbest chance, because they realize time is running out, that while our \ncommitment was strong to Iraq, it is not an unending one, infinite.\n  They are going to have to take control if they don't want to see \ntheir country descend into chaos. So there was a lot of talk about the \npros and cons of the policy the President announced to turn over the \nresponsibility to the Iraqi military, for ending the insurgency in \nBaghdad, and to send our troops into the Al Anbar province to deal with \nradical Islamists, such as al-Qaida, who continue to stir up problems \nand who we believe were responsible for the bombing of the Golden \nMosque in Samara, which escalated the insurgency.\n  So I asked another question and the answers, I thought, were very \ntelling. They were not covered in the media. I asked what if we decided \nnow or within 2 or 3 months to withdraw and turn it over to the Iraqi \nGovernment, and the consensus was uniform and frightening.\n  Admiral Negroponte said:\n\n       And I think the view pretty much across the community is \n     that a precipitous withdrawal could lead to a collapse of the \n     government of that country, and a collapse of their security \n     forces, because we simply don't think that they are ready to \n     take over, to assume full control of their security \n     responsibilities.\n       We think that that is a goal that can be achieved on a \n     gradual basis and on a well-planned basis. But to simply \n     withdraw now, I think, could have catastrophic effects. And I \n     think that's a quite widely held view inside of Iraq itself.\n\n  Later, I went back and asked what it would mean in terms of the \nworldwide terrorist threat of al-Qaida. Director Negroponte responded:\n\n       I think in terms of al-Qaida's own planning, if you look at \n     the letter that Zawahiri wrote to Zarqawi last year about \n     establishing in Iraq a sort of beachhead for the expansion of \n     al-Qaida's ideology throughout the Islamic world, \n     establishing the caliphate, it would be the very sanctuary \n     for international terrorism that we are seeking to avoid.\n\n  In other words, the No. 2 man under Osama bin Laden, Zawahiri, wrote \nto the notorious, infamous butcher Zarqawi, who had beheaded Americans \nand others on television, to tell him to cool it; we are trying to \nestablish a basis for al-Qaida to operate out of Iraq. This would be, \nin Zawahiri's and bin Laden's own words, establishing the range of the \ncaliphate. What they mean by that is to establish a Taliban style of \ngovernment, such as we saw in Afghanistan, on a regionwide and \nultimately a global basis.\n  I asked General Maples about the impact of withdrawal, precipitous or \nimmediate, or politically, a timetable withdrawal, determined by what \nwe want in Washington, rather than what is available on the ground. He \nsaid:\n\n       . . . I believe that a failure in Iraq would empower the \n     jihadist movement. It would give that base of operations from \n     which the jihadist movement would expand. And it's consistent \n     with the goals of al-Qaida in Iraq to establish that \n     Islamic state, and then to expand it into the caliphate.\n\n  He went on to say there would be regional impacts and that there \nwould be a tremendous economic impact. He cited hydrocarbons and, \nobviously, we know Iraq is very rich in oil reserves, and it would make \noil reserves available to fund the activities of al-Qaida and the \ninternational radical Islamist terrorist movements. He also said it \nwould have an impact on the world market on oil, driving up the power \nof oil. He concluded by saying it would give Iran the power to expand \nits evil empire, which President Ahmadi-Nejad is urgently trying to \nexpand not only in the Middle East but throughout Latin America.\n  I think probably the best summary of the intelligence community \nestimates of the impact of the choices--and we are talking about \nchoices--is there is nothing good in terms of choices. One option has \nbeen put forward by President Bush. I happen to believe it is the best \navailable option to support the Iraqis who have committed to end the \ninsurgency, to bring the Sunnis into a government that would share in \nthe oil revenues and take responsibility for ending the insurgency, \nwhile our troops go after the external forces, the terrorists coming in \nfrom other countries and joining the al-Qaida movement.\n  I asked General Hayden to give me a concise statement of his view and \nthe view of the intelligence community on the second option, which \nwould be to\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\nwithdraw now, or to set a short timetable deadline in 2 or 3 months. I \nwill read what he said:\n\n       Yes, sir, Senator. When I went before the Iraq Study Group, \n     I prefaced my remarks by saying I think I'll give a rather--\n     I'm going to be giving a rather somber assessment of the \n     situation in Iraq. But before I do that, I said, let me tell \n     you. If we leave under the current circumstances, everything \n     gets worse.\n\n  At that point, I commended him for being a master of understatement. \nHe went on to say:\n\n       Three quick areas. More Iraqis die from the disorder inside \n     Iraq. Iraq becomes a safe haven, perhaps more dangerous than \n     the one al-Qaida had in Afghanistan. And finally, the \n     conflict in Iraq bleeds over into the neighborhood and \n     threatens serious regional instability.\n\n  I said, well, what would be the threat to the U.S. homeland? How does \nthat affect us in Washington, in Rhode Island, Missouri, Kansas, New \nYork, Los Angeles, and elsewhere? He said:\n\n       The immediate threat comes from providing al-Qaida that \n     which they are attempting to seek in several locations right \n     now, be it Somalia, the tribal area of Pakistan or Anbar \n     province--a safe haven to rival that which they had in \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  I have my views on this. This is the overwhelming consensus of the \nintelligence community. There are no great options, but the best \noption, they believe, is to provide American troops to support what the \nGovernment of Iraq has pledged to do, and that is to end the \ninsurgency, to stop the Shia death squads, to cut the Sunnis in on a \nfair share of the Government, and take responsibility not only for \nclearing but for controlling the areas in Baghdad that have been the \nproblem. So I think as we talk about the options available, it is \nvitally important that we listen to the intelligence community and \ntheir best assessments of what happens if we follow the President's \nplan or if we choose a course of continuing to do what we have been \ndoing, without assisting the Iraqis to take control of their \nGovernment, or if we cut and run.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the transcripts which I cited be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   SSCI Open Hearing: Current and Projected National Security Threats\n\n       JANUARY 11, 2007\n       NEGROPONTE (responding to a question from Sen. Bond): And I \n     think the view pretty much across the community is that a \n     precipitous withdrawal could lead to a collapse of the \n     government of that country, and a collapse of their security \n     forces, because we simply don't think that they are ready to \n     take over, to assume full control of their security \n     responsibilities.\n       We think that that is a goal that can be achieved on a \n     gradual basis and on a well planned basis. But to simply \n     withdraw now, I think could have catastrophic effects. And I \n     think that's a quite widely held view inside of Iraq itself.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       NEGROPONTE: I think, in terms of Al Qaida's own planning, \n     if you look at the letter that Zawahiri wrote to Zarqawi last \n     year about establishing in Iraq a sort of a beachhead for the \n     expansion of Al Qaida's ideology throughout the Islamic \n     world, establishing the caliphate, it would be the very \n     sanctuary for international terrorism that we are seeking to \n     avoid,\n       BOND: General Maples?\n       MAPLES: Sir, I'd follow up on that statement by the \n     ambassador, because I truly believe that a failure in Iraq \n     would empower the jihadist movement. It would give that base \n     of operations from which the jihadist movement would expand. \n     And it's consistent with the goals of Al Qaida in Iraq to \n     establish that Islamic state, and then to expand it into the \n     caliphate.\n       I also think that there, of course, will be very \n     significant regional impacts, both in terms of stability to \n     other countries in the region.\n       There will be economic impacts with respect to, in \n     particular, hydrocarbons and the effect that that could have, \n     particularly if those resources were in the hands of \n     jihadists. And . . .\n       BOND: In other words, they could get the profit off of the \n     high price of oil.\n       MAPLES: Absolutely. And then I would follow with one last, \n     and that is the empowerment--further empowerment--of Iran \n     within the region.\n       BOND: General Hayden?\n       GEN. HAYDEN: Yes, sir, Senator. When I went before the Iraq \n     Study Group, I prefaced my remarks by saying I think I'll \n     give a rather--I'm going to be giving a rather somber \n     assessment of the situation in Iraq. But before I do that, I \n     said, let me tell you. If we leave under the current \n     circumstances, everything gets worse. And . . .\n       BOND: You have a masterful way of understating it.\n       HAYDEN: Three very quick areas. More Iraqis die from the \n     disorder inside Iraq. Iraq becomes a safe haven, perhaps more \n     dangerous than the one Al Qaida had in Afghanistan. And \n     finally, the conflict in Iraq bleeds over into the \n     neighborhood and threatens serious regional instability.\n       BOND: Any threat do you see--what threat to the United \n     States homeland?\n       HAYDEN: The immediate threat comes from providing Al Qaida \n     that which they are attempting to seek in several locations \n     right now, be it Somalia, the tribal area of Pakistan or \n     Anbar province--a safe haven to rival that which they had in \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, the issue that is paramount in the minds \nof many Americans is the war in Iraq. It is a consuming issue for us \nbecause we know that as we stand in the safety of the Senate Chamber or \nin our homes across America, at the same moment in time, 144,000 \nAmerican soldiers are risking their lives. Sadly, some are giving their \nlives almost on a daily basis. Many are injured and come home to face a \ndifferent life than they ever imagined.\n  The cost of this war, of course, starts with the human accounting. \nOver 3,013 American soldiers have died as of today, 23,000 have \nreturned injured, 6,600 seriously injured, with double amputations, \nblindness, or traumatic brain injury of a serious nature.\n  This morning's Wall Street Journal, in an article by David Rogers, \ntalks about the real cost of this war in dollar terms. Many of us have \nused the numbers of $380 billion, $400 billion, and some have come to \nthe conclusion that the number is really much higher and that when you \naccount for our obligations to our veterans and rebuilding the military \nafter this war, it will range in the hundreds of billions of dollars \nmore. This will affect our Nation. It will affect the quality of our \nlife. It will affect our spending on basics, whether it is the \neducation of our children, the health of our citizens, building the \ninfrastructure so our economy can expand, or creating higher education \nopportunities so that the 21st century can be an American century, as \nthe 20th century was.\n  This war has taken its toll. It isn't the first war that has been \ncontroversial in our history. Some of us are old enough to remember \nanother war not that long ago. It was October 19, 1966, on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate, across the aisle, when a Senator from the State of \nVermont, George Aiken, rose to speak. George Aiken gave a speech about \nthe war in Vietnam. It is one that has been quoted many times since. He \nsaid a lot about the war at that moment. Some of the things he said are \ninteresting in a historical context.\n  Senator Aiken said, in October of 1966, about the Vietnam war:\n\n       The greater the U.S. military commitment in south Vietnam, \n     however, the less possibility that any south Vietnamese \n     government will be capable of asserting its own authority on \n     its own home ground or abroad. The size of the U.S. \n     commitment already clearly is suffocating any serious \n     possibility of self-determination in south Vietnam for the \n     simple reason that the whole defense of that country is now \n     totally dependent on the U.S. armed presence.\n\n  Of course, Senator Aiken went on to say that we should declare \nvictory and start bringing our troops home. He said:\n\n       Such a declaration should be accompanied not by \n     announcement of a phased withdrawal, but by the gradual \n     redeployment of\n\n[[Page S635]]\n\n     U.S. military forces around strategic centers and the \n     substitution of intensive reconnaissance for bombing.\n       This unilateral declaration--\n\n  Senator Aiken said--\n\n     --of military victory would herald the resumption of \n     political warfare as the dominant theme in Vietnam.\n\n  He closed by saying:\n\n       Until such a declaration is made, there is no real prospect \n     for political negotiations.\n\n  When Senator Aiken took the floor and gave that speech in October of \n1966, we began that year with fewer casualties in Vietnam than we have \nalready incurred in Iraq. Around 2,800 American lives had been lost in \nVietnam at the beginning of 1966. But 1966 was a bloody year in \nVietnam, and by the end of that year, we had lost 8,400 soldiers as \nSenator Aiken gave his speech. Had we followed his advice, what a \ndifference it might have made. By the end of that Vietnam war, we \nhadn't lost 8,000, we had lost 58,193 troops.\n  The President's call for increasing the number of American soldiers \nwho will be serving and fighting in Iraq is a grim reminder of the cost \nof escalation. Instead of assessing where we are today in honest terms, \nthe President is continuing a strategy which has failed. He has \nconceded that point. The President no longer says we are winning the \nwar in Iraq. He concedes we have made serious mistakes--mistakes which \nall of us know have cost us dearly in human life and in the cost of \nthis war.\n  Now we face the reality of our politics in this town. In 2 weeks, \nthings have changed pretty dramatically here in Washington. If you \nhaven't noticed, with the hearings on Capitol Hill with the Democratic \nCongress, there is a different tenor, there is a different approach. \nBefore, over the last 6 years, the President has had a compliant and \nsupine Congress, afraid to ask hard questions about this war. That has \nchanged. And the encouraging thing is that the hearings before the \nForeign Affairs Committee last week showed that not only is the \nDemocratic majority speaking out with important and relevant questions, \nbut now our Republican colleagues are joining us in what should be a \nnational and bipartisan chorus. This is a moment of accountability when \nthis President and the administration will have to answer for policy \ndecisions. It was a Republican Senator last week who made a statement \nin that Foreign Affairs Committee, which sadly I have to agree with, \nwhen he said that our invasion of Iraq was the greatest strategic \nforeign policy blunder in recent memory. I think it may be one of the \nworst mistakes in the history of our country, one we will pay for in \nyears to come.\n\n  Now I watch carefully for the reaction in Iraq as we are preparing to \nsend more soldiers, and I am waiting for signs and signals and \nstatements from the al-Maliki government that they understand this is a \nnew day, and I am still waiting. Until they are prepared to eliminate \nthe militias, whether they are going to disband them or destroy them, \nthere can be no security on the ground in Iraq. I read the statements \nby our soldiers and the media where they say the Iraq Army and the Iraq \npolice force is a dead horse and we are not going to get anywhere by \nkicking it. If that is a fact, then 21,000 American soldiers' lives \nwon't make a difference. That is the reality of what we face.\n  In the coming days ahead, very soon after we finish this debate on \nethics legislation, we are going to move into a more serious and open \ndebate on the war in Iraq. Initially, there will likely be a markup in \none of the committees on a resolution. It will come to the floor, and \nwe will consider it. I sincerely hope that, like the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee meeting of last week, it is a bipartisan resolution because I \nwill tell you, the sentiment about this war is strongly bipartisan or \nnonpartisan across this country.\n  First and foremost, there are some basics we should make clear. No. \n1, how much we respect and admire and will stand behind our troops. \nThese men and women in uniform, the best and bravest, have done \neverything we have asked them to do--in fact, many times with displays \nof heroism--and they have done more than we could ever expect from any \nhuman being. They have been there. They have unflinchingly responded to \nthe call to arms and have served us so well. Their families stay home \nwith worry and prayer, hoping they will come back safely. For those \nsoldiers and their families, the first thing said is thank you, thank \nyou from a grateful nation for all you have given to this country and \ncontinue to give.\n  Secondly, we won't turn our backs on these soldiers. Whether it is a \nmatter of the equipment they need now to be safe in Iraq and to come \nhome to their families with their missions completed or, if they come \nhome with a need, whether it is through the Veterans' Administration or \nfor college education or for some help in their lives, we need to be \nthere. They were there for us; we need to be there for them. That \nalmost goes without saying.\n  But I wish to make it clear from the Democratic side, and I am sure I \nspeak for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we will never \nshortchange our troops. We will never shortchange their safety. For \nthose who suggest any disagreement with foreign policy of this \nadministration somehow is going to be at the expense of our troops, \nthey are just plain wrong. In the final analysis, we will keep our word \nto our soldiers.\n  The other point I would like to make, though, is if we expect this to \nend and end well, it can only end with a political solution in Iraq \ndriven by Iraqi leadership. We cannot superimpose a democracy on Iraq. \nThey have to come to this clear understanding that their future is in \ntheir own hands. We can help them aspire to this goal, but ultimately \nthey have to take the difficult, painful steps moving toward it. That \nmeans, of course, putting an end to the sectarian violence.\n  For 14 centuries now, the people of the Islamic faith have had a \ndisagreement about who were the rightful heirs to their great Prophet \nMuhammad. We cannot resolve 14 centuries of this sectarian debate and \nviolence in one little country with more American soldiers. This is \nsomething which will have to be resolved if Iraq decides their future \nwill be a democracy. They have to treat all Iraqis in a fair and honest \nway instead of favoring one sect over another. They have to bring an \nend to violence, whether it is inspired by Sunnis or Shias or others. \nWhatever the inspiration, it has to come to an end.\n  The militias that now control parts of Baghdad and parts of Iraq have \nto come to an end as well. You can't have private armies in a country \nand expect the national army to have the strength to control the \nsituation. We need to see the police forces in Baghdad and other places \nreally emerge as professionals. When I was there in October, the \nreports were very disappointing. It was said that if you went to a \npolice station, you could decide right off the bat whether it was going \nto be a Sunni or Shia police station and then decide how they would \nreact to crime committed by their own. That has to end. We can't change \nthat by sending American soldiers into battle. We can't change that \nwith American lives and American injuries. Only the Iraqis can change \nthat.\n  As Senator Aiken said 40 years ago now:\n\n       The unilateral declaration of military victory would really \n     herald the resumption of political warfare in south Vietnam.\n\n  We need to move this to a political level, and that is where I think \nthe President's recommendations last week are so wanting. He still is \nin the mindset to believe that enough American soldiers can somehow \nchange the politics of Iraq. That is never going to happen. It has to \ncome from the Iraqi people.\n  So we face a challenge--a challenge which we accept--to have an \nhonest, nonpartisan, productive, and positive debate on our foreign \npolicy in Iraq. Those of us who disagree with the President really \nstand in an awkward position in this regard. I sincerely hope the \nPresident is right. I hope 21,000 American soldiers change the whole \ncontour of the debate and the future of Iraq. I don't believe they \nwill, but I want this to end and end well, and I don't care who takes \ncredit for it. But I believe--sincerely believe--that the only way to \nconvince the Iraqis of their responsibility is for us to start bringing \nAmerican troops home, as Senator Aiken called for in Vietnam in 1966 \nwith 8,000 American lives lost, and that we start the phased \nredeployment of our troops. Had America, had Congress, had the \nPresident in 1966 followed the\n\n[[Page S636]]\n\nsuggestions of the Senator from Vermont, 50,000 American lives might \nhave been spared. By the end of the Vietnam war, almost 3,000 \nIllinoisans had given their lives in Vietnam. Some were my buddies in \nhigh school, my friends with whom I had grown up. I still remember to \nthis day and wonder, if the Senate at that moment in time had made the \nright decision, a decision Senator Aiken had called for, whether they \nmight be alive today. That is the reality of war, and it is the reality \nof these foreign policy decisions.\n\n\n                             Ethics Reform\n\n  Our business before the Senate now is the Senate ethics reform \nbill. We have a big task ahead of us. The leadership has made it clear \nto Senators on both sides of the aisle that we are going to finish this \nbill this week. It could mean long sessions, as Senator Reid said \nearlier today. It could mean we are in late in the night, perhaps even \non the weekend, but we want to get this important part of our business \nbehind us. The culture of corruption, the climate of corruption which \nhas been on Capitol Hill over the last several years has to come to an \nend.\n\n  There will always be Members of the House and Senate who can think of \nanother way to improve the way we do business. Each of us has our own \nideas. I was fortunate, as I said before on the floor of the Senate, to \nstart my Senate and public career with two extraordinary men, Senators \nPaul Douglas and Paul Simon of Illinois, who tried to set new standards \nof ethical conduct in national service. Back when I was fresh out of \nlaw school and penniless, I went to work for Lieutenant Governor Paul \nSimon, who insisted that every member of his staff make a complete \nincome disclosure every year and a complete net worth disclosure.\n  My first disclosure brought real embarrassment to me and my wife \nbecause we had nothing and with student debts would have qualified for \nbankruptcy under most circumstances. We didn't file bankruptcy, but \nthose annual disclosures were embarrassing until we finally passed a \npoint where we had a few meager possessions and were on the positive \nside of the ledger.\n  I have continued to do that every year. I make the most detailed \ndisclosure I can in my financial statement, not categories of wealth or \nincome but actual dollar amounts. I have done it every single year. I \nknow it serves up to my critics a ready menu of things on which to \nattack me. That's OK. I want to make it clear that in the time I have \nbeen in public service, the decisions I have made--good, bad, whether \nyou agree with them or not--have not been driven by any desire to come \naway from this experience wealthy.\n  I have not imposed that on my colleagues here, or suggested it by way \nof amendment, that they do a detailed income disclosure, put their \nincome tax returns with that disclosure, and a net worth statement each \nyear. But I feel comfortable doing it. I am glad I got started. Now \nthat my family is beyond the embarrassment of those early disclosures \nwhen we had nothing, they have come to accept it every year as just a \nroutine. It is a small thing, but it is voluntary on my part, and I \nhope that others, if they see the need, will accept voluntary changes \nin the way they approach this to demonstrate their commitment to ethics \nin public service.\n  The amendment before us by Senator Reid, Senator Harry Reid, our \nmajority leader, is one that deals with the use of corporate airplanes. \nThat has been a source of some embarrassment and question before. I \nbelieve that Senators Reid and McConnell have shown real leadership in \nmoving this amendment forward. We will consider some changes to it \nduring the course of our debate but, once again, it is a step in the \nright direction.\n  Finishing this, we will move to the minimum wage bill and then to a \ndebate on Iraq and then probably to the stem cell issue, so we have \nquite an agenda before us. Our friends in the House are benefited by \nsomething known as the House Rules Committee, which can expedite the \nprocess. The Senate doesn't work that way. We have a unanimous consent \nprocess which is slow, ponderous, deliberate, and, for Members of the \nHouse, absolutely maddening. It will take us longer.\n  At the end of the day, though, I hope we end up with a good work \nproduct for the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we, as Members of Congress, owe it to \nthe American people to conduct ourselves in a way that reinforces, \nrather than diminishes, the public's faith and confidence in Congress. \nAn informed citizenry is essential to a thriving democracy. And, a \ndemocratic Government operates best in the disinfecting light of the \npublic eye. With this bill, we have an opportunity to balance the right \nof the public to know with its right to petition Government; the \nability of lobbyists to advocate their clients' causes with the need \nfor truthful public discourse; and the ability of Members to legislate \nwith the imperative that our Government must be free from corrupting \ninfluences, both real and perceived. We must act now to ensure that the \nerosion we see today in the public's confidence in Congress does not \nbecome a collapse of confidence.\n  I am pleased with the progress we have been making on this bill. We \nhave been having a good debate on a range of proposals to further \nimprove this bill, including requirements to reign in wasteful spending \nsuch as by more fully disclosing earmarks and granting the President's \nenhanced recision authority. We have recognized the need for increased \ndisclosure and more timely reporting of lobbyists' activities. And, I \nam pleased that we are considering an amendment--one that I fully \nsupport--to require Members of Congress who use corporate aircraft to \nreimburse the full charter rate for a flight, instead of simply paying \nthe cost of a first-class ticket, as required under the current rules. \nThese are all solid proposals, but we need to do more.\n  Madam President, on this issue of the first-class airfare, I don't \nthink there is a more dramatic example of the difference between we \nMembers of Congress and the average American citizen. No American \ncitizen can today call up a corporation and say: Please let me use your \nairplane, and, by the way, I am only going to pay first-class airfare. \nNothing is more egregious. There are worse abuses that go on around \nhere, but there is no more egregious an example than the ability of a \nMember of Congress, who many times has oversight of the corporation \nthat provides the aircraft, taking advantage of a situation where they \nonly have to pay first-class airfare, with a difference of sometimes \ntens of thousands of dollars. It is remarkable.\n  We need to reform earmarking beyond mere disclosure requirements. We \nneed to curtail this practice, which cost American taxpayers $64 \nbillion in FY 2006, and I have offered an amendment to help do that. \nAbove all, we need to ensure the enactment and enforcement of \ncomprehensive lobbyist, ethics and earmark reforms. That is why we need \nto establish an Office of Public Integrity to help provide enforcement \nmeasures for the reforms that we are advocating. We can pass all the \nrules changes we want but unless we back them up with a tough \nenforcement mechanism, they are useless.\n  On the issue of earmarks, Madam President--and I obviously have a \nlong record of being opposed to these egregious examples of \nporkbarreling--I think that it is important for us to recognize that \nthere are two ways we can address earmarking. One is to eliminate them \nand the other is to watch them grow. Over the previous 20 years, I have \nwatched them grow and grow and grow and grow.\n  I was intrigued by getting a call from an administration official who \nsaid the President is for cutting them in half. That is like saying we \nwant to cut half of the drug dealers in America. There is an addiction \nin Congress to porkbarreling, and we have to cure the addiction or it \nwill continue to grow.\n  It is because of this need that I am pleased to again join my \ncolleagues, Senators Lieberman and Collins, in cosponsoring an \namendment to create an Office of Public Intergrity to investigate \ncomplaints of ethical violations by Senators, staff, or officers of \nthis Chamber. Headed by a Director appointed by the President pro tem \nof the Senate upon the joint recommendation of the majority and \nminority leaders, the Office of Public Integrity would investigate \ncomplaints of rules violations filed with or initiated by the office. \nTo ensure swift action, within 30 days of receiving a complaint, the \noffice would be required to make an initial determination whether to \ndismiss or investigate it. Although a determination by the office to \ninvestigate may be overridden by the Select Committee on Ethics, the \namendment stipulates that this can occur only if the Ethics Committee \noverrides the decision by a two-thirds vote and makes this vote public.\n  To assist it in its investigation, the Office of Public Integrity \nwould be empowered to issue subpoenas, take statements, and compel the \nattendance of witnesses. If, after investigation, the Director of the \noffice determines that there is probable cause that a violation \noccurred, he or she must inform the Ethics Committee, which again, can \ndecide not to proceed on a complaint, but only upon a two-thirds vote \nthat must be made public. If the Ethics Committee does not overrule the \noffice's determination of probable cause, the office shall present the \ncase to the Ethics Committee which shall vote on whether the subject of \nthe investigation violated any rules or other standards. Again, this \nvote must be made public. If the Ethics Committee finds there was a \nviolation, the Director of the Office of Public Integrity shall \nrecommend appropriate sanctions and whether the matter should be \nreferred to the Department of Justice for investigation.\n  For 2 years, the Committee on Indian Affairs which I chaired at the \ntime, investigated the actions of Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon, \nand\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\nbrought to light their efforts to manipulate the political process. If \nthere is a silver lining to the Abramoff affair, it is that it helped \nto compel Congress to reassess the rules that govern our dealings with \nlobbyists and others who seek to influence us, and to do so through the \neyes of the public, not through our own jaundiced perspectives. \nFrankly, I also believe the American public sent a clear message that \nbusiness as usual in an unacceptable proposition. That is what drives \nour amendment today.\n  Again, I point out that we investigated in the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs Mr. Abramoff and his connection, frankly, with both \nsides of the Capitol. There was never an Ethics Committee \ninvestigation. It was the Justice Department that finally had to take \naction. There was ample evidence of misbehavior in violation of the \nrules of both Houses, and here we are with people in jail and, as far \nas I know, the Ethics Committee never ruled on their behavior. So when \nI hear people say the Office of Public Integrity would somehow cause us \nembarrassment, are we not embarrassed by what already happened? Are we \nnot embarrassed that Members of Congress violated their oath of office \nto the degree that they are in jail and the investigation continued on \nthe part of the Justice Department?\n  I say to the opponents of this amendment, in a perfect world, maybe \nyou are right. In the world that we live in today, you are not right. \nWe owe the American public a better system than the one that has been \nin place for the past several years.\n  While strengthening the Senate rules regarding disclosure, gifts, \nmeals, travel and post-employment lobbying is necessary and overdue, it \nis also of little importance if the rules are not enforced. Instances \nof apparent violations of congressional rules by Members and staff who \nwere the beneficiaries of Mr. Abramoff's largesse were widely reported. \nPress accounts of luxury trips, high-priced tickets to sporting events, \nmeals at expensive restaurants, and other gifts suggest that there had \nbeen flagrant, if not widespread, violations of our rules, and that \nthese violations had been occurring for some time.\n  As the columnist and scholar Norman Ornstein has observed, Congress \nhas ``regularly struggled with its constitutional responsibility to \npolice itself, sometimes verging on partisan vendettas--what we called \nin the 1980s and 1990s `the criminalization of partisan differences'--\nbut more often erring on the side of doing nothing, or as little as \nhumanly possible, to deal with ethical violations.''\n  At a time when the public is demanding change, the Senate needs to \nmore aggressively enforce its own rules. We should do this not just by \nmaking more public the work that the Senate Ethics Committee currently \nundertakes, but by addressing the conflict that is inherent in any body \nthat regulates itself. By creating, as this amendment would do, a new \noffice with the capacity to conduct and initiate investigations, and a \nperspective uncolored by partisan concerns or collegial relationships, \nI believe we can address this long-standing structural problem.\n  This amendment strikes a good balance by keeping with the Select \nCommittee on Ethics the final decisions on whether to conduct an \ninvestigation, whether a violation has occurred, and whether to refer \nthe matter to the Department of Justice, while adding an independent \nvoice to the process to ensure that the reputation of the institution \nis not sacrificed for the understandable concern for the reputation of \none's friends and colleagues.\n  The Office of Public Integrity would not only assist in performing \nexisting investigative functions, but would also be charged with the \nnew function of approving or denying requests for travel by Members and \nstaff. The purpose of this pre-clearance is to ensure that the trips \nserve a legitimate Governmental interest, and are not substantially \nrecreational in nature. I believe that the Office of Public Integrity \nwould be an appropriate entity to conduct these reviews.\n  I urge the majority and minority leaders to allow an up or down vote \non this amendment. The American public is watching.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by Senator \nLieberman.\n  Madam President, there are many organizations that are observing our \nactivities. I think, as I said earlier, we can be pleased at some of \nthe progress we are making. But this would be a seminal vote. This will \nbe an indication that we are really serious, if we are really serious, \nabout making sure that decisions made by the Ethics Committee are \nuntainted by personal relationships or by other factors. I think it is \nlong overdue.\n  I want to point out again that in the exit polling from the 2006 \nelection there were two major issues that affected the voters' opinion \nand vote. One, as we all know, was the war in Iraq. The other was the \nissue of ``corruption in Washington.''\n\n  The American public are very dissatisfied with the way Congress \nconducts its business. I have seen polls in the low twenties and even \nin the high teens of their approval rating of Congress. They don't \nthink we conduct our business in an honest and straightforward manner, \nand they believe the special interests have way too much influence in \ndetermining both our priorities and the outcome of legislation.\n  I believe the Lieberman amendment can go a long way toward restoring \nthe very badly tarnished image of the Congress of the United States.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 9\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to take a few minutes to urge my \nSenate colleagues to carefully study and support my amendment to ban \nspouses of sitting Members of the Senate from lobbying any Member of \nthe Senate or any Senate staff person.\n  This is a very important debate. It goes to the heart of rebuilding \nconfidence of the American people in our institutions--Senate, House, \nall of Congress, all of the Federal Government.\n  As we all know, we have seen scandal after scandal over several \nyears, certainly involving both parties, that has, for obvious and good \nreason, rocked people's confidence.\n  At the heart of almost all of these scandals is a very simple, basic \nissue and that is public officials using their public position to \nenrich themselves, to enrich their family, and, of course, the public \ninterest being sold down the road.\n  That is at the heart of this debate, and that concern is at the heart \nof my amendment. Again, my amendment--we will vote on this later this \nweek--says very simply: No spouse of a sitting Member of the Senate can \nlobby the Senate, can lobby that Senator, can lobby that Senator's \noffice, can lobby any Senator, can lobby any Senate office, can lobby \nany Senate committee.\n  Again, I don't think this is a peripheral issue. I think it goes to \nthe heart of the matter: People using public office to enrich \nthemselves, to enrich their families.\n  For the same reason, I thought it was important that we prohibit \nfamily members from going on the campaign payroll. Unfortunately, that \nwas voted down. I think this is even more in need of strong action \nbecause certainly lobbying connections were at the heart of so many of \nthe scandals that got us to this debate.\n  There are two big problems, two big conflicts we are talking about \nthat this amendment can largely solve. One is for certain lobbyists to \nhave undue influence. That is clearly an issue with regard to lobbying \nof spouses of sitting Members of the Senate.\n  The underlying bill would prohibit those spouses from lobbying their \nspouse Member, that office. That is fine. But clearly, any Senate \nspouse is going to have an enormous advantage in terms of access and \ninfluence to other Senators and other Senate offices. Imagine if a \nspouse lobbyist walks in the door and his or her spouse happens to be \nthe chair of a committee on which the Member she is lobbying sits. That \nis a pretty significant power relationship right in the midst of that \nlobbying. Clearly, there is that real danger of undue influence and \naccess.\n  There is a second problem too. In my opinion, the second problem is \neven\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\nbigger than the first, and that is for a special interest, for a monied \ninterest, to have a mechanism to write a big check straight into the \nfamily bank account of a sitting Senator, to directly and dramatically \nincrease the income, the personal wealth of a sitting Senator. That \nabsolutely happens whenever you are going to allow spouses of sitting \nSenators to lobby.\n  Again, that I think is an even bigger issue and certainly has been \nfront and center in terms of a number of problems and scandals that \nhave come up and reported fully in the media in the last couple of \nyears on both sides of the aisle.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that this recent article \nabout the problem, about that very issue in the Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 17, 2007]\n\n             Lawmakers' Lobbying Spouses Avoid Hill Reforms\n\n                           (By John Solomon)\n\n       When Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) rose to the Senate floor \n     last summer and passionately argued for keeping the federal \n     estate tax, he left one person with an interest in retaining \n     the tax unmentioned.\n       The multibillion-dollar life-insurance industry, which was \n     fighting to preserve the tax because life insurers have a \n     lucrative business selling policies and annuities to \n     Americans for estate planning, has employed Dorgan's wife as \n     a lobbyist since 1999.\n       A few months earlier, Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) had \n     pleaded for restraint as she urged colleagues to avoid \n     overreacting to the news that the Bush administration had let \n     a United Arab Emirates company take over operations at six \n     U.S. ports. At the same time, her husband, Robert J. Dole, a \n     former senator and presidential nominee, was registered to \n     lobby for that company and was advising it on how to save the \n     deal from the political firestorm.\n       At least half a dozen congressional spouses have jobs as \n     registered lobbyists and several more are connected with \n     lobbying firms, but reining in the practice to prevent \n     potential conflicts or the appearance of them has not been a \n     priority among congressional leaders. Even modest proposals \n     such as banning wives and husbands from lobbying their \n     spouses or using their spouses' floor privileges for lobbying \n     have gone nowhere.\n       Democrats made ethics reform a major issue in last fall's \n     congressional elections, but the ethics package the House \n     approved earlier this month didn't address the issue and \n     neither did the one proposed by Senate Democrats. Last week, \n     however, Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) proposed banning spouses \n     of senators from lobbying any part of the chamber. The lone \n     exception is for spouses who were lobbying at least one year \n     before their husband or wife was elected.\n       The Senate is scheduled to vote on the legislation as soon \n     as today. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) \n     called Vitter and said he would support the proposal with one \n     caveat: It should exempt spouses who are already lobbyists.\n       ``As long as it is not retroactive, Senator Reid supports \n     efforts to ban spouses of sitting members from lobbying in \n     the future,'' spokesman Jim Manley said. Vitter said he will \n     not support Reid's proposal. ``I think this goes to one of \n     the fundamental issues in this whole debate and that is \n     officeholders using their office to increase their personal \n     and family income. It doesn't get any more basic than that,'' \n     Vitter said.\n       Massie Ritsch of the Center for Responsive Politics, a \n     nonpartisan group that studies political donations and ethics \n     in Washington, said that if senators decide that a lobbying \n     ban is necessary, it makes no sense to exempt current \n     spouses.\n       ``If there is a problem here, it is that family members can \n     get access to lawmakers that other people don't. And if they \n     exempt the current spouses, then they are making it all the \n     more exclusive. Those family members will seem all the more \n     special.''\n       Vitter's legislation does not apply to the House. It also \n     does not address lawmakers' siblings and children, another \n     growth area in lobbying. Vitter said he wanted to make the \n     plan broader but was not assured of a vote, so he scaled it \n     back to Senate spouses.\n       Elected to the Senate in 2004, Vitter took an initial foray \n     into ethics reform more than a year ago, proposing the \n     spousal lobbying ban as well as the end of large tribal \n     donations like those seen in the Jack Abramoff lobbying \n     scandal. But his plans went nowhere when his own party was in \n     charge.\n       Vitter had garnered scrutiny during the scandal when it was \n     learned that, as a House member in 2002, he had written a \n     letter opposing a casino for an Indian tribe that rivaled \n     Abramoff's clients. Vitter had taken donations from \n     Abramoff's tribal clients but had refunded the money. He said \n     he always has opposed gambling.\n       With Democrats in control of Congress and promising broad \n     ethics reform, Vitter tried again. Last week the Senate \n     rejected another of his proposals--one to end the practice of \n     lawmakers hiring relatives and paying them with Senate \n     office, campaign or political action committee money.\n       Typically, according to their offices, those senators with \n     lobbyist-spouses do not let their spouses lobby them or their \n     staff personally. The rest of the Senate and Congress, \n     however, is usually fair game.\n       Robert Dole's office said that while he registered to lobby \n     for DP World, he never contacted the Senate and instead \n     focused on giving advice. Nonetheless, his work during the \n     political firestorm over port security helped earn his firm \n     $320,000 in the first half of 2006, records show.\n       Kimberly Olson Dorgan is registered as a lobbyist for the \n     American Council of Life Insurers and worked on several \n     issues, including the estate tax. She now has moved into an \n     executive job. Barry Piatt, a spokesman for Byron Dorgan, \n     said that the senator long opposed repealing the estate tax, \n     that his position was consistent with that of most Democrats \n     and that his wife's job had no bearing.\n       Piatt noted that Dorgan once was at odds with his wife's \n     lobby when he supported exempting income under $10 million \n     from the estate tax.\n       Though the Dorgans built a voluntary wall between them, it \n     doesn't extend to the senator's reelection campaign. His \n     wife's lobbying group gave the senator's campaign $2,000 from \n     its political action committee in 2004. And other life \n     insurers have donated tens of thousands of dollars to \n     Dorgan's campaign, Federal Election Commission records show.\n       Among the other senators with lobbyist wives are Ted \n     Stevens (R-Alaska) and Kent Conrad (D-N.D.).\n       Catherine A. Stevens has been a registered lobbyist for the \n     Washington firm of Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, whose past \n     clients include media giant Bertelsmann AG and the famed King \n     Ranch in Texas, lobbying records show. She did not return \n     calls to her office seeking comment.\n       Lucy Calautti, Conrad's wife and a former chief of staff to \n     Dorgan, is registered to lobby for Major League Baseball's \n     commissioner's office, which paid her firm at least $360,000 \n     in the first half of 2006, according to the most recent \n     lobbying reports on record with the Senate. She did not \n     return calls to her office seeking comment. Conrad spokesman \n     Chris Thorne said that the senator and his wife have a firm \n     rule prohibiting her from lobbying his Senate office and \n     staff.\n       On the House side, Abigail Blunt, the wife of House \n     Minority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), has lobbied for years for \n     Altria Group, the parent company for Kraft Foods and tobacco \n     firm Philip Morris. The couple were married in 2003 and \n     decided about a year ago that Abigail would no longer lobby \n     any part of the House, Blunt's office said yesterday. And \n     Jennifer LaTourette, the wife of Rep. Steven C. LaTourette \n     (R-Ohio), has been registered in recent years to lobby for \n     several interests, including health-care companies and \n     Cleveland's port authority.\n       Other congressional spouses have ties to lobbying even \n     though they aren't formally registered in Washington. Ray \n     Hutchison, the husband of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.), \n     works at the Vinson & Elkins firm, whose lobbying clients \n     have included corporate giants such as 7-Eleven, Goldman \n     Sachs and Halliburton.\n       Senate Democratic Whip Richard J. Durbin's wife, Loretta \n     Durbin, runs a lobbying firm called Government Affairs \n     Specialists. But Durbin's office said she limits her lobbying \n     to their home state of Illinois and recuses herself from any \n     federal matters that could affect her husband's work in the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. VITTER. Certainly.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is my understanding, initially, the Senator's \namendment had a grandfather clause. Does it now contain that \ngrandfather clause?\n  Mr. VITTER. No, it does not. I appreciate the question. In developing \nthis amendment, we dealt with a lot of different ideas and a lot of \ndifferent versions. I mistakenly filed a version with the grandfather \nclause in it. That was never my intent, in terms of filing an amendment \nin this Congress and in this debate. As soon as I learned that from my \nstaff, I amended the amendment, and so it does not contain that \ngrandfather clause.\n  My thinking is very simple. If it is wrong, it is wrong. If it is a \nconflict, it is a conflict. If it is a problem, it is a problem. And \nbecause somebody has been doing it for a few years doesn't right the \nwrong.\n  I do have an exception, which is different from a grandfather clause. \nI bent over backward to try to meet every reasonable argument. The \nexception says: If the spouse lobbyist was a lobbyist a year or more \nbefore the marriage or a year or more before the Member's first \nelection to Congress, that is a bit of a different situation that is \nallowed.\n  I can make an argument for even doing away with that exception, but I \ntried to bend over backward for what I considered any legitimate \nargument.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, may I ask a second question?\n\n[[Page S640]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Certainly.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So anyone who doesn't meet the specific confines of \nthe Senator's bill would be forced to lose their job; is that correct?\n  Mr. VITTER. No, it is not correct, for the following reason: My \namendment, first of all, applies only to Senate spouses lobbying the \nSenate. It doesn't apply to the House, it doesn't apply to Federal \nagencies, it doesn't apply to State legislatures. It doesn't apply to \nall sorts of other things. To be quite honest and direct, I would like \nto have it apply more broadly to all of Congress, but to make my \namendment germane, I have to forgo that.\n  I think that is a direct answer to the Senator's question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SALAZAR addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wish to emphasize what I stated to the \ndistinguished Senator from California. I tried to meet every legitimate \nargument. I bent over backward with regard to that issue. Specifically, \nI point out that the exception in my amendment that says, quite simply, \nif the spouse lobbyist was a lobbyist a year or more prior to the \nmarriage or a year or more prior to the Member's first election to the \nHouse or Senate, then that is an exception, and they can continue \nlobbying.\n  Every other case is a real problem, a real conflict, and specifically \nI don't think a grandfather clause that protects folks who are doing it \nnow is appropriate. If it is wrong, it is wrong. If it is a conflict, \nit is a conflict. If it poses real ethical questions--that is true \nwhether one has been doing it for 10 years or whether one starts \ntomorrow--I urge all the Senate to reject that grandfather clause.\n  The message of a grandfather clause is simple: Yes, we are going to \nget serious about ethics, as long as it doesn't do anything in \npractice, as long as it doesn't affect our friends.\n  I don't think that is the right policy. I don't think that is the \nright message.\n  I urge all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to support this \namendment. The American people are watching this debate. They have seen \nthe leadup to this debate. They have seen the scandals. They have seen \nthe rhetoric in the campaigns, and they are wondering: Is this going to \nbe real or is this going to be a farce?\n  We have had some votes, quite frankly, that are leading folks to \nbelieve this is a lot of show, a lot of sound and fury with nothing \nbehind it. I hope we can prove those cynics wrong, but I have to admit, \nI am quickly becoming one of those cynics.\n  I believe this vote is going to say a lot about how serious we are. \nIf there is a vote on the grandfather clause issue, that is going to \nsay a lot about whether we are going to act when it has a consequence \nin this body or just act when it doesn't affect anybody in this body as \nit stands now.\n  Madam President, I urge all my colleagues to look at the amendment, \nsupport the amendment, certainly resist any grandfather clause which \nwould be horrible policy, and send a very simple message to the \nAmerican people. I look forward to a fuller debate on the issue and a \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 71\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \namendment No. 71, which was offered and cosponsored by myself and \nSenator Ben Nelson from Nebraska. The essence of the amendment we \noffered last night is to try to make sure that as we move forward with \nethics reform in Washington, DC, a spotlight not just be on the Senate \nor the House of Representatives but that the ethics standards we are \nmoving forward with in this legislation, which will be a hallmark piece \nof legislation for Washington and for our Nation's Government, that \nthose same kinds of high ethical standards should also apply to the \nsenior executive officials of the executive branch of Government, as \nwell as to the judicial branch of Government.\n  The essence of our amendment is to say, as we clean up Washington, \nDC, that we ought not to stop simply by cleaning up the affairs of the \nCongress; that what we ought to do is adopt a set of ethical standards \nthat will also apply to the executive branch and to the judicial branch \nof Government.\n  As we move forward with that principle, what we have tried to do in \nthis amendment is very simple. Let me discuss three important aspects \nof this legislation.\n  First, our amendment would apply to the gift and travel ban--which \nwill become the rules of this Senate on passage of this bill--to senior \nand very senior executive and judicial branch personnel. After passage \nof this bill, we in the legislative branch will operate under a \nstringent set of rules which will ban gifts and travel from lobbyists, \namong other things. Currently, executive branch personnel can, with few \nexceptions, accept gifts, except from a few so-called prohibited \nsources. Simply put, there is no reason why lobbyists should be able to \ngive gifts--no matter how small--to senior employees of the executive \nand judicial branches.\n  Second, the amendment would ban all executive branch personnel from \nlobbying their former agency for 1 year after leaving Government \nservice. Currently, the revolving door rules in the executive branch \napply only to senior and very senior personnel. That means junior \nemployees of any executive branch agency are permitted to go directly \nfrom a Government job to a position of lobbying their former office. \nThat, in my view, is an unethical thing to do. Meanwhile, here in the \nSenate, all Members and staff are subject to at least some form of a \nrevolving-door rule, and the bill we are debating would strengthen \nthose rules for the Senators as well as for staff. Simply put, there is \nno reason the executive branch personnel, no matter how junior, should \nbe permitted to lobby their former office immediately upon leaving \nGovernment service.\n\n  Third, the amendment would require senior and very senior executive \nbranch personnel to disclose to the Office of Government Ethics any \nnegotiation for private employment within 3 business days. The bill we \nare now debating would require Senators and senior Senate staff to \ndisclose to the Ethics Committee that they are negotiating for private \nemployment within 3 business days. There is no principled reason this \nrule should not apply equally to senior executive branch employees as \nwell.\n  This is a narrowly drafted attempt to apply some of the key \nprovisions of this bill to other branches of Government. It is based on \nboth principle and practical concerns. The principle is that ethics \nrules should apply uniformly across the Government of the United \nStates. The practical concern is that key Government personnel should \nnot accept any gifts from parties seeking action by the Government, \nthat all legislative and executive employees should adhere to minimum \nrevolving-door standards, that senior officials should not negotiate \nfor future employment in secret, and that negotiations should be fully \ndisclosed.\n  I support Senator Nelson's amendment, and I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to accept this amendment as we move forward in an effort to try \nto clean up Washington, DC. At the end of the day, this is much more \nthan just about dealing with the ethics issues of the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives; this should be an effort from all of us to \nsend a loud and clear signal to the people of America that we are \ntaking ethics seriously and that we are going to bring a new standard \nof conduct, a new standard of ethics across all the branches of our \nNation's Government.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to ask a couple of \nquestions about the Vitter-Inhofe amendment, amendment No. 3. I think \nit is one thing if the amendment is prospective and doesn't affect \npeople. I think it is another thing when it is retroactive. I believe \nour side would accept\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\nthe amendment if it were, in fact, prospective.\n  The amendment has a complicating factor in addition to that; that is, \nthere is a prohibition against any official contact with any spouse of \na Member who is a registered lobbyist under the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct. That is not any lobbying contact, it is official contact. Now, \nwhat is official contact? Does this mean the spouse, if he or she \nhappens to have been a lobbyist for a substantial period of time, \ncannot attend the Supreme Court dinner which just took place? That \ncould be interpreted as an official contact. Is it an official contact \nif the individual calls the scheduler of her husband's or his wife's \noffice and asks for some information on the schedule? I am surprised--\nand I didn't know this--that this amendment has the words ``official \ncontact.'' You can be sure that even if it said: Well, it is not an \nofficial contact, that someone will make the argument: Oh yes, it is an \nofficial contact if you attend the Supreme Court dinner with your \nspouse.\n  Again, I would repeat, this is retroactive legislation. We know it \naffects people in this body who have worked, helped support their \nfamilies. I don't recall another time when we have enacted this kind of \nlegislation.\n  So it concerns me, and it concerns me if it is overly repressive, \nsuch as using the words ``official contact.'' I am puzzled as to why, \nwhen the majority leader offered that if it had a grandfather clause, \nwe would accept it, it wasn't taken, unless the intent is essentially \nto sever people from their ability to have anything to do with this \nbody, whether it is simply as a spouse or as a professional.\n  So I have some concerns about this amendment, and I wanted to take \nthis opportunity to express them, and hopefully the author will \nrespond.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from California for \nthose points and questions. Let me respond to each one.\n  First, I think what you said, literally at the very beginning of your \ncomments, says it all. You said this would be fine if it didn't affect \nanyone, but it does. This would be window dressing if it didn't affect \nanyone, if it did not do anything. But, yes, it does. And it should.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield, please?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will be happy to, after I finish my comment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Because I said ``presently employed,'' if I may, \nthrough the Chair. To clarify that, I said anybody ``presently \nemployed.'' We know it affects people. We know it would affect people \nin the future. We also know it affects people presently employed.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming my time, the point is, yes, it is a great vote \nas long as it doesn't affect anyone here, as long as it doesn't affect \nanyone in the body now, as long as it doesn't affect any spouse.\n  I disagree. If it is a conflict, it is a conflict. If it is a \nproblem, it is a problem. Having done it in the past doesn't cure the \nconflict, doesn't cure the problem. I think demanding that a \ngrandfather clause be attached to this is the height of cynicism. We \nare going to reform things as long as it doesn't affect us. I think \nthat is bad policy and I certainly think it is a very negative message \nto send to the American people--although it may be a rather clear \nmessage about what this debate and exercise is all about.\n  In terms of the question about official contact, I think that is very \nclear because it is in the context of the lobbyist disclosure law. It \nis in the context of lobbyist contact. However, if the Senator \ncontinues to believe it is not clear and wants to offer any clarifying \nlanguage, I would look at that and work with the Senator. I will be \nhappy to work on clarifying language. Obviously, no one wants to \nprohibit spouses from going to the Supreme Court dinner or anything \nelse. I think that is a relatively--I don't think it is a problem. But \neven if you think it is one, I believe it is an easy problem to solve.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Certainly.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair, on line 5, if you substituted \n``lobbying'' for ``official,'' I think that would do it.\n  Mr. VITTER. I will be happy to look at that and respond to that \nsuggestion. Certainly, if there is any ambiguity there, and I don't \nthink there is, I will be eager to clarify it and work on it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. VITTER. Again, I think this goes to the heart of the matter. I \nthink this grandfather clause issue goes to the heart of the matter. \nAre we going to do something that ``doesn't affect anybody,'' that \ndoesn't matter in terms of people here and now and make a big show of \nit or are we going to make a difference and stop practices that the \nhuge majority of the American people think are a real problem?\n  I hope we are going to do the latter. I hope we are going to be real \nand substantive and not go through a PR exercise, and I think the \nAmerican people are watching to find out. I think this, among other \nvotes, will be a clarifying moment.\n  I thank the Senator for her questions and I look forward to \ncontinuing the discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I thank the Senator. \nPerhaps our staffs can get together directly and take a look at this. I \nappreciate it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S641-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, one of the best things about the Senate \nand the character of this place and the opportunity it provides all of \nus is we are privileged to work with people as our experts on our \ncommittees and our aides who, even more than many of us, dedicate \ndecades to this institution and to the causes that bring them to public \nservice.\n  They do it selflessly, never seeking the headlines but always trying \nto shape those headlines, making contributions that are most often left \nin the unwritten history of this institution and of the country.\n  The fact is, though, as my colleagues know, it is these individuals \nand their commitment that really writes that history and makes an \nunbelievable contribution to the country as a whole.\n  One such person I have had the privilege of working with for the \nentire time I have been here, for 22-plus years. No one is a more \ndedicated, harder working, more idealistic, passionate, and effective \nexample of that special kind of public service than Dr. Nancy Stetson \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who is retiring this year \nafter over 25 years of remarkable service--groundbreaking service, \nreally--to the Senate.\n  As a young and idealistic doctoral student, Nancy first came to \nWashington to work on her thesis and to ask the question whether a \nsingle legislator could make a difference in the shaping of American \nforeign policy. Her subject was Senator ``Scoop'' Jackson and the long \nrecord that he amassed in the Cold War through the legislation that to \nthis day bears his name, the Jackson-Vanik waiver.\n  Nancy found that on Capitol Hill, despite the Historians' fixation on \nthe rise and fall of the imperial Presidency, one Senator can make a \nlasting impact on America's role in the world. But it has really been \nfor her role to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and to me \npersonally that I want to pay her tribute today.\n  She began working for Senator Pell from her beloved home State of \nRhode Island and, then, of course, for Chairman Biden. I really \ninherited her in a sense from Senator Pell because when we came into \nthe majority in 1986, Senator Pell was a chairman who believed in \ndelegating responsibility. I was then the chairman of one of the \nsubcommittees that had jurisdiction over the\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\nState Department budget and a number of issues that sort of brought \nNancy to me.\n  So there she was, one Senate staffer with a lot more knowledge on how \nthe committee and the Senate worked than I had. She was committed, \ndogged, and determined to make this kind of impact or to affect the \nlife of a Senator life who was trying to make that impact.\n  So I ask my colleagues to consider the legacy of this remarkable \nstaff person. Among her many proud accomplishments as a senior aide on \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee was the South Africa sanctions \nbill and the normalization of relations between America and Vietnam \nthat culminated in the signing of the United States-Vietnam trade \nagreement in the last Congress.\n  I am also particularly proud of Nancy's work as the principal \narchitect of the Vietnam Education Foundation and the Vietnam Fulbright \nProgram. These are two programs that we worked on during the 1990s \ntogether, but it was really her sense of the possible and her \nwillingness to do a lot of the detail work that helped to bring them to \nmaturity.\n  Working with a very close friend of mine, a Vietnam veteran from \nMassachusetts, we helped to shape, and she helped to shape, what is now \nthe largest Fulbright program of the U.S. Government, the program with \nVietnam. We have students from Vietnam studying at Harvard in \nMassachusetts and likewise professors and others going from Harvard to \nVietnam to help train their new technicians and leaders of the future.\n  I think Nancy and I both believed for the years we spent in a war \nthat became so controversial and tore this country apart--which set out \nas our goal to transform a country, Vietnam--that this was the best way \nto complete that task; that the war in a sense had not ended, and there \nwas a way to try to ultimately make peace with Vietnam, with ourselves, \nand build a new future for that country and for ours.\n  This Vietnam Education Foundation and this Fulbright program have \nbeen instrumental in helping us to do that. And today, Vietnam is \nsimply a transformed, extraordinarily different country. It was an \ninnovative policy, and it was a master stroke of public diplomacy for \nwhich Nancy deserves enormous credit. Without her vision and her \nperseverance, we would not be able to talk today, in foreign policy, in \nterms that say that Vietnam is not just a war but a country. It became \na country because of this kind of effort and this kind of outreach in \nthe consciousness of Americans.\n\n  We have a relationship today that we could have never imagined when \nso many of us were in uniform so many years ago. It is no exaggeration \nto say that entire effort of normalization also was part of Nancy's \ncraftsmanship. And I will talk about that in a moment.\n  In addition to the normalization with Vietnam, Nancy contributed \nenormously to global health issues and to some of the most significant \npolicies of any industrialized country against diseases of poverty. Her \nwork on malaria, TB, and AIDS, where she fought to significantly \nincrease the U.S. contribution to the Global AIDS Fund, were among her \nproudest accomplishments. People across the world today literally owe \ntheir lives to Nancy's work.\n  I remember when we began that effort, Senator Helms was then \nchairman, and a lot of people said: You are never going to get anything \nthrough this committee. Well, with slow and steady work, we not only \ngot it through the committee, we got Senator Helms, to his credit, to \nbe one of the principal cosponsors of this effort.\n  Together with Senator Frist, we drafted the first original \ncomprehensive plan on AIDS that passed the Senate and which became the \ncenterpiece of how we are approaching particularly Sub-Sahara and \nAfrica today, but really our global efforts to try to deal with this \nscourge that is growing, I might say notwithstanding those efforts, for \nlack of global initiative and effort to focus on it.\n  Over the last 22 years in the Senate, Nancy Stetson and I traveled to \nmany parts of the world. We went to Latin America, to Central America, \nto East Asia, to the Middle East, to dozens of countries on more trips \nthan I can count. And I will tell you something. Nancy has the ability \nto win the ``Amazing Race,'' for those of you who have ever seen it. \nShe secured meetings with heads of state, Nobel Prize winners, and \nunsung health advocates in some of the poorest countries of the world.\n  She pulled me and other staffs through the wilds of Myanmar, \nnegotiated travel to remote areas of Vietnam, handled the logistical \ncomplexities of visiting Indonesia, Cuba. She gave up weekends, \nholidays, and vacations. And on trips she would stay up into the night, \npreparing for a press conference or a speech or a policy statement, and \nconvincing the hotel business centers to open at 2 a.m. in Hanoi or \nBangkok.\n  She gave up her 50th birthday. We celebrated it in New Delhi. It is \nhard to overstate the long hours, the incredible effort, the passion, \nand the personal sacrifice that Nancy has put into working for me and \nfor her country.\n  She was indefatigable, and I am incredibly grateful. I might add that \non occasion there were some very tricky moments in Vietnam when we were \ntrying to open prisons and open the history centers in order to resolve \nthe issue of POW-MIA, and it required some delicate negotiations. For \nAmerican soldiers to be reentering Vietnamese prisons and communities \nby helicopter was an emotional leap for the Vietnamese to make. Nancy \nbuilt wonderful relationships with leaders, with those people who could \nmake those doors open. And, indeed, they did. I am grateful to her for \nthat.\n  She was incredibly loyal, brilliant, blunt, honest, absolutely smart \nas a tack, and wiley. She always asked the questions that needed to be \nasked of me. Time and time again, when I failed to ask the right \nquestion before a witness at our committee, I could always expect that \ntap on the shoulder and the passing of a note, a reminder from Nancy of \nwhat really should have been said or really should have been asked.\n  Part prosecutor, part conscience, part intellectual, on matters of \nforeign policy, I was proud to think of her as an alter ego. And I hope \nthat in some of my better moments, if there were a few, she thought the \nsame of me.\n  She could step in as a surrogate Senator at the drop of a hat, and I \nmean that literally. When a massive fire took the lives of six of our \nfirefighters in Worcester, MA, immediately--I was in Asia at the time \nin Myanmar and about to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi--and I immediately \ncanceled all my meetings and flew back to be in Worcester. But Nancy \nstayed there and soldiered on and went to my meetings for me. In Burma, \nmeeting with dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, she was herself living out her \nown commitment on the diplomatic stage with poise and with courage and \nwith intelligence that I think is a credit to the Senate.\n  Nancy's first love was Africa. She started her career focusing on it. \nMany years later, she returned to work on the devastating health issues \nplaguing the continent now. She had a knack for seeing reality quicker \nthan most. She was never swept up by the headlines or the political \nsales pitch.\n  She was prescient in seeing the disastrous path that has played out \nin Iraq for what it is and for helping me to devise a policy going \nforward. She has never been afraid to act on her conscience.\n  Nancy is headed now to Massachusetts to become the vice president for \nhealth policy at the New England Health Care Institute. Her Senate \nfamily will miss her more than we can ever properly express. Even as we \nwish her good luck and much happiness in her new endeavor, I hope she \nknows she is not going to escape my badgering e-mails or 3 a.m. phone \ncall from Baghdad or Amman to mine her thoughts.\n\n  I have worked with Nancy longer and probably more closely than I have \nworked with just about anyone in my time in the Senate. As I mentioned, \nwe traveled the world together. Although she may not realize it--I may \nnot have said it in so many words in those long flights to Asia or \nback, or during the many long hours and late nights here in the \nSenate--I know in my heart I could not have done it without her energy, \nwithout her drive, her grit, her tough-mindedness, and her loyalty.\n  She has worked long and hard without ever getting the credit she \nrightly\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\ndeserves for the amazing things she accomplished in her time in the \nSenate. So I just want to say thank you to this special woman for her \ncontributions to this institution and to our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Madam President, I felt it was important today to come \nto the floor and speak about the efforts of the House of \nRepresentatives to lower the cost of prescription drugs for our \nseniors. There has been a measure passed that will require that the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services negotiate prices. It sounds like \nsomething that is pretty straightforward and common sense: to negotiate \nthe very best price for our seniors and people with disabilities.\n  I know my distinguished colleague and friend, the now-ranking member \nof the Finance Committee, has spoken about his objection to that \napproach. I think it is important that we also have voices speaking out \nabout why we believe this makes sense for Medicare, for taxpayers, for \nour seniors, and for the disabled.\n  The facts really bear out that this makes sense. We are not talking \nabout whether we do research and development on new breakthrough drugs \nversus being able to get prices that are affordable for our seniors. \nThere is an ample way to be able to do both. In fact, we, as taxpayers, \nprovide a tremendous amount of the money that is currently being spent \non R, and it is important we know we can afford the medicine that we \nare helping to pay to have developed.\n  A report by Families USA, released last week, looked at the prices of \nprescription drugs most commonly used by our seniors. The conclusion \ncould not have been more clear. The report compared the prices the \nprivate Medicare Part D plans charge now and the prices charged by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, the VA, which negotiates, as we all \nknow, for the best price on behalf of America's veterans. The report \nshowed, again, what we have been seeing over the past year. The lowest \ndrug prices charged by the private Part D plans are significantly \nhigher than the prices obtained by the VA.\n\n  Among the top 20 most used drugs, the median difference between the \nlowest Part D plan and the lowest VA plan is 58 percent; 58 percent \ndifference between what the VA is able to do for veterans and taxpayers \nversus what is happening under the Medicare Part D plan. In other \nwords, for half of the drugs our seniors need most, the highest price \ncharged by the private drug plans is almost 60 percent higher. That \nmakes no sense. I hope we will act to change that.\n  It can be a lot worse, however. When we look at half of the top 20 \ndrugs, the highest price charged by a private plan is twice as high as \nthe average price through VA for the lowest priced drugs. Seniors and \npeople with disabilities who get their drugs through Medicare are \nforced to pay more because the law actually prohibits the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services from negotiating the best price. It is not \nonly that they are trying and are not able to do it; the law that was \npassed prohibits them from doing that. That does not make sense.\n  We have all heard from seniors, from families, from people with \ndisabilities across the country trying to wade through all of the \nprivate plans and the complexities and dealing with the doughnut hole, \nand so on. We know that, in fact, one of the reasons that there is that \ngap in coverage is that we are not using the purchasing power of the \nFederal Government through Medicare to get the best price so that our \ndollars and the dollars of the people on Medicare are stretched as far \nas possible to help people get the medicines they need.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is the Senator aware of the fact that there are well \nover 1 million veterans who have moved to Medicare Part D rather than \nthe veterans plan because they find that the restricted formulary in \nthe veterans plan has made it impossible for them to get the drugs they \nwant? And one of the reasons the VA plan is cheaper is because they are \nrationing drugs? Is the Senator aware of the fact that many veterans \nhave, in fact, moved to Medicare Part D for that reason?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, reclaiming my time, I am aware that, in fact, \nthere are veterans who have moved to the Medicare system. One of the \nreasons the House bill that passed did not include a national formulary \nwas because of those kinds of concerns. We are not talking about that. \nWe are talking about the ability to negotiate to get the best price. I \nwould also say, though, from the VA's standpoint, that there are \nmillions of veterans who are getting much better prices as a result of \nthe fact that they can negotiate the best price for veterans. We are \nworking to find that balance to provide a choice so that you can get \nthe specific prescription drug that you need but at the same time be \nable to get the best price. I don't know why we wouldn't want to do \nthat. It makes absolutely no sense not to do that.\n  We are seeing huge differences on prescription drugs that are \ncommonly used by our seniors. Let me give an example. Zocor, which is a \ndrug many seniors use for keeping their cholesterol levels under \ncontrol, the lowest VA price is about $127 a month. But people under \nMedicare are paying $1,486. We are talking about a difference of over \n1,000 percent. If you account for an aggressive R budget, if you \naccount for differences, there is a lot of wiggle room when you are \ntalking about a 1,000-percent difference in price between someone going \nthrough the VA and someone going through Medicare. I don't understand \nwhy we would not say to the Secretary of Health and Human Services: We \nwant you to negotiate a better price for Zocor.\n  There were 7.5 million veterans enrolled in the VA health system in \n2005. The administration estimated that over 29 million seniors were \nenrolled in private plans last year. So there are four times more \nseniors enrolled in Medicare than there are people under the VA system. \nAnd I do not understand--to me it defies logic--why we would not give \nthem the same negotiating power.\n  I would also like to give the Secretary a chance to negotiate a \nbetter price for Protonix, a drug that is commonly used to treat \nheartburn. The lowest VA price for Protonix for a year is $214.52. \nSeniors paying the lowest private Part D price have to pay $934 more to \nget their heartburn treated. Again, that makes no sense. Older \nAmericans are forced to pay 435 percent more for Protonix because the \nSecretary is forbidden from negotiating prices on behalf of our \nseniors. When we look at what is happening, the claim that private \nplans could actually negotiate a better price under Medicare but also \nunder Medicaid has not borne truth.\n  The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and expert testimony \nbefore the Finance Committee last week all indicated that, in fact, \ndrug prices are now higher for these individuals, those who were before \non Medicaid and now on Medicare. These are our poorest seniors and \npeople with disabilities. Our seniors are being charged more than \nveterans for the same drugs and our poorest seniors are not getting the \nprice break we had anticipated. It doesn't make sense to me why we \nwould be paying more and why prices would have gone up once Medicare \ncame into place for prescription drugs, why prices have gone up rather \nthan down.\n\n  There are two arguments that I am hearing all the time. One is that \nwe can't possibly rigorously negotiate for lower prices for seniors and \npeople with disabilities because we will see prices go down so much \nthat the companies will not be able to conduct research and development \non breakthrough drugs. At the same time, we hear also that negotiating \nwould not make a difference; it would not lower prices. It is\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\nimpossible to argue both of those positions at the same time. If \nnegotiating will, in fact, not lower prices, then it certainly can't \naffect R expenses. But yet both of those assertions are being made at \nthe same time.\n  We are all committed. This Congress last year appropriated $29 \nbillion for research and development through NIH. And I know the \ndistinguished Chair has been involved in advocating for those efforts \nas well as for Medicare. The fact that we have put into place $29 \nbillion of taxpayers' money indicates our commitment to R and to work \nwith the industry. The research that is done through that effort is \navailable free of charge to the industry. They are able to take that \ninformation. They are able to deduct as a business expense their R \nefforts, and they get a 10-percent tax credit for R efforts on top of \nthat for breakthrough drugs, all of which I support. We then give about \nan 18-year patent to protect a company from a particular drug. They \nhave to be able to recoup their costs and not have full competition \nfrom the private marketplace or from generic drugs. I, also, support \nthat.\n  All we are asking--all the people of the country are asking, \nparticularly our seniors and disabled--is that when one gets through \nwith the process they have invested in, they should be able to afford \nto buy the medicine. Medicine that is not affordable is not available, \nand health care today is becoming more and more a question of treatment \nthrough medicine.\n  I am hopeful we will move quickly. I know the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has held a hearing. We are grateful for that. I am hopeful we \nwill move forward together on a bill that will mirror what the House of \nRepresentatives has done in order to say that the Secretary should \nnegotiate the best price for medicine for our seniors, for people with \ndisabilities, and certainly for the taxpayers who are paying a \nsubstantial amount for this benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I would like to respond to my colleague \nfrom Michigan. I wish to talk a little bit about the minimum wage, but \nI would love to debate drug rationing. And that is what we are going to \nget to. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about \nadopting the VA system. For those seniors out there listening, you have \na limited list of drugs which are available. And by the way, you get \nthem through the VA. You get about 80 or 90 percent through mail order, \nthe rest at the VA, where my dad goes. I think he, also, may have an \naddition tied into Part D. I have seniors in Minnesota who like to go \nto the local pharmacy. I am struggling and fighting every day to keep \nrural pharmacies alive. You want to put a stake through the heart of \nrural pharmacies, of small business, talk about doing what the House is \ntalking about. We will have that debate another day.\n  Americans and Minnesotans like choice. Under Medicare Part D, the \npoorest of the poor are dual eligibles, and it is a program that is \nworking. Most of the seniors in my State who have Medicare Part D are \npretty happy. We have some challenges with the doughnut hole. But going \nto a system of limited choice, limited options and somehow saying that \nthat is going to be better than a system where you have millions of \nconsumers and, in effect, the bargaining goes on every day, if you \ndon't like one plan, you can go to the next, this plan has cost us less \nmoney. It is giving great choices. Our challenge is to keep our rural \npharmacies alive. This is not going to make that any better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S644-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S644-S645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I wish to talk about a bipartisan \neffort to increase the minimum wage. Last week, the House \noverwhelmingly passed legislation to increase the current minimum wage \nfrom $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. We will have a chance to deal with that in \nthe Senate. We are going to get a better bill out of the Senate. We are \ngoing to have some small business protection which is important. But we \ndo need to increase the minimum wage.\n  I have long supported increasing the minimum wage. I strongly believe \nthat Congress should ensure that the benefits of our strong economy go \nto everybody. My State of Minnesota is 1 of 29 that have sought to ease \nthe burden for minimum wage workers by increasing the minimum wage \nabove the Federal minimum wage. But it is well past time that Congress \nacted.\n  It has taken more than 9 years to finally reach the point where we \nwill be increasing the minimum wage, and it is about time. As a result \nof congressional inaction, the Federal minimum wage is actually at a \n50-year low, when we factor in inflation. That is simply not fair. It \nis not fair for our minimum wage workers who must deal with the ever-\nrising cost of day-to-day living.\n  There are some who argue that the vast majority of those receiving \nthe minimum wage don't come from poor families. They claim that those \nreceiving the minimum wage are middle income families, young, and work \npart time. I don't think the facts support that proposition. If \nCongress increases the minimum wage to $7.25, we are talking about \nhelping about 50 percent of the workers who come from poor and low-\nincome families. We are talking about helping out those Minnesotans who \nwork in the nearly 230,000 low-wage jobs who would benefit from an \nincrease. We are talking about 40 percent of hourly workers who are \nmaking $5.15 or less who are uninsured.\n  Congress needs to find bipartisan solutions to reduce the ranks of \nthe uninsured. We need to act to improve health care accessibility and \naffordability for all Americans, not the least of which are low-wage \nworkers. It is important to make the point that these same uninsured \nAmericans are also the ones who will benefit most from a hike in the \nminimum wage.\n  While I support increasing the minimum wage, I, also, support \ntargeted small business protection. I want to see the hit of an \nincrease in the minimum wage lessened. It is no good to increase the \nminimum wage if you are going to take away somebody's job. You have to \nlook at the impact on small business.\n  I am a former mayor, a member of the Small Business Committee. I \nunderstand the importance of small business to our economy. I believe \nthat America's future is tied to the growth of small business. Small \nbusinesses become big businesses, but they have to start small. They \nneed the kind of protection we are talking about, bipartisan relief.\n  I have introduced legislation--and apparently a bill will come out of \ncommittee--that will provide some protection. I want to make sure a \ncouple other things are in there, such as increasing expensing for \nsmall business. My small business owners tell me this is important. \nUnder this sort of expensing, businesses can take an immediate \ndepreciation deduction of up to $112,000 on taxes for qualified \nbusiness purchases. This is important to do the right kind of \nprotection and ensure that businesses can continue to hire workers and \ncontinue to grow and expand.\n\n  I applaud the Finance Committee today for passing small business \nrelief. I think it includes an extension of increased expensing and a \n15-year straight-line cost recovery period for qualified leasehold and \nrestaurant improvements. I am not going to get into the nitty-gritty, \nbut we are making progress. That is good.\n  I wish to comment on one other aspect of the minimum wage debate that \nis not included in the bill out of the Finance Committee. It is called \nthe tip credit. Although this is somewhat of a technical issue, at the \nend of the day this is about jobs, plain and simple.\n  So what is tip credit? With tip credit, employers can count a certain \npart of their employees' tips toward meeting their employees' minimum \nwage. Tip credit has long been on the books. Labor laws recognize it. I \nknow the State of New York has tip credit. I think there are 7 of the \nStates that do not have a tip credit; 43 States have it. Again, labor \nlaws recognize it, tax laws recognize it. It is an issue that impacts \nabout 10,000 Minnesota businesses and their workers--mostly in the \nhospitality industry, such as restaurant workers. Those are important \nbusinesses. They are gathering places in the community. They are the \ncornerstone of many of the communities.\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nThey form an important part of the State's tax base. The restaurants \nand those folks employed there are active in the community. They \nsponsor the local youth teams and support schools and neighborhood \nprojects. Restaurants are where Little Leaguers celebrate victories, \nfamilies celebrate special occasions, and tourists spend good money, as \nin my State of Minnesota. This is a way of life which is increasingly \nunder threat. Minnesota is one of seven States that do not have tip \ncredit. My hospitality industry is at a competitive disadvantage with \nrespect to those States which surround us which allow for tip credit. \nThose in the hospitality industry in our border areas are in \ncompetition with other States.\n  Minnesota has a minimum wage of $6.15 an hour. That is a good thing, \nbut it is not the case in our neighboring States. I think if we look at \nthe other chart, for instance, Wisconsin has an even higher minimum \nwage. Ours is $6.15 an hour, with a tip credit of $4.17. In Wisconsin, \nan employer pays a minimum hourly cash wage of $2.33 and can apply \n$4.17 of their employees' tips toward meeting the minimum wage of \n$6.50. The employers in Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, and North Dakota \nin the hospitality industry can pay employees less. There is a lower \ncost of doing business, which puts my employers at a competitive \ndisadvantage. We are at risk of losing jobs in these areas.\n  As I have always said, the best welfare program is a job program and \na housing program. Consider dining out in the border town of Moorhead, \nMN. Just across the river in Fargo, ND, there are more than 50 national \nchains, and there is only 1 in Moorhead.\n  Operating on an unfair playing field with North Dakota and Wisconsin, \nhospitality establishments have to make tough decisions, such as \nraising prices, cutting the workforce, reducing employee hours or, \nworse, shutting down in the State. Peggy Rasmussen, the owner of \nCountryside Cafe in Hamel, is seriously considering closing down her \nbusiness because of this tip credit issue. When businesses such as \nPeggy's shut down, their workers are left behind and so, too, are our \ncommunities.\n  This is a fundamental question of fairness. Forty-three States have \ntip credit. All of Minnesota's neighbors have tip credit. Minnesota \ndoes not.\n  I wish to make it clear that any change in the tip credit law is not \ngoing to result in a lowering of this wage for Minnesotans. Anything we \ndo needs to be prospective. I want to defend our restaurant employees. \nThis is what they are making. Over time, we can equalize some of the \ndisadvantage. We can do it in a way that doesn't support a tip credit \nthat would lessen a worker's minimum wage.\n  As we increase the minimum wage, which I have consistently said is \nthe right thing to do, let's also ensure that States such as Minnesota \ncan operate on a more level playing field with the rest of the 43 \nStates that have the tip credit. Without the tip credit, Minnesota's \nhospitality businesses and workers will continue to be hurt.\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have sought to improve the living \nstandards of America's hard-working families. Increasing the minimum \nwage is one way to do so. I look forward to voting with my colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle to increase the minimum wage.\n  It is my hope that the minimum wage proposal will also allow for tip \ncredit, which is critical to the future of Minnesota's businesses and \nworkers, which is, in the end, about fairness and, most importantly, \nabout keeping jobs in the States that need them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S645-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S645-S646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF TED TOTMAN\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to a staff \nperson, Ted Totman, who will retire this week after 23 years of public \nservice as a professional staff member in the U.S. Senate. I didn't \nknow it back then, but when Ted took a job for me in 1983 on the \nSubcommittee on Aging of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I \nhad hired someone who would be one of my closest, most trusted, and \nlongest serving advisers.\n  Ted was a professional staff member for the Subcommittee on Aging \nfrom May 1983 to February 1985. He was staff director during my \nchairmanship of that subcommittee from April 1985 to January 1987. Ted \nplayed a major role in developing and passing the 1984 Older Americans \nAct amendments and was a forward-looking, successful advocate for more \nattention to Alzheimer's disease, including expanding the number of \nAlzheimer's disease research centers, increasing funding for \nAlzheimer's disease research, and increasing funding for the care of \npeople with Alzheimer's disease. Ted also worked to help obtain funding \nfor two statistical centers on aging in the Census Bureau.\n  For the next 10 years, from January 1987 to January 1997, Ted served \nas a legislative assistant in my office, where he was responsible for \nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security retirement and disability policy, \nprivate pensions, and veterans issues. He was the leading staff member \nin the Congress for rural health initiatives. He worked to call \nattention to regional disparities in Medicare provider reimbursement \nwhich disadvantage rural providers, requested and achieved a major \nOffice of Technology Assessment study on the problems of delivering \nhealth care in rural areas, and supported the Medicare Dependent \nHospital Program and the EACH/RPCH hospital program. Ted's staff \nleadership helped to secure landmark amendments in the 1995 Finance \nCommittee reconciliation bill to ensure geographic equity in Medicare \nmanaged care and to reform Medicare's reimbursement for nonphysician \nprimary care providers. In addition, Ted spent countless hours helping \nIowans navigate the Federal health care programs.\n  In January 1997, I became, because of seniority, chairman of the \nSenate Special Committee on Aging. I asked Ted to be staff director. \nFor the next 3 years, Ted led the committee's work that focused on \npreparing for the retirement of the baby boom generation and rural \nhealth issues. The committee staff developed legislation on aging \npolicy issues, including Medicare, Social Security retirement, and \nprivate pensions, most of which was referred to the Committee on \nFinance, where I was also a member. Legislative initiatives included \nbills on Medicare dependent hospitals, consumer protections for \nparticipants in Medicare managed-care plans, and the program of all-\ninclusive care for the elderly, and that comes under the acronym we all \nrecognize as the PACE Program. Staff developed and helped enact the \nBalanced Budget Act in 1997, provisions that provided greater \nreimbursement equity to managed-care plans that operated in rural \ncommunities. As staff director, Ted also led the pursuit of an active \noversight and investigative agenda, including a pivotal review of the \nquality of care in nursing homes and the management of the oversight of \nquality of care in the nursing homes by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration. Let me say for the distinguished Presiding Officer, the \nprevious administration helped us very much get that through so that we \nnow are adequately enforcing overview of nursing homes, as one example.\n  Ted helped to raise the profile of many issues of importance not only \nto older Americans but to our society as a whole.\n  In January of 2001, I became chairman of the Senate Committee on \nFinance, and Ted was there again to provide valuable leadership. When I \nasked him to stay on, at a time he was thinking of retiring, as deputy \nstaff director, he was an integral part of the success of the \ncommittee's work during the next 6 years and oversaw staff work on \nmajor initiatives, including the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, \nthe health provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act, the PRIDE Act, and \nthe authorization of the Safe and Stable Families legislation.\n  Once again, Ted helped to ensure an active oversight program that \nfocused on fraud and abuse in the health care system, problems in the \nprocess by which the Food and Drug Administration approves medications \nand devices, the quality of care in nursing homes, and the management \nby the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of the survey and \ncertification system for nursing homes. That was an ongoing issue back, \nas I referred to, when I was chairman of the Committee on Aging.\n\n[[Page S646]]\n\n  Ted's work on the staff of the Finance Committee is so highly \nrespected that the members signed a resolution expressing gratitude and \nrespect for Ted's service and dedication.\n  In addition to his 23 years of service in the U.S. Senate, Ted worked \nfor 5 years for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and \nserved 2 years in the military.\n  In the Senate, Ted's policy acumen and understanding of the \ncomplexities of the legislative process, insight into the executive \nbranch of Government, political wit, as well as his strong work ethic \nand intellectual honesty and his evenhandedness and personal generosity \nhave made him remarkably effective and universally regarded.\n  Ted is a true public servant who was committed in his work to the \npeople of Iowa and of this great country. I am grateful for his loyalty \nand applaud his legacy of accomplishment. Ted has made a positive \ndifference in the lives of so many Grassley staff members, and his \ndaily presence will be greatly missed by all of us. We wish Ted well \nand look forward to continuing our friendship with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see my neighbor from across beautiful \nLake Champlain, the State of New York, here. If the managers of the \nbill have no objection, I will speak for 4 or 5 minutes about a matter \nthat has just come up. There has been a lot of interest in it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 7 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have no objection if we can add to that that following \nthe presentation of the Senator from Vermont, I will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

Madam President, earlier today, I spoke with the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. He is going to be testifying before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee tomorrow morning. We anticipate it will be \nfor much of the day. He wished to inform me, as he did Senator Specter, \nof some changes in the so-called FISA Program. I have been very \ncritical of the administration's actions through the National Security \nAgency--their wiretapping of Americans, wiretapping of people \nthroughout the country, and apparently doing so without obtaining any \nwarrants.\n  Interestingly enough, the information about this spying on Americans \ncame not from our administration reporting it either through the \nIntelligence Committee or the Judiciary Committee or the appropriate \ncommittees involved; it came out because, like so many other things we \nfind out about, we read about it first in the newspaper.\n  Apparently, the administration has decided not to continue this \nwarrantless spying program on Americans, but instead to seek approval \nfor all wiretaps from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. I \nsay this based on the letter sent to us. This is public; this is not a \nclassified matter. The law has required for years that they do it this \nway.\n\n  I welcome the President's decision not to reauthorize the NSA's \nwarrantless spying program because, as I have pointed out for some \ntime, and as other Senators on both sides of the aisle have pointed \nout, the program was, at very best, of doubtful legality.\n  Since this program was first revealed, I have urged this \nadministration to inform Congress of what the Government is doing and \nto comply with the checks and balances Congress wrote into law in the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  We know we must engage in all surveillance necessary to prevent acts \nof terrorism, but we can and we should do it in ways that protect the \nbasic rights of all Americans, including the right to privacy.\n  The issue has never been whether to monitor suspected terrorists--\neverybody agrees with that; all Americans do. The question is whether \nwe can do it legally and with proper checks and balances to prevent \nabuses. Providing efficient but meaningful court review is a major step \ntoward addressing those concerns.\n  I continue to urge the President to fully inform Congress and the \nAmerican people about the contours of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court order authorizing the surveillance program and of \nthe program itself. Only with meaningful oversight can we assure the \nbalance necessary to achieve security with liberty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from the Attorney \nGeneral, dated January 17, addressed to me and Senator Specter, which \nindicates copies to numerous other people, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The Attorney General,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter: I am writing to \n     inform you that on January 10, 2007, a Judge of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court issued orders authorizing the \n     Government to target for collection international \n     communications into or out of the United States where there \n     is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is \n     a member or agent of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist \n     organization. As a result of these orders, any electronic \n     surveillance that was occurring as part of the Terrorist \n     Surveillance Program will now be conducted subject to the \n     approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n       In the spring of 2005--well before the first press account \n     disclosing the existence of the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program--the Administration began exploring options for \n     seeking such FISA Court Approval. Any court authorization had \n     to ensure that the Intelligence Community would have the \n     speed and agility necessary to protect the Nation from al \n     Qaeda--the very speed and agility that was offered by the \n     Terrorist Surveillance Program. These orders are innovative, \n     they are complex, and it took considerable time and work for \n     the Government to develop the approach that was proposed to \n     the Court and for the Judge on the FISC to consider and \n     approve these orders.\n       The President is committed to using all lawful tools to \n     protect our Nation from the terrorist threat, including \n     making maximum use of the authorities provided by FISA and \n     taking full advantage of developments in the law. Although, \n     as we have previously explained, the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program fully complies with the law, the orders the \n     Government has obtained will allow the necessary speed and \n     agility while providing substantial advantages. Accordingly, \n     under these circumstances, the President has determined not \n     to reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance Program when the \n     current authorization expires.\n       The Intelligence Committees have been briefed on the highly \n     classified details of these orders. In addition, I have \n     directed Steve Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney General \n     for the Office of Legal Counsel, and Ken Wainstein, Assistant \n     Attorney General for National Security, to provide a \n     classified briefing to you on the details of these orders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I was a prosecutor for 8 years. I enjoyed \nbeing a prosecutor. But I also was well aware that we acted within \nchecks and balances. Courts had their role, prosecutors had their role, \ndefense attorneys had their role. It only worked when everybody did \nwhat they were supposed to, including the executive.\n  I was also a prosecutor and on the board of the National District \nAttorneys Association at the time of COINTELPRO, a program of spying on \nAmericans who disagreed with the war in Vietnam, and even, we found out \nlater, spying on Martin Luther King because he was speaking so \nradically as to suggest that we might actually want equality between \npeople, no matter what their color might be, in this country.\n  Our Government was spying on people who objected to war. Our \nGovernment was spying on people who wanted integration in America. I \ndon't want us to go back to that point.\n  I shudder to think what might have happened if J. Edgar Hoover had \nhad all the electronic capabilities we have today. The only way we stop \nthis--it makes no difference if we have a Democratic or Republican \nadministration--the only way we stop it is with the checks and balances \nwe have built in.\n  FISA and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court came about \nbecause of illegal spying on Americans who were not committing any \nunlawful act, but were simply questioning what their Government was \ndoing. Many of us\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\nworry that has happened now. We have seen, for example, that the \nDepartment of Defense has had surveillance, has even recorded movies, \nof Quakers protesting war. Quakers always protest wars.\n  Madam President, I ask for 2 additional minutes, under the same \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. They always do this. We heard in the press that there has \nbeen surveillance of Vermonters who protested the war. I can save them \nmoney. Turn on C-SPAN. I do it all the time on the Senate floor, if \nthey want to find a Vermonter who may protest the war.\n  The question here is a greater one. What right does our Government--\nour Government, which is there to serve all of us--have to spy on \nindividual Americans exercising their rights?

Madam President, I have an amendment, No. 20, which I \nhave offered and which I believe we will be voting on at some point, if \nnot today then tomorrow. I rise to discuss the amendment and to share \nwith my fellow Senators comments that have been made about the \namendment by those groups in the Nation that would be most affected by \nit.\n  My amendment is very simple. It is a single sentence. It strikes \nsection 220 of the underlying bill. So the whole focus of this \ndiscussion has to be on section 220 and what is it and what does it do \nand why do I think it should be stricken.\n  If I can go back to the history of this bill, back to the Senate-\npassed bill we dealt with in the previous Congress, I can tell you \nwhere section 220 came from. It was an attempt to deal with what the \npress has labeled ``the astroturf groups.'' That is a little bit hard \nto understand.\n  What does astroturf have to do with anything here? There are \ngrassroots lobbyists and then there are groups the press has decided \nare phony groups pretending to be grassroots lobbyists. And it is these \nphony groups that they have labeled ``astroturf lobbyists'' and they \nthink something ought to be done about it.\n  Here is the theoretical definition of an astroturf lobbyist: An \nastroturf lobbyist is someone who gets paid, presumably by a large \norganization--a labor union, a corporation, a trade association, \nwhatever it might be--to pretend there is a groundswell of grassroots \nsupport or opposition for or to a particular piece of legislation. So \nthis hired gun, if you will, sends out letters, e-mails, faxes--\nwhatever it is--to stir up phony grassroots support for or against the \nparticular piece of legislation.\n\n  The idea was that this hired gun, this individual who does this is, \nin fact, a lobbyist, even though he or she never talks to a Member of \nCongress, even though he or she may not live in Washington, DC, or even \ncome here, even though he or she has no connection with any Member of \nCongress or the staff, because he or she is trying to stimulate \ncommunications to Congress that have the effect of putting pressure on \nCongress. He or she is a lobbyist and, therefore, must register, must \nreport who pays him or her, must go through all of the procedures \nconnected with a lobbyist under the Federal Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  Put in that narrow context, there may be some justification for \nsection 220.\n  Now let's step out of that hypothetical context and go to the real \nworld, and we discover that section 220 is pernicious in its effect, \nwhich is why it is opposed all across the political spectrum by those \nwho are involved in trying to put pressure on Congress by virtue of \ncommunicating with their Members.\n  On the right-hand side of the slate we have the Eagle Forum, on the \nleft-hand side of the slate, if you will, we have the ACLU, and all \nacross the spectrum we have a number of groups that are saying: Wait a \nminute, the prohibitions on astroturf lobbyists or grassroots \nlobbyists, as they are called in the bill, are prohibitions that cut to \nthe heart of the constitutional right of Americans to petition the \nGovernment for redress of their grievances.\n  I have a letter, a copy of which was sent to every Senator, from the \nACLU. Knowing what I know about senatorial offices, I think most \nSenators will not see the letter, so I will quote from it and at the \nend of my presentation ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord so that all Senators and their offices can read it.\n  Here is what the ACLU has to say about this particular provision:\n\n       Section 220, entitled ``Disclosure of Paid Efforts to \n     Stimulate Grassroots Lobbying'' imposes onerous reporting \n     requirements that will chill constitutionally protected \n     activity. Advocacy organizations large and small would now \n     find their communications to the general public about policy \n     matters redefined as lobbying and therefore subject to \n     registration and quarterly reporting. Failure to register and \n     report could have severe civil and potentially criminal \n     sanctions.\n\n  If I can end the quote there and insert this fact: When we adopted \nthe Vitter amendment on January 12, we raised that fine to $200,000. \nSomeone who gets his neighbors together and says, let's all write our \nCongressmen on this issue, and then spends some money doing it, under \nthis provision becomes a paid lobbyist, and if he does not report and \nregister would be fined $200,000 for having done that. The ACLU does \nnot overstate the case when they say this would have a chilling effect \non constitutionally protected activity.\n  If I can go back to the ACLU letter and continue quoting:\n\n       Section 220 would apply to even small, state grassroots \n     organizations with no lobbying presence in Washington. When \n     faced with burdensome registration and reporting \n     requirements, some of these organizations may well decide \n     that silence is the best option.\n\n  I guarantee you that if this small organization has a lawyer, the \nlawyer will advise them that silence is the best option. The lawyer \nwill say: You are exposing yourself to a $200,000 fine if you don't do \nthis right, and if you don't have the capacity to go through all of the \npaperwork and be sure you do this right, the best thing to do is simply \nnot try to stimulate anybody to write his Congressman or go visit the \nlocal congressional office.\n  Back to the letter from the ACLU:\n\n       It is well settled that lobbying, which embodies the \n     separate and distinct political freedoms of petitioning, \n     speech, and assembly enjoys the highest constitutional \n     protection.\n\n  And for every statement they make here, as you will see when you get \nthe letter inserted in the Record, the ACLU gives Supreme Court \ndecisions in support of the position, and in many instances they are \nquoting directly from the Supreme Court opinion and not paraphrasing.\n  Back to their letter:\n\n       Petitioning the government is--\n\nand this is a subquote from the Supreme Court--\n\n     core political speech,\n\nthe ACLU again--\n\n     for which the First Amendment protection is--the Supreme \n     Court--``at its zenith.''\n\n  So we are talking about something the Supreme Court has ruled is at \nthe zenith of protected political speech under the first amendment.\n  Now, back to another Supreme Court position, quoting again from the \nACLU:\n\n       Constitutional protection of lobbying is not in the least \n     diminished by the fact that it may be performed for others \n     for a fee. Further--from the Supreme Court--``the First\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\n     Amendment protects the right not only to advocate one's \n     cause, but also to select what one believes to be the most \n     effective means of doing so.'' That is from the Supreme Court \n     decision: The right to not only advocate for the cause, but \n     to select what one believes to be the most effective means of \n     doing so.\n\n  A grassroots lobbying group decides in its neighborhood that the most \neffective means of influencing and speaking up on legislation is to \nsend out letters to its membership, or perhaps it may decide the most \neffective means would be to buy a mailing list and send out letters to \nthe people on the mailing list. As soon as they spend the money to buy \nthe mailing list, there is a paid lobbyist involved, and if the \nregistration is not correct, there is a $200,000 fine against that \ngroup, if we leave this provision in the bill as it is.\n  The ACLU goes on to make other compelling arguments, but I would like \nto add a few other comments from other sources to show that this is \nfrom across the board.\n  The National Right To Life Committee--not usually associated with the \nACLU in most people's minds as being on the same side of an issue--they \nsay:\n\n       Section 220 defines the act of a constituent contacting a \n     Member of Congress as an act of ``lobbying,'' specifically, \n     ``grassroots lobbying.''\n\n  And then here is what section 220 has to say, quoting directly from \nthe bill:\n\n       Grassroots lobbying means the voluntary efforts of members \n     of the general public to communicate their own views on an \n     issue to Federal officials, or to encourage other members of \n     the general public to do the same.\n\n  Let me stress that, again. This legislation says that grassroots \nlobbying is defined as members of the general public communicating with \ntheir Congressman or encouraging others to do the same.\n  I thought that is what we were all supposed to do. I was taught in \ncivics class in high school that everyone had the right to do that, \nwithout being forced to register and report all of their connections if \nsomebody pays for it. Again, the Supreme Court says, constitutional \nprotection of lobbying is not in the least diminished by the fact that \nit may be performed for others for a fee. But if you mess up your \nforms, if you don't file them on time, if somehow they are confusing to \nyou and you have contacted your neighbors or you have purchased a \nmailing list, whether you are Astroturf or grassroots, you are on the \nhook for $200,000, as the bill currently stands.\n  Bradley Smith, who is the former chairman of the FEC, along with \nStephen Hoersting, who is Republican Senatorial Committee general \ncounsel, two distinguished lawyers, had this to say on this issue:\n\n       ``Grassroots lobbying'' is merely encouragement of average \n     citizens to contact their representatives about issues of \n     public concern. It is not ``lobbying'' at all, as that phrase \n     is normally used outside the beltway, meaning paid, full-time \n     advocates of special interests meeting in person with Members \n     of Congress away from the public eye. Contact between \n     ordinary citizens and Members of Congress, which is what \n     grassroots lobbying seeks to bring about, is the antithesis \n     of the lobbying at the heart of the Abramoff scandals. It is \n     ordinary citizens expressing themselves. That they are \n     ``stimulated'' to do so by ``grassroots lobbying activities'' \n     is irrelevant. These are still individual citizens motivated \n     to express themselves to Members of Congress.\n\n  The Right To Life letter goes on to say:\n\n       Poorly paid, activist employees of such organizations could \n     receive penalties of up to $200,000 per infraction, or even \n     face a threat of criminal prosecution, even if they never set \n     foot in Washington, D.C., or speak to a Member of Congress or \n     congressional staff.\n\n  Yes, Senator Bennett, that is all very well and good, but what about \nthese Astroturf lobbyists? We have to get to that terrible evil. The \npeople who say that, quite frankly, probably have never, ever served in \na congressional office or held public office. And if they have, they \nwere pretty unconscious while that was going on.\n  I first came to this town as a congressional staffer over 40 years \nago. I served on the House side; I have served on the Senate side. I \nhave been a lobbyist downtown. Yes, I have been one of these paid \nprofessionals, and I reported all of the things I was required to \nreport--went through the whole situation. I was in the executive branch \nas a lobbyist. We didn't call it that. We pretend the executive branch \ndoesn't lobby the legislative branch, so it is called ``congressional \nliaison'' or ``congressional relations.'' I was the Director of \nCongressional Relations at the Department of Transportation. I had \nexquisite timing. I left just before they had title inflation, and if I \nhad been there a little later, I could say I was an Assistant \nSecretary.\n  I understand this. People who have been involved in this understand \nthis. When somebody tries to create a truly phony outburst of public \nopinion, the people in the front office of a congressional staff \nrecognize it in about 3 nanoseconds. The letters come in. They are all \nidentical. You know they are not stimulated by the position of the \npeople at home. You know they were written by some professional who is \ntaking a fee as an Astroturf lobbyist, if you will. You can see through \nit in an instant. They all come in, almost always in one of these \nsimulated kinds of campaigns and somebody ruins it. I have seen these \npostcards, and on one of them is written: Senator, my organization told \nme to send you this. I hope it is helpful. And you know the person who \nwrote that doesn't know what is on it.\n\n  Sometimes they come in and they say: I don't know anything about this \nissue, but I am being asked to send you this postcard. I trust your \njudgment, Senator, and I hope you do the right thing.\n  There were times when these phony Astroturf kinds of campaigns were \nso overwhelming in volume that in the office where I was working, we \ndidn't read any of it. You identified it immediately, you put them in a \nseparate mail sack, and you threw them away. I tell people when they \ncome to me and say, What is the best way to influence a Member of \nCongress, it is to stay away from these people because we are smart \nenough to see through it.\n  In order to protect the Congress from these kinds of Astroturf \ncampaigns, do we have to put a potential $200,000 fine on someone who \nuses his church list to send out a letter and urge people who receive \nthe letter to write their Congressman on a particular issue? Do we have \nto expose every group, right and left, that does its best to stimulate \nsome kind of interest in an issue to this sort of penalty? What about \nthe Internet? What happens if someone goes on the Internet and urges \neverybody who sees his blog to write Congress and then makes the \nmistake of hiring somebody and paying him to write that notice on the \nblog? Has that not created a lobbyist for hire? Somebody finds out the \nman who created the message on the blog got paid and files a complaint. \nI don't know what the lawyers would do with it, whether he would end up \npaying the $200,000, but I do know what he would run up in legal fees \nto protect himself against that kind of situation.\n  This is simply something that has been created by virtue of a \nperception of the way grassroots works, a perception that is wrong. \nThis should be stricken from the bill. This should not go forward. I \nspeak not from my own experience, not from how I feel after 40 years of \ncontact with this place in one way or another, but I speak for a vast \nnumber of groups who are involved in this on the far right, on the far \nleft, on every stage of the political spectrum in between, including \nthose who are strongly for this bill and including those who say we \nneed more transparency, we need to do something about earmarks, we need \nto do something about the more traditional definition of lobbyists \nhaving undue access. People who say we are for the bill, we are for all \nof these wonderful things, but if you do this, put this in the bill, \nyou are on very shaky constitutional ground.\n  I have no doubt that if section 220 survives in the bill and ends up \nin the law, it will be struck down as unconstitutional. But in order to \nhave it struck down, someone will have to file a lawsuit. Someone will \nhave to fund hundreds of thousands and probably millions of dollars to \ntake it through a district court and a circuit court and up to the \nSupreme Court, although maybe not. I would think any district judge \nwould take one look at this and strike it down. But life being what it \nis, you can never tell about that. The Supreme Court has spoken often \nand repeatedly on this issue. The Supreme Court position is very clear. \nLet's hear them and save the money for the group\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\nthat would have to take this to the Supreme Court to try to get it \nreversed. Let's reverse it in the Senate so it does not ever see the \nlight of day. I urge all of my colleagues to support my amendment that \nwould strike section 220 and reaffirm that the zenith of the Bill of \nRights is free speech, the right to petition your Government for \nredress of your grievances, and the right to peacefully assemble, all \nof which is involved in grassroots lobbying and none of which should be \ncriminalized as a result of the legislation that we are considering \ntoday.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to include these letters in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 17, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the ACLU, a non-partisan \n     organization with hundreds of thousands of activists and \n     members, and 53 affiliates nation-wide, we urge you to \n     support Bennett Amendment S.A. 20 to S. 1, the ``Legislative \n     Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007'' when it comes \n     to the floor for a vote. This amendment would strike Section \n     220 of the underlying bill.\n       Section 220, entitled ``Disclosure of Paid Efforts to \n     Stimulate Grassroots Lobbying'' imposes onerous reporting \n     requirements that will chill constitutionally protected \n     activity. Advocacy organizations large and small would now \n     find their communications to the general public about policy \n     matters redefined as lobbying and therefore subject to \n     registration and quarterly reporting. Failure to register and \n     report could have severe civil and potentially criminal \n     sanctions. Section 220 would apply to even small, state \n     grassroots organizations with no lobbying presence in \n     Washington. When faced with burdensome registration and \n     reporting requirements, some of these organizations may well \n     decide that silence is the best option.\n       The right to petition the government is ``one of the most \n     precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of \n     Rights.'' When viewed through this prism, the thrust of the \n     grassroots lobbying regulation is at best misguided, and at \n     worst would seriously undermine the basic freedom that is the \n     cornerstone of our system of government.\n       It is well settled that lobbying, which embodies the \n     separate and distinct political freedoms of petitioning, \n     speech, and assembly, enjoys the highest constitutional \n     protection. Petitioning the government is ``core political \n     speech,'' for which First Amendment protection is ``at its \n     zenith.''\n       Constitutional protection of lobbying is not in the least \n     diminished by the fact that it may be performed for others \n     for a fee. Further, ``the First Amendment protects [the] \n     right not only to advocate [one's] cause but also to select \n     what [one] believe[s] to be the most effective means of doing \n     so.'' In Meyer, the Court emphasized that legislative \n     restrictions on political advocacy or advocacy of the passage \n     or defeat of legislation are ``wholly at odds with the \n     guarantees of the First Amendment.''\n       Where the government seeks to regulate such First Amendment \n     protected activity, the regulations must survive exacting \n     scrutiny. To satisfy strict scrutiny, the government must \n     establish: (a) a compelling governmental interest sufficient \n     to override the burden on individual rights; (b) a \n     substantial correlation between the regulation and the \n     furtherance of that interest; and (c) that the least drastic \n     means to achieve its goal have been employed.\n       A compelling governmental interest cannot be established on \n     the basis of conjecture. There must be a factual record to \n     sustain the government's assertion that burdens on \n     fundamental rights are warranted. Here, there is little if \n     any record to support the contention that grassroots lobbying \n     needs to be regulated. Without this record, the government \n     will be unable to sustain its assertion that grassroots \n     lobbying should be regulated.\n       The grassroots lobbying provision is troubling for other \n     reasons as well. First, the provision seems to assume \n     Americans can be easily manipulated by advocacy organizations \n     to take actions that do not reflect their own interests. To \n     the contrary, Americans are highly independent and capable of \n     making their own judgment. Whether or not they were informed \n     of an issue through a grassroots campaign is irrelevant--\n     their action in contacting their representative is based on \n     their own belief in the importance of matters before \n     Congress.\n       Second, it appears groups such as the ACLU may end up \n     having to report their activities because of the grassroots \n     lobbying provisions. A ``grassroots lobbying firm'' means a \n     person or entity that is retained by one or more clients to \n     engage in paid efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying on \n     behalf of such clients and receives income of, or spends or \n     agrees to spend, an aggregate of $25,000 or more for such \n     efforts in any quarterly period. ``Client'' under existing \n     law includes the organization that employs an in-house staff \n     person or person who lobbies. If, for example, the ACLU hires \n     an individual to stimulate grassroots lobbying on behalf of \n     the ACLU and pays that individual for her efforts in amounts \n     exceeding $25,000, it appears that individual could be \n     considered a grassroots lobbying firm, and have to register \n     and report as such. The fact the ACLU employs that individual \n     appears to be irrelevant to this provision. Unless this is \n     the type of activity that the provision is intended to reach, \n     there is no substantial correlation between the regulation \n     and the furtherance of the government's alleged interest in \n     regulating that activity.\n       Groups such as the ACLU could also be affected because of \n     the definitions of ``paid efforts to stimulate grassroots \n     lobbying'' employed in Section 220. For example, the ACLU \n     maintains a list of activists who have signed up to be \n     notified about pending issues in Congress. Not all of those \n     activists are ``dues paying'' members who would be exempt \n     from consideration for ``paid efforts to stimulate grassroots \n     lobbying.'' Additionally, since there are 500 or more such \n     individuals, sending out an action alert to ACLU activists \n     could be deemed ``paid'' communication and subject to \n     registration and quarterly reporting.\n       Because the grassroots lobbying provision is unsupported by \n     any record of corruption, and because the provision is not \n     narrowly tailored to achieve the government's asserted \n     interest, the provision is constitutionally suspect. \n     Requiring groups or individuals to report First Amendment \n     activity to the government is antithetical to the values \n     enshrined in our Constitution. If our government is truly one \n     ``of the people, for the people, and by the people,'' then \n     the people must be able to disseminate information, contact \n     their representatives, and encourage others to do so as well.\n           Sincerely,\n     Caroline Fredrickson,\n       Director, Washington Legislative Office.\n     Marvin Johnson,\n       Legislative Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Right to Life\n\n\n                                              Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2007.\n     Re Support Bennett Amendment No. 20 to avoid radical effects \n         of Section 220 of S. 1 (substitute amendment)\n\n       Dear Senator: The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) \n     urges you to support the Bennett Amendment (No. 20), which \n     would strike Section 220 from the pending substitute \n     amendment to S. 1. Because of the chilling effect that \n     Section 220 could have on grassroots activism, NRLC may \n     include any roll call on the Bennett Amendment in our \n     scorecard of key votes for the 110th Congress.\n       While supporters of Section 220 say that it would only \n     require ``disclosure'' of certain big-dollar lobbying \n     campaigns, the actual language of Section 220 would place \n     unprecedented burdens on issue-oriented citizen groups from \n     coast to coast that seek to motivate the public on matters of \n     federal policy. Any local activist who runs afoul of the new \n     requirements could be subjected to crushing civil penalties, \n     raised from $50,000 to $200,000 per infraction by adoption of \n     the Vitter Amendment No. 10 on January 12, and even to \n     intimidation by threat of the new criminal penalty of up to \n     10 years in prison created by Section 223 of the substitute \n     bill. The net effect would be to chill activities that are \n     essential to the healthy functioning of a representative \n     system of government.\n       The reach of Section 220 would be far more expansive and \n     drastic than has been acknowledged by any of the sponsors or \n     advocacy-group backers of the provision. Some of the sweeping \n     effects are clearly intended (if not acknowledged) by the \n     provision's backers, but others may be the result of poor \n     draftsmanship or poor understanding of the way Section 220 \n     would alter the structure of the existing Lobbying Disclosure \n     Act (2 U.S.C. Chapter 26).\n\n\n                        CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE\n\n       Before discussing the specific regulatory burdens that \n     would be imposed by Section 220, it is necessary to describe \n     the pernicious premise that is at the heart of the proposal: \n     Section 220 defines the act of a constituent contacting a \n     member of Congress as an act of ``lobbying,'' specifically \n     ``grassroots lobbying.'' In our view, petitioning elected \n     representatives is at the very heart of representative \n     democracy, is granted the highest degree of protection by the \n     First Amendment, and ought to be encouraged rather than \n     restricted and regulated. Yet Section 220 would enact into \n     law a mind-set that encouraging citizens to contact their \n     federal representatives is a type of influence-peddling, \n     inherently suspect, and the proper subject for scrutiny \n     regarding exactly how citizens were motivated to exercise \n     their constitutional right to petition.\n       (We refer here to definition 17 in Section 220: \n     ``GRASSROOTS LOBBYING. The term `grassroots lobbying' means \n     the voluntary efforts of members of the general public to \n     communicate their own views on an issue to Federal officials \n     or to encourage other members of the general public to do the \n     same.'' Note that this definition is so expansive that it \n     covers not only verbal and written communications sent by a \n     constituent to an officeholder, but also such activities as \n     holding placards at public demonstrations, submitting letters \n     for publication in local newspapers, or offering comments on \n     an officeholder's position on a call-in radio program.)\n       Bradley Smith, former chairman of FEC, and Stephen \n     Hoersting, former Republican Senatorial Committee general \n     counsel, last year explained in detail why ``grassroots \n     lobbying'' should be protected from Congressional scrutiny \n     and regulation (see ``Let the\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\n     Grassroots `Lobbying' Grow,'' www.nationalreview.com/comment/\nsmith_hoersting_200602210809.asp), They wrote:\n       `` `Grassroots lobbying' is merely encouragement of average \n     citizens to contact their representatives about issues of \n     public concern. It is not `lobbying' at all, as that phrase \n     is normally used outside the beltway, meaning paid, full-time \n     advocates of special interests meeting in person with members \n     of Congress away from the public eye. . . . Contact between \n     ordinary citizens and members of Congress, which is what \n     `grassroots lobbying' seeks to bring about, is the antithesis \n     of the `lobbying' at the heart of the Abramoff scandals. It \n     is ordinary citizens expressing themselves. That they are \n     `stimulated' to do so by `grassroots lobbying activities' is \n     irrelevant. These are still individual citizens motivated to \n     express themselves to members of Congress.''\n       We agree. We urge you to support the Bennett Amendment in \n     order to reject the root concept that communications from \n     constituents are a form of ``lobbying,'' or that what \n     motivated a constituent is a proper subject for governmental \n     inquiry--be it a mailing from an advocacy group, or a \n     newspaper editorial, or a franked newsletter, or a \n     conversation at a local gym.\n\n\n            SECTION 220--TWO DISTINCT WEBS OF NEW REGULATION\n\n       Beyond the fundamental constitutional objection, it is \n     vital that you understand the actual legal effects of Section \n     220, which have been grossly understated (and are probably \n     poorly understood) by many of the provision's supporters.\n       Section 220 would create many legal hazards for grassroots-\n     based, actvist-staffed organizations throughout the country.\n       Section 220 creates two separate and distinct new webs of \n     regulation. (These have been confused or conflated in some \n     materials circulated by both supporters and opponents of the \n     provision.) First, Section 220 greatly expands the universe \n     of persons who must register and file detailed reports \n     (henceforth, quarterly) as federal ``lobbyists,'' because \n     Section 220 redefines ``lobbying activities'' to include \n     ``paid efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying.'' This \n     would include many employees of state and local right-to-\n     life organizations who are paid only small amounts and who \n     seldom engage in true lobbying of members of Congress or \n     their staffs. Second, Section 220 creates a new category, \n     the ``grassroots lobbying firm,'' defined so broadly that \n     even a single individual, employed by a state or local \n     advocacy group and paid a nominal amount, could be forced \n     to register as a ``grassroots lobbying firm'' if the \n     organization purchased a single full-page ad in a \n     newspaper on a federal legislative issue.\n       The primary impact of these regulations would not fall \n     primarily on well-heeled ``K Street'' lobbyists or on \n     professional public relations firms, which supporters of \n     Section 220 claim are their targets. Most professional \n     Washington lobbying firms and their vendors are well-equipped \n     to deal with complex regulations--they can hire extra \n     lawyers, bookkeepers, and support staff, and bill their \n     clients for the additional expenses required to keep track of \n     their centralized ``grassroots lobbying activities.''\n       The real burdens of Section 220 would fall on the thousands \n     of low-paid employees of thousands of issue-oriented citizen \n     groups across the land, of every ideological stripe, who try \n     to motivate members of the general public to communicate with \n     members of the U.S. Senate and House regarding pending \n     legislation. If Section 220 is enacted, the activist will \n     learn that she must register with the federal government as a \n     ``lobbyist'' and file quarterly reports detailing her efforts \n     to stimulate ``grassroots lobbying,'' of any dollar amount, \n     if (l) she is paid any sort of salary, (2) spends more than \n     20 percent of her time on such grassroots activities, (3) \n     presents the motivating communications to more than 500 \n     persons who are not paying members of the organization, and \n     (4) has communicated with a congressional office or Executive \n     Branch official more than once during a calendar quarter (for \n     example, by sending an e-mail or making a phone call advising \n     a Senate office of the organization's position on a pending \n     vote).\n\n\n    REGISTRATION/REPORTING BY ``GRASSROOTS LOBBYISTS'' WHO SPEND $1\n\n       Some defenders of Section 220 say that these requirements \n     would apply only if the activist is an employee of an \n     organization that spends more than $10,000 in a calendar \n     quarter on such ``grassroots lobbying activity.'' \n     Regrettably, they are mistaken--that may have been the \n     intent, but it is not the language of Section 220. There is \n     indeed a $10,000 minimum (per three-month period) threshold \n     in the bill (which amends the $24,500 semi-annual threshold \n     that applies under the current Lobbying Disclosure Act), but \n     Section 220(b)(1) explicitly removes ``paid efforts to \n     stimulate grassroots lobbying'' from the scope of this \n     exemption. In other words, Section 220 creates an exception \n     to the exemption. This means that under Section 220, even $1 \n     per quarter spent to ``stimulate'' citizens to communicate \n     with their representatives in Congress triggers the \n     registration and reporting requirement, for an individual who \n     meets the other four numbered criteria in our previous \n     paragraph. (Note: The $10,000 minimum discussed here applies \n     to registration as a ``lobbyist,'' and should not be confused \n     with the $25,000 threshold that applies to the ``grassroots \n     lobbying firm,'' the new entity created by Section 220, which \n     is discussed on the final two pages of this letter.)\n       Some defenders of Section 220 also claim that the \n     registration requirement would apply only to individuals or \n     firms that are already required to register because they \n     engage in extensive direct lobbying with members of Congress \n     or congressional staff. In this, too, they are mistaken: \n     Section 220(a)(1) explicitly adds ``paid efforts to stimulate \n     grassroots lobbying'' to the list of activities that trigger \n     the federal registration and reporting requirement Therefore, \n     if a local issue-activist group has an employee who has spent \n     any money to encourage more than 500 private citizens (not \n     members of the organization) to write letters to their \n     representatives, has spent 20% of his time on such activity, \n     and has made as few as two contacts to congressional or \n     Executive Branch offices urging action on a pending issue, \n     that employee would be trapped by the registration and \n     reporting requirements.\n       Defenders of Section 220 emphasize that communications to \n     members of an organization (for example, members of a labor \n     union) are exempt. But the First Amendment does not merely \n     guarantee the right to communicate with those who pay dues \n     for the privilege of receiving such communications. Even a \n     small single-issue organization may have a large e-mail alert \n     list (for example), made up of individuals who fall outside \n     of the Section 220 definition of ``membership'' because they \n     do not make contributions, but nevertheless have a strong \n     desire to be kept informed of congressional legislative \n     activities. In addition, the group may at times feel the need \n     to reach out to the general public--for example, by \n     purchasing an ad in a daily newspaper--to urge citizens to \n     speak out on a timely issue.\n\n\n              ``GRASSROOTS LOBBYING FIRM'' REGULATION WEB\n\n       The second and distinct web of regulation created by \n     Section 220 applies to a new category of regulated entity, \n     the so-called ``grassroots lobbying firm.'' Defenders of \n     Section 220 talk about this provision in ``terms of so-called \n     Astroturf'' operations, as if it applied to professional \n     advertising or public relations firms, but the actual \n     language is far more sweeping. Section 220 defines a \n     ``grassroots lobbying firm'' as ``a person or entity'' \n     [emphasis added] who is paid, by a ``client,'' to stimulate \n     ``grassroots lobbying'' (as defined in Section 220), and who \n     receives, spends, or agrees to spend $25,000 or more in a \n     quarter for such activities. ``Client'' is defined in the \n     existing law to include an organization that employs an in-\n     house staff person who engages in ``lobbying activities,'' a \n     definition that Section 220 would expand to include \n     activities to motivate grassroots contacts to members of \n     Congress.\n       (It is important to note that this $25,000-per-quarter \n     threshold applies only to the new ``grassroots lobbying \n     firm'' provision of Section 220, and not to the separate \n     requirement that one engaged in ``paid efforts to stimulate \n     grassroots lobbying'' must register and report as a \n     ``lobbyist.'' As we have already explained, the lobbyist \n     registration requirement is not confined by any dollar \n     threshold with respect to ``paid efforts to stimulate \n     grassroots lobbying.''\n       Thus, under Section 220, the executive director (for \n     example) of a state or local affiliate of National Right to \n     Life, even if she is part-time and paid only a nominal \n     amount, and even if she seldom or never interacts directly \n     with congressional offices, could be forced to register as \n     a federal ``grassroots lobbying firm'' and file detailed \n     reports on a quarterly basis, if she on behalf of the \n     organization (the ``client'') spends more than $25,000/\n     quarter on encouraging the general public to contact their \n     federal elected representatives. Since a single full-page \n     ad in a major metro newspaper typically costs more than \n     $25,000, many part-time citizen activists would find \n     themselves legally defined as ``grassroots lobbying \n     firms.'' Note that in this scenario, it is not the \n     organization that Section 220 defines as a ``grassroots \n     lobbying firm,'' but the individual staff person as \n     described. Also, note that this new regulation of \n     ``grassroots lobbying firm(s)'' is not constrained by the \n     language that limits the existing Lobbying Disclosure Act \n     requirement to register as a ``lobbyist'' to persons who \n     make at least two direct ``lobbying contacts'' and who \n     spend more than 20% of their paid time on lobbying \n     activities during a reporting period. Those limitations \n     apply only to the Act's definition of ``lobbyist,'' and \n     not to the new language of Section 220 defining \n     ``grassroots lobbying firm.''\n       The ``grassroots lobbying firm'' provision of Section 220 \n     has one additional side effect which has not been understood, \n     or at least has not been acknowledged, by its supporters: The \n     $25,000 threshold is an aggregate figure for a vendor, not a \n     threshold that applies to each issue-oriented client \n     organization. We illustrate the implications by the following \n     scenario: In Anytown, 15 citizen-activist groups, none of \n     which has any paid staff or engages in any direct contacts \n     with members of Congress or congressional staff, all hire the \n     same vendor to mail to various lists of citizens urging them \n     to communicate with their elected representatives on \n     different timely issues. No organization pays more than \n     $2,000 for the use of any list, but the aggregate amount \n     collected by the vendor for mailings to all lists exceeds \n     $25,000 in a three-month period. Under Section 220, this \n     local vendor would be required to register as\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\n     a ``grassroots lobbying firm'' and to report the details of \n     his mailing activities for all 15 of his ``clients,'' even a \n     group that merely paid $50 for the use of a list.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       In summary, Section 220 is a poorly drafted provision. If \n     enacted, it will disrupt the constitutionally protected \n     activities of thousands of issue-oriented citizen groups from \n     coast to coast, chill free speech by citizen activists on the \n     issues of the day, and become a textbook example of the Law \n     of Unintended Consequences.\n       We urge you to prevent these consequences by supporting the \n     Bennett Amendment No. 20, which will strike Section 220 from \n     the substitute to S. 1. Thank you for your consideration of \n     our strong views on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Douglas Johnson,\n       NRLC Legislative Director.\n     Susan Muskett, J.D.,\n       Congressional Liaison.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: As \n     leaders of advocacy organizations active on a broad variety \n     of issues, we write to express our strong concerns regarding \n     certain proposals that are being advanced that would \n     establish, for the first time, congressional oversight of \n     grassroots activity that is intended to encourage members of \n     the public to communicate with Members of Congress about \n     pending legislative matters--so-called ``grassroots \n     lobbying.''\n       We take no issue with proposals that may be legitimate \n     responses to allegations of certain unethical actions by \n     Members of Congress, congressional staff and lobbyists. But \n     nothing in those allegations provide any justification \n     whatsoever for the notion that incumbent Members of Congress \n     should seize authority to scrutinize and regulate the \n     constitutionally protected efforts of groups such as ours to \n     alert citizens regarding legislative developments in Congress \n     and to encourage them to communicate their views to their \n     elected representatives. That citizens are ``stimulated'' to \n     contact their representatives by so-called ``grassroots \n     lobbying activities'' is irrelevant. Newspaper editorials, \n     op-eds, grassroots advertisements and e-mail alerts are all \n     ways to influence people to contact their elected \n     representatives on an issue. Just as it would be \n     unconstitutional to monitor the press because of their \n     influence over their readership, the First Amendment also \n     protects the right of the people to ``petition the government \n     for a redress of grievances.'' To monitor motivation as to \n     why a citizen would contact Members on an issue is attacking \n     that First Amendment right.\n       A prominent example of the type of provisions that we \n     strongly oppose are found in the Legislative Transparency and \n     Accountability Act of 2007 (S.l). We strongly oppose Section \n     220 of this legislation and any other proposals along these \n     lines.\n       Section 220 requires ``grassroots lobbying firms'' to \n     report to Congress within 45 days of agreeing to provide \n     services related to grass roots lobbying (including filing of \n     quarterly reports listing disbursements made in connection \n     with such activities).\n       Section 220 exempts communications of an organization to \n     its members from direct application of these requirements, \n     but the bill ensures that all private contractors and vendors \n     which we retain to help communicate with the general public, \n     in order to encourage these citizens to contact their elected \n     representatives in Congress, would be subject to the \n     burdensome recordkeeping and reporting requirements. \n     Moreover, since these activities must be reported \n     according to when they are arranged (even before \n     communications to the public actually occur), they would \n     in effect require that we provide our opposition on any \n     given issue with detailed information about the scope and \n     location of our planned grassroots efforts.\n       Reasoned attempts to address the concerns emerging from \n     Congressional scandals should not be used as an excuse for \n     incumbent officer-holders to encroach upon our most basic \n     Constitutional liberties. Therefore, we urge you to strongly \n     oppose any legislative proposals that would establish federal \n     oversight over grassroots lobbying activities. We fully \n     support Amendment 20 to S. 1 filed by Senator Robert Bennett \n     which would strike the section relating to disclosure of paid \n     efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying.\n           Respectfully,\n     Family Research Council\n     Focus on the Family\n     Family Protection Lobby\n     The Family Action Council of Tennessee\n     American Family Association\n     Illinois Family Institute\n     The Family Research Institute of Wisconsin\n     Free Market Foundation\n     Christian Civic League of Maine\n     The Center for Arizona Policy\n     Corner Institute of Idaho\n     South Dakota Family Policy Council\n     Georgia Family Council\n     The Minnesota Family Council\n     Mississippi Center for Public Policy\n     Men's Health Network\n     Family Leader Network\n     National Council for Adoption\n     Institute on Religion and Public Policy\n     Catholic Family & Human Rights Institute\n     American Association of Christian Schools\n     National Rifle Association\n     Coalition for Marriage and Family\n     Judicial Action Group\n     Coalitions for America\n     American Shareholders Association\n     Americans for Tax Reform\n     American Values\n     Catholic Exchange\n     Traditional Values Coalition\n     Tradition, Family, Property, Inc.\n     Family Resource Network/Teen Pact\n     Grassfire.org Alliance\n     Eagle Forum\n     Concerned Women for America\n     Christian Coalition of America\n     Fidelis\n     Citizens for Community Values\n     Population Research Institute\n     Home School Legal Defense Association\n     Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission\n     Advance USA\n     Americans United for Life\n     Massachusetts Family Institute\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to make a very few \ncomments in response to the ranking member's comments, and then I know \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania would like to speak on another matter, so \nI ask unanimous consent that he be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. I know that Senator Lieberman is \ngoing to speak on the specific provisions of section 220 in the base \nbill, S.1, at a later time. However, I would like to share with this \nbody what I understand to be the facts. If I understand correctly what \nis attempted in the underlying bill, the goal is to compel disclosure, \nregistration and reporting for those companies, individuals or \norganizations that say, We have a cause, this is the cause; we want to \nestablish a grassroots lobbying organization. They go and hire \norganizations to get going and spent more than 25,000 a quarter. They \nsay go ahead and organize a movement, but nobody ever knows who they \nare or who funds them. This is called astroturf lobbying. Some people \nrefer these groups as ``sham'' or ``front'' organizations. I am not \ngoing to say they necessarily are, but they have been referred to as \nsuch. They seek to influence legislation through mass media, using \ncampaign and issue ads, letters, phone calls, think-tank public policy \npapers, and public polls.\n  The problem is, these organizations are hired guns funded by \nundisclosed special interest corporations and public policy firms. They \nconduct grassroots organization lobbying efforts which are often very \nmisleading or in some cases, deceptive. For example, an oil company \nhires a sham organization to promote the benefits of alternative fuels \nto big oil, or a cigarette company hires a front group to lobby for \nsmoke-free environment--or whatever the popular cause may be. They go \nout to organize, make lobby contacts, and conduct other lobby \nactivities on specific issues. Unlike genuine grassroots groups that \ntend to be money poor but people rich, astroturf campaigns are \ntypically people poor and money rich.\n  Section 220 of the base bill contains the provisions on disclosure of \npaid efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying. I am the first one to \nsay these provisions could be more clearly written. Nonetheless, the \nsection's goal is to close the loophole in current law that allows \nthese groups to engage in lobbying contacts without any public \ndisclosure or reporting whatsoever--like the paid lobbying contacts and \nefforts of Jack Abramoff and Ralph Reed.\n  The bill recognizes this increased type of lobbying--paid efforts to \nstimulate grassroots lobbying--and creates new disclosure and reporting \nrules for such activities. It makes clear that efforts by an \norganization to contact its own members as part of a grassroots \nlobbying campaign are not covered and are unaffected by these \nprovisions unless some outside group paid the organization to do so.\n  The bill also requires a $50,000 quarterly threshold as a \nprecondition of registration. This means that small and truly local \nefforts are not covered.\n  I do not agree with the comments made by the ranking member about \nthis section 220. Non-profits will continue to be able to lobby under \ncurrent\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\ntax law that requires threshold disclosure and reporting. However, \nprivate sector groups and their paid lobbyists are not currently \nrequired to disclose, register or report and therefore would be under \nsection 220. So this is the differentiation between the two groups.\n  The provisions would create a balanced playing field by opposing a \nsham grassroots lobbying operation while protecting legitimate \ngrassroots lobbying organizations. This in essence is the purpose. If \nit does survive consideration here, we will take another look at it in \nconference with respect to narrow definitions, registration and the \nreporting trigger thresholds. I do believe if somebody goes out and \ncreates one of these groups, pours a lot of money into it and then \nhires people for grassroots lobbying purposes, then this group should \nbe required to disclose and report so the public knows exactly who the \ngroup is and who is financing the group. Is it an undisclosed oil \ncompany or is it really a legitimate Citizens for Alternative Fuels to \nOil? I think that it is important to determine the credibility and \nlegitimacy of these organizations involved in grassroots lobbying.\n  I know the ACLU is opposed to it. The ACLU is a group that has been \naround for a long time. I don't see them being affected by this at all \nbecause they would be covered under this other section of the law. I \noffer these comments in the interests of the purpose of section 220 in \nthis legislation, which I think is bona fide, helpful, and overdue. \nThank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have a question of my distinguished \nfriend from Pennsylvania. It is my understanding he is going to speak \nnext; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, my request is to speak for about 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. My only question was how long he is going to speak. I will \ncome back after that time. I appreciate the Senator allowing me to ask \nthat question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, may I make a quick response to the \nSenator from California before we hear from the Senator from \nPennsylvania? I will not take more than a minute or two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I simply want to make this point with respect to the \nthreshold that causes people to come under the provisions of the bill. \nThere is, indeed, a $10,000 minimum for a 3-month period threshold in \nthe bill, but section 220(b)(1) explicitly removes ``paid efforts to \nstimulate grassroots lobbying'' from the scope of this exemption. In \nother words, $1 per quarter spent to stimulate citizens to communicate \nwith their representatives in Congress triggers the registration and \nreporting requirement for an individual who meets the other four \nnumbered criteria.\n  I agree with the Senator from California. This is very badly drafted \nand needs an awful lot of work, which is why I think the best thing to \ndo with it is simply strike it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                    New Foreign Surveillance Policy\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for yielding this \ntime. I have sought recognition to express my approval--I am glad to \nsee that the Attorney General of the United States, in telephone calls \nto Senator Leahy and myself and now in letters, has advised that there \nis a new procedure to have the requests for wiretaps on al-Qaida \nmembers submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. On \nDecember 16, the New York Times broke the story that there were \nwiretaps going on under a Presidential order without complying with the \ncustomary requirement that probable cause be established and submitted \nto the court, which would authorize the issuance of a warrant, to \nauthorize the wiretap.\n  On that day, Friday, we were in the final stages of floor debate on \nthe PATRIOT Act, and the disclosure that morning that there were \nwarrantless recordings going on was quite a shock and quite a problem, \nbecause I was managing that bill in my capacity as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I said on the floor at that time that there was a clear-cut violation \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which provides that the \nAct is the exclusive way for having a wiretap for foreign intelligence \nsurveillance. The President has sought to justify the surveillance \nunder his article II inherent powers. That raises a complicated issue, \nwhich can only be determined by the courts by weighing the invasiveness \nof the wiretapping--invasiveness into privacy--contrasted with the \nimportance of national security.\n  Most of last year found this item as the No. 1 priority of the \nJudiciary Committee and my No. 1 priority as chairman. We had a series \nof hearings, four hearings. I introduced legislation to try to bring \nthe program at that time under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct.\n  The administration had refused to disclose the details of the program \nto the Judiciary Committee. They maintained that attitude consistently \nup until today. They finally did submit it, after a lot of pressure, to \nthe Intelligence Committees--first a subcommittee of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, then when the House resisted only a \nsubcommittee, it was finally submitted to the full committees--really \nit was only submitted when the time came for the confirmation of \nGeneral Hayden for Director of the CIA.\n  I have not been privy to what was disclosed to the Intelligence \nCommittee, but based on my chairmanship of that committee during the \n104th Congress, I have some doubts as to the adequacy of the \ndisclosure. I know when I was chairman, the chairman was supposed to be \ninformed about those classified and secret programs, but that was in \nfact not the case.\n  When the matter later moved into litigation and the Federal court in \nDetroit declared the surveillance program unconstitutional, and then \nthe appeal was taken to the Sixth Circuit, I introduced substitute \nlegislation--S. 4051 last year, and I've reintroduced it already this \nyear--which would have provided for expedited review in the Federal \ncourts and mandatory review by the Supreme Court. The bill also would \nhave required individualized warrants for calls originating in the \nUnited States, because the administration had disclosed that, if there \nwere changes made in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, there \ncould be a warrant for all outgoing calls but not incoming calls \nbecause there were so many.\n  I am glad to see that we may now have all of that resolved. We are \nnot sure. I want to know the details of this program.\n  Senator Leahy has already spoken on the subject today and has put \ninto the Record a letter that he and I received today from the Attorney \nGeneral. The key parts are as follows:\n\n       I am writing to inform you that on January 10, 2007, a \n     Judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued \n     orders authorizing the Government to target for collection \n     international communications into or out of the United States \n     where there is probable cause to believe that one of the \n     communicants is a member or agent of al Qaeda or an \n     associated terrorist organization. As a result of these \n     orders, any electronic surveillance that was occurring as \n     part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program will now be \n     conducted subject to approval of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court.\n\n  That language says there will be probable cause established. I think \nwe need to know more about the procedures for the determination of \nprobable case, whether it is on individualized warrants or it is a \ngroup program. We will need to know more about the determination of an \nindividual being an agent of al Qaeda, and we will need to know more \nabout what is meant by an associated terrorist organization, to see \nthat probable cause has been established under the customary standards.\n  The letter from the Attorney General goes on to say:\n\n       In the spring of 2005--well before the first press account \n     disclosing the existence of the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program--the Administration began exploring options for \n     seeking such FISA Court approval.\n\n  It would have been my hope that the Attorney General, in our \noversight hearings, where he was called and asked about this program, \nwould have made that disclosure. A lot of time and effort went into the \nJudiciary Committee hearings and went into the\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\ndrafting of legislation. I personally met with the President last July \n11 and secured his agreement to submit this program to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court. For a variety of reasons, which I \nshall not detail now, that legislation did not move forward.\n  Then, as I've noted, there was substitute legislation when the \nFederal court in Detroit declared the program unconstitutional and the \nmatter came before the Sixth Circuit.\n  The Attorney General's letter says, as is appropriate, that the \nprogram will have ``the speed and agility necessary to protect the \nNation'' from terrorist attack--and that has always been a major \nconcern: that we be protected, but that we be protected with an \nappropriate balance, so that there not be an intrusive wiretap without \nthe customary court approval.\n  The Attorney General had advised me that there would be a meeting \ntoday, which I am just informed has been canceled, but there needs to \nbe oversight beyond what has been disclosed in this letter. But at \nleast there is a very significant first step. It is regrettable that \nthese steps were not taken a long time ago. I would like to have an \nexplanation as to why it took from the spring of 2005, and at least \nfrom December 16, 2005, until now, when there has been such public \nfuror and public concern.\n\n  Further, the letter of the Attorney General says:\n\n       Accordingly, under these circumstances, the President has \n     determined not to reauthorize the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program when the current authorization expires.\n\n  It would be my hope that the program is terminated now, since there \nis an alternative method which the Attorney General has announced. I do \nnot know when the program will expire. They have it in place for 45-day \nperiods. We do not know when the last one started, so we do not know \nwhen this one will end. But, with an alternative program in place, it \nought to be terminated now--to have the regular procedures for the \nestablishment of probable cause, to protect civil liberties. And, as \nthe Attorney General says, to address concerns in taking care of the \nprotection of the country.\n  Again, Madam President, I thank my colleagues for yielding the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been in Government all my adult \nlife. Until I came back here, all my jobs were part time, and I \npracticed law. I say as sincerely as I can to anyone within the sound \nof my voice, I am so disappointed in the conversation I had with my \nRepublican counterpart, Senator McConnell, a few minutes ago. I was \ntold that this ethics bill is not going to get the support of the \nRepublicans. They are going to bring this bill down, defeat this bill.\n  Why? Listen to this. Because they are not going to have a vote on \nline-item veto. I told the distinguished Republican leader yesterday \nthat we were willing to give the Republicans a vote on this prior to \nthe Easter recess--up-or-down vote. We would have their bill, our bill, \ntwo competing votes, with 60 vote margins.\n  It is very clear what is going on with this bill. Keep in mind, Madam \nPresident, that we have had in Washington a culture of corruption. For \nthe first time in 131 years, someone was indicted working in the White \nHouse. He is now in trial as we speak. The head of Government \ncontracting appointed by the President, Mr. Safavian, is led from his \noffice in handcuffs for sweetheart deals he had with Abramoff and \nothers.\n  The majority leader of the House of Representatives was convicted \nthree times of ethics violations in the House within 1 year. And then, \nof course, he was indicted in Texas on more than one occasion.\n  A House Member from California is in prison now as we speak for \naccepting more than $2 million in bribes.\n  A Congressman now is awaiting trial.\n  Staff members have been convicted of crimes from the House.\n  Talk about a culture of corruption, the American people deserve \nethics and lobbying reform. That is why I brought to the floor S. 1. It \nis very clear that the minority does not want a bill. They have tried a \nnumber of different things to defeat this bill, offered all kinds of \namendments, thinking we would oppose them. We supported those \namendments. The only one that was a little blip in the road was a \nDeMint amendment, but we thought it should be stronger rather than \nweaker, so we added tax provisions to that. That has now passed.\n  Line-item veto has nothing to do with ethics and lobbying reform--\nnothing, zero. If the majority felt so strongly about line-item veto, \nwhich I am sure they do, I have agreed to give them a vote. This is a \npretext. They could not kill the bill by offering amendments, thinking \nwe would oppose them, so now they have come up with a new idea: We \ncannot do this because you will not give us a vote on a nongermane, \nnonrelevant amendment--line-item veto.\n  Line-item veto has nothing to do with ethics and lobbying reform. If \nthe line-item veto is so important to the minority, why didn't the \nRepublicans get a vote on it last year when they controlled this \nChamber? This is very difficult to comprehend.\n  The bill that is before the Senate was sponsored, for the first time \nin 30 years, by the two leaders. And then the substitute was sponsored \nby the two leaders. The two leaders agreed to bring this bill to the \nfloor. Now they are going to bring down the bill that their leader \ncosponsored?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nmajority leader if he would recount for us what happened 2 years ago \nwhen we faced passage of an ethics reform bill, with an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote, when the Republicans were in control of the House and \nSenate.\n  Mr. REID. They would not take it to conference. We never got it done.\n  Madam President, this bill is very strong. It is something the \nAmerican people want. I say to my distinguished counterpart, and all \nthe minority Senators, they are going to vote against cloture on this \nbill? We hear people say, in passing, here: Well, that is a 30-second \nspot. Voting against cloture on this is not a 30-second spot. It is a \n30-minute spot.\n  This bill prohibits lobbyists from giving gifts to lawmakers and \ntheir staffs. It prohibits lobbyists from paying for trips or taking \npart in privately funded congressional travel. It requires public \ndisclosure of earmarks. It slows the revolving door by extending to 2 \nyears the ban on lobbying by former Members of Congress.\n  It makes pay-to-play schemes such as the K Street Project a violation \nof Senate rules. It makes lobbying more transparent by doubling the \nfrequency of reporting and requiring a searchable electronic database.\n  It would require for the first time the disclosure of shadowy \nbusiness coalitions that engage in so-called Astroturf lobbying \ncampaigns. These big companies pay these people to come out and do \ngrassroots stuff. You never know who is paying for it. Under this bill \nyou would.\n\n  But even though we have under S. 1, as we introduced it, a lot of \ngood things, it is even stronger because we offered a substitute \namendment to make it even stronger. There are new protections to \nprevent dead-of-night additions to conference reports. We added new \nrules to say Members may not engage in job negotiations with the very \nindustries they regulate.\n  There is fuller discloser by lobbyists. We ensure proper evaluation \nof tickets to sporting events. We make sure that Senate gift and travel \nrules are enforceable against lobbyists. And we toughen criminal \npenalties for corruption violations of the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  Since that was offered by me and the distinguished Republican leader, \nwe have had a debate in the Senate that has strengthened the bill even \nmore.\n  The Senate has adopted other amendments on a bipartisan basis: \nSenator Kerry's amendment to strip pensions from Members convicted of \ncorruption; Senator Salazar's amendment to ensure public access to \ncommittee proceedings; and two amendments by Senator Vitter to \nstrengthen enforcement of ethics rules. And I might add, there are \nother amendments out there waiting to be voted on if, in fact, cloture \nwere invoked on the substitute.\n  Finally, we voted overwhelmingly to invoke cloture on an amendment to \nprevent the things that we did before\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\nwith airplanes. It strengthens the gift ban even further.\n  The underlying bill generally prohibits gifts from lobbyists. The \namendment I offered broadens the gift ban to prevent gifts from \ncompanies and other entities that even hire or retain a lobbyist.\n  We did an excellent job, I repeat, on the travel. It is common sense. \nIt broadens the provision by generally prohibiting congressional travel \npaid for by companies and other entities who hire or retain a lobbyist.\n  The amendment provides exceptions for 1-day participation at events--\nspeech, conference, convention--and for de minimis lobbyist \ninvolvement. It requires advanced approval by the Ethics Committee for \nall privately funded travel, pursuant to guidelines issued by the \ncommittee.\n  Madam President, I believe we have done yeoman's work. I think it is \nso unfortunate that I have been told that the minority would not \nsupport cloture. We will find out. We have a vote scheduled for 12:38 \ntonight. And if the minority desires, we will certainly agree to an \nearlier vote. But I have been told we will not get the additional 16 \nvotes required. We need 66 votes on this--66 votes on this.\n  But I want the world to know that this bill is being brought down not \non a matter of principle because there is no one in the Senate I have \nmore respect and admiration for than the Senator from New Hampshire, \nSenator Judd Gregg. He is a wonderful man, a fine person, and he \nbelieves in this line-item veto. I understand that. But I have told the \nRepublican leader that my friend from New Hampshire or whoever else is \ninterested in this issue can have a full debate on it. We will give \nthem time to do it.\n  But this is not the place. This is not the place. This has nothing to \ndo--we are going to vote. If cloture were invoked, we would vote on I \nthink it is 16 germane amendments. Those are germane. This is not \ngermane. It falls. This has nothing to do with ethics and lobbying \nreform.\n  So I would hope that there would be another view taken of this. This \nbill is being brought down because people do not want to comply with \nethics and lobbying reform. That is what it is all about. All the rest \nis game playing.\n  This is a tough bill. It would drastically change the way we do \nbusiness in Washington for the better. The American public deserves \nthis. I think they are going to demand this. And I think it is a sad \nday for the American people that this bill is going to be brought down. \nBecause it will. We can only supply 50 votes. That is all we have. And \nwe need 66.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, you are new to the Senate and, \ntherefore, you were not here during this debate last year. But all this \nsounds quite familiar.\n  I remember last year we had this very bill on the floor, and our \ncolleagues on the other side were voting against cloture on this very \nbill last year for the very same reason that we will now vote against \ncloture on the bill this year, in order to ensure that more amendments \nare voted upon.\n  How many times have we heard the distinguished majority leader and \nthe distinguished majority whip remind us that the Senate is not the \nHouse. One of the frustrations of being in the majority here is that \nyou have to give the minority votes in order to advance legislation.\n  No one seriously believes--no one--that Republicans do not want to \npass this legislation. That is not credible, I would say to my good \nfriend on the other side of the aisle. We passed it 90 to 8 last year \nwhen my party was in the majority. So no amount of spin is going to \nconvince anyone that the Republicans do not want to pass this bill. We \ndo. We want to pass it after a fair process. And having nongermane \namendments on legislation in the Senate is about as common as the Sun \ncoming up every 24 hours.\n  Now, we have been working, in fact, in a bipartisan fashion on this \nlegislation. Our two managers, Senator Bennett and Senator Feinstein, \nhave been working their way through this. We would like to finish the \nbill. We would like to finish it this week.\n  With respect to the senior Senator from New Hampshire, he is on the \nfloor and would be glad to describe his amendment and how he believes \nthat it is certainly related to this legislation. In fact, his \namendment has been pending, since last Wednesday. A full week in the \nSenate, he has been waiting to get a vote.\n  I do not believe that cloture is necessary on this bill, and I am \nprepared to enter into a unanimous consent agreement which will limit \nthe number of amendments and move us toward completion of the bill. We \nare not in favor of having an unlimited amount of amendments but a \nreasonable number. We have had 10 rollcall votes on the bill to this \npoint, not an incredible number. And allowing us to process the \nremaining amendments is something that simply the minority frequently \ninsists on in the Senate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, will the Republican leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry, I did not yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a question from the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I did not yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I beg your pardon. I thought you did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I understand.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. GREGG. So I can understand the parliamentary situation, I did \noffer this amendment last Wednesday. It does deal with earmarks. We \nhave, as I understand it, spent 8 days of legislative time on this \nbill, of which almost 4 days have been consumed in a discussion of \nearmarks with the majority--not the majority but the plurality of \namendments that we have actually voted on dealing with earmarks.\n  Now, in that context, I guess my question would be this: Why would \nyou have to pull the bill down in order to take this amendment up \nlater?\n  Why in 15 minutes is it not possible to dispose of this amendment? It \nrequires a supermajority because it is subject to a point of order. \nThat saves the majority leader time wherever he wants to give us time \nlater. Why do you have to pull a bill down to dispose of an amendment \nwhich is pretty relevant to what we have been discussing and you can do \nit in 15 minutes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, there is no \nreason to take this bill down. In fact, Republicans hope the bill will \nnot be taken down. What we are asking for is a vote on the Gregg \namendment, not an unreasonable request to the Senate. We see on it \nvirtually every piece of legislation week in and week out.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may ask further, this amendment, which I call a \nsecond look at waste, and some people have characterized it as enhanced \nrescission and others have called it the line-item veto, essentially \nallows the President to send up a package of rescissions, which I \npresume he would have taken out of omnibus bills, which I presume will \nbe mostly earmarks for us to take a vote on. Isn't that something we \nhave been discussing, this concept of earmarks, throughout the debate \non this lobbying bill? And isn't this lobbying bill very much tied into \nthe earmark issue? Isn't one of the real issues of lobbying the ability \nto establish earmarks by using influence?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, he is \nprecisely correct. We have spent a substantial amount of time during \ndebate on this bill discussing that very issue.\n  Mr. GREGG. My final question would be, why don't we just vote on this \namendment and get it over with? I presume the good leader from the \nDemocratic Party, who is an exceptional leader and does a great job, \nwill probably beat me on this amendment. It will be over in 15 minutes, \nbecause he has kept the votes to 15 minutes. And we can wrap this baby \nup.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend.\n  I repeat, there is no good reason why we couldn't finish this bill \ntomorrow night. We are in the process now of surveying the number of \namendments over here that need to be offered. Obviously,\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\nat the top of that list is the Gregg amendment. I would hope we could \ncontinue our discussion about how we might wrap this bill up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The fallaciousness of this argument is astounding. Line-\nitem veto, the last time it left this body, it went to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. It was argued before the Supreme Court, dealing with the \nseparation of powers doctrine. Fifteen minutes dealing with the very \nfiber of our society, our constitutional requirement of separation of \npowers, the legislative, the executive, and judicial branches of \nGovernment? This has implications with the separation of powers between \nthe administration, the White House, and this Congress. To think we \ncould do this in 15 minutes is not fair. I have said, if we want to \nhave a debate on this, I am willing to do that, but not on this bill. \nThis is an effort to bring down this bill. To say that nongermane \namendments come just like the sun comes up every day is not reasonable \nor rational or sound.\n  We have worked through this bill. We have worked on nongermane \namendments, germane amendments, trying to work things out. We are now \nin a parliamentary structure where at 12:38 tonight, the Senate would \ndispose of the Reid amendment No. 4 and then vote to invoke cloture on \nthe substitute amendment. At that time, if cloture were invoked, we \nwould have a number of amendments. As I indicated, I think there are 16 \nthat would require votes because they are germane. My friend from New \nHampshire can talk about having laid this amendment down 5 days ago or \nwhenever he wants to say he laid it down. I don't know when he did. But \nthe fact is, it is a nongermane amendment. It is not on this bill. It \nshould not be on this bill.\n  I have told the distinguished Republican leader, if they want some \ntime to do this, we will set other things aside and do it. But this is \nan attempt to bring down this bill. To think that you could do this in \n15 minutes is absolutely unreasonable. Senator Levin, Senator Byrd, and \nothers filed the case. It went before the U.S. Supreme Court the last \ntime the line-item veto came before this body. Senator Byrd gave 10 \nhours of speeches on the line-item veto here on the Senate floor.\n  To think we could do this in 15 minutes--\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wasn't referring to 15 minutes as the time for debate. I \nwas referring to it as the time that you allow votes on the floor and \nthat the votes on the floor have been condensed and they are efficient. \nI respect the leader's accomplishing that in such short order. The \ndebate has actually occurred. Senator Conrad gave a very impassioned \nresponse to the amendment. I understand Senator Carper has an amendment \nsimilar to my amendment. So, yes, it might take a little time to debate \nit, but I believe we could still deal with it promptly.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I direct, without my losing the floor, a \nquestion to the former chairman of the Budget Committee, someone who \nknows money as well as anybody in this body. Why couldn't we do this at \na later time? I will give you whatever time you want that is \nreasonable. If you want to spend 2, 3, 4 days on this, I am happy to do \nthat. We need time to prepare for this. This new in the session is not \nthe time to do this. I wish to get this ethics bill done. I think I am \nbeing about as reasonable as I can be to set aside a significant amount \nof time prior to the Easter recess to give you an opportunity to do the \nline-item veto. And prior to that time, we could have a couple of \nhearings on this. I also recognize that we have a process in the Senate \nwhere bills can be amended. Sometimes they don't have to be relevant or \ngermane. But I think you have to be in the ballpark.\n\n  We have a CR coming up. We have the supplemental coming up which is \nmoney matters that you could file this on. I think people would have \ntrouble objecting to it procedurally being improper. But right now, \nthis isn't the time to do it. We are talking about doing something to \nmake this body and the House better places to look at from an ethics \nand morality standpoint. I think your forcing us to go forward on this, \nwhich we are not going to do, makes it very difficult. I say this \nwithout pointing at anyone in particular, Democrat or Republican. \nAnyone who votes against cloture is creating some real political \nproblems for himself. I think the American people think that something \nshould be done with this culture of corruption we have back here.\n  Mr. GREGG. Was that question directed at me initially?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, it was. Why can't we do this at a later time when you \nhave all the time you need? I have told the distinguished Republican \nleader, we will have your amendment. We will have Carper or something \nlike that. I am not sure Carper is what we want to go with but \nsomething like that, where we can debate it, have a good debate on it, \nhave you and Senator Conrad leading the debate. Others will want to \njoin in, Senator Byrd and Senator Levin who were plaintiffs in the \ncase. And we can move forward on it. Why couldn't we do that it way?\n  Mr. GREGG. I guess I would ask the inversion of that question which \nis why not do it now? The amendment has been pending. It has been \ndebated. People are fairly sophisticated about this amendment since it \nhas been an issue that has been around here for awhile. I think it \ncould be easily moved forward and discussed and voted on in a very \nprompt way.\n  But independent of that, the reason why I think we should proceed is, \nI can't imagine bringing the bill down over an amendment like this \nwhich is not a partisan amendment. It has always been bipartisan and it \nhas substance to it. It would seem appropriate. But independent of \nthat, as you know, the ability to amend this vehicle gives me a vehicle \nwith this amendment which, first off, the amendment is relevant. It may \nnot be germane, but it is certainly relevant, considering the fact that \nit deals primarily with earmarks. But it gives me a vehicle with which \nto go to conference, and I want to at least get this thing to \nconference. Granted, the House will probably stand in disagreement, and \nyou will control the conference. And you may decide that you are not \ngoing to take it and you will recede to the House. But at least I will \nhave gotten to the conference with what I consider to be a fundamental \nreform, which goes to the issue of ethics, which is when the President \nsees something in a bill which he thinks inappropriate and it probably \ngot in there through lobbying, he can send it back for another look by \nus. That is my primary concern.\n  If the position of the Democratic leader is that you will give us \ntime on the floor and if we succeed, we will have a commitment to go to \nconference, assuming we can conference--I mean, is the House going to \npass a bill that we get into a position where it can get to conference \nsomehow--that is something I would consider.\n  Mr. REID. You are talking about if we do this at another, subsequent \ntime?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, if I had a commitment that we would somehow get it to \nconference.\n  Mr. REID. I am going to meet the distinguished Speaker of the House \nin 20 minutes. I will be happy to visit with her about that. I don't \nsee why we couldn't have some assurance that it would go to conference. \nAs you know, I believe in conferences. I think they should go forward. \nI would work very hard to get that done. I would say to my friend and \nthose who can hear me that you can see through this a thousand miles. I \nam sure there are Senators who are overjoyed that this matter won't \nbecome law; I mean the ethics legislation. This matter, the line-item \nveto, is not a simple procedure, as my friend indicates. I repeat, it \nhas very difficult constitutional problems, as indicated when the \nSupreme Court knocked it out last time. We can't debate this in a few \nminutes. I am willing to spend whatever time and give the Senator \nwhatever assurances I can that we will try to move this on, move this \nbeyond where we are here to conference.\n  I say this: There are people who are Democrats who have some degree \nof confidence in being able to do something that is a line-item veto. \nSenator Carper has something. You might not like what he has done. I am \nnot an expert on what he has done, but he is\n\n[[Page S656]]\n\nproud of it. Senator Conrad had some other ideas. We would agree on \none. We would match it with yours. It would take us a few weeks to come \nup with that. But as I told the distinguished Republican leader, we \nwill bring this up at a specific time, not a hit-or-miss time, prior to \nthe recess we are going to have for Easter. I think that is reasonable.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a further question. If the \nSenator could in the same unanimous consent give me some sort of safe \nharbor that I will get to conference with my language, I think we might \nbe on to something.\n  Mr. REID. I can give you this assurance: I will do everything I can \nto get this to conference. I have not discussed this with the \ndistinguished Speaker or anyone over there, but I will be happy to work \nto see that that is done. As the distinguished Senator knows, I will \nwork to get it to conference, but as we have learned--and if we get it \nto conference, it will be a public conference. It will be one where \nDemocrats will be there and Republicans will be there from both the \nHouse and the Senate. But as you know, we have more votes than you \nhave, so I can't guarantee what would happen in conference. But I will \ndo everything I can to get it to conference.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the leader would yield further, I don't think this \nshould be characterized as an amendment to bring down the bill. That is \nsort of a unilateral authority of the leader, of course. But it is \ncertainly not my intention with this amendment, nor was it my intention \nwith this amendment. I simply want to move this item along. I think \nthis is an appropriate vehicle. But it sounds to me as if there might \nbe a framework here for some progress. I will leave it to the good \nleaders to discuss this.\n  Mr. REID. I want the record to reflect that the Senator from New \nHampshire offered this--and I said this in my remarks--because he \nbelieves in it. This is something he believes in. It was not offered by \nthe Senator from New Hampshire to bring down the bill. But that is what \nis happening. I am sorry to say there are other Senators who see this \nas an opportunity to bring down the bill. I would hope we can work \nsomething out on this. I want to move forward on this legislation. I \nwant the Senator from New Hampshire to move forward on his legislation.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire knows, I don't agree with your \nlegislation. But I will work, as I have indicated before to whoever is \nwatching this Senate proceeding, to do everything I can to get a \nconference and have an open public conference. If we pass something \nhere, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to point out, I was on the \nfloor when this item was discussed, when the Senator from New Hampshire \noffered his line-item veto amendment. I was also on the floor when \nSenator Conrad, who is our side's budget expert, came forward and \ndebated it.\n  There was a rather fulsome debate. I want to recount what Senator \nConrad said about his belief about the amendment, that not only does it \nraise serious constitutional concerns, but it would allow the President \nto unilaterally block enacted funding, even if Congress rejects a \nproposed rescission. In addition, rather than strengthening fiscal \ndiscipline, the amendment could lead to more spending, not less. He \npointed out how it could be used to eliminate entire new programs or \nimprovements to benefits such as Medicare and Social Security. The \nPresident would have a year after a bill's enactment to propose a \nrescission. The President could package rescissions as he or she wishes \nand could combine rescissions that have been enacted in several \ndifferent pieces of legislation. Senators would be forced to vote on \nthe package with little opportunity for public notice or input and no \nopportunity to offer amendments, nor would there be any opportunity to \nfilibuster proposed rescissions. The new power would make it much \neasier for a President to eliminate new Medicare or Social Security \nbenefits to which he objects.\n  Now, I agree very much with what the majority leader said. This is a \nvery problematic amendment. It was debated on the floor of the Senate. \nIt needs further refinement if anybody is going to move ahead with it. \nClearly, it is a major amendment. Clearly, it is a real problem for our \nside. But for the minority to take down the bill over this amendment \nwhen the amendment is not germane to the bill, when I have tried very \nhard to keep matters that are not within the scope of the bill off the \nbill, including a matter I myself very much wanted to present, I think \nmakes no sense.\n  The minority leader pointed out that this bill passed before, 2 years \nago, by a vote of 90 to 8. The whole point of this legislation is to \nshow that the two sides can come together, be bipartisan, and enact a \nbill that will bring about ethics, lobbying, and earmark reform. And we \nhave done that.\n  As Senator Bennett, the ranking member, and I have sat on this floor, \nthere has been ample time for Members to bring their amendments to the \nfloor. I assure you that there has been a lot of time when we have just \nsat here in a quorum call. To allow this bill to be pulled down at this \ntime is just a special matter of some kind of pique, when we know that \nthe line-item veto amendment is extraordinarily problematic and \ndeserves another venue, deserves more scrutiny, and should take some \ntime before it is passed in any way, shape, or form.\n  So I am fully in support of what the majority leader had to say. It \nmakes no sense for the other side to take down this bill over it. I \nhope the proposal made by the majority leader will be accepted. I \nbelieve he will keep his word. I will help in any way I possibly can to \nsee that that is, in fact, the case. But we are so close to getting \nthis bill done, and it has some momentous things in it that represent a \ntotal change of the way these bodies operate, and they are important, \nsignificant, and timely. We ought to pass this bill. We ought to show \nthe American people that we can work together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, for a common purpose. So I just want to say that after a \nweek and a half, I am profoundly disappointed that this has come about. \nI really thought we were going to be able to work together and pass a \nstrong, bipartisan bill. And, in fact, most of the amendments have \npassed by huge majorities. I think there have only been two that have \nbeen relatively close.\n  I urge the Republican side to reconsider. There are so many positive \nelements of this bill, and the American people will be so shortchanged \nif we cannot solve whatever problem there is between us and pass a bill \nthat we voted on 90 to 8 some time ago, which has even been \nstrengthened by some of the eight members who voted against it because \nthey didn't think it was strong enough. This is a very strong measure.\n  Those of us who will work in conference will work to smooth out any \nbumps. We will work in an open way, and no side will be shut out of the \nconference. I pledge it will be a collegial conference. This is our \nopportunity to set an agenda for the 110th Congress. Please, please, \nplease, let us not reject this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have been working for a week and a half \non this bill, S. 1, which is the highest priority of the Democratic \nmajority in the new Congress because we believe, as it says, providing \ngreater transparency in the legislative process is a starting point. \nTrying to restore public confidence in the way we work here is a \nstarting point.\n  I was heartened by the fact that this bill, as well as the substitute \namendment and other amendments offered, has largely been bipartisan. \nMost of the debate has been bipartisan in nature. With few exceptions, \nthe rollcalls have been bipartisan. It troubles me that we have reached \nthis procedural impasse with the minority that, with the power given to \nit in the Senate, is threatening to bring down this bill. I am \nsearching my mind to understand why they would want to bring down a \nbill that would clean up this culture of corruption in Washington and \nmake substantial ethical changes.\n  I have come to the conclusion that it has to do with indigestion. \nWhat I am referring to is this: For every decision in political life \nthere is usually a good reason and a real reason. The good reason \nstated by the Republican side--or\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\none they portray as a good reason--is they want to offer an amendment, \nwhich is characterized as a simple amendment. The bill is 55 pages \nlong; the amendment is 24 pages long--almost half the size of the bill. \nIt is not simple; it is very complex. It is on the legislative line-\nitem veto.\n  Senator Reid, as majority leader, has already made a good-faith \noffering even before we came to the floor to the Republican minority \nand said that it is important and deserves its day on the Senate floor. \nWe will guarantee you that we will debate this bill before the Easter \nrecess, a like bill to be offered on the Democratic side. Let's bring \nit to a debate and a vote and see which, if either, prevails and take \nit from there. That was a good-faith offering.\n  So the so-called good reason the Republicans are threatening to bring \ndown the ethics bill just doesn't hold. We have already made the best \noffer that the minority could ever expect, and I know that having \nserved in the minority for most of my time in the Senate.\n  But there is also a real reason they are trying to insert line-item \nveto into this ethics bill. Sadly, I am afraid it is because as they \nsat together over lunch and read the provisions of this bill that will \nnow likely pass, it caused indigestion among the Republican ranks and, \nas a consequence, they said we need a reason to stop this bill. Well, \nthe reason turned out to be the legislative line-item veto.\n  For those who follow what happens in Washington, it is my belief that \nsomewhere in the White House the President has a veto pen. I don't know \nif it is one pen or many pens, but my guess is if it is one pen, most \nof us know already that there is a lot of ink left in this pen. For \nover the 6 years the President has been in the White House he has only \nvetoed one bill, and that was the stem cell research bill. He has never \nvetoed a spending bill in the entire 6 years that he has served as \nPresident.\n  The suggestion by the Republicans now that this President has been \nlonging for the chance to veto spending bills to show how fiscally \nconservative he is is not supported by the evidence. Time and again, \nthis President signed appropriations bills without hesitation. Now we \nare being told if he just had this new power, he could bring spending \nunder control. We know better. We know spending starts with the \nPresident's budget. We know that year after year, the President has \ntaken us away from the surplus of the Clinton years into the deepest \ndeficits in the history of the United States.\n  Now we are being told the reason we cannot address ethics is we need \nto give the President a new power to veto spending bills for the first \ntime in over 6 years. It doesn't really stand the test of scrutiny for \nus to consider this as a suggestion that is based in fact. It clearly \nis a reason to stop the ethics bill.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, let's not give \nup on this bipartisan effort and see this ethics bill go down. Yes, as \nthe minority, you have the power to bring the bill down. Perhaps you \nbelieve the legislative line-item veto is the way to bring it down, but \nthe American people are not going to buy it. They understand that \nstrengthening disclosure on earmarks, eliminating dead-of-night \nprovisions in conference reports, respecting minorities in conference \ncommittees, and ensuring proper valuation for gifts and meals and \ntickets that Members of Congress receive, closing the loophole and the \nrevolving door as Members leave public life and go into the private \nsector, negotiating for lobbying jobs while still in Congress, \nenhancing the oversight of staff level job negotiations, enhancing \nfiscal transparency and lobbyist disclosure, lobbyist certification and \ncompliance with gift rules--these are powerful. They are big changes \nand they are long overdue. We tried a year ago under Republican \nleadership and failed. I hope we don't fail again because the \nRepublican minority wants to bring the bill down. I hope that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will reconsider their \nposition. I hope they will come back and join us in passing this \nbipartisan bill, making sure we do the people's work before we leave \nthis week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I don't want to get deep into this \nconfrontation between the two leaders, but I say to my good friend from \nIllinois--and he is my good friend--that I was present at the \nRepublican luncheon and there was no indigestion on this bill. I was \nasked by the Republican leader to present where we are on the floor to \nthe members of the conference. By the way, our rule is that we don't \ndiscuss anything that happens in the Republican conference, so I am \nbending that rule. We are allowed to at least discuss what we \npersonally say. So I will not disclose what anybody else said, but I \nwill bend the rule a little to characterize it.\n  I made the presentation as to where we were on the floor. There was \nno pushback whatsoever to the idea that we should pass this bill. There \nwas no suggestion from any Member of the Republican conference that \nthis bill should be taken down by some subterfuge.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has gone to the leader and made a \nrequest. The leader has responded to the request, feeling that the \nSenator from New Hampshire is entitled to a vote. We are where we are. \nThe leaders will make their decision and have their discussion. I want \nto make the record as clear as I possibly can that any Republican who \nwants to use this as a subterfuge to take down the bill has not made \nhis or her position known to me or to the leader. There is no \nsuggestion of that at all of which I am aware.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may follow up on the Senator's comments, it is \nobvious that the only person who can bring the bill down is the \nDemocratic leader, if that is his choice. His choice appears to be \nbased on the fact that he doesn't want to vote on the second look at \nwaste amendment or enhanced rescission, which is tied into this bill.\n  As I mentioned earlier, almost 30 percent of the amendments offered \nhave dealt with earmarks, and half of the time of the debate here in \nthe last 8 days has been on earmarks. So it is not as if this is \nsomething that is totally off track or truly outside the realm. This \nisn't a farm amendment on the lobbying bill; this is a lobbying \namendment on the lobbying bill. It doesn't have germaneness because \nthat is a very narrow test, but it is sure relevant and on point. It \nclearly deals with earmarks, and it also deals within appropriate \nactions from lobbyists who get earmarks into the bills and bury them in \nomnibus bills. That is the purpose.\n  So the idea that this amendment is some sort of poison pill to the \nbill, it wasn't offered for that purpose and doesn't have that as its \npurpose. The Republican membership is ready to go forward and vote and \nis ready to either win or lose on this amendment.\n  The language of the assistant Democratic leader is such that it \nsounds to me as if maybe they don't want the bill. Maybe they concluded \nthey don't want the bill because they are the only ones talking about \npulling the bill down. We are not talking about pulling the bill down. \nWe are talking about getting a vote on a reasonable amendment. \nIndependent of that, I have made an offer----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? \nMaybe I am misinterpreting something. Will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I will.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair, I thought what was said was that \nif the Senator from New Hampshire doesn't get a vote on his amendment, \nthat his side will vote ``no'' on cloture. That was clearly what I \nheard. Am I wrong?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, that is absolutely true. We should have a vote on our \namendment, and as soon as we get a vote on our amendment, we can go to \nfinal passage. What is wrong with that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will tell the Senator what is wrong \nwith it.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have not yielded the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The amendment is a very complicated amendment. It is \nimpossible to understand, it is a lengthy amendment, and all of the \nreverberations. I contend and say that it is out of the scope of this \nbill, and we hope to keep the bill away from these kinds of contentious \nmatters but pass those items within the scope of the bill. I thought \nthere was general agreement with that position. I thought the\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\nSenator would recognize, based on the debate Senator Gregg had with \nSenator Conrad that there were real questions with the amendment that \ntook further study. My impression was the Senator from New Hampshire \nwas willing to go through that process at the time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I may reclaim my time, I have actually \nsuggested to the Democratic leader and have taken him up on his \nsuggestion as a way we can pursue this issue. I hope it will be done \nthat way and that will resolve the matter. But I continue to hear, even \nafter making that suggestion to the assistant leader, that we on our \nside of the aisle are attempting to bring the bill down. That is not a \ndefensible position because the only people who can bring this bill \ndown are on your side. You can take it off the floor. We can insist on \nour right to a vote, which we have every right to do, and it is \nreasonable to do, and especially reasonable to do in the context of \nthis amendment which the Senator claims is complicated. It is not; it \nis fairly straightforward. In fact, it is much more straightforward and \nless complicated than the substitute amendment which has never gone \nthrough committee. It came here as a substitute amendment, drafted by \nthe two leaders out of their offices. It is a very complex amendment--\nin fact, so complex that I heard both sides of the leadership of the \nbill trying to explain certain sections of it and they had different \nexplanations as to how it affected, for example, private citizens who \nhappen to be married to Members of Congress. It is extremely complex \nlanguage.\n  My language at least has pretty much been vetted. It has been vetted \nall the way to the Supreme Court. It has gone through subcommittee, \ncommittee, it has been on the floor, debated, it has been debated \nagain, it has been debated, and it was offered--in fact, my language \nwas actually offered, in essence, by the Democratic Party as their \nsubstitute to the original line-item bill. In fact, the Senator from \nCalifornia supported the language when it was offered back in 1995. The \nSenator from California said:\n\n       I believe that what a line-item veto essentially does is \n     encourage caution on the part of both the Chief Executive and \n     the legislative branch. I think the time has come for fiscal \n     discipline and, as I said, I sincerely believe the line-item \n     veto can help us achieve that goal.\n\n  So this matter has been debated extensively on the floor. It has been \nvoted on before. It is not a matter of first impression. It is a matter \nof considerable discussion, and it is not unique. It is related to this \nbill.\n  The Senator from California used the term ``scope.'' Were the term \n``scope'' applied to postcloture standing of an amendment, this \namendment would stand. But scope is not the operative language. \nGermaneness is, and germaneness is a much narrower test in postcloture, \nas we know it is extraordinarily difficult to get germaneness with any \namendment that has any breadth to it. That is the reason it falls \npostcloture, and that is the reason why it should be taken up and voted \non before cloture. But I am willing to push the vote off if we are \nguaranteed what the Democratic leader has suggested he will guarantee \nus. I won't put words in his mouth. I think what he said was: You will \nget the vote on your amendment; you will have an amendment from your \nside; they will both be subject to 60 votes, with time limit on debate, \nand it will go to conference.\n  In that context, I think we can resolve this matter. But I take a \nlittle bit of umbrage at the idea that the other side of the aisle \ncontinues to characterize, even after that presentation had been worked \nout, our side of the aisle as trying to bring this bill down because \nthe only person who has the right to bring this bill down right now is \nthe majority leader. He controls the floor, he decides what is on the \nfloor, and he can bring it down if he wishes.\n  We do not wish to bring this bill down. We simply wish to get a vote \non a reasonable amendment that won't survive germaneness postcloture; \ntherefore, it has to be voted before cloture. It is an entirely \nreasonable position for the minority to take, especially since the \namendment has been aggressively vetted by having been through this \nprocess so many times and actually has been pretty well defined by the \nSupreme Court as to what rights we have and what rights we don't have. \nThat is why it is structured the way it is so it is constitutional.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the pending \nbusiness at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Nelson amendment \nNo. 71.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may proceed to speak on this overall \nissue that has been going back and forth for quite some time, I find \nmyself somewhat amused. I don't quite understand what all the fuss is \nabout. I have been through this before. I have been in the position of \nresisting an amendment such as this. I have been in the position of \nadvocating an amendment such as this. Everybody is getting their press \nreleases ready now to go out to put their spin on this issue. I wish to \nmake a brief effort to try to put it into proper perspective.\n  First, the idea or the suggestion that Republicans don't want to get \nthis to conclusion is not credible because I managed this bill last \nyear. We did it in a bipartisan way. As Senator McConnell has said, we \ngot an overwhelming vote. I think it was 90 to 8, and it had tough \nprovisions in there, including most of what is in this bill.\n  Keep in mind, the underlying bill from last year was introduced by a \nbipartisan group, leaders on both sides, to begin this debate. Then \nthere was a substitute laid down with some additional changes. Then we \nwent forward with the amendments.\n  I don't think it is fair to characterize this as one side or the \nother trying to stop a result. As a matter of fact, I thought our \nleaders were going to come together. It is OK, we are going to identify \na number of amendments about which Members are serious, and we could \nhave votes on them this afternoon and Thursday and finish up Thursday \nnight or Friday. Now I guess there is a little bit of a manhood thing \nhere where one side is going to show the other.\n  Again, having been through this, when Senators do feel strongly about \nan issue, who have done the kind of work Senator Gregg has done, they \nare going to get a vote and they should get a vote. It is very simple. \nWe could get a time agreement. Obviously, Senator Gregg would be \nprepared to come up with a reasonable time agreement. It is an \nimportant issue, but it certainly has been debated.\n  I have been on all sides of this issue over the last 10 years or so, \nand we could have a vote on a few other amendments and complete our \nwork and then await conference, by the way, which won't occur until \nsome time in March or April because the House action which has been \ndescribed basically as getting the job done was only a rules change in \nthe House. They didn't do anything about lobby reform, and they are not \ngoing to do so until March. It is not that we are in a tear to catch up \nwith the House. We are going to complete this in a reasonable time, and \nthen we will wait, but we are going to get a result because there are \nthings we need to do with ethics, lobbying reform.\n  We can do it. We should do it. Some have gotten out of control. Now \nwe are in a long process of self-flagellation without getting to \ncleaning up some things that need to be changed.\n  With regard to the specifics of this amendment, I was involved in the \nprocess in the nineties when we passed the line-item veto. I was very \nmuch an advocate of it. I remember we had a bipartisan group that did \nthat. I know Senator Byrd spoke vigorously against it. We got it done, \nand it went to the Supreme Court. Before it went to the Supreme Court, \nPresident Clinton used the line-item veto for the first time, and I was \npretty shocked by the list he came up with. Then I thought: Well, maybe \nI was wrong after all to support this power of the President.\n  This is not the same thing. This has been developed by Senator Gregg \nspecifically addressing questions or problems of the line-item veto. I \ndon't want to give Presidents, as they have had, by the way, and used \nfor years, a summary rescission. This is a process, and I looked at it \ncarefully.\n  I had reservations about the draft we were talking about last year. I \ndon't\n\n[[Page S659]]\n\nparticularly like giving the President four bites of the apple. But I \ndo like the fact that if we have some rescissions that go to reduce the \ndeficit, Presidents can't put the same rescission project multiple \ntimes. He gets a shot at it, and then he can come up with a different \nlist.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation. I think it will help to bring \nspending under control. I do think it will allow the President, when \nthere is a project that cannot be defended in the light of day, a \nchance to take it out, and then we have to vote on it. And, by the way, \nit is not in perpetuity. It is for 4 years. This President will have \nthis authority for 2 years, and the next President will have this \nauthority for 2 years. Is that the correct timing on this amendment?\n  It has a sunset. We will see how it works. If we don't like it, if we \ndon't agree with it, if we are embarrassed by the result, it will \nsunset, and then that will be the end of it unless we extend it. Is \nthat a correct interpretation?\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, that is correct. This is 4 years, but this \nPresident probably won't get 2 years of it. He will probably get a year \nand a half.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. I don't know why we have all this huffing \nand puffing. Let's set it up, have some debate, have a vote, and let's \nmove on. By the way, I believe Senator Reid has the majority, and as \nSenator Gregg pointed out, it takes 60 votes to get this through. I \ndon't think it is going to happen.\n  Senator Gregg has been willing to work out any and all kinds of \nagreements. I don't know how in the world the leader could keep a \ncommitment to get it in conference out of whole cloth. Maybe he has \nsome plan afoot.\n  So far we have worked pretty good. I was a little embarrassed last \nweek. We had one of our Members offer an amendment. I voted against it, \nbut he won fair and square. And then we went through this exercise \nwhere we were going to strong-arm Members into switching their vote. \nOur Members said, wait a minute, including me. I was going to switch \nback the other way because I thought that a mistreatment. All he was \ntrying to do on earmarks was put us in line or in sync with what the \nHouse had passed.\n  I still don't particularly like that language. I think it is going to \ncreate some problems, but I thought it was a very good amendment. \nBasically, that put us in a holding pattern for the rest of the week or \n3 or 4 days.\n  Hopefully the Democratic leadership will quit trying to fix blame and \ncome up with a way we can complete this good work. The managers have \nbeen dealing with it and moving it along. I looked at the list of \namendments. I don't see too many amendments that will be a problem in \nterms of time and debate and completing the work. Let's find a way to \nget this done, then await further House action, and then see if we can \ncome up with a good product that is in the best interest of this \ninstitution and the American people. I believe this rescission package \nwould help us get to that point.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Mississippi for \nthat explanation. I simply want to add a little bit of history, which I \ndid previously, to his comments. He said when he saw how President \nClinton used the line-item veto he began to wonder if he hadn't, in \nfact, made a mistake by supporting it. I supported the line-item veto. \nWhen I saw how President Clinton used it, I was sure I had made a \nmistake. Here on the floor and in the debate with Senator Moynihan and \nSenator Byrd, I made the commitment that I would never support the \nline-item veto again because it was used in a way I had not \nanticipated. It was used in a way very different from the way State \nlegislatures have dealt with the line-item vetoes that Governors had. \nThat was my rationale for supporting it. I said: The Governors have it \nand it works; why shouldn't the President have it? That is because I \ndidn't understand the way the Congress really works. So I said I will \nnever support a line-item veto again.\n\n  When the White House called me and said, We need your vote on this, I \nsaid, You won't get it. And then when I saw the details of what the \nSenator from New Hampshire has crafted, I realized, as he has pointed \nout, that it is crafted with the Supreme Court rescission in mind, with \nthe history of the experience with President Clinton in mind, and I am \nnow willing to support the enhanced rescission legislation the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has proposed because, as he has said, this is not \nthe line-item veto.\n  Our friends in the press like a quick headline that they think \neverybody can understand, and they use the headline ``line-item veto,'' \nand then it sticks. In fact, that is not what it is, and a careful \nreading of the bill makes it clear that is not what it is. If, indeed, \nthat were what it was, I would vote against it.\n  But I am hoping the Democratic leader, the majority leader, can work \nout something which can give the opportunity for this to be brought \nforward, debated, and then voted on. I do note, as the Senator from New \nHampshire has noted, that in order for it to pass, it would require 60 \nvotes. So if, indeed, there are 41 votes against it, the logical thing \nto do is bring it up, kill it, and let us move forward. But apparently \nthere are not 41 votes against it. I don't know, but I am guessing. So \nwe are where we are. I am hoping it all gets worked out because I think \nwe are close to getting this bill done. I think it is a bill that both \nsides can vote for overwhelmingly. I have enjoyed working with the \nchairman of the committee in getting reasonable adjustments in the \nbill, and it would be a shame to see all of that hard work go down the \ndrain if we can't get this resolved.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand we are having a discussion on \nthe floor about the amendment being proposed by Senator Gregg from New \nHampshire, known as the second look at wasteful spending amendment, to \nthe pending legislation, which is called the Legislative Transparency \nAct of 2007. I spoke on this particular amendment offered by Senator \nGregg last week, and I came to the Chamber and expressed my strong \nsupport for what Senator Gregg is trying to do. For the life of me, I \ndon't understand why we would want to put an issue such as this off, \nbecause it adds transparency to the process. That is the name of the \nbill we have before us: the Legislative Transparency Act of 2007.\n  What the Gregg amendment would do is to allow the President to \nidentify certain items in bills that are earmarks or may be classified \nas pork barrel spending. Then once those provisions have been \nidentified, they would get singled out, and then, the President can \nbring those forward and allow the House and the Senate to vote on those \nseparately.\n  What happens so many times in legislation that comes before the \nCongress is a process which is called logrolling. It is an old term; it \nhas been around for a long time. You just keep adding issues in there \nand adding issues in there and make a piece of legislation bigger, and \nyou pick up votes, and the bill gets so big and cumbersome that it is \ndifficult to find people who are going to vote against it because there \nare so many issues in there they support. So what Senator Gregg does to \nbring transparency to this process is to take out those single issues, \ngive the President an opportunity to pull those out and send them back \nto both the House and the Senate, and we vote on them as a separate \nissue. That creates a clear position on that particular issue from the \nHouse and the Senate. I daresay if we do that, we will cut back on a \nlot of spending, for those of us who are concerned about the mounting \ndeficits in our Federal budget, who are concerned about accountability, \nand who are concerned about the process around here, both in setting up \na budget and then the appropriations bills that come forward.\n  I think it is an accountability issue, and I hope we can bring this \nup and have a vote, in my view, the sooner the better because right now \nwe are involved in an appropriations process that got bogged down from \nthe last session because of earmarks and those\n\n[[Page S660]]\n\nkinds of spending provisions, and we are getting ready to go into a \nbudget process and then right back into appropriations. So the sooner \nwe can deal with this type of legislation, the better.\n  I am hoping the leadership here in the Senate would consider and \neventually allow us to bring this up, and as I say, the sooner the \nbetter because it brings accountability to the budget process. That is \nsomething we have all been talking about, those of us who are serious \nabout getting the deficit under control, those of us who are serious \nabout some accountability in the budgeting process. If I secure funding \nfor a project in an appropriations bill, I don't have any problem \nletting people know about it because what I do is I go through the \nprocess of getting it authorized; that is, the authorizing committee \nhas looked at it and they have verified that whatever it is that is in \nthe amendment is legitimate, they have reached a consensus on what \nneeds to be done to bring accountability to that particular project or \nprogram. Then you take it to the Appropriations Committee, and they \nallocate the money and they keep allocating the money, and by holding \non to the purse strings, they continue to make that an accountable \nprocess. If we have any shortfall in what is going on, it is a lack of \naccountability in the budgeting process and in the appropriations \nprocess. I don't believe this makes it any more complicated. I myself \nthink it is pretty straightforward, and I think it is constitutional.\n  Now, we had sort of a line-item rescission process this Congress \npassed a number of years back with a large reform. The courts looked at \nit and decided it was unconstitutional. But in this legislation the \nfinal decision is made by the Congress. We leave control of the purse \nstrings here in the Congress. The President just delineates a few of \nthese programs or projects and then brings them back to the Senate, and \nwe vote on them separately.\n  So I just felt compelled to come to the floor and reemphasize how \nvery important I believe it is that we step forward and we begin to act \non these kinds of commonsense solutions Senator Gregg has offered. He \nwas chairman of the Budget Committee. He has worked hard on this issue. \nI supported his Stop Overspending Act of 2006 when he introduced it in \nthe last Congress. It had a similar provision in there. This is \nimportant. I hope we can get an opportunity to act on this particular \nprovision before we move off of this piece of legislation. I ask my \ncolleagues here in the Senate to join us in trying to bring excessive \nspending under control.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I know we are in an unfortunate \ngridlock at the moment, but earlier in the afternoon my friend from \nUtah, Senator Bennett, rose to indicate that he intended, at some point \nin the debate, to move to strike a section of the bill regarding so-\ncalled grassroots lobbying. It requires disclosure of people doing paid \ngrassroots lobbying exceeding a certain threshold of spending every \nyear. And this provision is part of the title of the bill before us \nthat came out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, of which I am privileged to chair and of which I am \nprivileged to have the distinguished Presiding Officer as a new member \nof.\n  I wish to respond to several statements that Senator Bennett made. We \nwill have a fuller debate, I am sure, before he asks for a vote on his \namendment. But for the record, for the information of my colleagues, I \nwish to speak in favor of what I believe is one of the most important \nelements of this lobbying reform legislation.\n  The original provision, sponsored in committee by my friend from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, and myself, requires, for the first time, \ndisclosure of so-called paid grassroots lobbying. Much has been said--I \nfear, too much of it not on point--about this provision and its \npurported impact on free speech. I wish to reassure my colleagues that \nthose claims about this provision are not true.\n  This grassroots lobbying provision would do nothing to stop, deter or \ninterfere with individuals exercising their constitutional rights to \npetition our Government for redress. We are talking about disclosure, \nnot censorship, not limits in any way on lobbying. We are talking about \ndisclosure of large sums of money spent by professional organizations. \nWe are not talking about barring any organization from conducting a \ngrassroots lobbying campaign. And we are not talking about small \ngrassroots lobbying efforts.\n  We are talking about major media campaigns, mass mailings, large \nphone banks, designed for the purpose of influencing Members of \nCongress or the executive branch on specific issues. There is nothing \nwrong with that. But it has become, as I will discuss in a moment, an \never-increasing, evermore expensive part of the way in which people use \ntheir constitutional right to petition their Government, and it has, \nunfortunately, been abused, particularly in the Abramoff case. This \nprovision would shine the disinfecting, the edifying, the illuminating, \nthe educating sunshine of public disclosure, but would impose no \nlimitation on constitutional rights.\n  Our former colleague, the late Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas--a \nwonderful man and a great Senator--once referred to this kind of paid \ngrassroots lobbying as ``astroturf lobbying'' because it was not real \ngrassroots lobbying. It was generated, manufactured, and not self-\ngrown. It, to me, defies logic to require a company to disclose--as we \ndo in law now, and would even more according to the underlying bill, S. \n1--to require a company to disclose its direct lobbying of Members of \nCongress, while giving that same company a pass by not requiring it to \ndisclose anything with regard to its efforts to manufacture and \ngenerate thousands of pieces of mail and calls for the same purpose.\n  To avoid confusion, I want my colleagues to understand what this \nprovision does and what it does not do. It does not ban or restrict \ngrassroots lobbying of any kind in any way. That would be wrong. \nGrassroots lobbying is an important way for people to get involved and \ncontact their Members of Congress or the executive branch. There is \nnothing wrong with astroturf lobbying, as Senator Bentsen described it, \neither. It is not self-generated grass, but it is appropriate, \nconstitutional and legal and nothing in this provision of S. 1 would \nstop it.\n  This legislation simply requires disclosure of the amount of money \nspent on grassroots lobbying when it is conducted by professional \norganizations. The opponents of this measure would have us believe we \nare trying to amend the first amendment. That is not true. Our Senate \nphones are often jammed with callers expressing their points of view \nand all giving the exact same message. That comes from somewhere, is \npaid for by somebody and is part of an organized effort, and the public \nand the Members have a right to know who is paying and how much.\n  I wish to note this provision responds directly to one element of the \nAbramoff scandal. Mr. Abramoff funneled money from one of his clients, \nthe Mississippi Choctaw Indians, to a grassroots lobbying firm run by \nRalph Reed to oppose pro-gambling measures. The Choctaws were \nparticularly interested in stifling competition to their gambling \nactivities. Well, it seems to me in that case the public had a right to \nknow the anti-gambling campaign was funded by those trying to protect--\nwhich is their right--their own position in the gambling industry from \nfurther competition.\n  Mr. Abramoff also directed his clients--and here is where we get into \nbig problems--to pay millions of dollars to grassroots lobbying firms \ncontrolled by himself and his associate Michael Scanlon, fees that were \nin part directed back to Mr. Abramoff personally but never known by the \npublic as direct fees. If the disclosure requirements that we are \nproposing here had been in place, Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Scanlon would \nhave had to have disclosed these multimillion dollar fees they passed \nthrough this grassroots lobbying operation and, therefore, I believe \nthey probably would not have been able to pull that particular scam off \nso easily.\n\n[[Page S661]]\n\n  In crafting this provision, Senator Levin and I have been careful to \nlisten to grassroots organizations and have incorporated several \nsafeguards to make sure we do nothing to inhibit their exercise of free \nspeech. We make clear, for example, that the grassroots lobbying effort \nmust be in support of a direct lobbying effort. Grassroots activities \nwithout connection to lobbying do not trigger a reporting requirement \nin and of themselves. So no matter what is being said here, I assure my \ncolleagues that if this bill passes with this provision in it, anyone \npicking up their phone of their own free will to tell their Member of \nCongress how they feel about an issue is not going to face any \nrequirements under our amendment.\n  Here is another threshold the amendment requires. Some people say: \nWhat if an organizational leader writes to his Members or a clergyman \nwrites to his church to urge them to express an opinion on a particular \nmatter to Members of Congress? It wouldn't be covered by this. We \nexclude efforts that are not professional, that are not paid for, and \nwe exclude all efforts that cost less than $25,000 per quarter. That is \na significant exemption, and it means that an organization can spend up \nto $100,000 a year on paid grassroots lobbying without triggering the \ndisclosure requirement. Again, we also exclude communication made by \norganizations to their own members. And we exclude any communication \ndirected at less than 500 members of the general public.\n  So what we are asking for is disclosure of spending over $25,000 per \nquarter to get others to engage in grassroots lobbying, and we are \nasking them to report just one number rounded to the nearest $20,000. \nEleven years ago, Senator Levin unsuccessfully fought for a grassroots \nlobbying disclosure provision when Congress originally passed the \nLobbying Disclosure Act. At the time he said, to the best of his \nknowledge, grassroots lobbying campaigns spent about $700 million a \nyear. To the best of my knowledge, though obviously we don't know \nbecause there is no disclosure, that figure has multiplied probably \ninto the billions per year, and the public has no accurate picture of \nwho is spending what to influence others to lobby Congress. That is \nwhat this provision would do.\n  My friend from Utah, Senator Bennett, pointed out that the first \namendment protects the right of every American to petition Government \nfor redress of grievances. Of course, that is true, and lobbying is \npart of that. As I said in my opening statement on this bill, it is a \nconstitutionally protected right. The Senator further pointed out that \nthe Supreme Court has said this right is not diminished if performed \nfor others for a fee. That is also correct. I agree. Nothing about \ndisclosure, however, is inconsistent with that first amendment right. \nRequiring disclosure under certain narrow circumstances is all our \ngrassroots provision would try to do. The fact is, the Supreme Court \nhas upheld disclosure requirements for direct lobbying. I am confident \nthat the Court's reasoning applies equally to the disclosure we are \nproposing for paid efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying.\n  In the leading case on lobbyist disclosure, which is U.S. v. Harriss, \ndecided in 1954, the Supreme Court considered the Federal Regulation of \nLobbying Act which at that time required every person ``receiving any \ncontributions or expending any money for the purpose of influencing the \npassage or defeat of any legislation by Congress'' to report \ninformation about their clients, their contributions, and their \nexpenditures. The Supreme Court upheld in that case disclosure \nrequirements for the Court's narrow definition of lobbying, which \nincluded not only direct communications with legislators but also their \nartificially stimulated public letter campaigns to Congress. Two courts \nof appeals have also upheld grassroots lobbying disclosure \nrequirements. In Minnesota State Ethical Practices Board v. the \nNational Rifle Association, decided by the Eighth Circuit Court in \n1985, that circuit upheld the State statute requiring disclosure of \ngrassroots lobbying, even when the activity at issue was correspondence \nfrom a national organization to its members. In other words, the Eighth \nCircuit upheld a statute that goes even farther than we are going \nbecause we are exempting communications made by organizations to their \nown members.\n  In the other case, the 11th Circuit, in a case known as Florida \nLeague of Professional Lobbyists, Inc. v. Meggs, decided about 10 years \nago in 1996, upheld a Florida law which required disclosure of \nexpenditures both for direct lobbying and indirect lobbying activities.\n  Astroturf lobbyists who don't like this legislative provision may \nwell challenge it in court. That could be said of most pieces of \nlegislation that Congress considers. But I believe the weight of \nprecedent of both the Supreme Court and the two explicit circuit court \ncases on grassroots lobbying should give us confidence that extending \nthe essential disclosure requirements of lobbying to paid efforts to \nstimulate grassroots lobbying would be upheld as constitutional.\n  I hope more broadly that we can proceed with this bill. It is an \nimportant reaction to the voices of the people that we have all heard \nwho are offended by the ethical scandals here in Congress over the last \nfew years, as we all, each Member of Congress, are embarrassed by those \nscandals. This underlying bill, S. 1, is a very strong response to \nthem. I hope it does not fall by the wayside in what may appear to \nobservers to be the first partisan gridlock of this session of \nCongress. Surely we can figure out a way to proceed to consider the \nissue that is the subject of the gridlock at some point in the Senate \nand then proceed rapidly to consider the other amendments pending on S. \n1, adopt the bill, and go forward.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest on the \ntelevision when my friend from Connecticut was responding to my \namendment, talking about the grassroots or astroturf kinds of \nlobbyists. I was struck as usual with my friend's good intentions. I am \nreminded once again of a comment I made, which the Presiding Officer \nheard me make, which is hard cases make bad law.\n  The Abramoff situation was clearly a matter of money laundering. It \nhad little or nothing to do with lobbyists. He found a way to use a \nparticular activity in order to channel contributions from one of his \nclients back to himself in fees that would be hidden. That is being \noffered as a reason why we need to adopt this amendment with respect to \ngrassroots organizations.\n  My friend from Connecticut talked about simply disclosure. Everybody \nwho does this ought to say what they are doing, and we are not stopping \nthem. Yes, they have their constitutional right to do this. And yes, it \nis a proper thing for them to do, so long as it all gets disclosed. \nBecause if Abramoff had been forced to disclose, he wouldn't have been \nable to launder the money. That sounds enormously reasonable. But as I \nlistened to the details, comparing them to my knowledge of the \nunderlying bill, I realized, once again, this is being crafted with an \neye toward the astroturf lobbyists, without an understanding of how \nchilling an effect it will have on genuine grassroots kinds of \nactivities.\n  As the ACLU pointed out in its letter, the reporting requirements are \nso heavy and so onerous and now, as a result of an amendment we have \npreviously adopted, carry with them a $200,000 fine, if they are \ninadvertently broken, that it will have a chilling effect on many \ngroups who will decide they simply don't want to run the risk. We \nsimply don't want to expose ourselves to this. Someone who \ninadvertently violates the law or violates the reporting requirements \nwhich we would be putting into the law, who accepts a relatively small \namount of money for his services but somehow triggers the amount listed \nin the bill, finds himself or herself subject to a $200,000 fine for \neach incident. And even if that individual goes to court and gets it \nset aside, the legal costs will clearly go above $200,000.\n  To what end? Members of Congress are fully aware of how these \nastroturf campaigns are mounted. We understand when we are the target \nof one of\n\n[[Page S662]]\n\nthese. I don't know a single Member of Congress who can be swayed by \nthis kind of thing, if, in fact, the underlying legislation is bad \nlegislation in the opinion of the Member of Congress. I know many of \nthese people do this to make a living, and they convince their Members \nthat it is a worthwhile kind of thing. They will still continue to do \nthat, the big ones. This is not something that is part of any culture \nof corruption. We cannot point to anybody who has been overwhelmed by \nthese and, therefore, changed his mind on a particular piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let's have a little understanding of the way the system works and a \nlittle common sense about how Congress responds, about how people try \nto bring particular pressure points upon them.\n  I respect my friend from Connecticut. I think his reading of the law \nis obviously very careful. But I come back to exactly the same position \nI did before in my earlier statement. This will have a chilling effect \non honest, responsible, legitimate grassroots kind of activity, because \nthe people who engage in that kind of activity will be afraid that \ntheir exposure to a $200,000 fine is too great. And it will be easier \nfor them to say: Never mind.\n  People who do the astroturf kind of thing, where they are big enough \nand they have enough money, they have enough legal background, file all \ntheir reports and will continue to do it. The reports will be filed, \nand no one will pay any attention to them. I often say the best place \nto hide a leaf is on the floor of the forest surrounded by all of the \nother leaves. There will be a blizzard of reports coming from the big \npeople who can afford to do this, and there will be a chilling effect \non the little people who will be very nervous about the exposure we \nhave built into this bill.\n  In the previous bill passed by the Senate that had this provision in \nit, the fine was $50,000. That was serious enough. Now that the fine is \n$200,000, I am getting all kinds of concern from all kinds of groups \nthat are not professional astroturf lobbyists but legitimate grassroots \ngroups that are very anxious that this is going to, in effect, hamper \ntheir ability to exercise their constitutional rights. Will it legally \nprevent them from exercising their rights? No, it won't. Will it \npractically prevent them from doing so? Yes, in all probability, it \nwill. And the result is simply not worth that kind of risk to run.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly oppose Senator Bennett's \namendment to strike section 220 from the bill. The debate about section \n220 is essentially a debate about the openness of the legislative \nprocess. It is a debate about the right of the American people to know \nwho is spending money to influence their elected representatives and \nhow that money is being spent.\n  It is important not to be misled by the use of the term grassroots \nlobbying in section 220. We aren't talking here about constituents \nreading the newspaper and deciding to call their Member of Congress to \nweigh in on the issue of the day. No, what section 220 deals with is \npaid grassroots lobbying, the spending of money to try to get the \npublic to contact Congress. It is estimated that grassroots lobbying is \na billion dollar business. That is a billion undisclosed dollars spent \nby special interests to influence the legislative process. We should \nkeep in mind as well that in 2005 a few million of those undisclosed \ndollars went to Grassroots Interactive, a so-called ``grassroots'' \nlobbying firm controlled by Jack Abramoff. E-mails made public by the \nIndian Affairs Committee indicate that Abramoff and his accomplice \nMichael Scanlon prided themselves on being able to make it appear as if \nthere was significant public concern over an issue. Further, those e-\nmails suggest that Abramoff and Scanlon used the grassroots lobbying \nfirm as a way to avoid public scrutiny of their activities because \ncurrent law does not require disclosure for grassroots lobbying firms. \nFor example, Jack Abramoff reportedly paid Ralph Reed $1.2 million to \nuse his Christian Coalition network to stimulate public opposition to a \ntribal casino; under current law, Ralph Reed's supporters were \ncompletely in the dark about the fact that their antigambling efforts \nwere being funded by a competing tribal casino.\n  The lobbying disclosure law, as it stands now, contains a billion \ndollar loophole. All section 220 does is close that loophole.\n  I am going to address some of the claims made by the Senator from \nUtah, but first let me explain what section 220 does. First, it \nrequires registered lobbyists to report how much they spend on efforts \nto stimulate grassroots lobbying on the lobbying disclosure reports \nthat they are already required to file. Second, it requires large \nprofessional so-called grass roots lobbying firms to report on the \namount they receive for their services, just like any other lobbyist. \nAnd that is it, that is all section 220 does. Organizations do not have \nto report on the amounts they spend to communicate with their own \nmembers, and they only have to report on the cost of their \ncommunications with the general public if they are required to register \nand file under the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  By the way, communications to fewer than 500 people are not \nconsidered by section 220 to be communications to the general public. \nAnd here is the important thing private citizens can still call, write, \ne-mail, fax, or visit their Senators anytime they want, in response to \na call from a telemarketer or an e-mail from an organization they \nbelong to, or because they read something in the morning paper, without \never have to report anything at all. Citizens are completely unaffected \nby this provision.\n  Some groups, especially the ACLU, have raised concerns that section \n220 will intrude on Americans' freedom of speech and right to petition \nthe Government. I appreciate the ACLU's concerns and am grateful for \nits vigilance in protecting our civil liberties, but in this case its \nreservations are unfounded. In 1954, in United States v. Harriss, the \nSupreme Court upheld the constitutionality of disclosure requirements \nin the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, stating that Congress is \nentitled to require a modicum of information from those who for hire \nattempt to influence legislation or who collect or spend funds for that \npurpose. That is exactly what section 220 does. Without disclosure, the \nCourt warned, ``the voice of the people may all too easily be drowned \nout by the voice of special interest groups seeking favored treatment \nwhile masquerading as proponents of the public weal.'' Paid grassroots \nlobbying is a billion dollar business. It will not be chilled or \ndiscouraged by the very reasonable disclosure requirements in section \n220.\n\n  While the ACLU's opposition to section 220 is honest and heartfelt, \nthe same cannot be said of attacks made by some other groups. Their \nclaims are so outrageous, so manifestly untrue, so unhinged from \nany connection to the reality of this bill, that I would like to assume \nthat they have been misinformed about the details of the section, or \nthat perhaps they are mistakenly referring to an entirely different \npiece of legislation. Unfortunately, I think it is more likely that \nthey are engaged in a campaign of deliberate misinformation about the \ndetails of section 220. And of course, because of the loophole they are \ntrying to protect, we may never know who is spending big money to try \nto convince the public to tell us to oppose this provision.\n\n  I certainly would not claim that the Senator from Utah is \ndeliberately trying to mislead the Senate. But his statement today \nshows a deep misunderstanding of how section 220 works. So let me \naddress several of the claims he made.\n  First, the Senator from Utah said the following:\n\n       Someone who gets his neighbors together and says, let's all \n     write our congressmen on this issue and then spends some \n     money doing it, under this provision, becomes a paid lobbyist \n     and if he does not report and register, would be fined \n     $200,000 for having done that.\n\n  That is simply not true. The definition of lobbyist and the \nrequirements for registration are not changed by this bill or section \n220. A lobbyist doesn't have to register under the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct unless he makes a lobbying contact on behalf of a client and\n\n[[Page S663]]\n\nreceives over $5,000 for lobbying activities engaged in for a \nparticular client. So the person who gets his neighbors together as \ndescribed by the Senator from Utah and spends some money getting them \nto write some letters is not a lobbyist and does not have to register--\nbefore this bill or afterwards. That is not just a matter of \ninterpretation of the statute; it is the undisputed meaning of the \nLobbying Disclosure Act.\n\n  The Senator from Utah also said the following in his statement \nyesterday:\n\n       A grass-roots lobbying group decides in its neighborhood \n     that the most effective means of influencing and speaking up \n     on legislation is to send out letters to its membership. Or \n     perhaps it may decide the most effective means would be to \n     buy a mailing list and send out letters to the people on \n     the mailing list. As soon as they spend the money to buy \n     the mailing list, there is a paid lobbyist involved. And \n     if the registration is not correct, there is a $200,000 \n     fine against that group if we leave this--this provision \n     in the bill as it is.\n\n  Again, that is not true. Unless an organization makes direct contact \nwith a Member of Congress and spends more than $10,000 in a quarter on \nlobbying activities, then it does not have to register. And if it does \nnot have to register, it does not have to report its spending on that \nmailing list. In addition, and this is very important, a group's \nspending to communicate with its own members is not considered grass \nroots lobbying at all.\n  The only way that this group would have to register is if it makes \ndirect contact with a Member of Congress and spends over $10,000 in a \nquarter on lobbying activities, not including communicating with the \ngeneral public to try to get the general public to contact the \nCongress. If the group does that, then it is not a small grassroots \nlobbying group. And yes, it has to register and report. I think that is \nthe correct result.\n\n  I have taken a fair amount of time to respond to the Senator from \nUtah because this legislation is too important to let mistaken \ndiscussions of this provision stand without an answer.\n  Some of section 220's opponents have claimed that it is designed to \nkeep the public in the dark about the legislative process, that it \ntargets individual citizens and small grassroots organizations, that it \nwill prevent organizations from communicating with the public, and that \nit will smother lobbyists in miles of redtape.\n  None of these claims are true. Not one. I suppose the groups \nspreading this information are so afraid of section 220 that they are \nwilling to say anything to try to stop it. But I wonder exactly what \nthey are afraid of. Section 220 only applies to registered lobbyists \nand large grassroots lobbying firms, and it does not prohibit or \nrestrict their activities in any way. In fact, section 220 merely makes \npublic how much money they spend and how they spend it. Surely these \ngroups that have tried to convince people to contact their offices with \nmistaken claims about the bill aren't afraid of a little sunlight--or \nmaybe they are.\n  We are so close to passing the kind of ethics bill that the public \nwants, that the 2006 elections endorsed, and that our democracy needs. \nDefeating this amendment will bring us closer to the day we can go back \nto our States and tell our constituents that we actually delivered real \nbipartisan lobbying reform. But what will our constituents say if this \namendment succeeds and the Senate votes to reopen a billion-dollar \nloophole in the lobbying disclosure law?\n  I urge my colleagues not to be fooled by the phony arguments being \nadvanced by the opponents of this provision. I ask my colleagues to \nplease vote no on the amendment of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to bring everyone up to date as to where we \nare, I made a good-faith offer to the minority that we will put the \nline-item veto off to another day. Senator Byrd was not agreeable to \nthat. I talked to Senator Byrd on more than one occasion this evening, \nthe last time for a significant amount of time, and he simply believes \nthis line-item veto is a matter of great constitutional import, that \nfor us to agree at this time to debate this would be wrong and that he \nsimply will not do that.\n  Having said that, I still say I think it is a terribly unfortunate \nday for this Senate that a bipartisan piece of legislation dealing with \nethics and lobbying reform that has been cosponsored for the first time \nin three decades as the first bill brought before the Senate by the two \nleaders, Democratic and Republican leader, is not going to be allowed \nto go forward based on the Republicans not being able to have a vote on \na matter that is not germane or relevant to this legislation.\n  We have done so much with this legislation. We introduced the bill \nthat passed this Senate last year by a vote of 98. We strengthened that \nsignificantly with the substitute. A number of amendments were offered \nby my Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues. There are those \nwho say that Senators thought those amendments would not be agreed to. \nThey have been agreed to, with rare exception.\n  We have 15 or so amendments that would be postcloture germane on the \nsubstitute if cloture were invoked. We have agreed those amendments \nshould go forward.\n  The point I am making is it is too bad that it appears this bill is \nnot going to pass because of a line-item veto. That is what it is all \nabout. Members can talk about things in here that may apply, and the \nParliamentarian says it is not germane. To think we can dispose of this \npiece of legislation in a few minutes is not sensible. This is \nsomething that will take a lot of debate. Senator Conrad, alone, would \ntake a number of hours. Senator Byrd would take a number of hours. \nSenator Levin, who is one of the plaintiffs taking this to the Supreme \nCourt, would take a significant amount of time.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle would reconsider. \nAfter what has gone on in Washington, in the courts alone, this \nrequires our doing something. We, in good faith, have moved forward on \nthis, playing by the Senate rules. I hope people of good will on the \nother side of the aisle vote to invoke cloture. If not, as I said \nearlier today, there is only one reason this bill is going to not pass. \nIt is because the minority does not want it to pass, period, \nunderscore, exclamation point.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Lott amendments \nNos. 78 and 79 be withdrawn, that at 9 o'clock p.m. tonight all time \npostcloture be yielded back, and without further intervening action or \ndebate, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following: \nFeingold amendment No. 65; Bennett amendment No. 81, as modified; Reid \namendment No. 4, as amended, if amended; motion to invoke cloture on \nthe Reid substitute amendment; provided further that there be 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided between each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I might \nsay in response to my good friend, the majority leader, there is no \nparticular reason these votes could not be held in the morning. It is \nclear we are at an impasse. That frequently happens in the Senate. It \nis not at all unusual. It is also not at all unusual to have nongermane \namendments offered on bills. They are offered on virtually every bill \nthat goes through the Senate. So there is nothing extraordinary \nhappening on this bill that we do not see in the Senate with great \nrepetition on bill after bill after bill after bill.\n  We have been working in good faith to reach an agreement with respect \nto Senator Gregg's amendment on enhanced rescission. I wish to thank \nthe Senator from New Hampshire for his patience in that regard. He was \nhere early on this bill. He offered it a week ago--it has now been \npending for an entire week--and is prepared for a vote.\n  Now, the majority leader, to his credit, was attempting to reach an \nagreement to allow for a vote on this issue at a later date. He \nmentioned it needed to be sufficiently debated. Of course, at a later \ndate, in the context in which he\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\nand I and Senator Gregg were discussing it, there would be plenty of \ntime for debate, adequate time to make the arguments on both sides to \nfully consider this important measure, with plenty of time for everyone \nto have their fair say about it.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader has an objection on his side, and \ntherefore it appears we will not be able to finish this bill this week. \nI hope we can continue to work on a path toward finishing the \nunderlying bill. It passed last year 90 to 8, after the then-minority \ndefeated cloture on one occasion in order to do exactly what this \nminority is going to do to defeat cloture on one occasion, which is to \nguarantee consideration of additional amendments.\n  So I would have hoped we could have had these votes in the morning \nbecause not much progress will be made tonight in this regard.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just want \nto thank the Republican leader and the majority leader for their \nefforts to try to move forward with my amendment. There was a lot of \nwork done, and we had, I thought, a reasonable understanding as to how \nto proceed, which was outlined on the floor earlier in a colloquy \nbetween myself and the Republican leader and the Democratic leader and \nthe assistant Democratic leader.\n  I regret that there is an objection on the other side. But I \nappreciate the Republican leader's willingness to protect my rights by \nmaintaining my ability to amend this bill, if I cannot get this \namendment up at a later date under a time certain, as we had an \nunderstanding at least between the four of us.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the unanimous consent request is agreed to; \nis that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 78 and 79) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what I want to say is, I do not want anyone \nto be disabused that the only problem we had with our conversations was \nthe time. As I indicated, I thought it would be appropriate to have a \ntime certain to do this, but there were other issues that became \ninvolved in this also about how we would get to conference and other \nmatters that were somewhat complicating, which certainly I did not have \nan opportunity to even discuss with Senator Byrd. But there were other \nhurdles we had to jump through. So it is not just as simple as that.\n  The point is, it was not done. I think that is unfortunate. But the \nissue before this Senate tonight is whether we are going to move \nforward with the most significant lobbying and ethics reform, by a \nlarge margin, since Watergate. It would be historic legislation. I \nwould remind everyone the legislation that passed last year, 90 to 8, \nwas the original bill we laid down. So everyone understands, it was \nheld up because of the Dubai Ports issue, which was resolved quite \nquickly.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the record, a year ago when we debated \nethics reform, the cloture motion was opposed on the Democratic side \nafter we considered one amendment--one amendment. We have considered 12 \namendments to this bill to this point, plus there have been others that \nhave been accepted by the managers. So our objection a year ago was the \nfact that we had not opened it to an amendment process. I do not think \nanyone can argue that point this evening when the minority decides, if \nthey do, to oppose the motion to invoke cloture.\n  I do not want to read too much into this. I hope this is just a bump \nin the road. But this is going to be a long journey of 2 years, and it \ndoes not start well when a bipartisan bill sponsored by the two \nleaders--the Democratic and Republican leaders--a substitute \ncosponsored by both leaders, and amendments cosponsored on both sides \nof the aisle are not enough impetus for us to pass a bill which is long \noverdue.\n  We considered this bill a year ago. It has been set over and over \nagain, but nothing happened. We were determined with the mandate of the \nlast election to see some change on the floor of the Senate. I thought \nwe were off to the right start with a bipartisan measure, an effort to \ncooperate, an effort to compromise--and there have been many \ncompromises on the floor. To think it is going to break down this \nevening because we refuse to consider a measure which is not even part \nof this bill, not even relevant to this bill, not even germane to this \nbill, tells me that we have reached a bad spot in the road. I hope we \ncan get beyond it. We have a lot of work we need to do in the time to \ncome. I hope it starts off in the same bipartisan manner, but I hope it \nends better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 81, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am grateful to the majority leader for \nscheduling a vote on my amendment No. 81. I wish to inform the Members \nof the Senate that Senator Feinstein and I have been working to get \nthis worked out in such a fashion that a recorded vote would not be \nnecessary.\n  I raised the issue because lawyers on our side examined the \nunderlying legislation and said the way it was worded, it could, in \nfact, be interpreted to prevent the 501(c)(3) activity that is purely \neducational and not connected with lobbying in any way, in which many \nof us participate.\n  The flagship example of that is the Aspen Institute and their \nCongressional Program. I am told the Aspen Institute has approved the \nlanguage that is in the underlying bill. But I am convinced from the \nanalysis of the lawyers that someone who wanted to do that program harm \ncould, in fact, take the language of the underlying bill and attack the \nAspen Institute Congressional Program.\n  Furthermore, while the Aspen Institute is perhaps the best known and \nthe best supported, there are a number of other purely educational \nprograms conducted by groups that have some connection with lobbyists. \nThey do not take lobbyists on the trip. The lobbyists do not use the \ntrip in any way. But because the organization has some connection to a \nlobbyist--may have employed a lobbyist for some issue unrelated to the \ntrip or may, as in the case of the Aspen Institute, have lobbyists on \nits board--I am told that someone who wanted to disrupt those programs \ncould challenge them.\n  So we have tried to work out a way to carve out this area reasonably \nand clearly, and we thought we had a deal. We had approval from both \nsides of the aisle by Senators who looked at it and said: Yes, this is \nexactly right. This is something we can certainly live with. We were, \nfrankly, within minutes of having a voice vote on this, and then an \nobjection was raised. The Senator who raised the objection has refused \nto budge. He has refused to compromise.\n  I have modified our original proposal in an effort to get compromise \nand have been unable to get it. So we will be voting on it. I would \nhope everyone would understand, when the time comes to vote on the \nBennett amendment No. 81, that we are not, in fact, as some might \nallege, creating any kind of a loophole. The Ethics Committee will be \ninvolved to review all of these programs in advance, to make sure they \nare, in fact, educational programs. Lobbyists will not be allowed to \ntravel or be present at any of the meetings.\n  We are talking about the kinds of things we should have more of in \nthe Congress rather than less--opportunities across the aisle to get \ntogether under the sponsorship of a neutral organization, in a neutral \nlocation, and talk through the various problems.\n  Again and again, as I have been involved in these things, people say \nto me: Why can't we have more of this in Congress? The way the \nunderlying bill is written contains the potential of having less of it. \nMy amendment is structured to see to it that we are able to preserve \nthose connections and relationships we already have. And if some future \nfoundation decides to fund a 501(c)(3) for an additional one, they will \nnot be prohibited from doing so just because someone on the \nfoundation's\n\n[[Page S665]]\n\nboard happens to be a lobbyist. They will not be prevented from doing \nso just because someone connected with the 501(c)(3) happens to be a \nlobbyist, totally removed and apart from anything the 501(c)(3) is \ntrying to do.\n\n  I believe very strongly this is the way we ought to go. I am grateful \nto my chairman, Senator Feinstein, for her willingness to cooperate in \na compromise. I am sorry we have been unable to work it out so that it \nis necessary for us to have a vote.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                        Vote on Amendment No. 65\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote begin \nnow and be discontinued at 20 after the hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 65 offered by the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n81, offered by the Senator from Utah.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, on this \namendment I wish to give them the names of the groups that would likely \nbe prohibited from sponsoring educational travel, unless this amendment \nis adopted: Aspen Institute, Transatlantic Policy Network, Save the \nChildren, CARE, Global Health Council, Population Action International.\n  For those who think this is a loophole that Jack Abramoff could drive \nthrough, I point out that the amendment requires the Ethics Committee \nto vet each program in advance, examine who is going, whether there \nwould be a lobbyist present, and what the purpose is. If you vote \nagainst this amendment, in my view, you are expressing a vote of no \nconfidence in the chairman and ranking member of the Ethics Committee, \nSenators Boxer and Cornyn. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Reid amendment draws a bright line. \nGroups that employ or retain lobbyists could not provide trips of over \n1 day. The Bennett amendment allows 501(c)(3)s that lobby to provide \ntrips. There is a limitation that will prevent this amendment from \nbecoming a loophole that will lead to kinds of abuses we saw with Jack \nAbramoff and his trips to Scotland. If these groups don't lobby, there \nis no limitation; they can do this. That means, unlike what the Senator \nfrom Utah said, the Aspen Institute would not be prohibited under the \nReid amendment. We must defeat this amendment to keep our rules \nparallel to the House rules and prevent lobbyists from funding these \ntrips.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise tonight at this late hour. The hour \nis late and the night is black. I rise tonight to shine a bright light \non political chicanery that is playing out on the Senate floor.\n  In November, America voted for a change. The people sent a strong \nsignal that they wanted less partisanship and more accountability in \nWashington. In response to the voters, Senator Reid, Senator Feinstein, \nand Senator McConnell put before the Senate an ethics reform bill that \nwould add transparency and accountability to the legislative process. \nThey should be proud of their product, and the Senate has had a good \ndebate thus far on the bill.\n  But wait, wait, wait 1 second. Before we can clear the way for \ngreater accountability and sunshine into the way work gets done in \nthese halls, the Senate is being blackmailed into an assault on the \nCongress's single most precious and most powerful authority--the power \nof the purse. That is the most powerful authority we have: the power of \nthe purse.\n  Tonight, this reform bill is threatened by an effort by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to give the President line-\nitem veto authority. No vote on the line-item veto, they say,\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\nand no ethics reform. That is nothing more than legislative blackmail, \nand I, for one, will not pay the price. No one should stand still when \nthis Constitution, which I hold in my hand, is the hostage. No one \nshould stand still, I repeat, when this Constitution, which I hold in \nmy hand, is the hostage.\n  This line-item veto authority would grant tremendous and dangerous \nnew power to the President. He would have unchecked authority to take \nfrom the Congress the power of the purse, a power that the \nconstitutional Framers thought was absolutely vital to protecting the \npeople's liberties.\n  It was just 8 years ago that the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the \nline-item veto was unconstitutional. Now our colleagues--some of them--\non the other side of the aisle are threatening to hold up the ethics \nreform bill in an effort to hand the President another line-item veto \nauthority. Are the memories around here so short?\n  Are the memories around here so short?\n  We have a President who already has asserted too much power. This is \na blatantly gross attempt to take even more power for the President and \nstrip away power from the people.\n  This President claimed the unconstitutional authority to tap into the \ntelephone conversations of American citizens without a warrant or court \napproval.\n  This President claimed the unconstitutional authority to sneak and \npeek, to snoop and scoop, into the private lives of the American \npeople.\n  This President has taken the Nation to a failed war based on faulty \nevidence and the misrepresentation of facts. And many Senators voted \nnot realizing that was what was being done when we voted on the war \nresolution.\n  So I say, this President has taken the Nation to a failed war based \non faulty evidence and an unconstitutional doctrine of preemptive \nstrikes. More than 3,000 American sons and daughters have died in Iraq \nin this crazed Presidential misadventure.\n  And what is the response of the Senate? To give the President even \nmore unfettered authority? To give him greater unchecked powers? We \nhave seen the danger of the blank check. We have lived through the \naftermath of a rubberstamp Congress. We should not continue to lie down \nfor this President or any other President.\n  Of course, this President wants to take away Congress's power of the \npurse. When Congress has the sole ability to shut down these \nunconstitutional practices, when Congress is asking tough questions and \ndemanding truthful answers about this war, when Congress is taking a \nhard look at finding ways to begin to bring our troops home, over the \nobjections of this administration, the President's response is to \ndemand that the Congress give away its most crucial power. Silence the \nCongress. Ignore the people. Strip away our constitutional protections \nand one may just as well strip away the people's liberties lock, stock, \nand barrel. Strip away the power of the Congress, the power of the \npeople, and amass all power behind the fences and secret doors of the \nWhite House.\n  No Senator should vote to hand such power to the President. No \nAmerican should stand for it--not now, not ever.\n  If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to stop the \nSenate's effort to add transparency and accountability to the \nlegislative process, that is their right and their choice. But I will \nnot blink. I cannot look the other way. We should get on with the \nbusiness at hand and pass meaningful ethics reform legislation. But we \nshould never, never, hand away those precious constitutional powers--\nthe last protections of the people's liberties, vested in the people's \nrepresentatives in this Congress--to any President.\n  We have each taken an oath to protect and defend this Constitution of \nthe United States. Here it is. I hold it in my hand. I say again, we \nhave each taken an oath to protect and defend this Constitution of the \nUnited States. And it is about time we did protect and defend that \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank all Senators.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., a great man who inspired ordinary African Americans to \ndemand equal rights as American citizens. This year, we celebrate what \nwould have been Dr. King's 78th birthday and his dream for equality and \njustice for all that remains our Nation's moral compass.\n  In honoring Dr. King on this particular anniversary of his birth, we \nremember that it has been a year since we lost his wife and \nindispensable partner, Coretta Scott King, who died on January 30, \n2006. Mrs. King was a woman of quiet courage and great dignity who \nmarched alongside her husband and became an international advocate for \npeace and human rights. She had been actively engaged in the civil \nrights movement as a politically and socially conscious young woman and \ncontinued after her husband's death to lead the country toward greater \njustice and equality for all, traveling the world on behalf of racial \nand economic justice, peace and nonviolence, women's and children's \nrights, gay rights, religious freedom, full employment, health care, \nand education.\n  Much has improved since 1966, when Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ralph \nAbernathy organized marches and protests in Chicago. Today, 80 percent \nof African Americans older than 25 have earned their high school \ndiploma, and there are 2.3 million African American college students, \nan increase of 1 million from 15 years ago. In addition, there are 1.2 \nmillion African-American businesses across the country that generate \n$88.6 billion in revenues.\n  This important day calls us to recognize the challenges that remain \nand the work that still must be done to move closer to Dr. King's \ndream. If he were alive today, Dr. King would undoubtedly be dismayed \nby injustices large and small, including the violence in Iraq, the \ndeepening divide between those who have and those who do not, and the \nprohibitive cost of higher education, which is now out of reach for \nmany African-American and Hispanic families. In the wealthiest Nation \non Earth, 37 million people live in poverty, 47 million people do not \nhave health insurance, and millions more are underinsured.\n  Our Nation is a better one thanks to Dr. King and the sacrifices he \nand others made during the 1950s and 1960s. I remembered that as I \nwalked in some of those same footsteps when I joined U.S. \nRepresentative John Lewis' pilgrimage to Selma and Montgomery, Alabama. \nAlthough there is much of Dr. King's dream that remains to be \nfulfilled, I have faith that we will continue to move toward the \nequality and justice that he sought. As a nation, we must and we shall.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on January 15, our Nation commemorated the \nbirthday of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Every year we pay \ntribute to the life of this great American. But, in honoring Dr. King, \nwe celebrate more than his life; we celebrate the legacy of his words \nand deeds, and the virtues that he embodied.\n  Today, we remember Dr. King because he represents the best of the \nAmerican spirit: someone who is compassionate, devoted, courageous, and \nhopeful. His compassion drew him to the plights of the poor and \noppressed, and his devotion led him to champion their cause. His \ncourage led him to act on this devotion, countless times placing \nhimself in harm's way. Indeed, it was because of his courage that he \nfell to an assassin's bullet in 1968. And, his hope sustained him, even \nin the face of bitter racism.\n  All of these virtues--compassion, devotion, courage, and hope--\npropelled\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\nDr. King to the esteemed place he occupies today.\n  Perhaps Dr. King's most enduring virtue was his hope. It surely was \non display when he delivered his most famous oration. In 1963, on the \nsteps of the Lincoln Memorial, gazing out at the Washington Monument \nand beyond to the Capitol, he delivered his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, \nwhich is familiar to all Americans.\n  As Dr. King looked upon these impressive symbols of America, he \nreflected upon the glaring shortcoming of our democracy. For all its \nsuccesses, America had failed to realize the truth put forth in our \nDeclaration of Independence: ``that all men are created equal.'' Amid \nthese monuments to the promise of America, he told hundreds of \nthousands of the Nation's greatest injustice: racial inequality. Yet he \nstill maintained hope, speaking in terms dreams and freedom.\n  In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, and \nthe Voting Rights Act became law the following year. Despite these \nlegislative gains, Dr. King realized that achieving equality of \nopportunity required something much greater, and far more difficult, \nthan mere legislation. It required a change in the hearts and minds of \ncitizens.\n  Despite this challenge, his optimism did not waver. In 1967, he \nappeared on ``Meet the Press'' where he was asked if he believed ``the \nAmerican racial problem can be solved.''\n  ``Yes, I do,'' he replied. ``I refuse to give up. I refuse to despair \nit in this moment. I refuse to allow myself to fall into the dark \nchambers of pessimism, because I think in any social revolution, the \none thing that keeps it going is hope.''\n  King's hope survived him, and today we are closer to the world that \nhe envisioned.\n  We honor historical figures not merely because they achieved or said \ngreat things. We honor them because their lives continue to offer \ninsight that we might use to improve our world.\n  ``[T]he goal of America is freedom,'' he wrote as he sat in a \nBirmingham, AL, jail cell. Only a man with great hope and faith in the \ntriumph of good could write those words in those circumstances. It is \nwith similar hope that we as Americans should proceed today, whatever \nthe challenges that confront us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S668-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIVE HAWAIIAN REORGANIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nAkaka, reintroduced the Native Hawaiian Reorganization Act, a bill that \nwould create a new, race-based government within the borders of the \nUnited States. I strongly oppose this bill. This legislation was \nconsidered and rejected by the Senate last year; we ought not waste one \nmoment of the Senate's time on it this year. Instead, we should \nconsider legislation that unites us all as Americans. Our Nation must \nremain ``one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice \nfor all''--``not many Nations, divided by race, with special privileges \nfor some.'' Here are four reasons this bill should be stopped in its \ntracks: 1. It would create a new, sovereign government within our \nborders. 2. As noted by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, the bill \n``would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin.'' 3. The \nbill is really about transferring control over ``land'' and ``other \nassets'' to this new, race-based government. 4. Native Hawaiians are \nnot just ``another Indian tribe'' since they do not meet the \nrequirements under current law of being sovereign for the last 100 \nyears, living as a separate and distinct community, and having a \npreexisting political organization.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this dangerous piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S668-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S668-S669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY LAKERS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the Grand \nValley State Lakers on winning the 2006 Division II National \nChampionship. Grand Valley completed a highly entertaining and \nrewarding season on December 16, 2006, when they defeated Northwest \nMissouri State 17-14 in the championship game. This victory is a great \nsource of pride for all those affiliated with Grand Valley State \nUniversity and for the State of Michigan.\n  It was a record breaking year on many fronts for the Grand Valley \nState Football team. This victory was the culmination of a perfect 15-0 \nseason for the Lakers. Under the guidance of Coach Chuck Martin, Grand \nValley State won their fourth Division II Championship in the last 5 \nyears. During this time, the Lakers have become a powerhouse in \nDivision II football and have a .709 winning percentage. Since 1999, \nthey have an extraordinary 86-9 record, which is the second highest in \nall of college football. Moreover, quarterback Cullen Finnerty became \nthe most prolific offensive player in college football history this \nyear. In his 4-year career, Finnerty amassed a 51-4 record and led the \nLakers to three national championships. As quarterback of the Lakers, \nFinnerty finished his career with over 10,000 total yards, including \nover 2,000 yards rushing.\n  The championship game provided its share of excitement. The thousands \nof GVSU fans and supporters who made the trip from the campus in \nAllendale to the stadium in Florence, AL, were not disappointed with \nthe result. It proved to be a hard fought contest between two great \nteams. Grand Valley State eventually forced three crucial turnovers in \nthe game, which included a NW Missouri St. fumble in the Grand Valley \nend zone late in the fourth quarter. Junior cornerback Bill Brenchin \nmade significant contributions on all three plays. Brenchin ended the \ngame with two interceptions and recovered the fumble in the end zone as \nNW Missouri St. attempted to tie or win the game. Overall, the Grand \nValley defense was too much for NW Missouri St. to overcome, and, the \nLaker offense, under Finnerty's direction had more than enough weapons \nto stifle the opposing defense.\n  I am proud to recognize the Grand Valley State football team for \ntheir remarkable achievements on the field this year. They have proven \nthat hard work, dedication and commitment can produce great results. \nThe members of the team should be proud of their efforts and should \nsavor their recent success. They have been a tremendous source of \ninspiration for both the Grand Valley State community and the entire \nState of Michigan.\n  Each member of the Grand Valley State team, including Anthony Adams, \nSam Allen, Matt Bakker, Lyle Banks, Brandon Barnes, Ryan Bass, Matt \nBeaty, Nate Beebe, P.J.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mayor \nWilliam T. McLaughlin. Bill, as he is affectionately called by his \nfriends--and Bill has a lot of friends--celebrated his 90th birthday on \nDecember 22, 2006. During the 90 years that the world has been blessed \nwith Bill's presence, he and his late wife Mary have touched many lives \nand helped countless people. His contributions have ranged from serving \nhis country during World War II, serving the city of Wilmington for two \nterms as the city's mayor and for 12 years on the city council before \nthat, and offering continued service with numerous community projects \nboth before and after his tenure in elected office.\n  William T. McLaughlin was born on December 22, 1916, on Wilmington's \neast side. One of 12 children, Bill often joked that the Great \nDepression helped to raise his family's standard of living. When Bill \nwas 16 years old, his father lost his job. Bill's devotion to his \nfamily led to his dropping out of high school in order to accept a job \ncleaning the Boy's Club in Wilmington's Browntown neighborhood. He then \nwent to work at a linoleum plant where, after being turned down for a \ntwo-cent raise, he helped organize a union for the plant employees. \nThis type of initiative would be a hallmark of Bill's life.\n  At the age of 22, Bill signed up for the National Youth \nAdministration, a Federal program he hoped would send him to \nCalifornia. Instead, he was assigned to a swamp drainage program in \nsouthern Delaware.\n  After helping to reduce Delaware's mosquito population, Bill decided \nto seek more adventurous endeavors and joined the Army Air Force during \nWorld War II. He trained as an electrical technician and saw action as \na radio operator and tail gunner. He was shot down over the skies of \nNew Guinea but managed to survive and went on to complete 50 missions \nbefore returning home to Wilmington.\n  Upon his return, Bill attended night school on the GI bill. During \nthis time, Bill went to work for DuPont, where he would work for 30 \nyears, mostly as a supervisor in the company's business machines \nsection.\n  It was during this time that Bill would meet the woman who would \nbecome the love of his life. Mary's enthusiasm and outgoing personality \nwere a good counterpoint to Bill's soft-spoken manner and she would \nhave a huge influence on both his future and the future of Wilmington. \nTogether, they raised two sons, William and Donald.\n  Unlike many elected officials, Bill did not enter politics until the \nlater years of his life. In 1964, Mary encouraged him to run for \nWilmington's 9th ward city council seat. Bill won the election and \ncontinued to serve on the city council for 12 years. During this time, \nhe became the council's finance chairman. In 1976, he agreed to seek \nelection as Wilmington's mayor after then-Mayor Tom Maloney decided to \nrun for the U.S. Senate.\n  Bill was elected as Wilmington's mayor and served two terms in that \ncapacity, serving from 1977 until 1984. During this time, his openness \nand compassion helped him cultivate a renaissance for the city. He held \nweekly ``open door'' sessions where any citizen could come by his \noffice and voice their concerns or simply chat about local issues.\n  As mayor, he worked with Governor Pete DuPont and other State leaders \nto develop the Financial Center Development Act, which laid the \nfoundation for Delaware's rebirth as a financial services center. He \nalso helped lead the efforts to recruit dozens of out-of-State banks to \nset up shop in Delaware, creating more than 30,000 jobs for the First \nState.\n  During his time in office, Mayor McLaughlin helped implement the \ndesegregation of Delaware's public school system in northern Delaware. \nBill never forgot the obstacles that he had to overcome during his \nlifetime and sought to level the playing field for all Delawareans, \nregardless of the color of their skin. He also increased housing \nopportunities for people with low incomes, and he worked tirelessly to \ncreate new jobs by recruiting potential employers to settle in \nWilmington and the surrounding areas.\n  Bill also played a pivotal role in promoting the Delaware arts \ncommunity, helping to create the Delaware Theatre Company and the \nDelaware Center for Contemporary Arts.\n  What stands out most to me--and for a generation of Delaware's \npolitical leaders--is Bill's willingness to mentor young people seeking \nelected office. When I first ran for State treasurer in 1976, Bill was \namong the first public officials I reached out to. His support and \nkindness were instrumental in my first campaign and continue to be a \nsource of inspiration for many of Delaware's elected officials.\n  After leaving office in 1984, Bill continued to play a vital role in \nthe lives of countless Delawareans. He championed the disadvantaged \nthrough his involvement with numerous community service efforts. In \n1996, he and Mary founded the William T. and Mary McLaughlin Education \nFund, which continues to provide academic support for deserving \nstudents in Wilmington and New Castle County. After Mary's passing in \n2002, Bill continued their work to help better the lives of their \nfellow Delawareans.\n  Bill's hard work and devotion to service have led to countless \ncommunity service awards. In 1985, on his last day as Wilmington's \nmayor, Bill was awarded the Josiah Marvel Cup for public service, the \nDelaware State Chamber of Commerce's most prestigious award. Many \npeople would have seen that award as a capstone, but Bill seemed to \nview it as a foundation upon which he continues to build his legacy.\n  Bill is a true friend of Delaware. His compassion, integrity, warm \nsense of humor and vitality of spirit are a true inspiration for us \nall. I rise today to commend his hard work, to applaud his devotion to \ncommunity service and to wish him many more happy birthdays in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S669-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 188.

A bill to express the policy of the United States regarding \nthe United States relationship with Native Hawaiians and to provide a \nprocess for the recognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with the senior Senator from \nHawaii to introduce the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act \nof 2007. This bill, which is of great importance to the people of \nHawaii, establishes a process to extend the Federal policy of self-\ngovernance and self-determination to Hawaii's indigenous people. The \nbill provides parity in Federal policies that empower our country's \nother indigenous people--merican Indians and Alaska Natives--to \nparticipate in a government-to-government relationship with the United \nStates.\n  January 17, 2007, commemorates the 114th anniversary of Hawaii's \nbeloved Queen Liliuokalani being deposed. Although this event may seem \nlike a distant memory, it is a poignant event that expedited the \ndecline of a proud and self-governing people. The overthrow facilitated \nNative Hawaiians being disenfranchised from not only their culture and \nland, but from their way of life. Native Hawaiians had to endure the \nforced imprisonment of their Queen and witness the deterioration and \nnear eradication of their culture and tradition in their own homeland, \nat the hands of foreigners committed exclusively to propagating Western \nvalues and conventions.\n  While Congress has traditionally treated Native Hawaiians in a manner \nparallel to American Indians and Alaska Natives, the Federal policy of \nself-governance and self-determination has not been formally extended \nto Native Hawaiians. The bill itself does not extend Federal \nrecognition--it authorizes the process for Federal recognition.\n  The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007 does three \nthings: (1) It authorizes an office in the Department of the Interior \nto serve as a liaison between Native Hawaiians and the United States; \n(2) It forms an interagency coordinating group composed of officials \nfrom Federal agencies who currently administer programs and services \nimpacting Native Hawaiians; and (3) It authorizes a process for the \nreorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purposes \nof a federally recognized government-to-government relationship.\n  Once the Native Hawaiian governing entity is recognized, the bill \nestablishes an inclusive, democratic negotiations process representing \nboth Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians. Negotiations between \nthe Native Hawaiian entity and the Federal and State governments may \naddress issues such as the transfer of lands, assets, and natural \nresources and jurisdiction over such lands, assets, and natural \nresources, as well as other longstanding issues resulting from the \noverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Any transfers of governmental \nauthority or power will require implementing legislation at the State \nand Federal levels.\n  The Hawaii congressional delegation has devoted much time and careful \nconsideration into crafting this legislation. When I first started this \nprocess in 1999, our congressional delegation created five working \ngroups to assist with the drafting of this legislation. The working \ngroups were composed of individuals from the Native Hawaiian community, \nthe State of Hawaii, Federal Government, Indian country, Members of \nCongress, and experts in constitutional law. Collectively, more than \n100 people worked together on the initial draft of this legislation. \nThe meetings held with the Native Hawaiian community were open to the \npublic and a number of individuals who had differing views attended the \nmeetings and provided their alternative views on the legislation.\n  In August 2000, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the House \nCommittee on Resources held joint field hearings on the legislation in \nHawaii for 5 days. While the bill passed the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in the 106th Congress, the Senate failed to take \naction. The bill was subsequently considered by the 107th, l08th, and \n109th Congresses. In each Congress, the bill has been favorably \nreported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and its companion \nmeasure has been favorably reported by the House Committee on Resources \nin the 106th through the 108th Congress.\n  Most recently in the 109th Congress clarifications were made to the \nbill. I want to inform my colleagues to the fact that this bill is \nidentical to legislative language negotiated between Senator Inouye and \nmyself, and officials from the Department of Justice, Office of \nManagement and Budget, and the White House. The language satisfactorily \naddresses concerns expressed in July 2005 by the Bush administration \nregarding the liability of the United States in land claims, the impact \nof the bill on military readiness, gaming, and civil and criminal \njurisdiction in Hawaii.\n  With respect to liability of the United States as it relates to land \nclaims, as the author of the Apology Resolution, P.L. 103-150, as well \nas the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, I have always \nmaintained that this legislation is not intended to serve as a \nsettlement of any claims nor as a cause of action for any claims. The \nnegotiated language makes clear that any grievances regarding \nhistorical wrongs committed against Native Hawaiians by the United \nStates or by the State of Hawaii are to be addressed in the \nnegotiations process between the Native Hawaiian governing entity and \nFederal and State governments.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs, as well as the incoming Chairman on the \nSubcommittee on Readiness and Management of the Senate Committee on \nArmed Services, military readiness for our Armed Forces is of great \nimportance to me. Due to concerns raised by the Department of Defense \nto the consultation requirements expected to be facilitated by the \nOffice of Native Hawaiian Relations in the Department of the Interior \nand the Native Hawaiian Interagency Coordinating Group; negotiated \nlanguage exempts the Department from these consultation requirements. \nHowever, these exemptions do not alter nor terminate requirements of \nthe DoD to consult with Native Hawaiians under the Native Graves \nProtection and Repatriation Act, NAGPRA, National Historic Preservation \nAct, NHPA, and other existing statutes.\n  The bill does not authorize gaming by the Native Hawaiian governing \nentity. Negotiated language clarifies that gaming may not be conducted \nby Native Hawaiians or the Native Hawaiian governing entity as a matter \nof\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\nclaimed inherent authority or under the authority of any Federal laws \nor regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior or the \nNational Indian Gaming Commission. The bill also makes clear that the \nprohibition applies to any efforts to establish gaming by Native \nHawaiians and the Native Hawaiian governing entity in Hawaii and in any \nother State or Territory. This language only applies to efforts to \nestablish gaming operations as a matter of inherent authority as \nindigenous peoples or under federal laws pertaining to gaming by native \npeoples.\n\n  The bill makes clear that civil and criminal jurisdiction currently \nheld by the Federal and State governments will remain with the Federal \nand State governments unless otherwise negotiated and implementing \nlegislation is enacted.\n  I have described the clarifications that have been made so my \ncolleagues know that our negotiations with the administration have been \nsuccessful. This language has been publicly available since September \n2005 and has been widely distributed. Although such clarifications have \nbeen made, I am proud to report that the bill remains true to its \nintent and purpose--to clarify the existing legal and political \nrelationship between Hawaii's indigenous people, Native Hawaiians and \nthe United States.\n  Along with our efforts to work with the Bush administration, during \nthe past 4 years, we have worked closely with Hawaii's first Republican \ngovernor in 40 years, Governor Linda Lingle to enact this legislation. \nWe have also worked closely with the Hawaii State legislature which has \npassed three resolutions unanimously in support of federal recognition \nfor Native Hawaiians. I am pleased to announce today that I am again \njoined by members from both sides of the aisle to introduce this \nimportant measure. I mention this, to underscore the fact that this is \nbipartisan legislation.\n  In addition to its widespread support by both Native Hawaiians and \nnon-Native Hawaiians in Hawaii, in resolutions adopted by the oldest \nand largest national Indian organization, the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians, and the largest organization representing the Native \npeople of Alaska, the Alaska Federation of Natives, the members of both \ngroups have consistently expressed their strong support for enactment \nof a bill to provide for recognition by the United States of a Native \nHawaiian governing entity. Organizations such as the American Bar \nAssociation, Japanese American Citizen League, and the National Indian \nEducation Association have also passed resolutions in support of \nfederal recognition for Hawaii's indigenous peoples.\n  Today I provide my colleagues with a framework to understand the need \nfor this legislation by briefly reviewing (1) Hawaii's past, ancient \nHawaiian society prior to Western contact, (2) Hawaii's present, the \nfar reaching consequences of the overthrow, and (3) Hawaii's future.\n  Hawaii was originally settled by Polynesian voyagers arriving as \nearly as 300 A.D, 1200 years before Europe's great explorers Magellan \nand Columbus. The Hawaiians braved immense distances guided by their \nextensive knowledge of navigation and understanding of the marine \nenvironment. Isolation followed the era of long voyages, enabling \nNative Hawaiians to develop distinct political, economic, and social \nstructures which were mutually supportive. As stewards of the land and \nsea, Native Hawaiians were intimately linked to the environment and \nthey developed innovative methods of agriculture, aquaculture, \nnavigation and irrigation.\n  With an influx of foreigners into Hawaii, Native Hawaiian populations \nplummeted due to death from common Western diseases. Those that \nsurvived witnessed foreign interest and involvement in their government \ngrow until Queen Liliuokalani was forced by American citizens to \nabdicate her right to the throne. This devastated the Native Hawaiian \npeople, forever tainting the waters of their identity and tattering the \nvery fabric of their society. For some this injustice, this wound has \nnever healed, manifesting itself in a sense of inferiority and \nhopelessness leaving many Native Hawaiians at the lowest levels of \nachievement by all social and economic measures.\n  Mr. President, 14 years ago the United States enacted the Apology \nResolution, 103-150, which acknowledged the 100th anniversary of the \noverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in which the United States offered \nan apology to Native Hawaiians and declared its policy to support \nreconciliation efforts. This is a landmark declaration for it \nrecognizes not only are Native Hawaiians the indigenous people of \nHawaii, but of the urgent need for the U.S. to actively engage in \nreconciliation efforts. This acknowledgment played a crucial role in \ninitiating a healing process and although progress has been made, the \npath ahead is uncertain.\n  Frustration has led to anger and festered in the hearts of Hawaii's \nyounger generations, with each child that is taught about this period \nof Hawaiian history, a loss is relived. It is a burden that Native \nHawaiians since the overthrow continue to carry, to know that they were \nviolated in their own homeland and their governance was ripped away \nunjustly. Despite the perceived harmony, it is the generation of my \ngrandchildren that is growing impatient and frustrated with the lack of \nprogress being made. Influenced by a deep sadness and growing \nintolerance, an active minority within this generation seeks \nindependence from the United States.\n  It is for this generation that I work to enact this bill so that \nthere is the structured process to deal with these emotional issues. It \nis important that discussions are held and that there is a framework to \nguide appropriate action. For Hawaii is the homeland of the Native \nHawaiian people.\n\n  A lack of action by the U.S. will only incite and fuel us down a path \nto a divided Hawaii. A Hawaii where lines and boundaries are drawn and \nunity severed. However, the legislation I introduce today seeks to \nbuild upon the foundation of reconciliation. It provides a structured \nprocess to bring together the people of Hawaii, along a path of healing \nto a Hawaii where its indigenous people are respected and culture is \nembraced.\n  Respecting the rights of America's first people--American Indians, \nAlaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians is not un-American. Through \nenactment of this legislation, we have the opportunity to demonstrate \nthat our country does not just preach its ideas, but lives according to \nits founding principles. That the United States will admit when it has \ntrespassed against a people and remain resolute to make amends. We \ndemonstrate our character to ourselves and to the world by respecting \nthe rights of our country's indigenous people. As it has for America's \nother indigenous peoples, I believe the United States must fulfill its \nresponsibility to Native Hawaiians.\n  I am proud of the fact that this bill respects the rights of Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples through a process that is consistent with Federal \nlaw, and it provides the structured process for the people of Hawaii to \naddress the longstanding issues which have plagued both Native \nHawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians since the overthrow of the Kingdom \nof Hawaii. We have an established record of the United States' \ncommitment to the reconciliation with Native Hawaiians. This \nlegislation is another step building upon that foundation and honoring \nthat commitment.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in enacting this legislation which is \nof great importance to all the people of Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this measure \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 310\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native Hawaiian Government \n     Reorganization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States;\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago that is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States;\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\n       (3) the United States has a special political and legal \n     relationship to promote the welfare of the native people of \n     the United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (4) under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm \n     treaties between the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, \n     and from 1826 until 1893, the United States--\n       (A) recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) accorded full diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii;

and\n       (C) the assets of this public trust have never been \n     completely inventoried or segregated;\n       (9) Native Hawaiians have continuously sought access to the \n     ceded lands in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State;\n       (10) the Hawaiian Home Lands and other ceded lands provide \n     an important foundation for the ability of the Native \n     Hawaiian community to maintain the practice of Native \n     Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions, and for the \n     survival and economic self-sufficiency of the Native Hawaiian \n     people;\n       (11) Native Hawaiians continue to maintain other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii;\n       (12) on November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the ``Apology Resolution'') was \n     enacted into law, extending an apology on behalf of the \n     United States to the native people of Hawaii for the United \n     States' role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (13) the Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished to the United States their claims to \n     their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national \n     lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum;\n       (14) the Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President--\n       (A) to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of \n     the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) to support reconciliation efforts between the United \n     States and Native Hawaiians; and\n       (C) to consult with Native Hawaiians on the reconciliation \n     process as called for in the Apology Resolution;\n       (15) despite the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their \n     separate identity as a single distinct native community \n     through cultural, social, and political institutions, and to \n     give expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination, self-governance, and economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (16) Native Hawaiians have also given expression to their \n     rights as native people to self-determination, self-\n     governance, and economic self-sufficiency--\n       (A) through the provision of governmental services to \n     Native Hawaiians, including the provision of--\n       (i) health care services;\n       (ii) educational programs;\n       (iii) employment and training programs;\n       (iv) economic development assistance programs;\n       (v) children's services;\n       (vi) conservation programs;\n       (vii) fish and wildlife protection;\n       (viii) agricultural programs;\n       (ix) native language immersion programs;\n       (x) native language immersion schools from kindergarten \n     through high school;\n       (xi) college and master's degree programs in native \n     language immersion instruction; and\n       (xii) traditional justice programs, and\n       (B) by continuing their efforts to enhance Native Hawaiian \n     self-determination and local control;\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources;\n       (18) the Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future generations of Native Hawaiians their \n     lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural identity in \n     accordance with their traditions, beliefs, customs and \n     practices, language, and social and political institutions, \n     to control and manage their own lands, including ceded lands, \n     and to achieve greater self-determination over their own \n     affairs;\n       (19) this Act provides a process within the framework of \n     Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise their \n     inherent rights as a distinct, indigenous, native community \n     to reorganize a single Native Hawaiian governing entity for \n     the purpose of giving expression to their rights as native \n     people to self-determination and self-governance;\n       (20) Congress--\n       (A) has declared that the United States has a special \n     political and legal relationship for the welfare of the \n     native peoples of the United States, including Native \n     Hawaiians;\n       (B) has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct group of \n     indigenous, native people of the United States within the \n     scope of its authority under the Constitution, and has \n     enacted scores of statutes on their behalf ; and\n       (C) has delegated broad authority to the State of Hawaii to \n     administer some of the United States' responsibilities as \n     they relate to the Native Hawaiian people and their lands;\n       (21) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special political and legal relationship with the Native \n     Hawaiian people through the enactment of the Act entitled, \n     ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii \n     into the Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; \n     73 Stat. 4), by--\n       (A) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held as a public trust for 5 purposes, 1 of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (B) transferring the United States' responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the exclusive right of the United \n     States to consent to any actions affecting the lands included \n     in the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act;\n       (22) the United States has continually recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the aboriginal, indigenous, native people who \n     exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the indigenous, native \n     people of a once-sovereign nation with whom the United States \n     has a special political and legal relationship; and\n       (D) the special relationship of American Indians, Alaska \n     Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States arises out \n     of their status as aboriginal, indigenous, native people of \n     the United States; and\n       (23) the State of Hawaii supports the reaffirmation of the \n     special political and legal relationship between the Native \n     Hawaiian governing entity and the United States as evidenced \n     by 2 unanimous resolutions enacted by the Hawaii State \n     Legislature in the 2000 and 2001 sessions of the Legislature \n     and by the testimony of the Governor of the State of Hawaii \n     before the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate on \n     February 25, 2003, and March 1, 2005.\n\n     SEC. 3.

provided that the provisions of Public Law 103-454, \n     25 U.S.C. 479a, shall not apply.\n       (B) Resubmission in case of noncompliance with the \n     requirements of subparagraph (a).--\n       (i) Resubmission by the secretary.--If the Secretary \n     determines that the organic governing documents, or any part \n     of the documents, do not meet all of the requirements set \n     forth in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall resubmit the \n     organic governing documents to the Council, along with a \n     justification for each of the Secretary's findings as to why \n     the provisions are not in full compliance.\n       (ii) Amendment and resubmission of organic governing \n     documents.--If the organic governing documents are \n     resubmitted to the Council by the Secretary under clause (i), \n     the Council shall--\n\n       (I) amend the organic governing documents to ensure that \n     the documents meet all the requirements set forth in \n     subparagraph (A);

REAFFIRMATION OF DELEGATION OF FEDERAL AUTHORITY; \n                   NEGOTIATIONS; CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Reaffirmation.--The delegation by the United States of \n     authority to the State of Hawaii to address the conditions of \n     the indigenous, native people of Hawaii contained in the Act \n     entitled ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State \n     of Hawaii into the Union'' approved March 18, 1959 (Public \n     Law 86-3, 73 Stat. 4), is reaffirmed.\n       (b) Negotiations.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the reaffirmation of the special \n     political and legal relationship between the United States \n     and the Native Hawaiian governing entity, the United States \n     and the State of Hawaii may enter into negotiations with the \n     Native Hawaiian governing entity designed to lead to an \n     agreement addressing such matters as--\n       (A) the transfer of lands, natural resources, and other \n     assets, and the protection of existing rights related to such \n     lands or resources;\n       (B) the exercise of governmental authority over any \n     transferred lands, natural resources, and other assets, \n     including land use;\n       (C) the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction;\n       (D) the delegation of governmental powers and authorities \n     to the Native Hawaiian governing entity by the United States \n     and the State of Hawaii;\n       (E) any residual responsibilities of the United States and \n     the State of Hawaii; and\n       (F) grievances regarding assertions of historical wrongs \n     committed against Native Hawaiians by the United States or by \n     the State of Hawaii.\n       (2) Amendments to existing laws.--Upon agreement on any \n     matter or matters negotiated with the United States, the \n     State of Hawaii, and the Native Hawaiian governing entity, \n     the parties are authorized to submit--\n       (A) to the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate, the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate, and \n     the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives, \n     recommendations for proposed amendments to Federal law that \n     will enable the implementation of agreements reached between \n     the 3 governments; and\n       (B) to the Governor and the legislature of the State of \n     Hawaii, recommendations for proposed amendments to State law \n     that will enable the implementation of agreements reached \n     between the 3 governments.\n       (3) Governmental authority and power.--Any governmental \n     authority or power to be exercised by the Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity which is currently exercised by the State or \n     Federal Governments shall be exercised by the Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity only as agreed to in negotiations pursuant \n     to section 8(b)(1) of this Act and beginning on the date on \n     which legislation to implement such agreement has been \n     enacted by the United States Congress, when applicable, and \n     by the State of Hawaii, when applicable. This includes any \n     required modifications to the Hawaii State Constitution in \n     accordance with the Hawaii Revised Statutes.\n       (c) Claims.--\n       (1) Disclaimers.--Nothing in this Act--\n       (A) creates a cause of action against the United States or \n     any other entity or person;\n       (B) alters existing law, including existing case law, \n     regarding obligations on the part of the United States or the \n     State of Hawaii with regard to Native Hawaiians or any Native \n     Hawaiian entity;\n       (C) creates obligations that did not exist in any source of \n     Federal law prior to the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (D) establishes authority for the recognition of Native \n     Hawaiian groups other than the single Native Hawaiian \n     Governing Entity.\n       (2) Federal sovereign immunity.--\n       (A) Specific purpose.--Nothing in this Act is intended to \n     create or allow to be maintained in any court any potential \n     breach-of-trust actions, land claims, resource-protection or \n     resource-management claims, or similar types of claims \n     brought by or on behalf of Native Hawaiians or the Native \n     Hawaiian governing entity for equitable, monetary, or \n     Administrative Procedure Act-based relief against the United \n     States or the State of Hawaii, whether or not such claims \n     specifically assert an alleged breach of trust, call for an \n     accounting, seek declaratory relief, or seek the recovery of \n     or compensation for lands once held by Native Hawaiians.\n       (B) Establishment and retention of sovereign immunity.--To \n     effectuate the ends expressed in section 8(c)(1) and \n     8(c)(2)(A), and notwithstanding any other provision of \n     Federal law, the United States retains its sovereign immunity \n     to any claim that existed prior to the enactment of this Act \n     (including, but not limited to, any claim based in whole or \n     in part on past events), and which could be brought by Native \n     Hawaiians or any Native Hawaiian governing entity. Nor shall \n     any preexisting waiver of sovereign immunity (including, but \n     not limited to, waivers set forth in chapter 7 of part I of \n     title 5, United States Code, and sections 1505 and 2409a of \n     title 28, United States Code) be applicable to any such \n     claims. This complete retention or reclaiming of sovereign \n     immunity also applies to every claim that might attempt to \n     rely on this Act for support, without regard to the source of \n     law under which any such claim might be asserted.\n       (C) Effect.--It is the general effect of section 8(c)(2)(B) \n     that any claims that may already have accrued and might be \n     brought against the United States, including any claims of \n     the types specifically referred to in section 8(c)(2)(A), \n     along with both claims of a similar nature and claims arising \n     out of the same nucleus of operative facts as could give rise \n     to claims of the specific types referred to in section \n     8(c)(2)(A), be rendered nonjusticiable in suits brought by \n     plaintiffs other than the Federal Government.\n       (3) State sovereignty immunity.--\n       (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, the \n     State retains its sovereign immunity, unless waived in accord \n     with State law, to any claim, established under any source of \n     law, regarding Native Hawaiians, that existed prior to the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to constitute an \n     override pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment of \n     State sovereign immunity held under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n     SEC. 9. APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN FEDERAL LAWS.\n\n       (a) Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.--\n       (1) The Native Hawaiian governing entity and Native \n     Hawaiians may not conduct gaming activities as a matter of \n     claimed inherent authority or under the authority of any \n     Federal law, including the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) or under any regulations thereunder \n     promulgated by the Secretary or the National Indian Gaming \n     Commission.\n       (2) The foregoing prohibition in section 9(a)(1) on the use \n     of Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and inherent authority to \n     game apply regardless of whether gaming by Native Hawaiians \n     or the Native Hawaiian governing entity would be located on \n     land within the State of Hawaii or within any other State or \n     Territory of the United States.\n       (b) Taking Land Into Trust.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, including but not limited to part 151 of \n     title 25, Code of Federal Regulations, the Secretary\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\n     shall not take land into trust on behalf of individuals or \n     groups claiming to be Native Hawaiian or on behalf of the \n     native Hawaiian governing entity.\n       (c) Real Property Transfers.--The Indian Trade and \n     Intercourse Act (25 U.S.C. 177), does not, has never, and \n     will not apply after enactment to lands or lands transfers \n     present, past, or future, in the State of Hawaii. If despite \n     the expression of this intent herein, a court were to \n     construe the Trade and Intercourse Act to apply to lands or \n     land transfers in Hawaii before the date of enactment of this \n     Act, then any transfer of land or natural resources located \n     within the State of Hawaii prior to the date of enactment of \n     this Act, by or on behalf of the Native Hawaiian people, or \n     individual Native Hawaiians, shall be deemed to have been \n     made in accordance with the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act \n     and any other provision of Federal law that specifically \n     applies to transfers of land or natural resources from, by, \n     or on behalf of an Indian tribe, Native Hawaiians, or Native \n     Hawaiian entities.\n       (d) Single Governing Entity.--This Act will result in the \n     recognition of the single Native Hawaiian governing entity. \n     Additional Native Hawaiian groups shall not be eligible for \n     acknowledgment pursuant to the Federal Acknowledgment Process \n     set forth in part 83 of title 25 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations or any other administrative acknowledgment or \n     recognition process.\n       (e) Jurisdiction.--Nothing in this Act alters the civil or \n     criminal jurisdiction of the United States or the State of \n     Hawaii over lands and persons within the State of Hawaii. The \n     status quo of Federal and State jurisdiction can change only \n     as a result of further legislation, if any, enacted after the \n     conclusion, in relevant part, of the negotiation process \n     established in section 8(b).\n       (f) Indian Programs and Services.--Notwithstanding section \n     7(c)(6), because of the eligibility of the Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity and its citizens for Native Hawaiian \n     programs and services in accordance with subsection (g), \n     nothing in this Act provides an authorization for eligibility \n     to participate in any Indian program or service to any \n     individual or entity not otherwise eligible for the program \n     or service under applicable Federal law.\n       (g) Native Hawaiian Programs and Services.--The Native \n     Hawaiian governing entity and its citizens shall be eligible \n     for Native Hawaiian programs and services to the extent and \n     in the manner provided by other applicable laws.\n\n     SEC. 10. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any section or provision of this Act is held invalid, it \n     is the intent of Congress that the remaining sections or \n     provisions shall continue in full force and effect.\n\n     SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nAkaka, as a cosponsor of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization \nAct of 2007.\n  During the 109th Congress, the Administration expressed concerns with \nthis legislation that stem from its experience with Indian tribes. The \nhistory of the Native Hawaiians and their treatment by the United \nStates is similar to that of Indian tribes and Alaska Natives. I want \nto commend the Administration for devoting staff to work with us to \nachieve consensus on mutually agreeable language. I am confident that \nthis measure not only addresses the Administration's concerns but also \nthe concerns of some of our colleagues.\n  Having served on the Indian Affairs Committee for the past 28 years, \nI know that most of our colleagues are more familiar with conditions \nand circumstances in Indian country, and naturally, they bring their \nexperience with Indian country to bear in considering this measure, \nwhich has been pending in the Senate for the past eight years.\n  Accordingly, I believe it is important that our colleagues understand \nwhat this bill seeks to accomplish as well as how it differs from \nlegislation affecting Indian country.\n  It is a little known fact that beginning in 1910 and since that time, \nthe Congress has passed and the President has signed into law over 160 \nFederal laws designed to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n  Thus, Federal laws which authorize the provision of health care, \neducation, housing, and job training and employment services, as well \nas programs to provide for the preservation of the Native Hawaiian \nlanguage, Native language immersion, Native cultural and grave \nprotections and repatriation of Native sacred objects have been in \nplace for decades.\n  The Native Hawaiian programs do not draw upon funding that is \nappropriated for American Indians or Alaska Natives--there are separate \nauthorizations for programs that are administered by different Federal \nagencies--not the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian Health \nService, for instance--and the Native Hawaiian program funds are not \ndrawn from the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee account. Thus, they \nhave no impact on the funding that is provided for the other \nindigenous, native people of the United States.\n  However, unlike the native people residing on the mainland, Native \nHawaiians have not been able to exercise their rights as Native people \nto self-determination or self-governance because their government was \noverthrown on January 17, 1893.\n  This bill would provide a process for the reorganization of the \nNative Hawaiian government and the resumption of a political and legal \nrelationship between that government and the government of the United \nStates.\n  Because the Native Hawaiian government is not an Indian tribe, the \nbody of Federal Indian law that would otherwise customarily apply when \nthe United States extends Federal recognition to an Indian tribal group \ndoes not apply.\n  Thus, the bill provides authority for a process of negotiations \namongst the United States, the State of Hawaii, and the reorganized \nNative Hawaiian government to address such matters as the exercise of \ncivil and criminal jurisdiction by the respective governments, the \ntransfer of land and natural resources and other assets, and the \nexercise of governmental authority over those lands, natural resources \nand other assets.\n  Upon reaching agreement, the U.S. Congress and the legislature of the \nState of Hawaii would have to enact legislation implementing the \nagreements of the three governments, including amendments that will \nnecessarily have to be made to existing Federal law, such as the Hawaii \nAdmissions Act and the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, and to State law, \nincluding amendments to the Hawaii State Constitution, before any of \nthe new governmental relationships and authorities can take effect.\n  That is why concerns which are premised on the manner in which \nFederal Indian law provides for the respective governmental authorities \nof the State governments and Indian tribal governments simply do not \napply in Hawaii.\n  We have every confidence that consistent with the Federal policy for \nover 35 years, the restoration of the rights to self-determination and \nself-governance will enable the Native Hawaiian people, as the direct, \nlineal descendants of the aboriginal, indigenous native people of what \nhas become our nation's fiftieth state, to take their rightful place in \nthe family of governments that makes up our constitutional system of \ngovernance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Webb, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mr. Thune, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 315. A bill to establish a digital and wireless network technology \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Minority \nServing Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act. \nThis legislation, which was crafted by Senator Allen and I in years \npast, will provide vital resources to address the technology gap that \nexists at many Minority Serving Institutions, MSIs.\n  In the past, Senator Allen took the role of lead sponsor on this \nimportant bill. With his leadership, this exact legislation has passed \ntwice unanimously. Unfortunately, the 109th Congress adjourned before \nthe House of Representatives considered the bill. Accordingly, today I \nam privileged to serve as the lead sponsor of this legislation in the \n110th Congress. I am pleased to have my Virginia colleague Senator Jim \nWebb as an original cosponsor of this bill. I hope this important bill \nwill soon become law.\n  Over 60 percent of all jobs require information technology skills. \nJobs in the information technology field pay significantly higher \nsalaries than jobs in non-information technology fields. At the same \ntime, many of our Minority Serving Institutions lack the capital to \noffer assistance to their students to bridge the ``Digital Divide'' \nbetween students who are able to develop the skills necessary to \nsucceed in\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\na technology based economy and those who are not.\n  This legislation will establish a grant program for these \ninstitutions of higher education to bring increased access to \ncomputers, technology, and the Internet to their student populations. \nSpecifically, this legislation authorizes $250 million in Federal \ngrants for Minority Serving Institutions to acquire equipment, \ninstrumentation, networking capability, hardware and software, digital \nnetwork technology and wireless technology and infrastructure to \ndevelop and provide educational services. In addition, the grants could \nbe used for such activities as campus wiring, equipment upgrades, and \ntechnology training. Finally, Minority Serving Institutions could use \nthese funds to offer their students universal access to campus \nnetworks, increase connectivity rates, or make infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  I am proud to say that Virginia is home to five Historically Black \nColleges and Universities, HBCUs--Norfolk State University, St. Paul's \nCollege, Virginia Union University, Hampton University, and Virginia \nState University--that are eligible for these technology grants. There \nare over 200 Hispanic Serving Institutions, over 100 Historically Black \nColleges and Universities and over 30 Tribal Colleges throughout the \nUnited States.\n  Again, in 2005, this bill passed in the Senate by unanimous consent. \nIn 2003, this bill passed in the Senate with a roll call vote of 97-0. \nI am pleased to support this legislation, as I have done in the past, \nand I look forward to strengthening the technology provided to students \nat Minority Serving Institutions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, \n        and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 316. A bill to prohibit brand name drug companies from \ncompensating generic drug companies to delay the entry of a generic \ndrug into the market; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Preserve \nAccess to Affordable Generics Act. This legislation will stop one of \nthe most egregious tactics used by the brand-name pharmaceutical \nindustry to keep generic competitors off the market, leaving consumers \nwith unnecessary high drug prices.\n  The way it is done is simple--a drug company that holds a patent on a \nblockbuster brand-name drug, pays a generic drug maker off to delay the \nsale of a competing generic product that might dip into their profits. \nThe brand name company profits so much by delaying competition that it \ncan easily afford to pay off the generic company, leaving consumers the \nbig losers who continue to pay unnecessarily high drug prices.\n  Last year, the Supreme Court refused to consider an appeal by the \nFederal Trade Commission to reinstate anti-trust charges against a \nbrand-name drugs maker. Since the recent court decisions allowing these \nbackroom deals, there has been a sharp rise in the number of \nsettlements in which brand-name companies pay off generic competitors \nto keep their cheaper drugs off the market. In a report issued last \nyear, the FTC found that more than two-thirds of the 10 settlement \nagreements made in 2006 included a pay-off from the brand in exchange \nfor a promise by the generic company to delay entry into the market.\n  The decision by the Supreme Court is a blow to consumers who save \nbillions of dollars on generics every year. When brand, name drugs lose \npatent rights, this opens the door for consumers, employers, third-\nparty payers, and other purchasers to save billions--63 percent on \naverage--by using generic versions of these drugs. A recent study \nreleased earlier this year by Pharmaceutical Care Management \nAssociation, showed that health plans and consumers could save $26.4 \nbillion over the next 5 years by using the generic versions of 14 \npopular drugs that are scheduled to lose their patent protections \nbefore 2010.\n  Last year, I was successful in including an additional $10 million in \nthe fiscal year 07 Agriculture Appropriations bill for the Food and \nDrug Administration's Office of Generic Drugs, an effort to help reduce \nthe growing backlog of generic drug applications. The FDA Office of \nGeneric Drugs has reported a backlog of more than 800 generic drug \napplications with more applications for new generics being received \nthan ever before.\n  But even approval by the FDA doesn't always guarantee that consumers \nwill have access to these affordable drugs. Brand-name pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers have learned to circumvent the Drug Price Competition and \nPatent Term Restoration Act, commonly referred to as Hatch-Waxman, \nusing litigation and other means to extend the life of patents and keep \ngenerics from entering the market Of the six approved first generics \nfor LA popular brand-name drugs taken by seniors over the last year, \nonly two have actually reached the market, while the others are being \nkept of the shelves by patent disputes.\n  We cannot profess to care about the high cost of prescription drugs \nwhile turning a blind eye to anticompetitive backroom deals between \nbrand and generic drug companies. It's time to stop these drug company \npay-offs that only serve the companies involved and deny consumers to \naffordable generic drugs. I urge my colleagues to join me in this \neffort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 316\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Preserve Access to \n     Affordable Generics Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) prescription drugs make up 11 percent of the national \n     health care spending but are 1 of the largest and fastest \n     growing health care expenditures;\n       (2) 56 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the United \n     States are generic drugs, yet they account for only 13percent \n     of all expenditures;\n       (3) generic drugs, on average, cost 63 percent less than \n     their brand-name counterparts;\n       (4) consumers and the health care system would benefit from \n     free and open competition in the pharmaceutical market and \n     the removal of obstacles to the introduction of generic \n     drugs;\n       (5) full and free competition in the pharmaceutical \n     industry, and the full enforcement of antitrust law to \n     prevent anticompetitive practices in this industry, will lead \n     to lower prices, greater innovation, and inure to the general \n     benefit of consumers.\n       (6) the Federal Trade Commission has determined that some \n     brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers collude with generic \n     drug manufacturers to delay the marketing of competing, low-\n     cost, generic drugs;\n       (7) collusion by the brand name pharmaceutical \n     manufacturers is contrary to free competition, to the \n     interests of consumers, and to the principles underlying \n     antitrust law;\n       (8) in 2005, 2 appellate court decisions reversed the \n     Federal Trade Commission's long-standing position, and upheld \n     settlements that include pay-offs by brand name \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers to generic manufacturers \n     designed to keep generic competition off the market;\n       (9) in the 6 months following the March 2005 court \n     decisions, the Federal Trade Commission found there were \n     three settlement agreements in which the generic received \n     compensation and agreed to a restriction on its ability to \n     market the product;\n       (10) the FTC found that more than \\2/3\\ of the \n     approximately ten settlement agreements made in 2006 include \n     a pay-off from the brand in exchange for a promise by the \n     generic company to delay entry into the market; and\n       (11) settlements which include a payment from a brand name \n     manufacturer to a generic manufacturer to delay entry by \n     generic drugs are anti-competitive and contrary to the \n     interests of consumers.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by \n     prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion between \n     brand name and generic drug manufacturers intended to keep \n     generic drugs off the market;\n       (2) to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by \n     prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion in the \n     pharmaceutical industry; and\n       (3) to clarify the law to prohibit payments from brand name \n     to generic drug manufacturers with the purpose to prevent or \n     delay the entry of competition from generic drugs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Federal \n     Trade Commission such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kohl, \nFeingold, Grassley and Schumer in introducing the Preserve Access to \nAffordable Generics Act of 2007. This legislation is a continuation of \na longstanding, bipartisan effort to provide consumers with more \nchoices for medications at lower costs. Better access to affordable \nprescription medication is of vital importance to seniors, families, \nand consumers across the Nation who are struggling to keep up with the \never increasing costs of health care.\n  This legislation builds on the Drug Competition Act, which I authored \nin 2001 and which became law in 2003 in the Medicare Modernization Act. \nRecently, two Federal courts undermined the intent of this law; the \nlegislation we introduce today will address that problem. The Preserve \nAccess to Affordable Generics Act will result in lower prescription \ndrug costs for all Americans by preventing a pernicious practice in \nwhich brand-name pharmaceutical companies pay other drug companies not \nto produce and market generic drugs--which can be 80 percent less \nexpensive than their brand-name counterparts--as part of private patent \nsettlement agreements.\n  The Hatch-Waxman Act was intended to facilitate the entry of lower-\ncost generic drugs into the market, making medication more affordable, \nwhile protecting patent rights to foster innovation. It created a \nprocess, known as the Abbreviated New Drug Application, ANDA, to speed \napproval of generics. Under ANDA, an applicant can receive expedited \napproval from the FDA to market a generic product. An applicant using \nANDA may certify that the manufacturing of its new drug will either not \ninfringe on a previously patented drug on which it is based, or that \nthe existing patent is invalid. After certifying an ANDA, the generic \napplicant must give notice to the patent-holder, at which point the \npatent-holder has 45 days to file a patent infringement against the \napplicant.\n  More times than not, disputes over an ANDA are resolved through \nprivate settlements. Unfortunately, the\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nunderpinnings of these private settlements are becoming more and more \nquestionable; drug companies are abusing Hatch-Waxman provisions, and \nusing settlement opportunities to limit consumer choices and keep \nconsumer prices artificially high. The FTC had been policing these \ndeals to ensure they were not anticompetitive until two recent \nappellate court decisions limited it's role.\n  Hatch-Waxman created a good framework for promoting innovation while \nspeeding the market entry of affordable drugs. The trend of \nanticompetitive agreements between brand-name pharmaceutical companies \nand generic companies to delay entry into the market is a troubling \nabuse of that good law. Some drug firms have colluded to pad their \nprofits by forcing consumers to pay higher prices than they would pay \nfor lower-cost generics. Congress never intended for brand-name drug \ncompanies to be able to grease the palms of generic companies by paying \nthem not to produce generic medicines.\n  Rarely do we have such a clear-cut opportunity as this to remove \nobvious impediments that prevent the marketplace from working as it \nshould--to the benefit of consumers. Congress should seize this \nopportunity and enact legislation that plainly makes anticompetitive \ndeals, such as those I have outlined, illegal.\n  The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act will accomplish this \ngoal. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to pass this timely and needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 317. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish a program to \nregulate the emission of greenhouse gases from electric utilities; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nCarper to introduce the Electric Utility Cap and Trade Act.\n  Today, we are introducing the first of five bills to address the \nnumber one environmental issue facing this planet--global warming.\n  This bill establishes a national cap and trade system over the \nelectricity sector. It will reduce emissions from this sector by 25 \npercent by 2020.\n  What distinguishes this bill is that it has the support of 6 major \nenergy companies.\n  Together, these companies operate in 42 States and produce \napproximately 150,000 megawatts of energy. This is greater than 15 \npercent of the U.S. electricity market.\n  These companies include, first, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) \nCorporation, which is the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. \nPG is California's largest utility and serves approximately 1 in \nevery 20 Americans. PG Corporation currently owns approximately 6,500 \nmegawatts of generation.\n  Second, Calpine, which operates in 20 States and Canada, generating \n26,000 megawatts of energy.\n  Third, Florida Power & Light, which operates in 26 States, generating \nmore than 30,000 megawatts.\n  Fourth, Entergy, which operates in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand Texas, generating approximately 30,000 megawatts.\n  Fifth, Exelon, which operates in Illinois and Pennsylvania, \ngenerating 38,000 megawatts of energy.\n  Sixth, Public Service Enterprise Group, which is the largest provider \nof energy in New Jersey, generating approximately 15,000 megawatts.\n  These companies' support is greatly appreciated, and I think it \nsignals a new willingness in the energy industry to seriously tackle \nglobal warming.\n  This bill is just the beginning of a major program. Over the next \nweeks and months, we will also be introducing a cap and trade bill for \nthe industrial sector; a bill that increases fuel economy standards by \nten miles per gallon over the next ten years; a bill to promote bio-\ndiesel and E-85; and other low carbon fuels and an energy efficiency \nbill modeled after California's program.\n  This is an ambitious agenda, but I believe it is the right way to go \nif we are to slow global warming.\n  A great debate has raged in the halls of Congress, in academia, and \nin the field over the past two decades.\n  At issue were three fundamental questions: First, is the earth \nwarming? Second, if so, is the warming caused by human activity? And \nthird, can it be stopped?\n  Over the past few years, a consensus has been forged. An overwhelming \nbody of evidence has been gathered. And, an inescapable conclusion has \nbeen reached: The earth is warming. The warming is caused by human \nactivity, namely the combustion of fossil fuels.\n  It cannot be stopped, because carbon dioxide does not dissipate. It \nstays in the atmosphere for 30, 40, or 50 years or more.\n  When we pick up the newspaper each day we see the results. We read \nabout ice sheets the size of small nations breaking off the ice shelves \nin the Arctic and Antarctic. We read about polar bears committing acts \nof cannibalism, something unknown in recent memory. We read about \nspecies disappearing, seas rising, coral reefs dying, and glaciers \nmelting.\n  But, all this dire news does not mean we should throw up our hands \nand do nothing. If we act now, and if we act with purpose, the most \nserious consequences can be averted. Global warming can be contained to \n1-2 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  But if we do not act, and temperatures spike by 5 degrees or more, \nthe world around us will change forever. There's no going back.\n  The question becomes what can we do? I've spent the last year trying \nto answer this question. And the conclusion I've reached is that there \nis no single answer, no silver bullet, no one thing to turn the tide. \nBut rather, we need many answers in many different areas.\n  And more importantly, we need people of common purpose, working \ntogether, to find innovative solutions. And that's why we're here \ntoday.\n  As I was searching for answers, I picked up the phone and called PG \nCorporation's CEO, Peter Darbee. I said, ``Peter, would you help me out \non Global Warming legislation?''\n  To his immense credit, Peter went back, studied the issue, and said \n``You're right. Something must be done.'' And he's been terrific. He's \nhelped at every step of the way.\n  It means so much to me that PG, Calpine, Florida Power and Light, \nand all the companies that comprise the Clean Energy Group's Clean Air \nPolicy Initiative have endorsed the legislation we are introducing \ntoday.\n  This is the most aggressive global warming bill that industry has \nsupported to date. And I want to thank the CEOs of these companies \ntoday for their courage and leadership in taking this step.\n  Here's what the bill would do. The bill would establish a cap and \ntrade program for the electricity sector, which is the single largest \npiece of the global warming puzzle, accounting for 33 percent of all \nU.S. emissions.\n  First, the bill would a cap at 2006 levels in 2011--a 6 percent \nreduction from anticipated levels of greenhouse gases from the electric \nsector.\n  In 2015, it would ratchet the cap down to 2001 levels--a 16 percent \nreduction from anticipated levels.\n  In 2016, the bill would reduce the cap further to 1 percent below \n2001 levels. And, from 2017 to 2019 it would require additional annual \n1 percent reductions.\n  By 2020, emissions would be reduced 25 percent below anticipated \nlevels.\n  And after that, emissions will be reduced even further--by an \nadditional 1.5 percent a year and potentially more, if the EPA, based \non scientific evidence, believes that more needs to be done to avert \nthe most dire consequences of global warming.\n  That's the cap.\n  The trade part of the bill gives companies flexibility to embrace new \ntechnologies, encourage innovation, and promote green practices--not \njust in this area, but across the economy.\n  As I said, this bill is only one part of the answer. One piece of the \npuzzle.\n  Congress has a window of opportunity to act. If we act boldly and \nquickly, then perhaps we can make a difference.\n  But if we resort to the feuding which has characterized past \nCongresses, our world will be the poorer for it. I think there is but \none choice.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\n                                 S. 317\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today along with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Wyden, Senator Bunning, Senator Inouye, and Senator \nDurbin, to introduce the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act in \norder to protect and preserve the Nation's important fossil record for \nthe benefit of our citizens. Vertebrate fossils are rare and important \nnatural resources that have become increasingly endangered due to an \nincrease in the illegal collection of fossil specimens for commercial \nsale. However, at this time there is no unified policy regarding the \ntreatment of fossils by Federal land management agencies which would \nhelp protect and conserve fossil specimens. Consequently, we risk the \ndeterioration or loss of these valuable scientific resources. This Act \nwill correct that omission by providing uniformity to the patchwork of \nstatutes and regulations that currently exist. By creating a \ncomprehensive national policy for preserving and managing \npaleontological resources found on Federal land, this Act will also be \ninstrumental in curtailing and preventing future illegal trade thereby \nensuring that many generations to come will have access to these \ninvaluable records of our past. I would like to emphasize that this \nbill covers only paleontological remains on Federal lands and in no way \naffects archaeological or cultural resources under the Archaeological \nResources Protection Act of 1979 or the Native American Graves \nProtection and Rehabilitation Act.\n  I would also mention that this bill is exactly the same bill that I \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\nin the 109th Congress. This bill was heard and marked up by the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, and was passed by the Senate.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and Chair of the Subcommittee on National Parks, I am very \nconcerned about the preservation of fossils as records of earth's past \nupheavals and struggles. While I recognize the value of amateur \ncollecting--and casual collecting--of fossils is protected in this \nbill--fossil theft has become an increasing problem. New fossil fields \nand insights into the earth's past are discovered nearly every month. \nPaleontological resources can be sold on the market for a hefty price. \nFor example, the complete skeleton of a T-Rex was sold for $8.6 million \nat auction to the Field Museum of Chicago. Consequently, they are being \nstolen from public lands without regard to science and education. The \nprotections I offer in this Act are not new. Federal and management \nagencies have individual regulations prohibiting theft of government \nproperty. However, Congress has not provided a clear statute stating \nthe value of paleontological resources to our Nation, as we have for \narcheological resources. We need to work together to make sure that we \nfulfill our responsibility as stewards of public lands, and as \nprotectors of our Nation's natural resources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Each violation shall be considered \n     a separate offense for purposes of this section.\n       (2) Amount of penalty.--The amount of such penalty assessed \n     under paragraph (1) shall be determined under regulations \n     promulgated pursuant to this Act, taking into account the \n     following factors:\n       (A) The scientific or fair market value, whichever is \n     greater, of the paleontological resource involved, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       (B) The cost of response, restoration, and repair of the \n     resource and the paleontological site involved.\n       (C) Any other factors considered relevant by the Secretary \n     assessing the penalty.\n       (3) Multiple offenses.--In the case of a second or \n     subsequent violation by the same person, the amount of a \n     penalty assessed under paragraph (2) may be doubled.\n       (4) Limitation.--The amount of any penalty assessed under \n     this subsection for any one violation shall not exceed an \n     amount equal to double the cost of response, restoration, and \n     repair of resources and paleontological site damage plus \n     double the scientific or fair market value of resources \n     destroyed or not recovered.\n       (b) Petition for Judicial Review; Collection of Unpaid \n     Assessments.--\n       (1) Judicial review.--Any person against whom an order is \n     issued assessing a penalty under subsection (a) may file a \n     petition for judicial review of the order in the United \n     States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the \n     district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred \n     within the 30-day period beginning on the date the order \n     making the assessment was issued. Upon notice of such filing, \n     the Secretary shall promptly file such a certified copy of \n     the record on which the order was issued. The court shall \n     hear the action on the record made before the Secretary and \n     shall sustain the action if it is supported by substantial \n     evidence on the record considered as a whole.\n       (2) Failure to pay.--If any person fails to pay a penalty \n     under this section within 30 days--\n       (A) after the order making assessment has become final and \n     the person has not filed a petition for judicial review of \n     the order in accordance with paragraph (1); or\n       (B) after a court in an action brought in paragraph (1) has \n     entered a final judgment upholding the assessment of the \n     penalty, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to \n     institute a civil action in a district court of the United \n     States for any district in which the person if found, \n     resides, or transacts business, to collect the penalty (plus \n     interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the \n     final order or the date of the final judgment, as the case \n     may be). The district court shall have jurisdiction to hear \n     and decide any such action.

A bill to establish an Indian youth telemental health \ndemonstration project; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce legislation \nwhich would provide a first important step in dealing with the crisis \nof youth suicide in Indian Country.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is almost identical to \nlegislation that the Senate passed in May, 2006, to establish an Indian \nyouth telemental health demonstration project. The Indian Youth \nTelemental Health Demonstration Project Act of 2007 would authorize the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to carry out a 4-year \ndemonstration project under which five tribes and tribal organizations \nwith telehealth capabilities could use telemental health services in \nyouth suicide prevention, intervention, and treatment. Demonstration \nproject grantees would provide services through telemental health for \nsuch purposes as counseling of Indian youth; providing medical advice \nand other assistance to frontline tribal health providers; training for \ncommunity members, tribal\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\nelected officials, tribal educators, and health workers and others who \nwork with Indian youth; developing culturally sensitive materials on \nsuicide prevention and intervention; and collecting and reporting of \ndata.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs held three hearings during the 109th \nCongress on the issue of Indian youth suicide, including one hearing \nthat I convened in Bismarck, ND. Although on the Indian reservations of \nthe northern Great Plains, the rate of Indian youth suicide is 10 times \nhigher than it is anywhere else in the country, this tragic issue is \nnot limited to these locations. The committee has heard testimony from \npeople from tribal communities in Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, \nNew Mexico, and Wyoming, as well.\n  According to 2004 statistics from the National Center for Injury \nPrevention and Control, suicide is the second leading cause of death, \nbehind unintentional injury, for American Indian and Alaska Native \nyoung adults 15 to 24 years old, of both sexes--a statistic that has \nsadly been true for the past 20 years. For North Dakota Indian girls 15 \nto 24 years old in 2004, suicide was the number one leading cause of \ndeath.\n  I am grateful for the efforts of the Indian Health Service and the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in \nparticular, both of which have, in a host of ways, sought to address \nthe reservation youth suicide crisis. SAMHSA is providing a 4-year \ngrant to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota--a \ntribe that had 12 Indian youth die by suicide over a 6-month period--to \nprovide mental health outreach workers. In addition, across the \ncountry, tribal leaders, tribal health professionals, and service \nproviders and family members are working together to implement early \nintervention plans, improve access to prevention programs, promote \ncommunity training and awareness, and reinstate traditional tribal \npractices and culture-based interventions to address Native youth \nsuicides.\n  Many Indian reservations and Native villages in Alaska are remote and \nisolated, and everyone who lives in those communities experiences much \nmore limited access to mental health services than in our Nation's \nmetropolitan areas. The testimony received by the Indian Affairs \nCommittee indicates that it is particularly in these remote Native \ncommunities that there is a crisis among the youth. I believe that the \nuse of telemedicine--or, for purposes of this legislation, telemental \nhealth--will prove a useful resource for the several tribes or tribal \norganizations that will participate in this demonstration project in \nassisting their youth.\n  In addition to introducing this legislation, I will include \nauthorization of this Indian Youth Telemental Health Demonstration \nProject in legislation to reauthorize and amend the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act, which I intend to introduce soon.\n  I thank my colleagues who have joined me in sponsoring this \nlegislation and in being willing to talk and think hard about an issue \nthat many believe should be kept hidden. We must find ways to prevent \nthe needless loss of young Native American boys and girls whose whole \nlives lie ahead of them, and from whom their tribal communities and all \nof this country stand to benefit as these youth blossom in to their \npotential as adults. I look forward to continuing our efforts to \naddress this sensitive and very important issue. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.

A bill to require persons seeking approval for a liquefied \nnatural gas facility to identify employees and agents engaged in \nactivities to persuade communities of the benefits of the approval; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss liquified natural gas \nprojects in California. As of August of last year, there are five \npotential liquified natural gas projects in California. The projects \ninclude the Cabrillo Deepwater Port LNG Facility, Clearwater Port LNG \nProject, Long Beach LNG Facility, Ocean Way LNG Terminal, and the \nPacific Gateway LNG Facility.\n  LNG is natural gas in its liquid form. When natural gas is cooled to \nminus 259 degrees Fahrenheit, it becomes a clear, colorless, odorless \nliquid. Natural gas is transferred into LNG to transport it more \neasily.\n  Although there is a need for natural gas, there are potential safety \nconcerns with the siting of new LNG facilities. According to the \nCalifornia Energy Commission, ``LNG hazards result from three of its \nproperties: cryogenic temperatures, dispersion characteristics, and \nflammability characteristics. The extremely cold LNG can directly cause \ninjury or damage. A vapor cloud, formed by an LNG spill, could drift \ndownwind into populated areas. It can ignite if the concentration of \nnatural gas is between five and 15 percent in air and it encounters an \nignition source. An LNG fire gives off a tremendous amount of heat.''\n  This is why many people who live near a potential LNG facility have \nsafety concerns. As a result, many companies try to ``sell'' the \nprojects to communities.\n  That is why today I am introducing this common sense bill. This bill \nis identical to legislation that I introduced in the 109th Congress.\n  It would require any company seeking Federal Government approval to \nsubmit, as part or its application, the names of employees and business \nagents who are trying to persuade communities of the benefits of the \nLNG facility.\n  This bill does not stop anyone from reaching out to local \ncommunities. What this bill says is that if you are trying to get \napproval for an LNG facility, whether on- or off-shore, you have to be \npublic about it. Today, if someone lobbies the federal government, he \nor she needs to register so their affiliation and interests before the \ngovernment are publicly known. We should do the same for these \nprojects. As I said, it is common sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 323\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. IDENTIFICATION OF PROPONENTS OF APPROVAL OF \n                   LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities Requiring FERC \n     Approval.--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall--\n       (1) require an applicant for approval, by the Commission \n     under the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.), of the \n     siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a liquefied \n     natural gas facility to identify each of the employees and \n     agents of the applicant that are engaged, directly or \n     indirectly, in activities to persuade communities of the \n     benefits of the approval; and\n       (2) maintain a publicly available database listing the \n     names of the employees and agents.\n       (b) Off-Shore Liquified Natural Gas Facilities.--The \n     Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the \n     department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall--\n       (1) require an applicant for approval, by the appropriate \n     Secretary under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. \n     1501 et seq.), of the siting, construction, expansion, or \n     operation of a liquefied natural gas facility to identify \n     each of the employees and agents of the applicant that are \n     engaged, directly or indirectly, in activities to persuade \n     communities of the benefits of the approval; and\n       (2) maintain a publicly available database listing the \n     names of the employees and agents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 324. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nstudy of water resources in the State of New Mexico; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, above-average rainfall in New Mexico \nlast summer and recent snow fall have led many to turn a blind eye to \nthe grim water situation faced by our State only months ago. New Mexico \nwas fast approaching a disaster due to drought. Many of our \nmunicipalities' wells were running dry and reservoirs were at \ndangerously low levels. Providence intervened, narrowly averting a \ncrisis resulting from water scarcity.\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\n  The development of the centrifugal pump was an event of great \nsignificance in the history of the West. Windmill driven pumps provided \nenough water for a family and several livestock. The centrifugal pump, \non the other hand, was capable of pumping eight hundred gallons of \nwater a minute, making possible the habitation of what was previously \nbarren desert. To a large extent, this invention provided the water for \ngrowing towns and agricultural industry. However, it also resulted in a \ngreat dependence on groundwater. As such, we need to fully understand \nthe nature and extent of our groundwater resources. This bill will \nprovide us with the information necessary to ensure that the water on \nwhich we have come to rely is available for years to come.\n  During times of drought, when surface water is scarce, we must be \nable to reliably turn to groundwater reserves. Approximately 90 percent \nof New Mexicans depend on groundwater for drinking water and 77 percent \nof New Mexicans obtain water exclusively from groundwater sources. \nWhile groundwater supplies throughout the State are coming under \nincreasing competition, not enough is known about these resources in \norder to make sound decisions regarding their use.\n  Nearly 40 percent of the State's population resides in the Middle Rio \nGrande Basin. Once thought to contain vast quantities of water, we are \nnow faced with the reality the Middle Rio Grande Basin contains far \nless water than originally thought. Between 1995 and 2001, the United \nStates Geological Survey undertook a study of the Basin which added \ngreatly to our knowledge regarding the primary source of water for our \nlargest population center. Had we proceeded with our water planning \nwithout the information provided by this study, I have little doubt \nthat we would ultimately find ourselves in a dire situation. However, \nthere is much more to be learned about this Basin.\n  Roughly 65 percent of the State's population lives along the Rio \nGrande. Also located along the river are the four largest cities in New \nMexico: Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Rio Rancho and Las Cruces. While the \ncompletion of the San Juan-Chama Diversion by the Albuquerque \nBernalillo County Water Utility Authority will allow the County of \nBernalillo and City of Albuquerque to take advantage of their \nallocation of San JuanChama water, the remainder of the cities and \ncounties located along the Rio Grande will continue to receive the \nmajority of their water from aquifers beneath the Rio Grande. Aside \nfrom the Middle Rio Grande Basin, we have limited knowledge of the \namount of water contained in the aquifers below the Rio Grande, the \nrate at which they recharge, aquifer contamination, and the interaction \nbetween surface flows and ground water.\n  Elsewhere in the State, even less is understood regarding groundwater \nresources. While there is limited unallocated surface water in the \nState, there are significant quantities of untapped underground water \nin the Tularosa and Salt Basins. The Tularosa Basin is approximately 60 \nmiles wide and 200 miles long. Making the conservative estimate that 10 \npercent of the water contained in that aquifer is available for use \nthrough desalination, it would provide 100 years of water for a city \nthe size of Albuquerque. With the development of desalination \ntechnology, I anticipate that even a greater amount of the brackish \nwater contained in the Tularosa Basin will be available for human use.\n  Another untapped water supply is the Salt Basin located in southern \nNew Mexico. The Basin lies in a geologically complex area and our \nunderstanding of the total resource is incomplete. However, initial \nestimates predict sustainable withdrawals on the order of 100,000 acre-\nfeet per year of potable water from the New Mexico portion of the \naquifer. This is enough water to support a city the size of our largest \nmunicipal area. Additional brackish resources in that Basin are highly \nlikely. Because the Basin is located near expanding metropolitan areas \nnear the U.S.-Mexico Border, it is a resource of critical importance.\n  The bill I introduce today would direct the United States Geological \nSurvey, in collaboration with the State of New Mexico, to undertake a \ngroundwater resources study in the State of New Mexico. A comprehensive \nstudy of the State's water resources is critical to effective water \nplanning. Absent such a study, I fear that there is a significant \nlikelihood that we may be depleting aquifers at an unsustainable rate.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman for being an original co-sponsor of this \nlegislation. I look forward to working with him to ensure the bill's \npassage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 324\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``New Mexico Aquifer \n     Assessment Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NEW MEXICO WATER RESOURCES STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting \n     through the Director of the United States Geological Survey \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary''), in \n     coordination with the State of New Mexico (referred to in \n     this Act as the ``State'') and any other entities that the \n     Secretary determines to be appropriate (including other \n     Federal agencies and institutions of higher education), \n     shall, in accordance with this Act and any other applicable \n     law, conduct a study of water resources in the State, \n     including--\n       (1) a survey of groundwater resources, including an \n     analysis of--\n       (A) aquifers in the State, including the quantity of water \n     in the aquifers;\n       (B) the availability of groundwater resources for human \n     use;\n       (C) the salinity of groundwater resources;\n       (D) the potential of the groundwater resources to recharge;\n       (E) the interaction between groundwater and surface water;\n       (F) the susceptibility of the aquifers to contamination; \n     and\n       (G) any other relevant criteria; and\n       (2) a characterization of surface and bedrock geology, \n     including the effect of the geology on groundwater yield and \n     quality.\n       (b) Study Areas.--The study carried out under subsection \n     (a) shall include the Estancia Basin, Salt Basin, Tularosa \n     Basin, Hueco Basin, and middle Rio Grande Basin in the State.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives a \n     report that describes the results of the study.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 325. A bill to provide for innovation in heath care through State \ninitiatives that expand coverage and access and improve quality and \nefficiency in the health care system; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with Senator Voinovich entitled the ``Health Partnership \nAct of 2007,'' which along with a companion House bill introduced by \nRepresentatives Tammy Baldwin, John Tierney, and Tom Price, intends to \nset us on a path toward affordable, quality health care for all \nAmericans. The Health Partnership Act creates partnerships between the \nFederal Government, State and local governments, tribes and tribal \norganizations, private payers, and health care providers to seek \ninnovation in health care systems.\n  Under this Act, States, local governments, and tribes and tribal \ngovernments would be invited to submit applications to the Federal \nGovernment for funding to implement expansion and improvements to \ncurrent health programs for review by a bipartisan ``State Health \nInnovation Commission.'' Based on funding available through the Federal \nbudget process, the Commission would approve a variety of reform \noptions and innovative approaches.\n  This federalist approach to health reform would encourage a broad \narray of reform options subject to monitoring, to determine what is and \nis not successful. As Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis wrote in \n1932, ``It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a \nsingle courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a \nlaboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk \nto the rest of the country.''\n  Our bipartisan legislation, the ``Health Partnership Act,'' \nencourages\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\nthis type of State-based innovation and will help the Nation better \naddress both the policy and the politics of health care reform. \nCurrently, we do not have a ``one-size-fits-all'' model of reform, so \nencouraging States, local governments, and tribes to adopt a variety of \napproaches will help us better understand what may or may not work.\n  Inaction on the growing and related problems of the uninsured and \nincreasing health care costs is unacceptable and unconscionable.\n  In fact, while spending on health care in our country has reached $2 \ntrillion annually, the number of uninsured has increased to nearly 47 \nmillion people, seven million more than in 2000. The consequences are \nstaggering, as uninsured citizens get about half the medical care they \nneed compared to those with health insurance and, according to the \nInstitute of Medicine, about 18,000 unnecessary deaths occur each year \nin the U.S. because of lack of health insurance.\n  While gridlock continues to permeate Washington, DC, in regards to \nthis issue, a number of States and local governments are moving ahead \nwith health reform. The ``Health Partnership Act'' would provide \nsupport, in the form of grants, to States, groups of States, local \ngovernments, and Indian tribes and tribal organizations to carry out \nany of a broad range of strategies intended to reduce the number of \nuninsured, reduce costs, and improve the quality of care.\n  Responding to urgent needs, State and local governments have not been \nable to wait for Federal action. We observed this in the early 1990s as \nStates such as New Mexico, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida, Rhode \nIsland, Hawaii, Maryland, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington led the \nway to expanding coverage to children through the enactment of a \nvariety of health reforms. Evaluation proved that some of these \nprograms worked better than others, so the Federal Government took note \nand responded in 1997 with passage of the ``State Children's Health \nInsurance Program'' or SCHIP. This legislation, built upon experiences \nof the States, enjoyed broad bipartisan support. SCHIP is a popular and \nsuccessful State-based model that covers millions of children and \ncontinues to have broad-based bipartisan support across this Nation.\n  So, why not use that successful model and build upon it? In fact, \nState and local governments are already taking up that challenge and \nthe Federal Government should, through the enactment of the ``Health \nPartnership Act,'' do what it can to be helpful with those efforts. For \nexample--\n  On November 15, 2005, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich signed into \nlaw the ``Covering All Kids Health Insurance Act'' which, beginning in \nJuly 2006, intended to make insurance coverage available to all \nuninsured children.\n  In April, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney signed into law \nlegislation that requires all Bay State residents to have health \ninsurance. Their State experiment involves partnerships between the \nState Medicaid, employer groups, and insurance companies.\n  Now California's Governor Schwarzenegger proposes health reform to \ninclude health promotion and wellness services for all, insurance \ncoverage, and cost containment measures.\n  Other States, including New Mexico, Vermont, Tennessee, Maine, West \nVirginia, Oklahoma, and New York have enacted other health reforms that \nhave had mixed success.\n  All of these efforts add importantly to our knowledge base, and can \nthen lead to a national solution to our uninsured and affordability \ncrisis. We can learn from each and every one of these efforts, \nincluding those which failed.\n  Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis said it well by noting that \nState-based reforms, such as that passed in Massachusetts, are very \ngood news. As she notes, ``First, any substantive effort to expand \naccess to coverage is worthwhile, given the growing number of uninsured \nin this country and the large body of evidence showing the dangerous \nhealth implications of lacking coverage.''\n  She adds, ``But something more important is at work here. While we \nurgently need a national solution so that all Americans have insurance, \nit doesn't appear that we'll be getting one at the Federal level any \ntime soon. So what Massachusetts has done potentially holds lessons for \nevery State.'' I would add that it holds lessons for the Federal \nGovernment as well and not just for the mechanics of implementing \nhealth reform policy but also to the politics of health reform.\n  As she concludes, ``One particularly cogent lesson is the manner in \nwhich the measure was crafted--via a civil process that successfully \nbrought together numerous players from across the political business, \nhealth care delivery, and policy sectors.''\n  Senator Voinovich and I have worked together and reached out to like \nminded colleagues in the House of Representatives via a process much \nlike that described by Karen Davis. The legislation stems from past \nlegislative efforts by Senators such as Bob Graham, Mark Hatfield, and \nPaul Wellstone, but also from work across ideological lines by Henry \nAaron of the Brookings Institution and Stuart Butler of the Heritage \nFoundation.\n  The legislation also benefits from advice and support from health \ncare providers. Dr. Tim Garson who, as Dean of the University of \nVirginia, brought a much needed provider perspective, ensuring support \nfrom the House of Medicine. Supporters include the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College \nof Physicians, the American College of Cardiology, American \nGastroenterological Association, the Visiting Nurses Association, the \nNational Association of Community Health Centers, and from state-based \nhealth providers such as the New Mexico Medical Society and Ohio \nAssociation of Community Health Centers.\n  The Health Partnership Act supports providers.\n  The Health Partnership Act received much comment and support from \nconsumer-based groups advocating for national health reform, including \nthat by Dr. Ken Frisof of the Universal Health Care Action Network, \nBill Vaughan at Consumers Union, and from numerous health care \nadvocates in New Mexico, including Community Action New Mexico, Health \nAction New Mexico, Health Care for All Campaign of New Mexico, New \nMexico Center on Law and Poverty, New Mexico Health Choices Initiative, \nNew Mexico POZ Coalition, New Mexico Public Health Association, New \nMexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, New Mexico \nProgressive Alliance for Community Empowerment, and the Health Security \nfor New Mexicans Campaign, which includes 115 State-based \norganizations.\n  The Health Partnership Act supports consumers.\n  Support from stakeholders throughout our Nation's health care system \nhas been sought and I would like to thank the many organizations from \nNew Mexico for their support and input to this legislation. There is \ngreat urgency in New Mexico because our State, like all of those along \nthe U.S.-Mexico border, faces a severe health care crisis. Over one in \nfive New Mexicans does not have insurance coverage. In fact, only one \nState, Texas, has more uninsured. New Mexico is also the only State in \nthe country with greater than half of its population covered by State \nor federally funded health programs.\n  A rather shocking statistic, which also continues to worsen, is that \none out of every three Hispanic citizens are uninsured. In fact, less \nthan 41 percent of the Hispanic population now has employer-based \ncoverage nationwide, which is in sharp comparison to the 66 percent of \nnon-Hispanic whites who have employer-based coverage.\n  Because so few New Mexicans have employer-based health insurance, the \nState of New Mexico has enacted its own health reform plan called the \nState Coverage Initiative, or SCI, in July 2005. SCI is a public/\nprivate partnership intended to expand employer-sponsored insurance, \ndeveloped in part with grant funding from the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation. As of December 2006, there were 4,256 people covered by \nthis initiative and there are efforts to expand this effort to cover \nover 20,000 individuals. With Federal support for my State, the hope \nwould be to further expand coverage to as many New Mexicans as \npossible.\n  The Health Partnership Act encourages reforms at both the state and \nlocal levels of government. Senator Voinovich, as former mayor of \nCleveland, suggested language that would capture community-based \nefforts as well. Illinois, Georgia, Michigan, and\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\nOregon have all initiated efforts at the local level for reform, \nincluding so-called ``three-share'' programs in Illinois and Michigan. \nUnder these initiatives, employers, employees, and the community each \npick up about one-third of the cost of programs.\n  Jeaneane Smith, deputy administrator in the Office of Oregon Health \nPolicy and Research was recently quoted by an Academy Health \npublication stating, ``In recent years it has become apparent that \nthere is a need to consider both state- and community-level approaches \nto improved access. We want to learn how best to support communities as \nthey play an integral part in addressing the gaps in coverage.''\n  The Health Partnership Act supports communities.\n  Our hope is to spawn innovation. Brookings Institution senior health \nfellow Henry Aaron and Heritage Foundation vice president Stuart Butler \nwrote a Health Affairs article in March 2004 that lays out the \nfoundation for this legislative effort. They argue that while we remain \nunable to reconcile how best to expand coverage at the Federal level, \nwe can agree to support states in their efforts to try widely differing \nsolutions to health coverage, cost containment, and quality \nimprovement. As they write, ``this approach offers both a way to \nimprove knowledge about how to reform health care and a practical way \nto initiate a process of reform. Such a pluralist approach respects the \nreal, abiding differences in politics, preferences, traditions, and \ninstitutions across the nation. It also implies a willingness to accept \ndifferences over an extended period in order to make progress. And it \nrecognizes that permitting wide diversity can foster consensus by \nrevealing the strengths and exposing the weaknesses of rival \napproaches.''\n  In addition to Dr. Garson, Mr. Aaron, Mr. Butler, and Dr. Frisof, I \nwould like to express my appreciation to Dan Hawkins at the National \nAssociation of Community Health Centers, Bill Vaughan at Consumers \nUnion, and both Jack Meyer and Stan Dorn at ESRI for their counsel and \nguidance on health reform and this legislation.\n  I would also like to commend the American College of Physicians, or \nACP, for their outstanding leadership on the issue of the uninsured and \nfor their willingness to support a variety of efforts to expand health \ncoverage. ACP has been a longstanding advocate for expanding health \ncoverage and has authored landmark reports on the important role that \nhealth insurance has in reducing people's morbidity and mortality. In \nfact, to cite the conclusion of one of those studies, ``Lack of \ninsurance contributes to the endangerment of the health of each \nuninsured American as well as the collective health of the Nation.''\n  And finally, I would also thank the many people at the Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation on their forethought and knowledge on all the issues \nconfronting the uninsured. Their efforts to continue the dialogue on \nthe uninsured has successfully kept the issue alive for many years.\n  I urge my colleagues to break the gridlock and support this \nlegislation, which offers financial support to states, communities, \nproviders, and consumers, as they adopt important innovations in \nhealthcare coverage and expansion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 325\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To achieve such goal, the State plan shall comply \n     with the following:\n       (A) Coverage.--With respect to coverage, the State plan \n     shall--\n       (i) provide and describe the manner in which the State will \n     ensure that an increased number of individuals residing \n     within the State will have expanded access to health care \n     coverage with a specific 5-year target for reduction in the \n     number of uninsured individuals through either private or \n     public program expansion, or both, in accordance with the \n     options established by the Commission;\n       (ii) describe the number and percentage of current \n     uninsured individuals who will achieve coverage under the \n     State health program;\n       (iii) describe the minimum benefits package that will be \n     provided to all classes of beneficiaries under the State \n     health program;\n       (iv) identify Federal, State, or local and private programs \n     that currently provide health care services in the State and \n     describe how such programs could be coordinated with the \n     State health program, to the extent practicable; and\n       (v) provide for improvements in the availability of \n     appropriate health care services that will increase access to \n     care in urban, rural, and frontier areas of the State with \n     medically underserved populations or where there is an \n     inadequate supply of health care providers.\n       (B) Quality.--With respect to quality, the State plan \n     shall--\n       (i) provide a plan to improve health care quality in the \n     State, including increasing effectiveness, efficiency, \n     timeliness, patient focused, equity while reducing health \n     disparities, and medical errors; and\n       (ii) contain appropriate results-based quality indicators \n     established by the Commission that will be addressed by the \n     State as well as State-specific quality indicators.\n       (C) Costs.--With respect to costs, the State plan shall--\n       (i) provide that the State will develop and implement \n     systems to improve the efficiency of health care, including a \n     specific 5-year target for reducing administrative costs \n     (including paperwork burdens);\n       (ii) describe the public and private sector financing to be \n     provided for the State health program;\n       (iii) estimate the amount of Federal, State, and local \n     expenditures, as well as, the costs to business and \n     individuals under the State health program;\n       (iv) describe how the State plan will ensure the financial \n     solvency of the State health program; and\n       (v) provide that the State will prepare and submit to the \n     Secretary and the Commission such reports as the Secretary or \n     Commission may require to carry out program evaluations.\n       (D) Health information technology.--With respect to health \n     information technology, the State plan shall provide \n     methodology for the appropriate use of health information \n     technology to improve infrastructure, such as improving the \n     availability of evidence-based medical and outcomes data to \n     providers and patients, as well as other health information \n     (such as electronic health records, electronic billing, and \n     electronic prescribing).\n       (2) Technical assistance.--The Secretary shall, if \n     requested, provide technical assistance to States to assist \n     such States in developing applications and plans under this \n     section, including technical assistance by private sector \n     entities if determined appropriate by the Commission.\n       (3) Initial review.--With respect to a State application \n     for a grant under subsection (b), the Secretary and the \n     Commission shall complete an initial review of such State \n     application within 60 days of the receipt of such \n     application, analyze the scope of the proposal, and determine \n     whether additional information is needed from the State. The \n     Commission shall advise the State within such period of the \n     need to submit additional information.\n       (4) Final determination.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 90 days after completion of \n     the initial review under paragraph (3), the Commission shall \n     determine whether to submit a State proposal to Congress for \n     approval.\n       (B) Voting.--\n       (i) In general.--The determination to submit a State \n     proposal to Congress under subparagraph (A) shall be approved \n     by \\2/3\\ of the members of the Commission who are eligible to \n     participate in such determination subject to clause (ii).\n       (ii) Eligibility.--A member of the Commission shall not \n     participate in a determination under subparagraph (A) if--\n\n       (I) in the case of a member who is a Governor, such \n     determination relates to the State of which the member is the \n     Governor; or\n       (II) in the case of member not described in subclause (I), \n     such determination relates to the geographic area of a State \n     of which such member serves as a State or local official.\n\n       (C) Submission.--Not later than 90 days prior to October 1 \n     of each fiscal year, the Commission shall submit to Congress \n     a list, in the form of a legislative proposal, of the State \n     applications that the Commission recommends for approval \n     under this section.\n       (D) Approval.--With respect to a fiscal year, a State \n     proposal that has been recommended under subparagraph (B) \n     shall be deemed to be approved, and subject to the \n     availability of appropriations, Federal funds shall be \n     provided to such program, unless a joint resolution has been \n     enacted disapproving such proposal as provided for in\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\n     subsection (e). Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be \n     construed to include the approval of State proposals that \n     involve waivers or modifications in applicable Federal law.\n       (5) Program or project period.--A State program or project \n     may be approved for a period of 5 years and may be extended \n     for subsequent 5-year periods upon approval by the Commission \n     and the Secretary, based upon achievement of targets, except \n     that a shorter period may be requested by a State and granted \n     by the Secretary.\n       (e) Expedited Congressional Consideration.--\n       (1) Introduction and committee consideration.--\n       (A) Introduction.--The legislative proposal submitted \n     pursuant to subsection (d)(4)(B) shall be in the form of a \n     joint resolution (in this subsection referred to as the \n     ``resolution''). Such resolution shall be introduced in the \n     House of Representatives by the Speaker, and in the Senate, \n     by the Majority Leader, immediately upon receipt of the \n     language and shall be referred to the appropriate committee \n     of Congress. If the resolution is not introduced in \n     accordance with the preceding sentence, the resolution may be \n     introduced in either House of Congress by any member thereof.\n       (B) Committee consideration.--A resolution introduced in \n     the House of Representatives shall be referred to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives. \n     A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred to \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate. Not later than 15 \n     calendar days after the introduction of the resolution, the \n     committee of Congress to which the resolution was referred \n     shall report the resolution or a committee amendment thereto. \n     If the committee has not reported such resolution (or an \n     identical resolution) at the end of 15 calendar days after \n     its introduction or at the end of the first day after there \n     has been reported to the House involved a resolution, \n     whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be \n     discharged from further consideration of such reform bill and \n     such reform bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.\n       (2) Expedited procedure.--\n       (A) Consideration.--Not later than 5 days after the date on \n     which a committee has been discharged from consideration of a \n     resolution, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or \n     the Speaker's designee, or the Majority Leader of the Senate, \n     or the Leader's designee, shall move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the committee amendment to the resolution, \n     and if there is no such amendment, to the resolution. It \n     shall also be in order for any member of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, respectively, to move to \n     proceed to the consideration of the resolution at any time \n     after the conclusion of such 5-day period. All points of \n     order against the resolution (and against consideration of \n     the resolution) are waived. A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the resolution is highly privileged in the \n     House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and \n     is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, to \n     a motion to postpone consideration of the resolution, or to a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion to proceed \n     is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in order. If the \n     motion to proceed is agreed to, the House of Representatives \n     or the Senate, as the case may be, shall immediately proceed \n     to consideration of the resolution without intervening \n     motion, order, or other business, and the resolution shall \n     remain the unfinished business of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, until \n     disposed of.\n       (B) Consideration by other house.--If, before the passage \n     by one House of the resolution that was introduced in such \n     House, such House receives from the other House a resolution \n     as passed by such other House--\n       (i) the resolution of the other House shall not be referred \n     to a committee and may only be considered for final passage \n     in the House that receives it under clause (iii);\n       (ii) the procedure in the House in receipt of the \n     resolution of the other House, with respect to the resolution \n     that was introduced in the House in receipt of the resolution \n     of the other House, shall be the same as if no resolution had \n     been received from the other House; and\n       (iii) notwithstanding clause (ii), the vote on final \n     passage shall be on the reform bill of the other House.\n     Upon disposition of a resolution that is received by one \n     House from the other House, it shall no longer be in order to \n     consider the resolution bill that was introduced in the \n     receiving House.\n       (C) Consideration in conference.--Immediately upon a final \n     passage of the resolution that results in a disagreement \n     between the two Houses of Congress with respect to the \n     resolution, conferees shall be appointed and a conference \n     convened. Not later than 10 days after the date on which \n     conferees are appointed, the conferees shall file a report \n     with the House of Representatives and the Senate resolving \n     the differences between the Houses on the resolution. \n     Notwithstanding any other rule of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, it shall be in order to \n     immediately consider a report of a committee of conference on \n     the resolution filed in accordance with this subclause. \n     Debate in the House of Representatives and the Senate on the \n     conference report shall be limited to 10 hours, equally \n     divided and controlled by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives or their designees and the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders of the Senate or their designees. A vote on \n     final passage of the conference report shall occur \n     immediately at the conclusion or yielding back of all time \n     for debate on the conference report.\n       (3) Rules of the senate and house of representatives.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed to \n     be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution, and it supersedes \n     other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with \n     such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n       (4) Limitation.--The amount of Federal funds provided with \n     respect to any State proposal that is deemed approved under \n     subsection (d)(3) shall not exceed the cost provided for such \n     proposals within the concurrent resolution on the budget as \n     enacted by Congress for the fiscal year involved.\n       (f) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall provide a grant to a \n     State that has an application approved under subsection (b) \n     to enable such State to carry out an innovative State health \n     program in the State.\n       (2) Amount of grant.--The amount of a grant provided to a \n     State under paragraph (1) shall be determined based upon the \n     recommendations of the Commission, subject to the amount \n     appropriated under subsection (k).\n       (3) Performance-based funding allocation and \n     prioritization.--In awarding grants under paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary shall--\n       (A) fund a diversity of approaches as provided for by the \n     Commission in subsection (c)(1)(B);\n       (B) give priority to those State programs that the \n     Commission determines have the greatest opportunity to \n     succeed in providing expanded health insurance coverage and \n     in providing children, youth, and other vulnerable \n     populations with improved access to health care items and \n     services; and\n       (C) link allocations to the State to the meeting of the \n     goals and performance measures relating to health care \n     coverage, quality, and health care costs established under \n     this Act through the State project application process.\n       (4) Maintenance of effort.--A State, in utilizing the \n     proceeds of a grant received under paragraph (1), shall \n     maintain the expenditures of the State for health care \n     coverage purposes for the support of direct health care \n     delivery at a level equal to not less than the level of such \n     expenditures maintained by the State for the fiscal year \n     preceding the fiscal year for which the grant is received.\n       (5) Report.--At the end of the 5-year period beginning on \n     the date on which the Secretary awards the first grant under \n     paragraph (1), the State Health Innovation Advisory \n     Commission established under subsection (c) shall prepare and \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress, a report on \n     the progress made by States receiving grants under paragraph \n     (1) in meeting the goals of expanded coverage, improved \n     quality, and cost containment through performance measures \n     established during the 5-year period of the grant. Such \n     report shall contain the recommendation of the Commission \n     concerning any future action that Congress should take \n     concerning health care reform, including whether or not to \n     extend the program established under this subsection.\n       (g) Monitoring and Evaluation.--\n       (1) Annual reports and participation by states.--Each State \n     that has received a program approval shall--\n       (A) submit to the Commission an annual report based on the \n     period representing the respective State's fiscal year, \n     detailing compliance with the requirements established by the \n     Commission and the Secretary in the approval and in this \n     section; and\n       (B) participate in the annual meeting under subsection \n     (c)(4)(B).\n       (2) Evaluations by commission.--The Commission, in \n     consultation with a qualified and independent organization \n     such as the Institute of Medicine, shall prepare and submit \n     to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Education \n     and Labor, and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House \n     of Representatives annual reports that shall contain--\n       (A) a description of the effects of the reforms undertaken \n     in States receiving approvals under this section;\n       (B) a description of the recommendations of the Commission \n     and actions taken based on these recommendations;\n       (C) an evaluation of the effectiveness of such reforms in--\n       (i) expanding health care coverage for State residents;\n       (ii) improving the quality of health care provided in the \n     States; and\n       (iii) reducing or containing health care costs in the \n     States;\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\n       (D) recommendations regarding the advisability of \n     increasing Federal financial assistance for State ongoing or \n     future health program initiatives, including the amount and \n     source of such assistance; and\n       (E) as required by the Commission or the Secretary under \n     subsection (f)(5), a periodic, independent evaluation of the \n     program.\n       (h) Noncompliance.--\n       (1) Corrective action plans.--If a State is not in \n     compliance with a requirements of this section, the Secretary \n     shall develop a corrective action plan for such State.\n       (2) Termination.--For good cause and in consultation with \n     the Commission, the Secretary may revoke any program granted \n     under this section.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill my \ncolleague Senator Bingaman and I introduced today, the Health Care \nPartnership Act. For too many years, I have listened to my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle talk about the rising cost of health care \nand the growing number of uninsured Americans. Yet, at the Federal \nlevel we have made little progress toward a solution for improving \naccess to quality, affordable health care. I believe it is the greatest \ndomestic challenge facing our Nation. In fact, the rising cost of \nhealth care is a major part of what is hurting our competitiveness in \nthe global marketplace.\n  While surveys have indicated that health insurance premiums have \nstabilized--a 9.2 percent increase in 2006 the same increase as in 2005 \nand compared with; 12.3 percent in 2004; 14.7 percent in 2003 and 15.2 \npercent in 2002--health insurance costs continue to be a significant \nfactor impacting American competitiveness. In addition, the share of \ncosts that individuals have paid for employer sponsored insurance has \nrisen roughly 2 percent each year, from 31.4 percent of health care \ncosts in 2001 to 38.4 percent this year.\n  In fact, spending on health care in the United States reached $2 \ntrillion in 2005--16 percent of our GDP--the largest share ever.\n  Yet, despite all the spending some 45 million Americans--15 percent \nof the population--had no health insurance at some point last year. \nThis number has increased steadily. In 2000, that number was 39.8 \nmillion. In 2002 it was 43.6 million.\n  These statistics are startling, and it is beyond time that we do \nsomething about them.\n  The bill Senator Bingaman and I are introducing today aims to break \nthe log-jam here in Washington and allows States to experiment the way \nwe did with welfare reform when I was Governor of Ohio. This bill would \nsupport State-based efforts to reduce the uninsured, reduce costs, \nimprove quality, improve access to care, and expand information \ntechnology.\n  I have been in this situation before. As Governor of Ohio, I had to \nwork creatively to expand coverage and deal with increasing health care \ncosts for a growing number of uninsured Ohioans. I am happy to report \nthat we were able to make some progress toward reducing the number of \nuninsured during my time as the head of the State by negotiating with \nthe State unions to move to managed care; by controlling Medicaid costs \nto the point where from 1995 to 1998, due to good stewardship and \nmanagement, Ohio ended up under-spending on Medicaid without harming \nfamilies; and implementing the S-CHIP program to provide coverage for \nuninsured children. In fact, I recently learned from the Cuyahoga \nCommissioners that in our county, 98 percent of eligible children are \ncurrently enrolled in this program.\n  Like we did in Ohio, a number of States are already actively pursuing \nefforts to reduce the number of their residents who lack adequate \nhealth care coverage. This bill will build on the goals of States like \nMassachusetts, California and others, while providing a mechanism to \nanalyze results and make recommendations for future action on the \nFederal level.\n  Under the Health Partnership Act, Congress would authorize grants to \nindividual States, groups of States, and Indian tribes and \norganizations to carry out any of a broad range of strategies to \nimprove our Nation's health\n\n[[Page S702]]\n\ncare delivery. The bill creates a mechanism for States to apply for \ngrants to a bipartisan ``State Health Innovation Commission'' housed at \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, HHS. After reviewing the \nState proposals, the Commission would submit to Congress a list of \nrecommended State applications. The Commission would also recommend the \namount of Federal grant money each State should receive to carry out \nthe actions described in their plan.\n  Most importantly, at the end of the 5-year period, the Commission \nwould be required to report to Congress whether the States are meeting \nthe goals of the act and recommend future action Congress should take \nconcerning overall reform, including whether or not to extend the \nprogram.\n  I believe it is important that we pass this legislation and provide a \nplatform from which we can have a thoughtful conversation about health \ncare reform at the Federal level.\n  Since I have been in the Senate, Congress has made some progress \ntoward improving health care, most notably for our 43 million seniors \nwith the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act.\n  Yet, we have been at this too long here in Washington without \ncomprehensive, meaningful results. It is my hope that we will have \nbipartisan support for this very bipartisan comprehensive bill that I \nhope will move us closer toward a solution to the uninsured.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n        Enzi, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 326. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na special period of limitation when uniformed services retirement pay \nis reduced as result of award of disability compensation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nCraig Thomas, to introduce the Disabled Veterans Tax Fairness Act of \n2007. This much-needed legislation would protect disabled veterans from \nbeing unfairly taxed on the benefits to which they are entitled, simply \nbecause their disability claims were not processed in a timely manner. \nThis legislation is supported by the Military Coalition, a group \nrepresenting more than 5.5 million members of the uniformed services \nand their families.\n  While the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, resolves most of its \nfiled disability claims in less than a year, there are also instances \nof lost paperwork, administrative errors, and appeals of rejected \nclaims that often delay thousands of disability awards for years on \nend. When this occurs, disability compensation is awarded retroactively \nand for tax purposes, a disabled veteran's previously received taxable \nmilitary retiree pay is re-designated as nontaxable disability \ncompensation. Thereby, the disabled veteran is entitled to a refund of \ntaxes paid and must file an amended tax return for each applicable \nyear.\n  However, under current law the IRS Code bars the filing of amended \nreturns beyond the last 3 tax years. As a result, many of our disabled \nveterans are denied the opportunity to file a claim for repayment of \nadditional years of back taxes already paid--through no fault of their \nown--even though the IRS owes them a refund for the taxes that were \noriginally paid on their retiree pay.\n  The Disabled Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2007 would add an exception \nto the IRS statute of limitations for amending returns. This exception \nwould allow disabled veterans whose disability claims have been pending \nfor more than 3 years to receive refunds on previous taxes paid for up \nto 5 years--the length of time the IRS keeps these records. Affected \nveterans would have 1 year from the date the VA determination is issued \nto go back and amend previous years' tax returns.\n  My father and grandfather both served our Nation in uniform and they \ntaught me from an early age about the sacrifices our troops and their \nfamilies have made to keep our Nation free. This is particularly true \nfor our disabled veterans. During a time when a grateful nation should \nbe doing everything it can to honor those who have sacrificed so \ngreatly on our behalf, the very least it can do is ensure they and \ntheir families are not unjustly penalized simply because of \nbureaucratic inefficiencies or administrative delays which are beyond \ntheir control. This situation is unacceptable and our veterans deserve \nbetter.\n  That is why I am proud to reintroduce this legislation today to \nprovide relief to our Nation's veterans. It is the least we can do for \nthose whom we owe so much, and it is the least we can do to reassure \nfuture generations that a grateful nation will not forget them when \ntheir military service is complete.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 327. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of sites associated with the life of Cesar \nEstrada Chavez and the farm labor movement; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nSalazar in reintroducing the Cesar Estrada Chavez Study Act. A similar \nversion of this bill was introduced by Congresswoman Hilda Solis last \nweek. This legislation, which is identical to the bill we introduced in \nthe 109th Congress and passed the Senate by unanimous consent during \nthe 108th Congress, would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nconduct a special resource study of sites associated with the life of \nCesar Chavez. The bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to \ndetermine whether any of the sites significant to Chavez's life meet \nthe criteria for being listed on the National Register of Historic \nLandmarks. The goal of this legislation is to establish a foundation \nfor future legislation that would then designate land for the \nappropriate sites to become historic landmarks.\n  Mr. Chavez's legacy is an inspiration to us all and he will be \nremembered for helping Americans to transcend distinctions of \nexperience and share equally in the rights and responsibilities of \nfreedom. It is important that we honor his struggle and do what we can \nto preserve appropriate landmarks that are significant to his life. \nThis legislation has received an overwhelming positive response, not \nonly from my fellow Arizonans, but from Americans all across the \nNation. It has also received an endorsement from the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus.\n  Cesar Chavez, an Arizonan born in Yuma, was the son of migrant farm \nworkers. While his formal education ended in the eighth grade, his \ninsatiable intellectual curiosity and determination helped make him \nknown as one of the great American leaders for his successes in \nensuring migrant farm workers were treated fairly and honestly. His \nefforts on behalf of some of the most oppressed individuals in our \nsociety is an inspiration, and through his work he made America a \nbigger and better nation.\n  While Chavez and his family migrated across the southwest looking for \nfarm work, he evolved into a advocate of migrant farm workers. He \nfounded the National Farm Workers Association in 1962, which later \nbecame the United Farm Workers of America. He gave a voice to those who \nhad no voice. In his words, ``We cannot seek achievement for ourselves \nand forget about progress and prosperity for our community . . . our \nambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of \nothers, for their sakes and for our own.''\n  Cesar Chavez was a humble man of deep conviction who understood what \nit meant to serve and sacrifice for others.

Res. 31\n\n       Whereas, in September 2000, the people of Serbia fought for \n     democracy by going to the streets to hold protests and \n     rallies until President Slobodan Milosevic was removed from \n     power and the Government of Serbia was handed over to \n     democratic forces;\n       Whereas, in the following years, the democratic leadership \n     of Serbia worked to establish a democratic society, \n     functional rule of law, a free market economy, and respect \n     for human and minority rights;\n       Whereas the President of Serbia, Boris Tadic, has expressed \n     publicly his commitment to the principles of democracy and \n     the dream of leading Serbia forward on this path;\n       Whereas Serbia is a member of several international \n     organizations and has voiced its desire to become a member of \n     the European Union (EU);\n       Whereas Serbia has enacted several military and defense \n     reforms to strengthen ties to its Western allies and the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Alliance;\n       Whereas, on September 7, 2006, Serbia signed a Status of \n     Forces Agreement with the United States Government to \n     facilitate Serbia's participation in joint military exercises \n     and training;\n       Whereas, on September 8, 2006, President Tadic commemorated \n     the beginning of Serbia's participation in the National Guard \n     State Partnership Program with the Ohio National Guard;\n       Whereas, on December 14, 2006, Serbia was granted accession \n     to the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) program, along with \n     its neighbors, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, \n     initiating formal cooperation between NATO and Serbia;\n       Whereas Serbia has transferred 36 individuals indicted for \n     war crimes to the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia (ICTY), including Milosevic and some of his \n     top officials, and provided thousands of documents to the \n     Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY;\n       Whereas Serbia has taken some additional steps, under the \n     supervision of the ICTY and the international community, to \n     enact judicial reforms and establish special courts to try \n     individuals indicted for war crimes in Kosovo, Bosnia, and \n     Croatia;\n       Whereas Serbia has failed to arrest war criminal Ratko \n     Mladic for the horrific crimes he committed at Srebrenica in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, which prevented Serbia's earlier \n     participation in the PfP program and its progression in EU \n     accession talks;\n       Whereas, on January 21, 2007, Serbia will hold democratic \n     parliamentary elections to determine Serbia's future \n     leadership at this critical juncture in Serbia's history;\n       Whereas Albanian parties in southern Serbia will \n     participate in the parliamentary elections for the first time \n     in over 15 years; and\n       Whereas a strong, stable, and democratic Serbia is critical \n     to the future of the region: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should be committed to a strong \n     relationship with a democratic Serbia as Serbia moves toward \n     its goals of membership in the European Union (EU) and \n     cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation \n     (NATO);\n       (2) the inclusion of Serbia in the NATO Partnership for \n     Peace Program was a critical step in bringing Serbia closer \n     to the Euro-Atlantic Alliance;\n       (3) Serbia will now have the opportunity to enact defense \n     reforms and apply for a Membership Action Plan for NATO;\n       (4) Serbia should continue its progress on reform, \n     including defense and judiciary reforms and reforms in the \n     area of human and minority rights;\n       (5) Serbia should move quickly to fulfill its obligations \n     to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \n     Yugoslavia, including by immediately arresting Ratko Mladic \n     and transferring him to the Hague because this step is \n     essential for Serbia to be admitted into the EU and NATO;\n       (6) as Serbia continues to work toward integration in Euro-\n     Atlantic institutions, the United States should continue and \n     increase its defense and security cooperation with the \n     Government of Serbia, including through education, training, \n     and technical cooperation, to assist Serbia in the reform \n     process and in fulfilling the requirements for membership in \n     NATO; and\n       (7) the United States should remain a friend to the people \n     of Serbia as they continue on the path of democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S703-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 32--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                  SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following \nresolution;

Con. Res. 2\n\n       Whereas the United States strategy and presence on the \n     ground in Iraq can only be sustained with the support of the \n     American people and bipartisan support from Congress;\n       Whereas maximizing chances of success in Iraq should be our \n     goal, and the best chance\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\n     of success requires a change in current strategy;\n       Whereas the situation in Iraq is damaging the standing, \n     influence, and interests of the United States in Iraq, the \n     Middle East, and around the world;\n       Whereas more than 137,000 United States military personnel \n     are bravely and honorably serving in Iraq and deserve the \n     support of all Americans;\n       Whereas more than 3,000 United States military personnel \n     have already lost their lives in Iraq, and more than 22,500 \n     have been wounded in Iraq;\n       Whereas on January 10, 2007, President George W. Bush \n     announced his plan to deepen the United States military \n     involvement in Iraq by deploying approximately 21,000 \n     additional United States combat forces to Iraq;\n       Whereas Iraq is witnessing widening sectarian and intra-\n     sectarian violence;\n       Whereas Iraqis must reach a political settlement if there \n     is going to be a reconciliation in Iraq, and the failure of \n     the Iraqis to achieve such a settlement has led to the \n     increase in violence in Iraq;\n       Whereas Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006, that ``[t]he crisis is political, and the \n     ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting \n     of innocents are the politicians.'';\n       Whereas an open-ended commitment of United States forces in \n     Iraq is unsustainable and a deterrent to the Iraqis making \n     the political compromises and providing the personnel and \n     resources that are needed for violence to end and for \n     stability and security to be achieved in Iraq;\n       Whereas the responsibility for internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence in Iraq must rest primarily with \n     the Government of Iraq and Iraqi security forces;\n       Whereas there have been repeated promises by the Government \n     of Iraq to assume a greater share of security \n     responsibilities, disband militias, consider amendments to \n     the Iraq constitution, enact laws to reconcile sectarian \n     differences, and improve the quality of life for the Iraqi \n     people, but those promises have not been kept;\n       Whereas a successful strategy in Iraq is dependent upon the \n     Iraqi leaders fulfilling their promises;\n       Whereas the commander of the United States Central Command, \n     General John Abizaid, testified to Congress on November 15, \n     2006, that ``[i]t's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do \n     this work. I believe that more American forces prevent the \n     Iraqis from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future'';\n       Whereas the Iraq Study Group suggested a comprehensive \n     strategy to ``enable the United States to begin to move its \n     combat forces out of Iraq responsibly'' based on ``new and \n     enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the \n     region'';\n       Whereas the United States Army and Marine Corps, including \n     their Reserves and the Army National Guard, their personnel, \n     and their families, are under enormous strain from multiple, \n     extended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the majority of nondeployed Army and Marine Corps \n     units are no longer combat ready due to a lack of equipment \n     and insufficient time to train; and\n       Whereas the United States strategy in Iraq must not \n     compromise the ability of the United States to address other \n     vital national security priorities, in particular global \n     terror networks, proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, regional stability in the Middle East, the \n     nuclear program of Iran, the nuclear weapons of North Korea, \n     and stability and security in Afghanistan: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is not in the national interest of the United States \n     to deepen its military involvement in Iraq, particularly by \n     escalating the United States military force presence in Iraq;\n       (2) the primary objective of United States strategy in Iraq \n     should be to have the Iraqi political leaders make the \n     political compromises necessary to end the violence in Iraq;\n       (3) greater concerted regional, and international support \n     would assist the Iraqis in achieving a political solution and \n     national reconciliation;\n       (4) main elements of the mission of United States forces in \n     Iraq should transition to helping ensure the territorial \n     integrity of Iraq, conduct counterterrorism activities, \n     reduce regional interference in the internal affairs of Iraq, \n     and accelerate training of Iraqi troops;\n       (5) the United States should transfer, under an \n     appropriately expedited timeline, responsibility for internal \n     security and halting sectarian violence in Iraq to the \n     Government of Iraq and Iraqi security forces; and\n       (6) the United States should engage nations in the Middle \n     East to develop a regional, internationally-sponsored peace \n     and reconciliation process for Iraq.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, Senator Hagel, Senator Levin, and I \nare submitting a bipartisan resolution that opposes the President's \nplan to escalate the war in Iraq.\n  This resolution says what we and many of our colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans, are against: deepening America's military involvement \nin Iraq by escalating our troop presence.\n  Just as important, it says what we and many of our colleagues are \nfor: a strategy that can produce a political settlement in Iraq.\n  That's the only way to stop Shiites and Sunnis from killing each \nother and allow our troops to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\n  Last week, when Secretary of State Rice presented the President's \nplan to escalate our troop presence in Iraq to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the reaction from Democrats and Republicans alike ranged \nfrom profound skepticism to outright opposition.\n  This resolution will give every Senator a chance to say where he or \nshe stands on the President's plan.\n  I believe that when a President goes way off course on something as \nimportant as Iraq, the single most effective way to get him to change \ncourse is to demonstrate that his policy has waning or no support--from \nboth parties.\n  The more we make Iraq a partisan issue, the more the President is \nlikely to dig in. The more we show that Americans across the board \ndon't want to go down the path of escalation, the better our chance to \nstop it.\n  Iraq is not a partisan issue. It's a challenge we must meet as \nAmericans.\n  The very first sentence of our resolution says something the three of \nus believe profoundly: ``U.S. strategy and presence on the ground in \nIraq can only be sustained with the support of the American people and \nthe bipartisan support of Congress.''\n  This resolution will demonstrate that, right now, the support is not \nthere for the President's policy in Iraq. The sooner he recognizes that \nreality and acts on it, the better off all of us will be.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, we have before us one of the most important \nissues that has ever faced our country, certainly in modern times. The \nfuture of Iraq will affect the United States, the Middle East, and the \nworld for decades to come.\n  No one in Congress and no one in the United States wants to see \nAmerica humiliated, defeated, or in any way lose its purpose. The issue \nof Iraq involves all of us. The Congress of the United States must have \na role to play.\n  Our responsibility is to join together in a bipartisan effort to work \nto develop a consensus to deal with the great challenges of our time. I \nknow of no challenge that is greater today, before this country, than \nIraq. When a Nation commits its men and women to war, it is the \ngreatest challenge that any of us will ever deal with in our time in \nthe Congress.\n  We owe it to the American people to help find a bipartisan consensus \nof purpose, to help develop a policy worthy of our men and women in \nuniform. The American people not only deserve but they expect a \nconsensus. This resolution is not about trying to assign blame on the \nAdministration. It is not about replaying past mistakes. This \nresolution is about moving forward. It is difficult but it is our \nresponsibility.\n  Some of us believe that the course that the President announced \nWednesday was not the appropriate course. I do not believe that the \nUnited States should be sending more American troops into the middle of \nthe tribal, sectarian civil war that is occurring in Iraq.\n  Senators Biden, Levin, and I have focused personally on writing this \nresolution because we felt it must reflect a responsible, forward-\nlooking, and constructive approach. We must remain focused on a \nstrategy which seeks to advance America's national interests and allow \nAmerica to leave Iraq honorably.\n  The American people look to its government for responsible policy. A \npolicy that can be sustained. A policy that reflects a clear consensus \nof purpose regarding our objectives, our strategy and our policies. \nThis is what our resolution seeks to achieve.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the primary objective of the bipartisan \nresolution my colleagues and I are introducing today is to convince a \nbipartisan majority of Senators to oppose deeper military involvement \nin Iraq by the United States and to get the Iraqis to reach a political \nsettlement among themselves as the only way to end the violence in \nIraq.\n  The resolution would send a clear message that Congress does not \nsupport the plan to increase the number of U.S. troops in Iraq because \nit is based on the false premise that there is a\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\nmilitary solution to the violence and instability in Iraq, when what is \nneeded is a political solution among the Iraqi leaders and factions.\n  Iraq's own Prime Minister Maliki acknowledged recently that ``The \ncrisis is political, and the ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation \nand bloodletting of innocents are the politicians.''\n  The resolution states that it is not in the national security \ninterests of the United States to deepen our military involvement in \nIraq by increasing the number of U.S. troops.\n  The resolution calls for the transition of our military mission in \nIraq to a more limited one of training, counterterrorism, and \nprotecting the territorial integrity of Iraq. It also calls for greater \nengagement of other countries in the region in the stabilization and \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  Last week the President said that he had made clear to Iraq's leaders \nthat America's commitment is not open-ended. I welcome these words. But \nthe reality behind the President's new rhetoric is that the open-ended \ncommitment continues--more American military men and women would be \nsent into the chaos of Iraq's sectarian violence without condition or \nlimitation.\n  President Bush also indicated that the Iraqi government needs \n``breathing space'' to make political progress. The opposite is true. \nThe Iraqi leaders don't need breathing space--they must feel real \npressure to reach a political settlement. Increasing our military \npresence in Iraq takes more pressure off. The Iraq Study Group put it \nthis way last month: ``An open-ended commitment of American forces \nwould not provide the Iraqi government the incentive it needs to take \nthe political actions that give Iraq its best chance of quelling \nsectarian violence.''\n  President Bush also said that the Iraqis have set benchmarks for \nthemselves. But look at the track record of the Iraqi government in \nmeeting some of its past benchmarks and promises: Iraqi President \nTalibani said in August 2006 that Iraqi forces would ``take over \nsecurity in all Iraqi provinces by the end of 2006.'' That pledge has \nnot been kept. Prime Minister Maliki said last June that he would \ndisband the militias and illegal armed groups as part of his national \nreconciliation plan, and in October he set the timetable for disbanding \nthe militias as the end of 2006. That commitment has not been kept. The \nIraqi Constitutional Review Commission was to present its \nrecommendations for changes in the Constitution to the Council of \nRepresentatives within four months of the formation of the Government \nlast May. The Commission has yet to formulate any recommendations. \nPrime Minister Maliki put forward a series of reconciliation milestones \nto be completed by the end of 2006 or early 2007, including approval of \nthe Provincial Election Law, the Petroleum Law, a new De-Baathification \nLaw, and the Militia Law. Not one of these laws has been enacted. The \nIraqi army pledged six battalions in support of American and Coalition \nefforts during Operation Forward Together last summer. In fact, Iraqis \nprovided only two battalions.\n  This is not a track record that inspires confidence in Iraqi pledges \nand commitments.\n  The President said that ``America will hold the Iraqi government to \nthe benchmarks it has announced.'' How did the President say we are \ngoing to do that? What will the consequences be if the Iraqis continue \nto fail to meet these benchmarks, particularly since some of them have \nbeen established and missed in the past? The President said ``If the \nIraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose \nthe support of the American people . . . '' That is an empty threat \ngiven the fact that the Iraqi Government has already lost the support \nof the American people, and it hasn't affected their behavior. The \nPresident's most recent plan, like previous ones, includes no mechanism \nto hold the Iraqis to their commitments.\n  Just two months ago General Abizaid testified before our Committee \nagainst increasing the number of U.S. troops in Iraq. He told us: ``I \nmet with every divisional commander, General Casey, the corps \ncommander, General Dempsey. We all talked together. And I said, in your \nprofessional opinion, if we were to bring in more American troops now, \ndoes it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq? And \nthey all said no. And the reason is, because we want the Iraqis to do \nmore. It's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us do this work. I believe \nthat more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from \ntaking more responsibility for their own future.''\n  Deepening our involvement in Iraq would be a mistake. Deepening our \ninvolvement in Iraq on the assumption that the Iraqis will meet future \nbenchmarks and commitments given their track record would compound the \nmistake.\n  For America to supply more troops while the Iraqi leaders simply \nsupply more promises is not a recipe for success in Iraq. Telling the \nIraqis that we will increase our troops to give them yet more breathing \nspace will only postpone the day when Iraqis take their future into \ntheir own hands and decide whether they want to continue to fight a \ncivil war or make peace among themselves.\n  This resolution does not limit any future course of action that \nCongress may decide to take. What it would do is send a powerful \nmessage to the President and the Iraqis that Congress does not support \nan escalation of our military presence in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S705-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S705-S706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 3--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n  IT IS THE GOAL OF THE UNITED STATES THAT, NOT LATER THAN JANUARY 1, \n2025, THE AGRICULTURAL, FORESTRY, AND WORKING LAND OF THE UNITED STATES \nSHOULD PROVIDE FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES NOT LESS THAN 25 PERCENT OF THE \n  TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUE TO PRODUCE \n          SAFE, ABUNDANT, AND AFFORDABLE FOOD, FEED, AND FIBER\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nObama, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Thune, Mr. \nNelson of Nebraska, Mr. Brownback, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Allard, Mr. Kohl, \nMr. Menendez, Mr. Tester, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Brown, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Cochran) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 3\n\n       Whereas the United States has a quantity of renewable \n     energy resources that is sufficient to supply a significant \n     portion of the energy needs of the United States;\n       Whereas the agricultural, forestry, and working land of the \n     United States can help ensure a sustainable domestic energy \n     system;\n       Whereas accelerated development and use of renewable energy \n     technologies provide numerous benefits to the United States, \n     including improved national security, improved balance of \n     payments, healthier rural economies, improved environmental \n     quality, and abundant, reliable, and affordable energy for \n     all citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas the production of transportation fuels from \n     renewable energy would help the United States meet rapidly \n     growing domestic and global energy demands, reduce the \n     dependence of the United States on energy imported from \n     volatile regions of the world that are politically unstable, \n     stabilize the cost and availability of energy, and safeguard \n     the economy and security of the United States;\n       Whereas increased energy production from domestic renewable \n     resources would attract substantial new investments in energy \n     infrastructure, create economic growth, develop new jobs for \n     the citizens of the United States, and increase the income \n     for farm, ranch, and forestry jobs in the rural regions of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas increased use of renewable energy is practical and \n     can be cost effective with the implementation of supportive \n     policies and proper incentives to stimulate markets and \n     infrastructure; and\n       Whereas public policies aimed at enhancing renewable energy \n     production and accelerating technological improvements will \n     further reduce energy costs over time and increase market \n     demand: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that it is the \n     goal of the United States that, not later than January 1, \n     2025, the agricultural, forestry, and working land of the \n     United States should provide from renewable resources not \n     less than 25 percent of the total energy consumed in the \n     United States and continue to produce safe, abundant, and \n     affordable food, feed, and fiber.\n\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today Senator Grassley and I, along with \nour colleagues Senators Harkin, Lugar, Obama, Hagel, and others, are \nsubmitting Senate Concurrent Resolution 3, the ``25x'25'' Resolution, \nas we did last year, 25x'25 is a critical vision for our energy future \nthat will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil by building a new \nenergy economy here at home. Our resolution establishes a national goal \nof producing 25 percent of America's energy from renewable sources--\nlike solar, wind and biofuels--by 2025.\n  The ``25x'25'' vision is widely endorsed, bold, and fully attainable. \nIf implemented, it would dramatically improve our energy security, our \neconomy, and our ability to protect the environment.\n  I am pleased that more than 20 of my colleagues in the Senate, from \nboth sides of the aisle, are cosponsoring this resolution. In addition, \nthe ``25x'25'' vision has been endorsed by 22 current and former \ngovernors and several State legislatures across the country.\n  The Big Three automobile manufacturers--Ford, Chrysler, and General \nMotors--are all behind ``25x'25'' So are many agricultural \norganizations, environmental groups, scientists, and businesses, \nranging from the Farm Bureau and Farmers' Union to the Natural \nResources Defense Council and John Deere. The breadth of support for \nthe ``25x'25'' vision speaks to the extraordinary economic, \nenvironmental, and national security benefits that its implementation \nwill yield. In all, nearly 400 organizations have embraced this vision \nand are working together on a plan to implement it.\n  The resolution that Senator Grassley and I are submitting makes the \n``25x'25'' vision a policy goal for our Nation. It sets a challenging \nbut realistic target for our legislative and budgetary work on energy. \nOur resolution says that the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of the \nAmerican people should be the engine for a new, clean energy economy.\n  I urge every American to join with me and the roughly 400 partner \norganizations that are part of the 25x'25 Alliance to make this goal a \nreality. Results from a recent study conducted by the University of \nTennessee shows that reaching the 25x'25 goal is achievable. The study \nalso shows that 25x'25 would: increase net farm income by $180 billion \nand, including multiplier effects, could result in $700 billion in \neconomic activity annually; create approximately 5 million new jobs \nhere at home in 2025; save as much as $15 billion in government \npayments.\n  America's working people can and should be at the center of our \nenergy revolution. Farmers and ranchers in my native San Luis Valley, \nin Sterling, CO, and elsewhere are already leading the way; they are \nbuilding biodiesel plants and ethanol refineries that help power cars, \ntractors, and trucks. They are building wind turbines in Prowers County \nand biomass generators in Jackson County. And they are searching for \nnew technologies that will allow them to make even greater \ncontributions to our energy supply.\n  These Americans understand that we cannot continue to import 60 \npercent of our oil from foreign countries, many of which are hostile to \nthe United States, if we aim to be strong and secure in the world. They \nknow that we will have to build a clean energy economy if we are to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  A clean energy economy will take root in our farms and fields. It \nwill help revitalize a rural America that has been forgotten for too \nlong. It will spur our engineers to new developments and designs, and \nit will help establish the U.S. as the world leader in clean energy \ntechnologies.\n  It is time for Congress to take a more active role in our clean \nenergy future. Establishing a national goal--``25x'25'' is the first \nstep.\n  Today, with this resolution, we articulate a common vision for our \nenergy policy. It is a target we can hit. It is a target that \nGovernors, Senators, Representatives, state legislators, farmers, \nranchers, entrepreneurs, scientists, and automakers, all wish to \nachieve.\n  I am proud to be working with Senator Grassley and others to \nestablish ``25x'25'' as our Nation's shared goal for our energy \nsecurity and I look forward to working on a legislative agenda in this \nCongress that will help us reach that target.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Salazar in \nintroducing a concurrent resolution which expresses the goal of the \nUnited States to provide 25 percent of the Nation's energy needs from \nrenewable resources by 2025.\n  The goal of this 25 by 25 resolution is quite simple: to replace 25 \npercent of our total energy needs with renewable resources like wind, \nhydropower, solar, geothermal, biomass and biofuels by 2025. This is a \nbold goal, but given our current energy situation in the U.S., it is a \nnecessary goal.\n  The impact of increased energy prices is being felt around the \ncountry by working families, farmers, businesses and industries. The \nincreased cost for energy at the pump, in home heating and for \nindustrial uses has the potential to jeopardize our economic security \nand vitality.\n  Our effort with this concurrent resolution is to signal to America's \nfarmers, ranchers and forestry industry, that we believe they have the \nability and resources to generate 25 percent of our energy needs. And, \nthat it's in our economic and national security interest to do so.\n  There are many inherent virtues in producing our own domestic energy \nfrom renewable resources. It is good for our environment. It is good \nfor our national and economic security. It will provide an economic \nboost for our rural economies. And perhaps most importantly, it will \nensure a stable, secure, domestic supply of affordable energy.\n  Already, our farmers and ranchers are working hard to use their \nresources to produce electricity from wind, biomass and other \nagricultural wastes. In addition, corn, soybeans and other crops are \nbeing used to produce transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. \nIt is evident that rural America has the drive to achieve this goal.\n  While this concurrent resolution states our renewable energy goal, it \ndoes not prescribe a way to achieve the goal. Rather, it recognizes the \nbenefit of implementing supportive policies and incentives to stimulate \nthe development and use of renewable energy. It also identifies the \nbenefits of technological improvements to the cost and market appeal of \nrenewable energy.\n  The supporters of this goal commit to support sensible policies and \nproper incentives to work toward the goal. I am hopeful that my \ncolleagues will recognize the importance of this effort, and will \nconsider supporting us in this goal to produce 25 percent of our energy \nneeds from renewable resources by 2025.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/17/senate-section/article/S706-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Res. 31\n\n       Whereas, in September 2000, the people of Serbia fought for \n     democracy by going to the streets to hold protests and \n     rallies until President Slobodan Milosevic was removed from \n     power and the Government of Serbia was handed over to \n     democratic forces;\n       Whereas, in the following years, the democratic leadership \n     of Serbia worked to establish a democratic society, \n     functional rule of law, a free market economy, and respect \n     for human and minority rights;\n       Whereas the President of Serbia, Boris Tadic, has expressed \n     publicly his commitment to the principles of democracy and \n     the dream of leading Serbia forward on this path;\n       Whereas Serbia is a member of several international \n     organizations and has voiced its desire to become a member of \n     the European Union (EU);\n       Whereas Serbia has enacted several military and defense \n     reforms to strengthen ties to its Western allies and the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Alliance;\n       Whereas, on September 7, 2006, Serbia signed a Status of \n     Forces Agreement with the United States Government to \n     facilitate Serbia's participation in joint military exercises \n     and training;\n       Whereas, on September 8, 2006, President Tadic commemorated \n     the beginning of Serbia's participation in the National Guard \n     State Partnership Program with the Ohio National Guard;\n       Whereas, on December 14, 2006, Serbia was granted accession \n     to the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) program, along with \n     its neighbors, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, \n     initiating formal cooperation between NATO and Serbia;\n       Whereas Serbia has transferred 36 individuals indicted for \n     war crimes to the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia (ICTY), including Milosevic and some of his \n     top officials, and provided thousands of documents to the \n     Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY;\n       Whereas Serbia has taken some additional steps, under the \n     supervision of the ICTY and the international community, to \n     enact judicial reforms and establish special courts to try \n     individuals indicted for war crimes in Kosovo, Bosnia, and \n     Croatia;\n       Whereas Serbia has failed to arrest war criminal Ratko \n     Mladic for the horrific crimes he committed at Srebrenica in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, which prevented Serbia's earlier \n     participation in the PfP program and its progression in EU \n     accession talks;\n       Whereas, on January 21, 2007, Serbia will hold democratic \n     parliamentary elections to determine Serbia's future \n     leadership at this critical juncture in Serbia's history;\n       Whereas Albanian parties in southern Serbia will \n     participate in the parliamentary elections for the first time \n     in over 15 years;
