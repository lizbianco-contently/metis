Mr. President, we are going to be in a period of morning \nbusiness until shortly after 3 o'clock, with the time equally divided \nand controlled. The majority will control the first part, with Senator \nByrd taking our time. The final portion will be controlled by the \nRepublicans.\n  Shortly after 3 p.m., the Senate will proceed to the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act. The \ndebate time on that conference report will extend until quarter to 6 \ntonight. The majority manager, Senator Boxer, and Senator Inhofe will \nbe here shortly after 3 to proceed forward with the debate.\n  Mr. President, I have to comment on this remarkable piece of \nlegislative work. Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe--you could have no \ntwo different political ideologies than the two of them. One is the \nchairman of the committee, one is the ranking member. That was \nreversed--Inhofe was the chairman, Boxer was the ranking member last \nyear. They worked together well last year, and they worked extremely \nwell together this year, as evidenced by this bill, which I think sets \na good example for all of us here. You do not have to have ideological \nparity to get things done around here. This is a good example of that.\n  The vote on the conference report is expected around 5:45 p.m. today. \nThis could never, ever have been accomplished without these two \nSenators working together. Once the Senate completes action on the \nconference report this evening, we will decide what we have to do. We \nhave a lot to do this week. I am going to spend some time with the \nRepublican leader and determine how we are going to accomplish what we \nhave to do.\n  We have, perhaps, SCHIP, we have a continuing resolution, we have a \ndebt limit extension, and we have to finish this bill, which means we \nprobably will not finish this bill this week, but it is something we \nhave to do. So everyone should watch closely what is going on, and we \nwill try to work our way through this. There have been a number of \nprocedural hurdles to get through.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/24/senate-section/article/S11967-8", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11967-S11968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MAHMUD AHMADI-NEJAD'S UNITED STATES VISIT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss Iranian President \nMahmud Ahmadi-Nejad's visit to New York. The ostensible purpose of this\n\n[[Page S11968]]\n\nvisit is to address the United Nations General Assembly, but Ahmadi-\nNejad will have accomplished much more than that by the time he leaves. \nBy opening its gates to this man's hateful ideology, Columbia \nUniversity is allowing him to take full advantage of a golden \nopportunity to spread it and giving it a level of deference it, \nfrankly, does not deserve.\n  It is one thing for a foreign leader, even one as disreputable as \nAhmadi-Nejad, to visit the U.N. and remain confined to the grounds of \nthe U.N. As a head of state, he is legally entitled to visit the United \nNations. It is quite another to give a man who has referred to the \nUnited States as the ``Great Satan'' and who denies the Holocaust a \ncoveted platform from which to speak.\n  Let's consider for a minute what Iran has said and done during his \nPresidency. Iran actively supports militias that undermine the rule of \nlaw and export weapons that are killing our U.S. soldiers and marines \nin Iraq. Iran is actively pursuing a nuclear program that puts it on a \npath toward possessing nuclear weapons. Iran is a state sponsor of \nterror. Iran supports proxies that are undercutting attempts to bring \npeace, reconciliation, and democracy to Lebanon. Ahmadi-Nejad has \ncalled for Israel, one of America's closest allies, to be wiped off the \nmap. Iran supports proxies in Syria and Gaza that are actively \ntrying to goad Israel into war and undercutting the efforts to \nfacilitate peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Ahmadi-Nejad has \ndenied that the Holocaust ever took place, calling it a myth. He even \nhosted a convention of Holocaust deniers.\n\n  It is hard to imagine any nation on earth that threatens U.S. \ninterests and those of its allies much more than Iran. It is equally \nhard to imagine any greater American university of generations past \ninviting a world leader to its campus who supported groups that kill \nU.S. soldiers and marines. Think of the irony: Columbia University, \nhome of the core curriculum that prizes an in-depth understanding of \nWestern civilization and the free exchange of ideas, is bringing to its \ncampus a state sponsor of terror. A school that rejected the ROTC in \n2005 on the grounds that the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy \ndiscriminated against gays now welcomes a man whose government \nreportedly executes them.\n  Whether Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad should be speaking at Columbia should not \nbe the subject of a philosophical debate. He already rejected that \ndebate by leading a regime which has chosen terrorism over reason and \nopen dialog. Under Ahmadi-Nejad, the Iranian regime trains, funds, and \nexports terror. Defense Department sources tell us that explosively \nformed penetrators, the most lethal form of improvised explosive \ndevices used against our forces in Iraq, are being manufactured in \nIran.\n  I was heartened to see some common sense was injected into the \nIranian leader's visit when the New York City Police Department denied \nhis request to visit Ground Zero and lay a wreath. Looking at Ahmadi-\nNejad's record on terror, one wonders whether the wreath was meant to \nhonor the victims of the World Trade Center attacks or its \nperpetrators.\n  I support the administration's approach to the Iranian nuclear \nprogram. Active diplomacy and ratcheting up international sanctions \nare, at this point, the best path forward. That said, diplomacy is only \nas effective as the credibility and potential force backing it up. The \nPresident, as Commander in Chief, is correct to preserve a broad \nspectrum of policy options in confronting the Iranian threat.\n  Some groups on the left, such as MoveOn.org, believe we should take \nmilitary options off the table, then negotiate. Such an approach might \nmake sense to the zealots on the far left, but it will not help us in \nour efforts to slow Iran's nuclear program. Why would Iran take us \nseriously if we negotiate with all carrots and no sticks? Why would \nthey take us seriously when their hateful screeds against us and our \nallies are met with an invitation to join polite society's lecture \ncircuit?\n  I will close by saying that I strongly support free speech. Free \nspeech is a hallmark of democracy, a right not afforded by Ahmadi-Nejad \nto his own people. There is a world of difference between not \npreventing Ahmadi-Nejad from speaking and handing a megalomaniac a \nmegaphone and a stage to use it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/24/senate-section/article/S11968-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a few days ago, Congress and the American \npublic were treated to a sales job on Iraq that would have made any \nused car salesman proud. We heard the half-truths and rosy visions put \nforth by authoritative diplomats in dark suits and ribboned and starred \ngenerals in uniform, topped off by the pomp and circumstance of a well-\nrehearsed Oval Office speech. Visions were painted for us of a peaceful \nand prosperous oasis of democracy and stability in the turbulent \ngeography of the Middle East, if only--and only if--our gallant \nsoldiers stayed for just a little while longer to bring the dream to \nreality. Such a grand vision, of course, produced yet another new Bush \nadministration slogan, ``return on success,'' which fits very nicely on \na bumper sticker for the back of the lemon this team of salesmen is \ntrying to peddle.\n  Like any good used car salesman, the President insists that we take \nhim up on his once-in-a-lifetime good deal, just as he has insisted, \neach and every time, that he needs a little more time for his war in \nIraq. If we don't buy in once again, Iraq will descend into chaos, \nmilitias will commence with ethnic cleansing, terrorists will set up \ncomplexes from which to launch attacks on the United States, and Iran \nor Syria, or both, will develop nuclear weapons and invade Iraq on \ntheir way to Israel.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that we stop and take a little time to \nconsider this offer, consider what was said and what was not said. It \nis long past time to lift the hood and kick the tires.\n  President Bush said in his speech that things were going so well in \nIraq that the extra troops needed for the surge could begin returning \nhome, as long as conditions continued to improve. In the only time line \nthat he laid out, the President suggested that, subject to his fine \nprint, the number of U.S. troops in Iraq might be reduced to 137,000 by \nJuly 2008. While that is certainly welcome news, it carefully neglects \nto mention that this reduction would still leave 7,000 more troops in \nIraq than were present before the so-called ``temporary surge'' began \nin February 2007. Frankly, that is not much of a drawdown, given all \nthe so-called ``progress'' in Iraq cited by the President.\n  The President said in 2003, ``Mission accomplished.'' Now the \nPresident says that in December, it will be time to ``transition to the \nnext phase of our strategy in Iraq.'' the President said, and I quote, \n``As terrorists are defeated, civil society takes root, and the Iraqis \nassume more control over their own security, our mission in Iraq will \nevolve. Over time, our troops will shift from leading operations, to \npartnering with Iraqi forces, and eventually to overwatching those \nforces.''\n  In 2003, over 4 years ago, when U.S. forces overthrew the regime of \nSaddam Hussein, there was supposed to be a rapid transition to a new \ncivil government in Iraq. In all the years since the invasion, civil \nsociety has not yet put down strong roots despite our efforts. By every \nassessment and every benchmark, it is not happening now, either. The \nIraqi central government is nowhere near achievng reconciliation,\n\n[[Page S11969]]\n\nand equitable arrangements for the sharing of oil revenue or holding \nelections are but dim and distant visions. Iraqis have not assumed \ncontrol over their own security. Indeed, independent assessments of \nIraq have suggested that Iraqi security forces are riddled with \nsectarian corruption and will not be capable of providing security for \nsome time to come, if ever.\n  U.S. troops have been ``partnering'' with Iraqi troops for years now, \nand U.S. troops have been training, equipping and supporting Iraqi \nforces to the tune of billions of dollars. U.S. troops have been \nconducting counterterrorism operations, as the President also noted in \nhis speech. So what, pray tell, is new or different about this \nstrategy? I can see nothing by which to judge success so that our \ntroops may ``return on success.'' It is just a nice paint job slathered \nacross the same old junk car.\n\n  The warranties on this new speech and this new sales job expire as \nsoon as the car is driven off the lot. The only timeline offered by \nPresident Bush or General Petraeus ran out of time after July 2008. The \npretty six-colored chart that General Petraeus used to show the troop \ndrawdown associated with the transition had no dates on it past July \n2008, though it was pretty clear that U.S. troops would be in Iraq for \na very long time to come. President Bush explicitly said that if he has \nhis way, U.S. troops would be in Iraq long past his exit from the White \nHouse. He boldly asserts that he will leave his staggering foreign \npolicy calamity for someone else to clean up. Talk about passing the \nbuck.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot afford another slick White House \nsales job. Too many young men and women have died or have been maimed \nin this horrific war. We owe it to them to take a good hard look at the \nfacts. General Petraeus, in his testimony, suggested that because of \nthe ``surge,'' the number of Iraqi deaths have decreased, indicating \n``progress.'' That may or may not be true--I do not know--but I do know \nthat General Petraeus carefully did not note that the number of U.S. \ndeaths in Iraq actually increased during the surge period, compared to \nthe same periods in prior years. General Petraeus also did not note \nthat the U.S. military death rate in Iraq, that is, the average number \nof deaths per month, also continues to climb from prior years.\n  General Petraeus pointed to the decrease in the number of improvised \nexplosive device, or lED, attacks during the surge period of June \nthrough August as another sign of progress. It is true that the number \nof attacks dropped--as it does every year during the very hottest \nmonths of June, July, and August. But what General Petraeus did not say \nis that the number of U.S. deaths from IEDs increased during the surge \nperiod, compared to the same period in prior years. That, as they say, \nis the rest of the story. That is the whole truth, not carefully \ncherry-picked statistics designed to bolster the President's pitch for \nprogress.\n  The President and his men also did not talk about the price tag of \nthis shiny little war sedan. No need to discuss that before they have \nhooked us into writing the check. But the cost of this war should be \nuppermost in our minds, as the Senate addresses the Defense \nauthorization bill, and certainly before the Senate considers yet \nanother war funding supplemental appropriations bill--the largest one \never.\n  Congress has already appropriated over $450 billion for the war in \nIraq, and if Congress approves the President's latest request for \nsupplemental funds, that figure will grow to over $600 billion during \nfiscal year 2008. That is a price tag with nine zeroes in it, folks. \nThese direct costs do not cover the many hidden, indirect costs of this \nwar, such as higher Veterans Administration costs, more veterans' \ndisability payments, the considerable interest on the additional debt, \nhigher oil and gasoline prices, increased security costs here at home, \nand the incalculable damage done to our image and reputation in the \nworld because of this war. The combined direct and indirect costs and \nobligations of this war will exceed $1 trillion by the most \nconservative estimates. Many economists believe that the costs are much \nhigher.\n  That $600 billion or $1 trillion pricetag also does not begin to \ncover the lost opportunity costs--all the ways in which money now spent \non Iraq could have been used to make our bridges safer, secure our \nborder, improve education, or to prepare for and rebuild after natural \ndisasters and weather-related farming failures. That money could have \nbeen used to develop safe, clean, alternative energy sources so that \nthe United States would not have to rely so much on oil from the Middle \nEast or other volatile regions of the world.\n\n  Nor does that $600 billion or $1 trillion cover the costs of keeping \nupwards of 130,000 troops in Iraq for the many additional years the \nPresident and his men suggest will be necessary to achieve their vision \nof progress and success. It boggles the mind to consider the long-term \ncosts of buying this war.\n  We all say that we support the troops. These brave men and women have \nbeen given a near impossible task, which they have performed with \ndedication, professionalism, courage, and honor. The Congress has \nprovided everything the generals have asked for, and more. The \nPresident has taken that support for our men and women in uniform to \nimply support and even validation of his policy. He wants to keep the \nU.S. military tied down in Iraq indefinitely, trying to bargain for a \nlittle more time, a little more time, time and time again, never \ngrasping that his policy is fatally flawed. History shows the fallacy \nof thinking that democracy can be force-fed at the point of a gun.\n  In the fifth year of this misguided, infernal war, I am convinced \nthat the best way to support our troops is to bring them home--home, \nsweet home--and the only way to get them home may be to somehow \nrestrict the funds for this disastrous, awful war. We have tried this \nbefore and the President, the President, vetoed the bill. I am here \ntoday to insist that we must try again. Strings must be attached to \nthis money. This Senator will support no more blank checks for Iraq.\n  On October 11, 2002, I was one of only 23 Senators who voted against \nthe authorization that led to this awful, infernal war. I call on my \ncolleagues, for the sake of our soldiers and for the sake of our \nNation, to remember that half-truths and misleading claims are what led \nto this war. We can all recall that on February 5, 2003, the President \nsent Colin Powell, both a ribboned and starred general and a respected \ndiplomat, to the United Nations to sell this war to the UN and to the \nNation. Secretary Powell painted frightening visions of anthrax, truck \nand rail car-mounted mobile weapons laboratories, and nuclear weapons--\nnone of it was accurate. The Nation was led to believe that our troops \nwould be greeted as liberators, and that oil money would pay for Iraq's \nreconstruction. Now while the half-truths have changed, the strategy of \nmisleading the Nation remains the same.\n  Iraq may descend further into chaos if U.S. troops leave now, or it \nmay descend into chaos whenever they leave. As long as the United \nStates keeps the peace in Iraq, there is no incentive for Iraqis to \nmaintain the peace on their own. After nearly 5 years of this awful, \nterrible war, more than 3,800 deaths, over 27,000 wounded, and no end \nin sight, we must change course. This war, this draining, desultory, \ndreadful occupation of Iraq must end.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/24/senate-section/article/S11969-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING SENATOR BYRD\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

This amendment would \ndesignate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist \norganization and thereby subject this deadly, nefarious group to a \nseries of economic and diplomatic sanctions that Senator Kyl and I \nthink will be felt in Iran and that this group, because of its\n\n[[Page S11970]]\n\ndangerous and destabilizing work throughout Iraq and the Middle East, \ndeserves.\n  This is obviously a week in which the leader of Iran, President \nAhmadi-Nejad, is in the United States of America. A great debate rages \nabout what is the appropriate way to greet him? What sanctions, what \nplatforms should be given to him? What sanctions should be discussed?\n  Personally, I feel it was a terrible mistake for Columbia University \nto invite him to speak because he comes literally with blood on his \nhands--the blood of American soldiers who are being killed today in \nIraq by Iraqi extremists trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nCorps, the Quds Force, in Iran at bases surrounding Tehran.\n  But I offer this amendment in this spirit: If we are looking for a \nway to meaningfully respond to the presence of Ahmadi-Nejad in the \nUnited States, I cannot think of anything better than adopting this \nresolution which documents exactly the campaign of death and murder of \nAmericans and others throughout the Middle East that it is carrying \nout.\n  Regardless of where any individual Member of this Chamber stands on \nthe war in Iraq and what the best way forward on the war in Iraq is, \nthis matter of Iran's deadly role in Iraq and throughout the Middle \nEast should draw us all together. This is a matter on which we are not \nfor or against the war in Iraq, we are not Democrats or Republicans, we \nare Americans standing based of the evidence against a force, the \nIranian Republican Guard Corps, the Quds Force, that has blood on its \nhands, and the blood is American blood.\n  General Petraeus, 2 weeks ago, testified before Congress, and he \ncould not have been clearer about the threat we face from Iran. In his \nwords:\n\n       It is increasingly apparent to both coalition and Iraqi \n     leaders that Iran, through the use of the Iranian Republican \n     Guard Corps Quds Force, seeks to turn the Shi'a militia \n     extremists into a Hezbollah-like force to serve its interests \n     and fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state and coalition \n     forces.\n\n  General Petraeus's testimony is the latest in a growing dossier of \nevidence about Iranian terrorism--call it what it is. Ahmadi-Nejad is \nmaybe called President; he is the terrorist dictator who, with a small \ngroup around him, has seized control of a great Nation, Iran--a growing \ndossier of evidence about Iranian terrorism in Iraq and throughout the \nregion that we in this Chamber have received from our American military \ncommanders on the ground in Iraq, from our top diplomats there, and \nfrom our own intelligence community.\n  This is not opinion; this is fact. Specifically, we have received \ndetailed information in recent months about how operatives from the \nIranian Revolutionary Guard Corps have been training--have been \ntraining--arming, funding, and even directing extremists inside Iraq. \nAs Ambassador Crocker testified:\n\n       While claiming to support Iraq in its transition, Iran has \n     actively undermined it by providing lethal capabilities to \n     the enemies of the Iraqi state.\n\n  The IRGC, Quds Force, is also importing terrorists from the Lebanese \nHezbollah to help build its extremist proxies in Iraq. We know this \nbecause coalition forces, American forces, have captured one of the \nHezbollah leaders inside Iraq and recovered documents that detail the \nrelationship between the Iranian regime and the extremist groups they \nare sponsoring who are killing Americans.\n  General Petraeus said it when he was here:\n\n       This is not intelligence. This is evidence.\n\n  We also know Iran has been using its territory to train and organize \nthese extremists, as I said. What is the source of that? The U.S. \nmilitary spokesperson in Iraq, BG Kevin Bergner, U.S. Army. He has said \ngroups of up to 60 Iraqi militants at a time have been taken to three \ncamps near Tehran, where they received instruction in the use of \nmortars, rockets, improvised explosives, and other deadly tools of \nguerrilla warfare that they then use against our troops in Iraq.\n  General Bergner also reported this summer the U.S. military has \nconcluded that ``the senior leadership'' in Iran is aware of the \nactivities of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in sponsoring \nattacks against our soldiers in Iraq, and that, in his words, it is \n``hard to imagine'' that the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali \nKhamenei, does not know about them.\n  The consequences of this Iranian terrorism in Iraq have been immense \nand terrible for our men and women in uniform and for their families \nand friends at home. According to LTG Ray Odierno, the deputy commander \nof our forces in Iraq, Iranian-supplied weapons were responsible for a \nfull one-third of American combat deaths this July. That builds on a \nsimilar record in preceding months. Let me repeat that. Up to a third \nof the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq in July were caused by \nsophisticated explosive devices used by people trained in Iran, with \nthose devices supplied by Iran. This means the Iranians and their \nagents are killing our troops. Why are they doing it? Because they want \nus to retreat from Iraq.\n  The Iranians understand--sometimes, it seems, better than a lot of \nAmericans do--that if American power collapses in Iraq, if we retreat \nand abandon our allies and the hopes we share with them for a better \nfuture in Iraq and throughout the Middle East, our position throughout \nthe region will become much weaker and Iran's position will become much \nstronger.\n  Iranian aggression in Iraq fits squarely into a larger pattern of \nregional aggression, leading, they hope, to regional domination.\n\n  Tehran is also training, funding, and equipping radical groups that \nare responsible for the deaths of Lebanese, Palestinians, Afghanis, and \nIsraelis. They are attempting to destabilize a series of moderate \nregimes in the Arab world.\n  Last week, Admiral Fallon, the commander of our Central Command, said \nthe Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is supplying anticoalition forces \nwith the same sophisticated explosive devices it is giving to \nextremists in Iraq. In Admiral Fallon's words:\n\n       There is no doubt . . . that agents from Iran are involved \n     in aiding the insurgency.\n\n  The fact is, it is Iraq that today is the central front of Iran's \nefforts to become the hegemonic power in the Middle East. The Iranian \nregime knows Iraq has become the central front in our war with Islamist \nterrorism. It is where they believe they can begin the process of \npushing us out of the region and seizing control. That is why I do not \nbelieve a person can be serious about responding to the threat of Iran \nwhile calling for our precipitous withdrawal from Iraq.\n  Ahmadi-Nejad, a few weeks ago, said:\n\n       The political power of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly.\n\n  By that he means us.\n\n       Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region. . . .We \n     are prepared to fill that gap.\n\n  Asked about that statement, our own Ambassador Crocker said:\n\n       Ahmadinejad means what he says, and is already trying to \n     implement it, to the best of his ability.\n\n  That is a quote from our Ambassador in Baghdad.\n  It is vital to the national security interests of the United States \nthat the Iranian Government not be allowed to prevail in its war \nagainst us and the Iraqi people's hopes for a better future. The \namendment Senator Kyl and I and others are offering, we believe, is an \nimportant component of our response to this threat.\n  First, it will send a clear message both to the fanatical regime in \nTehran--not, I believe, representative of the feelings and hopes of the \nIranian people--and it will send a clear message to our allies in the \nregion that the United States will not stand idly by and allow Iranian-\nbacked terrorists to kill hundreds of American soldiers. We will not \nstand idly by and allow Iran, through its proxies and then directly, to \ndominate Iraq.\n  This amendment acknowledges what our military commanders and top \ndiplomats are telling us, which is that regardless of what we might \ndesire in Washington, the Government in Tehran has made a decision, and \nthey are carrying it out--to wage a proxy war against the United States \nin Iraq and against our allies in the Arab world and Israel throughout \nthe region. We must respond.\n  Our amendment states it should be the policy of the United States to \nstop the violent activities and the destabilizing influence inside Iraq \nof the\n\n[[Page S11971]]\n\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as its foreign \nfacilitators such as Lebanese Hezbollah and the indigenous Iraqi \nextremists.\n  Our amendment recognizes that thwarting Iran's campaign of terror \nmust be among the crucial considerations for any plan for the \ntransition and drawdown of our forces in Iraq. As General Petraeus \nwarned us in his testimony, the threat of Iran may, in the long run, \nprove an even greater danger to the stability of Iraq--their hopes for \npolitical reconciliation and self-government--than al-Qaida. We cannot \nignore Iran.\n  For that reason, the amendment Senator Kyl and I are offering calls \non the State Department to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nCorps as a foreign terrorist organization and place the IRGC on the \nlist of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. This is no small \norganization. I have seen estimates to say it is as large as 150,000 or \n180,000. They have ground troops. They have air capability. They even \nhave naval assets. They have businesses which are doing business with \nother businesses throughout the region and the world.\n  This is the organization that the evidence, presented to us by the \nAmerican military intelligence communities, tells us is responsible for \nthe murder of American soldiers in Iraq.\n  They are launching terrorist attacks through their agents against our \ntroops; therefore, they should be treated as terrorists. They must \nbegin to suffer the economic and diplomatic punishments that come with \nbeing designated as a foreign terrorist organization.\n  Of course, everyone in this Chamber would prefer that we find a way \nto convince the Iranian regime to stop these attacks against our \nsoldiers, Iraqi soldiers, and civilians through negotiation, but \nreality requires that we recognize that we have tried to use the tools \nof diplomacy with Iran, Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad's government, and it has \nproduced nothing.\n  Since May, Ambassador Crocker, our Ambassador, has met three times \nwith his Iranian counterparts in Baghdad--the highest level official \nmeetings between American and Iranian representatives in decades--and \nwhat have these talks produced? These talks, at which our Ambassador \nhas presented the Iranians with hard evidence that we know the IRGC, \nthe Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, is training Iraqi extremists who \nare coming back into Iraq and killing American soldiers--what has that \nevidence produced? Nothing. Nothing at all. In fact, there is some \nevidence that the Iranian activity is growing.\n  In Ambassador Crocker's own words as he testified before Congress:\n\n       I laid out the concerns we have over Iranian activity that \n     was damaging to Iraq's security, but found no readiness on \n     the Iranian side at all to engage seriously on these issues. \n     The impression I came away with after a couple of rounds is \n     that the Iranians were interested simply in the appearance of \n     discussions, of being seen to be at the table with the U.S. \n     as an arbiter of Iraq's present and future, rather than \n     actually doing serious business. Right now--\n\n  Ambassador Crocker says--\n\n     I haven't seen any signs of earnestness or seriousness on the \n     Iranian side.\n\n  Far from convincing the Iranian regime to stop its proxy attacks on \nIraqi soldiers, the evidence is that these attacks have escalated--\nincreased--over the last month. According to the most recent National \nIntelligence Estimate:\n\n       Iran has been intensifying aspects of its lethal support--\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask unanimous \nconsent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The war Iran is fighting against American troops and \nour allies in Iraq is an undeclared war, but it is, nonetheless, a real \nwar in which real Americans and Iraqis are being murdered by Iranian \nagents. We cannot close our eyes to that outrageous reality. This \namendment exposes that behavior and demands justice.\n  As we speak, the President of Iran is in the United States. There is \nno better time than that for us to stand together, united as Americans, \nregardless of our position on Iraq or our party affiliation, and send a \ncrystal clear message to Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad and the fanatical \nterrorists and tyrants who now run the great country of Iran and \noppress its people that their campaign of terror against our troops in \nIraq must end and we will stand united as Americans against it. Ahmadi-\nNejad should not be given any American platform to speak from until he \nacts to stop his government's killing of Americans. They have been \nshouting for almost three decades ``death to America.'' He leads those \nchants of tens of thousands in Iran today. But they have done more than \nshout; they have acted to bring that death to Americans in the marine \nbarracks in Beirut, Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and today in Iraq.\n  Giving this evil and fanatical man a platform at a great American \nuniversity is an insult to the hundreds of Americans whose blood he and \nhis extremist allies in Iran have on their hands. He deserves no \naudience, no respect, no opportunity to explain away his hateful words \nand murderous actions. He and the ruling clique in Iran deserve the \npunishment, and more, this amendment Senator Kyl and I are introducing \nwould impose on them as the terrorists they are.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first let me compliment my colleague from \nConnecticut, who is largely responsible for the idea of this amendment \nand much of the text of it, for his leadership over the years in trying \nto ensure we take appropriate action against Iran as it confronts \nAmerica, both with regard to its nuclear program development as well \nas, more currently, its activities against our forces in Iraq. He has \nbeen truly inspirational, and I appreciate that leadership.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has well laid out the case for this \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that the U.S. Government should designate \nspecifically the Islamic Revolutionary Guard as a foreign terrorist \norganization and include it on the list of Specially Designated Global \nTerrorists. In addition, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment urges the \nuse of our diplomatic and economic tools to pressure the Iranian regime \nnot only to abandon its nuclear program but also to stop the use of its \nsurrogates against our forces in Iraq.\n  There have been only two questions raised about this amendment. I am \nhoping and expecting that it will receive very strong bipartisan \nsupport tomorrow, assuming we are able to vote on it tomorrow. The only \ntwo questions were, first of all, Can this be read in any way as an \nauthorization of military action against Iran? I will assure my \ncolleagues that is absolutely not our intention--in fact, quite the \nopposite. This is intended to obviate the necessity for such military \nconduct. Nobody wants to have to engage in military action against Iran \ndirectly, but what we would like to do is get them to stop killing our \ntroops. One way to do that is to put economic pressure on the \norganization that is doing the killing, and that is what this amendment \nwould ask the administration to do.\n\n  Secondly, there is the question of whether the Islamic Revolutionary \nGuard is the appropriate entity to list on the Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorists, and the answer to that is clearly yes. As I will \npoint out in a moment, we have incontrovertible evidence that this is \nthe group, as Senator Lieberman pointed out, that is causing the \ntrouble.\n  Some have said: Well, we should just designate the Quds Force of the \nIslamic Revolutionary Guard as the terrorist entity. That is like \nsaying the Mafia isn't really responsible for what the Mafia does; it \nis only their hit men. The Quds Force is the group of hit men for this \nentity. This entity is clearly the overall entity responsible for this \naction, and it is the entity that engages in the economic activity \nwhich supplies the financial resources to the Quds Force. So it would \nnot be adequate, obviously, just to designate the Quds Force, which is \nan arm of the Revolutionary Guard, as the terrorist entity.\n  What evidence do we actually have that this is the entity of the \nIranian\n\n[[Page S11972]]\n\nGovernment that is doing all the dirty work? Well, there are many \npublic statements, and I will quote from some of them. Senator \nLieberman quoted some of them. There is also other information, as one \nmight imagine, and my colleagues should be encouraged to consult with \nterrorist agencies if they have any questions about the specific \ninvolvement of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. But it is clear that \nthis is the entity on which we should be focusing.\n  Senator Lieberman quoted one of General Petraeus's statements in his \ntestimony before the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on \nArmed Services on September 10 that it is apparent Iran, through the \nuse of the Iranian Republican Guard Corps--Quds Force--is causing this \nproxy war.\n  Here is something else General Petraeus also recently stated:\n\n       We know that it goes as high as Suleimani--\n\n  And his full name is BG Qassem Suleimani--\n\n     who is the head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Republican \n     Guards Corps. That is quite high level. We believe that he \n     works directly for the supreme leader of the country.\n\n  There is a specific reference to the IRGC.\n  In addition, Brigadier General Bergner, who is a spokesman for the \nMulti-National Force-Iraq, recently talked about the Quds Force \noperation in three camps near Teheran, and he said:\n\n       The Quds Force, along with Hezbollah instructors, train \n     approximately 20 to 60 Iraqis at a time, sending them back to \n     Iraq organized into these special groups. They are being \n     taught how to use Explosively Formed Penetrators, mortars, \n     rockets, as well as intelligence, sniper and killing \n     operations. In addition to training, the Quds Force also \n     supplies the special groups with weapons and funding of \n     750,000 to 3 million U.S. dollars a month.\n\n  Now, Senator Lieberman also referred to General Odierno. When I was \nin Iraq last, I was ushered into General Odierno's office to have a \nvery candid discussion with him, and what an impressive military \nofficer he is. He said: Come look at what I have on the table here, and \nhe proceeded to show us a great deal of military hardware and described \nto us what it was. Essentially, it was all of the things--examples of \nmany of the things they had found supplied by Iran, the weaponry that \nis killing American troops. On one, he said: Here, look at this. He \nsaid: You probably can't read Farsi, but this says, ``Made in Iran.'' \nWell, I accept his statement of what the Farsi says: ``Made in Iran.''\n  He also showed us the earth penetrators. Before we went to Iraq, we \nwere in Kuwait at the base from which a lot of our equipment has come \nback out of Iraq for repair or disposition, and I say ``disposition'' \nbecause some of it has been so devastated by the explosion of these \nweapons smuggled in from Iran that there is nothing much left of them. \nWhat was so impressive--or depressive--to see was to see the biggest, \nheaviest tank in the world, an Abrams tank, blown apart by these things \nas if it were a stick of dynamite in a tin can. The force and the \ndestructive capability was almost beyond belief. We saw examples of \nthat in General Odierno's office--a canister about this big with a \nconcave shape in the middle that he said is the shaped charge that \nexplodes up into the tank or the humvee or whatever the military \nvehicle is and devastates it. In any event, they have no doubt \nwhatsoever that this equipment which is killing American troops is \ncoming from Iran.\n  The Department of Defense report to Congress entitled ``Measuring \nStability and Security in Iraq'' that was just released on September 18 \nof this year states:\n\n       Most of the explosives and ammunition used by these groups \n     are provided by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard \n     Corps--Quds Force. For the period of June through the end of \n     August, the Explosively Formed Penetrator events--\n\n  The equipment to which I just referred--\n\n     are projected to rise by 39 percent over the period of March \n     through May.\n\n  There is a very interesting story in Time magazine, a recent issue, \nquoting a former CIA explosive expert who still works in Iraq as saying \nthat these explosively formed projectiles we are finding in Iran, that:\n\n       The Iranians are making them. End of story.\n\n  His argument is that only a state is capable of manufacturing these \nEFPs. In other words, these are manufactured by people officially \nconnected with the government. They have access to the equipment and \nmaterial and technology to make them. It is a complicated process that \nis involved in the making of the weapons I described.\n  Incidentally, this same individual is convinced that the IRGC is \nhelping Iraqi Shia militias sight in their mortars on the Green Zone, \nhelping them to make sure they actually land on the Green Zone:\n\n       The way they're dropping them in, in neat grids, tells me \n     all I need to know that the Shi'a are getting help. And \n     there's no doubt it's Iranian, the Islamic Revolutionary \n     Guard Corps.\n\n  The investigations into these particular attacks, incidentally, were \nalso discussed in an August 2005 Time report about an Iranian operative \nwho headed a network of insurgents created, again, by the Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps and that they began introducing these EFPs \ninto the country at the beginning of that year. Abu Mustafa al-\nSheibani, an Iranian operative who headed a network of insurgents \ncreated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, introduced the EFPs \ninto the country in early 2007. U.S. military sources claimed to have \ncaptured EFPs that displayed the hallmarks of Iranian-manufactured \nweaponry.\n  This is all IRGC. This is the entity which would be declared the \nterrorist group under our amendment.\n  Ray Takehy, of the Council on Foreign Relations, recently said this--\nI am speaking of the IRGC:\n\n       They are heavily involved in everything from \n     pharmaceuticals to telecommunications and pipelines--even the \n     new Imam Khomeini Airport and a great deal of smuggling.\n\n  I am going on to quote him:\n\n       Many of the front companies engaged in procuring nuclear \n     technology are owned and run by the Revolutionary Guards. \n     They're developing along the lines of the Chinese military, \n     which is involved in many business enterprises. It's a huge \n     business conglomeration.\n\n  This makes the point Senator Lieberman made before--that this \nRevolutionary Guard Corps is deeply involved in economic activity. They \nrely on financing for a lot of their activity. It is this vulnerability \nwhich causes us to believe that if they are listed as a state-sponsored \nterrorist group, we can, through the use of the sanctions that are \navailable to us, inhibit and impede and ultimately stop their activity.\n  The Revolutionary Guard Corps plays a key role in the military \nindustries in Iran. According to Anthony Cordesman, who is a \ndistinguished expert in this area and who is currently with the Center \nfor Strategic and International Studies, they have been involved in the \nattempted acquisition of nuclear weapons and surface-to-surface \nmissiles, among other things.\n  Interestingly, also, the unanimously passed U.N. Security Council \nresolutions sanctioning Iran have listed several IRGC entities as being \ninvolved in Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activities.\n  Finally, the UNSCR resolutions list high-ranking IRGC personnel for \ntheir involvement in these programs, including the deputy commander of \nthe IRGC, the chief of the IRGC joint staff, the commanders of IRGC \nground forces, the commander of the IRGC Navy, the commander of the \nBasij Resistance Force, the commander of the Quds Force, and the Deputy \nInterior Minister for Security Affairs, who is also an IRGC officer.\n  I note that these resolutions, 1737 and 1747, which were immediately \nimplemented by our European partners, have not yet been fully \nimplemented by our own Treasury Department.\n  I cite all of this evidence and these quotations to simply make the \npoint that there is absolutely no doubt that it is the IRGC that is \ninvolved in these activities against our American forces and is \nresponsible for their deaths in Iraq. It is the IRGC that needs to be \nnamed to the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list. I misspoke \nbefore and said the state-sponsored list. I meant the Specially \nDesignated Global Terrorist list.\n  By being so listed, we can employ our financial and immigration \nsanctions,\n\n[[Page S11973]]\n\nwhich could include them potentially blocking assets and even the \nprosecution of supporters who would provide funding to them. It could \nalso involve refusal of visas and deportations of members. It would \nallow us to block the assets--in the United States--of any foreign \ncompany doing business with them, in effect, cutting them out of \nAmerican markets.\n  Any lesser sanctions, such as focusing on the Quds Force, would not \nin any way solve the problem. That is like the hit men for the Mafia; \nyou have to get to the Mafia.\n  We cannot settle for symbolism. This is serious. As I said, finally--\nand this is my last point--our resolution should not be read as an \nauthorization for the use of force. I think we might even be changing a \ncouple words in it to make that crystal clear. That was not our \nintention. To the extent that anybody might try to use that as an \nexcuse for not supporting it, you will not have that excuse. We took \nout a couple of phrases that were pointed out as potentially offering \nthat degree of support. This is not such an authorization for the use \nof military action. This is designed to prevent that. So if your \nconcern is that we might ultimately be forced--or some people might \nbelieve we might be forced--to take action against Iran, and you want \nto void that result, this kind of economic sanction is within our power \nas Americans. We don't have to rely upon anybody else in the world to \ndo it; we can do that. We know it can hurt them, and it goes to the \nentity causing harm to our forces and, therefore, we believe it is an \nappropriate action for the administration to take.\n  This would put the Senate on record as urging the administration to \ntake this action as soon as possible, so we can end the actions of the \nIRGC.\n  I compliment my colleague from Connecticut again for his leadership \nand sponsorship of the resolution. I hope tomorrow we will vote on it \nand our colleagues will be supportive of it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, a lot is being said about whether Ken \nBurns included enough Latinos in his new television series on World War \nII. This is one more reminder that ``pluribus'' comes easy, but \n``unum'' is hard.\n  It would be a lot easier if ``e pluribus unum,'' the national motto \ndisplayed above the Presiding Officer's desk in the Chamber, were \nreversed and became ``many from one'' instead of ``one from many.''\n  Ken Burns's epic series on ``The War'' began last night on public \ntelevision. It promises to stick in our collective memory as only a few \ntelevision events have--for example, the Roots series, Burns' own Civil \nWar series, and Super Bowls.\n  In fact, our country is so splintered these days and so enthralled \nwith our diversity that not very much becomes collective memory, as \ndid, for example, McGuffey's Reader in the 19th century, or the three \nnetwork newscasts in the mid-20th century.\n  This diminution of our common core of beliefs and experiences is \nAmerica's fundamental challenge because forging unity from our \nmagnificent diversity is America's greatest achievement and has created \nour capacity for other achievements.\n  At the Library of Congress some weeks ago, reflecting on his 6 years \nof work on this television series, Ken Burns said Americans were more \nunited during World War II and its aftermath than at any other time. It \nwas no coincidence that during this era the ``greatest generation'' \nalso accomplished the most: Welcoming new citizens based upon beliefs \ninstead of race, building overwhelming military power and the best \nuniversities, and producing nearly one-third of the world's wealth for \n5 percent of the world's people.\n  Quoting the late Arthur Schlesinger's book, ``The Disuniting of \nAmerica,'' Ken Burns said America today could use ``a little less \npluribus and a little more unum.''\n  Following World War II, liberals such as Schlesinger, Albert Shanker, \nand Hubert Humphrey were vigorous apostles of America's common purpose. \nTheir Fourth of July speeches were as effusive as anybody's.\n\n  But today, the left disdains, and the right seems to have forgotten \nthe importance of unum, which means we are abandoning our greatest \nachievement.\n  We see this in our work in the Senate. There is no constituency for \nconsensus, only for division, and many of those who work hardest for \nconsensus are retiring or near the end of their careers here.\n  A good example is the debate on Iraq, a war that, unlike World War \nII, divides us instead of unites us. The President is conducting the \nwar the way he wants to conduct the war, not recognizing that \npersuading at least half the people he is right is the only way he can \nsustain a long-term U.S. presence in Iraq.\n  The Democratic majority, on the other hand, is working hard for a \nperceived political advantage, not recognizing that most voters would \nprefer we work together when Americans are fighting and dying.\n  Both sides deserve an ``incomplete'' on their report cards.\n  A unified country would speak with one voice on where we go from here \nin Iraq because our troops deserve to hear it; because the enemy needs \nto hear it; because one political party does not go to war, our country \ndoes; and, finally, because the Senate looks downright ridiculous \nlecturing Baghdad about being in a political stalemate when we cannot \nget out of one ourselves.\n  We still have an opportunity to speak with one voice on Iraq. \nSeventy-eight of us in the House of Representatives and the Senate--35 \nDemocrats and 43 Republicans--have cosponsored legislation making the \nbipartisan Iraq Study Group recommendations the policy of our \nGovernment. It is a consensus most Members, I believe, agree with. It \nis sitting there staring us in the face, waiting for us to adopt it and \nthe President to sign it.\n  At West Point a few weeks ago, 30 cadets told Ken Burns, after they \nhad seen some of his World War II series, that they had watched his \nCivil War series with their parents and had decided then to attend West \nPoint. We can only hope that Burns' new series can have as much impact \nand remind us of that time--World War II and its aftermath--when \nAmericans pulled together, and remind us that today we could use a \nlittle less pluribus and a little more unum.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe names of the 78 cosponsors of the Iraq Study Group recommendations, \non S. 1545 in the Senate and H.R. 2574 in the House. In the Senate, \nthere are nine Democrats and eight Republicans among the cosponsors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        The Iraq Study Group Recommendations Implementation Act\n\n\n                         Cosponsors of S. 1545\n\n       Democrats: Ken Salazar (D-CO), Mark Pryor (D-AR), Robert \n     Casey (D-PA), Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Bill Nelson (D-FL), \n     Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Kent Conrad \n     (D-ND), and Tom Carper (D-DE).\n       Republicans: Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Bob Bennett (R-UT), \n     Judd Gregg (R-NH), John Sununu (R-NH), Susan Collins (R-ME), \n     Pete Domenici (R-NM), Arlen Specter (R-PA), and Norm Coleman \n     (R-MN).\n\n\n                        Cosponsors of H.R. 2574\n\n       Democrats: Mark Udall (D-CO), Jason Altmire (D-PA), Leonard \n     Boswell (D-IA), Rick Boucher (D-VA), Nancy Boyda (D-KS), \n     Robert Brady (D-PA), Henry Cuellar (D-TX), Danny Davis (D-\n     IL), Lincoln Davis (D-TN), John Dingell (D-MI), Charles \n     Gonzalez (D-TX), Jane Harman (D-CA), Baron Hill (D-IN), Steve \n     Israel (D-NY), Daniel Lipinski (D-IL), Tim Mahoney (D-FL), \n     Jim Matheson (D-UT), Dennis Moore (D-KS), James Moran (D-VA), \n     Donald Payne (D-NJ), Collin Peterson (D-MN), Mike Ross (D-\n     AR), Bobby Rush (D-IL), John Salazar (D-CO), Heath Shuler (D-\n     NC), and David Wu (D-OR).\n\n[[Page S11974]]\n\n       Republicans: Frank Wolf (R-VA), Mary Bono (R-CA), Michael \n     Castle (R-DE), John Abney Culberson (R-TX), Tom Davis (R-VA), \n     Charles Dent (R-PA), David Dreier (R-CA), Vernon Ehlers (R-\n     MI), Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO), Phil English (R-PA), Jeff \n     Fortenberry (R-NE), Luis Fortuno (R-PR), Jim Gerlach (R-PA), \n     Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD), Dean Heller (R-NV), David Hobson (R-\n     OH), Peter Hoekstra (R-MI), Walter Jones (R-NC), Jack \n     Kingston (R-GA), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Randy Kuhl (R-NY), Michael \n     McCaul (R-TX), Sue Wilkins Myrick (R-NC), Jim Ramstad (R-MN), \n     Ralph Regula (R-OH), David Reichert (R-WA), Christopher Shays \n     (R-CT), Christopher Smith (R-NJ), Patrick Tiberi (R-OH), Fred \n     Upton (R-MI), James Walsh (R-NY), Zach Wamp (R-TN), Ed \n     Whitfield (R-KY), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Don Young (R-AK).\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 1495, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1495), to provide for the conservation and development of \n     water and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of \n     the Army to construct various projects for improvements to \n     rivers and harbors of the United States, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend that the House recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the Senate and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, signed by all conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of July 31, 2007)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to bring to the floor \ntoday the conference report on H.R. 1495, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2007. I think I can pick up on something Senator \nAlexander said about how divided we are in this country over this Iraq \nwar. That is very clear. No one understands more than our Senator who \nis sitting in the chair and presiding today how we are divided. This is \na different story, so we will take a little break out of our \ndiscussions about Iraq, and we will continue to work for bipartisanship \nin bringing this war to an honorable close.\n  At this time, we take a little break from that and turn toward \nsomething that is very important, which is building and rebuilding the \nwater infrastructure of our Nation. Today is a day that is 7 years in \nthe making.\n  I wish to start off by thanking my committee, all of the Members on \nmy side of the aisle, and Senator Inhofe, our ranking member, and all \nhis colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle. This is an unusual \nday. This is a day where we come forward united on a bill that will \nauthorize the projects and policies of the Civil Works Program of the \nArmy Corps of Engineers. I am so pleased we will vote today on final \npassage of that bill, and we will send it to the President.\n  I hope President Bush will reconsider his veto threat of this bill. I \nthink colleagues will speak to how urgent this bill is. Imagine not \nhaving a water resources bill for 7 long years. That is too long to \nwait. If colleagues are concerned about the size of the bill--truly, if \nwe had gone back the way we did it, every 2 years, it would be about \nthe size that this bill is. As Senator Inhofe will say when he gets \nhere--and, as you know, he and I don't agree on many environmental \nmatters, but on public works matters we do agree--this is the first \nstep in a long process--the authorizing step--and then comes the \nappropriations.\n  So every one of these projects that has gone through local \ngovernments all over this country--remember, for every one of these \nprojects, there is a local match. These are projects that came from the \nbottom up, from our people who were saying to us we need help with \nflood control, with economic development, with dredging and we need \nhelp with wetlands restoration and in a number of areas involving the \nmovement of water; and this country learned it when we watched after \nHurricanes Rita and Katrina.\n  If we didn't know it then, we certainly know it now. So I say to this \nPresident, this bill is in line, in terms of the pricetag, with what we \nwould have had if we had done this bill every 2 years. There is huge \nsupport for this bill. The votes in the House and the Senate are \nenormous, very one-sided.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, if you are listening or people in your \noffice are listening, this is a respectful request to please join with \nus. We don't have to fight over every single thing. When it comes to \nthe economy, the quality of life of our people, we should be united.\n  The House vote on this conference report was 381 to 40. We are hoping \nwe will vote in that same fashion in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have, since I am Senator Reid's \ndesignee?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Each of the managers has 67\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator has used 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will Senator Landrieu be amenable to \ntaking 10 minutes at this time, and I will reserve time later for her \nin the debate?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 10 minutes of my time to Senator Landrieu. I wish \nto say before she begins, she has been a mover behind this bill. She \nhas worked her heart out to get this bill to the floor and, as a result \nof her working, of course, along with her colleague, Senator Vitter, \nwho is on the committee, our committee came to Louisiana and held a \nvery unique hearing. We had many colleagues--I see Senator Cardin is on \nthe floor. He was there. We had a very good turnout, and Senator \nLandrieu was eloquent. She has been eloquent on the floor of the Senate \nin the past I look forward to hearing her remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California and \nall of my colleagues on this particular committee who have worked so \nhard. The ranking member, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, has also worked \nhard. But I have to say to this chairwoman who took the chairmanship of \nthis committee and said 7 years is enough time to wait, it is too long \nfor the people of Louisiana, for California, or Florida, or Maryland--\nmy good colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, who serves on this \ncommittee has been so forceful--she said: I am coming to Louisiana. I \nwant to see it for myself, particularly after Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita devastated our coast.\n  As the chairwoman knows, we lost 267 square miles of land in south \nLouisiana because of the storm and the devastation of the tides, the \nsurges, and the flooding. That is more than the whole District of \nColumbia, more than two and a half times the size of the 100 square \nmiles that represent the District of Columbia. This is a huge expanse \nof land that was lost.\n  This Senator said enough. We have been waiting too long. It has been \n7 long years. Today with this conference report vote that is going to \ntake place in about 2 hours, that wait will come to an end. The last \nstep Congress can take to send this bill off will have been taken. The \nconference report, hopefully, will be approved by a vast majority of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle. It would not have happened without \nSenator Boxer's leadership. I am, indeed, so grateful on behalf of the \npeople I represent in Louisiana.\n  This is a small map, but it shows my colleagues the vastness of the \nland we are trying to protect and preserve, this great wetlands, which \nis the green area shown on this chart. The Mississippi River comes \ndown, of course, through the mouth of the Mississippi River. This is \nthe Sabine River that divides Louisiana from Texas and the Pearl River \nthat serves as a boundary between Mississippi and Louisiana.\n  From east Texas, all of Louisiana, and for west Mississippi, this is \nan extremely important bill for our coastal regions. It is going to \nprovide historic\n\n[[Page S11975]]\n\nand first-time funding for a comprehensive wetlands restoration, a \ncombination of levees, wetlands restoration, and freshwater diversion \nprojects that are going to not only protect the 3.5 million people who \nlive south of the I-10--when people say to me, Senator, why do you live \nthere? I don't know exactly how to answer that question other than to \nsay we have been there for 300 years.\n  I don't know exactly why the first person--and that was before the \nNative Americans. That was after the Native Americans settled the land. \nI am speaking about when Bienville put up a stake along the Mississippi \nRiver. I would say there are any number of reasons, one of which is it \nwas absolutely imperative to settle on the mouth of the river for \nwestward expansion for the Nation. We couldn't have had a nation \nwithout the Mississippi River and the Louisiana Purchase, of which 19 \nStates now are made up from the Louisiana Purchase.\n  We remember our history. I cannot go into all the reasons, but they \nmost certainly are there with 300 years of history. There are 3 million \npeople who live here. We cannot relocate them. It would be cost \nprohibitive. We can only protect them. We have put in smart planning \nand smart zoning. That is what we are doing and have been doing. The \nparishes put up money, and the State, and the Federal Government, and \nthat is what we are doing.\n\n  I only have a few minutes remaining. I will speak later.\n  There is another way to look at the levee system that is crucial to \nprotect the people who live in south Louisiana. Unlike many States, we \ndo not have beaches. I have been to the beautiful beaches in \nCalifornia, and I want them preserved. I have been to some of the most \nbeautiful beaches in Virginia and North Carolina and throughout the \ncountry. We are the only State that does not have beaches. We only have \ntwo: Holly Beach which is 7 miles long--it was virtually destroyed in \nthe storm--and Grand Isle, which is 7 miles long. This coastline is \nthousands of miles long with only two little beaches. But we do have \nwetlands. We do not have people living on these wetlands. Sometimes \nthere is a little camp here or a little community there. But they are \nstuck on the high ridges. They have been living on ridges that can be \nprotected, and with the right kind of levees and the right kind of \ncomprehensive system such as is in the Netherlands and other places in \nthe world, this can be done. It takes commitment, it takes dedication, \nand it needs a steady stream of funding.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this is a fairly dramatic chart I want \nto show people. It is a little scary for me and, I am sure, the people \nI represent. It is also very scary for Florida, Virginia, North \nCarolina, and Georgia. This is the track of all hurricanes from 1955 to \n2005. This is what the southeastern part of this country has to brace \nitself for every year--year after year after year.\n  According to all reports, these storms are getting stronger and \nstronger and more numerous. We have been very blessed that we have not \nhad a critical storm this summer. But the season is still open until \nNovember.\n  This yellow track is the track of Katrina. This blue track is the \ntrack of Rita which actually hit 2 years ago today. I was down in \nCameron Parish on the corner of Louisiana, and east Texas is still \nhurting very badly, as well as our areas, from this storm. It has not \nrecovered yet.\n  My point is, this bill not only has projects for inland waterways and \nnavigation, but it provides vital projects for all of the southeastern \nUnited States and for the eastern seaboard to protect the people, the \ngreat industries, and manufacturing that are represented through all \nsorts of navigable waterways and ports that service this whole Nation.\n  Without this bill, this whole area will become significantly more \nvulnerable and open to storms, erosion, and surges. This is a very \ndramatic chart that shows what we are up against.\n  I am going to come back later and show some other charts, but in \nconclusion, this is a historic bill for Louisiana. It is extremely \nimportant for the Nation. For the first time we have authorized \nMorganza to the gulf which protects Houma, LA, a city not a lot of \npeople hear about, but it is a very important city. It is smaller than \nBaton Rouge, smaller than New Orleans, smaller than Lafayette, but it \nis crucial to the energy infrastructure of this Nation.\n  We have many small towns in south Louisiana that my colleagues will \nnot hear a lot about, but we store oil and gas there. We run pipelines \nthrough these towns. People are down there working their hearts out to \ngive us the energy security we need. The least we can do is protect \ntheir schools, their communities, their way of life, and their culture.\n  I thank Senator Boxer for allowing me to speak. I thank my colleague \nSenator Vitter, who is a member of this committee. He will be speaking \nin a moment. He has been extremely helpful, energetic, and forceful in \nhis advocacy for many of these projects. We have worked together. I am \nvery pleased that he has put so much time and effort into this bill.\n  I see my colleague from Florida, who also has made a historic \nbreakthrough on some projects, particularly the Everglades.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I also rise and join so many colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle in strong support of this Water Resources \nDevelopment Act conference report. Perhaps it is appropriate that we \nwill pass this historic legislation through the Senate today, September \n24, the 2-year anniversary of Hurricane Rita which devastated large \nparts of southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana.\n  Of course, less than a month ago, August 29, was the 2-year \nanniversary of Hurricane Katrina, also appropriate that we are finally \nmoving on this crucial legislation so near to that anniversary.\n  In fact, I would go so far as to say that as we still battle to \nrecover from those two devastating storms, as we still climb out of \nthat enormous setback in Louisiana, as we still face important work to \ndo related to that recovery in Congress, this conference report, this \nWRDA bill, is the single most important thing we can pass to help the \ngulf coast with that recovery, particularly medium and long term. That \nis how vital it is to improve hurricane flood protection. That is how \nessential it is to our very lifeblood survival recovery from the \ndevastating impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Of course, as virtually everyone, I am very frustrated about how long \nit took us to get to this moment--7 years--when a WRDA bill is expected \nto be passed every 2 years. But at least, I will also say, we have done \nsomething with that delay in improving the bill, particularly to take \naccount of the needs and the lessons learned coming out of those \ndevastating storms.\n  I first came to the Senate after the election of 2004, January 2005. \nThe first committee I was assigned to was the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, through which this WRDA bill, of course, passes. That \ncommittee works on this bill. Even when I first came to the Senate 3 \nyears ago, this bill was about 2 years overdue. So it has been a long \ntime coming. But we have worked on it, we have improved it, it has gone \nthrough the committee process, and it has gone through the conference \nprocess.\n  I also served on the conference committee. We finally have a very \ngood, robust product and, again, we have at least taken advantage of \nthat time lapse to learn the lessons of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and \nto include key positions that Louisiana and the gulf coast need for \ntheir recovery and, indeed, survival.\n  What crucial provisions are included in this bill? A 100-year level \nof hurricane protection. President Bush, in his famous Jackson Square \nspeech in mid-September 2005, made a clear, firm, and historic \ncommitment to that very high level of hurricane protection.\n  This bill embodies that commitment and passes it into law. It takes \nseveral steps forward toward that 100-year level of protection.\n  Recently the Corps determined that level of protection doesn't exist \nin the\n\n[[Page S11976]]\n\ngreater New Orleans area. We are between 2 and 16 feet vertically \ndeficient in terms of our levees throughout the greater New Orleans \narea. This bill fully authorizes addressing that shortfall.\n  The second key component of the bill, moving on into the future, is a \ngreater level of hurricane protection even beyond the 100-year level, \nwhat we in south Louisiana call category 5 protection. In prior \nlegislation, some of the supplemental appropriation bills we passed on \nan emergency basis after the hurricanes, we told the Corps to get to \nwork studying and designing that higher level of protection. This bill \nfurther refines that mandate and directs the Corps in no uncertain \nterms to offer specific project recommendations toward that \nfundamentally higher, sounder level of protection.\n  A third crucial component is coastal restoration. As my colleague \nfrom Louisiana has referred to, Louisiana has lost enormous amounts of \nland, having it vanish into the gulf due to coastal land loss. We have \nlost more land than exists in the entire State of Delaware. Right now, \nas we speak, we lose a football field of land every 38 minutes, and \nthat is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. It goes on and \non and on. This bill begins to address in a very serious way that \nnational emergency. This bill authorizes an ambitious coastal \nrestoration plan.\n  Again, the bill is long overdue, but we have made use of that delay. \nWhen I first came to the Senate, the WRDA bill then under consideration \nonly devoted about $400 million to this national crisis of coastal land \nloss. It only authorized one specific project. We knew we had to do \nmore. We saw we had to do more because of the experiences of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, and so now we authorize around $4 billion of this \ncrucial work, with 17 specific coastal restoration projects fully \nauthorized.\n  Corps reform, another crucial provision, is embodied in the bill, \nalthough I think we do Corps reform right, particularly with regard to \nLouisiana projects. One of the most bitter lessons of Hurricane Katrina \nin particular was that the Corps had made serious engineering and other \nmistakes in the past which led to the levee breaches and devastating \nflooding throughout the New Orleans area. We had to reform the process \nto make sure that never happened again. We had to bring in outside \nengineering and other expertise to integrate with the expertise within \nthe Corps to make sure those sorts of mistakes were never made again.\n  I drafted, with the help of others, Corps reform provisions that are \nin this bill, some of them specific to Louisiana projects. For the \nfirst time ever, we fully integrate hurricane, coastal, flood \nprotection, and navigation programs within Louisiana and we mandate a \nspecific integration team that will help that become reality so that \none type of project isn't done in isolation.\n  We establish the Louisiana Water Resources Council to improve the \nefficiency and performance of projects. That is a very important part \nof Corps reform. We expedite the process so that, hopefully, no longer \nwill it take an average of 13 years--13 years--for an average Corps \nproject to even get to the stage where the first shovel hits the \nground.\n  This bill contains so many other crucial provisions--closing of the \nMRGO, major improvements to the Bonnet Carre diversion alternative, \nmajor hurricane protection improvements to the lower Jefferson Parish \nand Lafourche Parish, and crucial work in the southwest part of the \nState, where Hurricane Rita caused devastating damage, including deeper \naccess to the Port of Iberia, coupled with greater flood and hurricane \nprotection for Vermilion Parish, and improved dredging and navigation \non the Calcasieu River, and on and on and on. This bill is a lifeline \nfor our continued survival in Louisiana.\n  As we move forward, I thank all of the folks who worked so hard to \nproduce this bill, certainly including the leadership of my EPW \nCommittee, the chair, Chairman Boxer, the ranking member, Senator \nInhofe, and the chair and ranking member of the subcommittee of \njurisdiction, Senators Isakson and Baucus, and all of their very \ndevoted staff. As we move on, I urge all of us to join together to pass \nthe bill, and then to either avoid Presidential veto or, if necessary, \nhopefully work immediately in a bipartisan fashion to override that \nveto and ensure that this crucial legislation, crucial for the very \nsurvival of Louisiana, becomes law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a little UC to take care of the \npeople on the floor right now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be allowed to speak for \nup to 5 minutes; Senator Nelson for up to 10 minutes, and Senator \nBaucus for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator wish for the \nMembers to speak in that order?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. And, for now, this will be it, but I will do a \nsecond UC to include Senator Landrieu for another 10 at a later time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the chair of the committee for \nyielding me this time, and I rise today in support of the conference \nreport for the Water Resources Development Act. This legislation \nauthorizes important studies and projects to protect and maintain water \nresources throughout our country.\n  I am especially pleased that the conference report includes $26.9 \nmillion for Camp Ellis, ME. More than 100 years ago, the Army Corps \nbuilt a jetty extending out from the Saco River, adjacent to Camp Ellis \nBeach. This jetty altered the pattern of currents and sand and it is \nthe primary cause of the devastating erosion at Camp Ellis. The extent \nof the erosion is truly shocking. Some 36 houses have been washed into \nthe sea in the last 100 years. The 1998 shoreline is 400 feet from \nwhere the shoreline stood in 1908. The houses that are now in danger \nwere once six or more houses back from the sea.\n  In April of this year, a devastating Patriot's Day storm hit Maine \nwith heavy winds and a great deal of rain. This terrible storm, the \nworst natural disaster to strike Maine since the ice storm of 1998, \ncaused massive storm surges, astronomically high tides, and inland and \ncoastal flooding.\n  Let me show my colleagues some of the evidence of the devastation \nthat was caused by this April storm. As you can see, this is the road \nthat follows along the waterfront. It was utterly devastated. In \nanother picture I will show my colleagues, this is what happened to \nsome of the houses that were along the waterfront. As you can see, they \nwere completely destroyed as the water took out the foundations and \ncaused terrible destruction. That is a power pole that has been thrown \ndown by the storm. In yet another example, a house has been absolutely \nruined as a result of this storm.\n  Now, when the jetty was first constructed 100 years ago, we didn't \nhave the knowledge we do now, and no one predicted the terrible impact. \nThe incredible force of the ocean during the storm earlier this year \nliterally washed out the foundations of the homes. The street that once \nran along the ocean front was largely destroyed, leaving nothing \nbetween the remaining homes and the open ocean. Many homeowners in the \narea were still dealing with flooded basements for weeks following the \nstorm. This was a vivid reminder of the terrible impact a powerful \nstorm can have on those who live in this vulnerable community.\n  The sea has advanced such that another large storm could wash out the \npeninsula altogether and turn Camp Ellis into an island. That, \nobviously, would be devastating to the people who live there.\n  We know what must be done to prevent such a calamity. Studies \nundertaken at the direction of the Army Corps of Engineers indicate \nthat an offshore breakwater and a spur coming off the jetty are likely \nto be needed to protect Camp Ellis from further erosion and the \ndestruction of even more property. The Camp Ellis jetty was built by \nthe Federal Government at a time when the erosional impacts of \nshoreline structures were largely unknown. The jetty has served its \nimportant navigational purpose well over the 100-plus years of its \nexistence, but now it is time for the Federal Government to make good \non its obligation to help those people who have been harmed by the \nstructure the Federal Government built in the first place.\n\n[[Page S11977]]\n\n  With the passage of the Water Resources Development Act, we will \nfinally have authorized the funds necessary to act upon the best \navailable science and to fully and finally protect the residents of \nCamp Ellis. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report, and \nagain I thank the committee for being responsive to the concerns of the \npeople of Maine.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, a commitment takes a lot more \nthan lip service and nice words to restore ecosystems, and particularly \necosystems that have been manipulated by mankind and distorted as has \nhappened with the Florida Everglades. When I talk about commitment, I \nwant to talk about Senator Boxer. This lady, in only a few months, \nafter waiting for 7 years, with all other leadership flailing about and \nnot making it happen--this lady, our chair of the Environment \nCommittee, has made it happen and it is going to be passed. We are \ngoing to do it today, and we all hope the President will not veto it. \nBut with the separation of powers under our constitution, we have a way \nof enacting law over a President's veto, and that is better than a two-\nthirds vote in both Houses of Congress to enact it into law despite the \nveto of the President. We hope we don't have to do that, but if we do, \nwe will. Then we can set things right and we can get about the \nrestoration.\n  I want to tell the Senate about this incredible area known as the \nEverglades. This is a compendium of satellite imagery over a 4-year \nperiod. This is at the southern tip of Florida. This is Lake \nOkeechobee, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Homestead, and the \nbeginning of the Florida Keys. This is a road which was constructed in \nthe 1920s, to get from Miami to Naples, called the Tamiami Trail. This \nis a road which was constructed to get from Fort Lauderdale to Naples--\nInterstate 75--called Alligator Alley. This, of course, was constructed \nmuch more recently--sometime about 25 years ago--and was constructed \nwith box culverts so that there would be proper water flows.\n\n  But you can imagine, back in the 1920s they didn't think about that. \nWhen they built the Tamiami Trail, it in effect created a dike that, as \nthe water flowed south out of Okeechobee, in the historical Mother \nNature patterns, and would flow in this sheet flow to the south into \nFlorida Bay and into the gulf of Mexico, it was suddenly stopped by \nthis dike, which was the roadbed.\n  So part of this bill called Modified Waters is to correct that, \nhaving additional flows come underneath and then eventually to \nconstruct a long bridge or bridges here, which will enhance the flow of \nthe water. Why enhance the flow of the water? That is what Mother \nNature intended. The water actually starts way north, just south of \nOrlando. It flows in a meandering stream called the Kissimmee River \ninto Lake Okeechobee and historically spilled over out of Lake \nOkeechobee and flowed in a massive sheet flow in this direction, \nsouthernly and southwesterly, until the hurricanes of the 1920s, in \nwhich over 2,000 people were killed, drowned, and the whole idea was to \ncome in and start diking and draining for flood control. But in so \ndoing, they messed up what Mother Nature intended.\n  About the year 2000, when the comprehensive Everglades restoration \nproject was passed, it was to now accommodate for several different \nthings. First of all, the water had been diverted, so that had to be \nchanged. But the fact is that now 6 million people are living here. \nThat wasn't the case in early Florida. And a vast agricultural industry \nhad developed on the south end of the lake. To give the water needs to \nthe Everglades and the Everglades National Park and to the 6 million \npeople and to the agricultural interests--that, put together, is the \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Ever since that was enacted, \nwe have not had an authorization bill to authorize the projects to \nimplement this plan. So I again give kudos to Senator Boxer for \nbringing this up and making it happen fast.\n  What we have, then, is a major project in this bill called the Indian \nRiver Lagoon. This is the Indian River up here. I happened to grow up, \nas a child, on this river. At times, that and the St. Lucie River \nflowing into the Indian River Lagoon is like a dead river because of \nthe excessive nutrients from lower Lake Okeechobee flowing to \nTidewater. The same to the west, down the Caloosahatchee River, down to \nFort Myers--excessive nutrients create a dead river.\n  I couldn't believe it. A couple of years ago, I went out on that \nriver right there, the St. Lucie River. First of all, there was a \nbright-green algae bloom. You know what that means. That means algae is \nsucking up the oxygen from the river, and therefore all the living \nthings that depend on that river are not going to be there. I didn't \nsee the mullet jumping. I didn't see the porpoises rolling. I didn't \nsee Mr. Osprey diving into the water to get his dinner. I didn't see \nMr. Eagle sitting over in the dead pine tree waiting for Mr. Osprey to \ncatch his dinner for him. It was a dead river. That is one of the \nreasons for one of these major projects called the Indian River Lagoon, \nand that is authorized. Then we have to appropriate the money and get \nit done.\n  There is another area here called the Picayune Spring. It is a highly \nendangered area because of the encroachment of development and the \nnecessary waterflows. It, also, is addressed as well as what I talked \nabout, this dike, which is the roadbed, called the Tamiami Trail.\n  What we have is a comprehensive plan for what Marjorie Stoneman \nDouglas, when she wrote of her great love of these Florida Everglades, \ntermed the ``River of Grass.''\n  I will conclude with this. Senator Boxer and her husband were kind \nenough to go down to the Everglades with me a few weeks ago. It was \nthis incredible sight. As we glided over this river of grass in an \nairboat and as the Sun began to set and as the shadows lengthened, as \nwe came out of the river of grass into the Big Cypress Preserve with \nthese stands of cypress trees, with that little light available right \nat dusk, it looked as if we were in this beautiful meadow of grass with \nthe tree stands. Suddenly, reality struck when we saw a mother doe and \nher two fawns--instead of bounding over the hills of the grass, they \nwere jumping over the grass out of the water and back into the water, \nin this incredible place, the location of fauna and flora.\n  The Everglades does not just affect Florida. It doesn't just affect \nthe Western Hemisphere. Major environmental sites that are ecologically \nthreatened affect the climate of planet Earth, our home.\n  I am so grateful that we have this bill up and that we are going to \npass it with huge numbers today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2007.\n  First, I deeply congratulate the chair of the committee, Senator \nBoxer. She worked very hard and on a strong bipartisan basis to get \nthis legislation where it is, working with Senator Inhofe. I thank him \nequally.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Isakson, the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, concerning this legislation.\n  And hats off to Senator Jim Jeffords. Senator Jeffords and his \nstaffer, Catharine Ransom, deserve special thanks because for years \nthey have been working on this legislation. I wanted first to thank him \nfor his efforts as well. I know if he were here with us today, he would \nbe very happy getting this legislation passed.\n  We westerners have been plagued recently with several years of \ndrought. Ranchers and farmers across my State of Montana have watched \ntheir livelihood dry up before their eyes. The West's battle with \ndrought highlights the pressing needs to ensure our water resources are \nused efficiently because it does not rain in the West. It may rain in \nWashington, DC, and other parts of the country, but it doesn't rain in \nthe West.\n  This conference report provides authority for the Army Corps of \nEngineers to move forward with long overdue water resources projects. \nLevees are crumbling, people are living in harm's way waiting for this \nlegislation. The tragedy in Minnesota highlights that need. This \nconference report authorizes projects that will provide needed flood \nand storm damage protection, navigation improvements, and environmental \nrestoration. Clearly, there\n\n[[Page S11978]]\n\nis authority here well needed, long overdue, for rebuilding and \nrestoring the coast of Louisiana, devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita.\n  Several projects are very important to my State of Montana: the \nYellowstone River and tributaries recovery project; the Lower \nYellowstone Project at Intake, MT; the Missouri River and tributaries \nrecovery project; the upper basin of the Missouri River project; and a \nriverfront revitalization project in Missoula.\n  There is also a very important authorization for the rehabilitation \nand improvement of a very important aging water project we called the \nHi-Line Region of Montana, called the St. Mary diversion. This system \nis rusting, it is cracking, and it is crumbling. If you go out and see \nit, you are stunned how much this is deteriorating. But 17,000 \nMontanans on the Hi-Line depend on this 90-year-old system for their \ndrinking water. Without St. Mary, lower Milk River would go dry 6 out \nof every 10 years, imperiling the water source to thousands of Montana \nfamilies.\n  These projects and their importance to the communities and the \nprojects they serve underlie the need for this conference report. We \npassed it last year. Let's get it enacted again this year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before my friend begins, I wanted to get \nthe parliamentary situation, if he will yield for a minute?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is my understanding that Senator Feingold has up to 30 \nminutes to speak on the bill. He and I discussed it. If he has any \nadded time, he has graciously agreed to yield it to me with the \nunderstanding that if he wants additional time, I will get it back to \nhim later. But I think, if it is necessary for me to make such a \nrequest, I ask unanimous consent that whatever time the Senator yields \nback be yielded back to me with the understanding he will be able to \nspeak again if he so chooses.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin has 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If I do not use all the time, I will certainly be happy \nto yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mr. President, I will oppose the conference report on the Water \nResources Development Act. For 7 years, I have worked with Senator \nMcCain and many of our colleagues on essential reforms of the Corps of \nEngineers and have long anticipated the day the Congress enacts \nmeaningful reform.\n  Unfortunately, today is not that day, and this is not the reform bill \nthe country needs.\n  After a decade of Government and independent reports calling for \nreforming the Corps and pointing out stunning flaws in Corps projects \nand project studies, and after the tragic failures of New Orleans' \nlevees during Hurricane Katrina, the American people deserve meaningful \nreforms to ensure the projects the Corps builds are safe, appropriate, \nenvironmentally responsible, and fiscally sound. The urgency and \nnecessity could not be clearer.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report includes weak reforms. The \nSenate twice voted in support of strong reform language, when it passed \nWRDA bills earlier this year and last Congress. But the conference \nreport we are about to vote on has been stripped of many important \nsafeguards that would ensure accountability and prevent the Corps from \nmanipulating the process. We have compromised enough over the years. We \ncan no longer afford a system that favors wasteful projects over the \nneeds of the American people.\n  The bill brought back from conference is particularly disappointing \nbecause a few months ago, on May 15, Senators Reid, Boxer, and I \nentered into a colloquy in which we agreed the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee would ensure the strong Senate reforms would be \nthe minimum reforms coming out of conference and enacted into law. That \nagreement, apparently, has counted for little.\n  I am particularly troubled by the changes made to the bill's \nindependent review provision during negotiations between the House and \nthe Senate. The Senate version of the bill included a strong \nindependent review provision, which I successfully offered as an \namendment to last year's bill and which was again included in this \nyear's WRDA.\n  Subjecting Corps of Engineers project studies to a review by an \nindependent panel of experts will help ensure future Corps projects do \nnot waste taxpayer money or endanger public safety and that \nenvironmental impacts are avoided or minimized.\n  Unfortunately, the independent review provision included in the \nconference report was significantly weakened in several respects. \nFirst, it does not ensure independence of the review process. Under the \nconference report, the supposedly ``independent'' review is not \nindependent. The review process is run by the Corps rather than outside \nthe Agency, as required by the Senate bill.\n  The Corps Chief of Engineers is given significant authority to decide \nthe timing of review, the projects to be reviewed, and whether to \nimplement a review panel's recommendations, and, apparently, even has \nthe ability to control the flow of information received by the review \npanel.\n  The Corps was not given the authority to determine the scope of the \nreview, but in these other respects, it was given far too much \nauthority, all of which will compromise the independence of the review \nthat is performed.\n  Second, it terminates the independent review provision 7 years after \nenactment. It is reasonable for Congress to continually evaluate how \nthe program is working, but to presume there is not a need for a long-\nterm review and set a sunset date is irresponsible.\n  Independent reviews should be permanently integrated into the Corp's \nplanning process. The burden should be on the Corps to demonstrate why \nit does not need a congressionally mandated review process, rather than \non Congress to wage another battle to extend the requirement in 7 \nyears.\n  Third, it allows the Corps to exempt projects. The Senate provisions \nestablished mandatory review when clear triggers are met. However, the \nconference report gives the Corps fairly broad discretion to decide \nwhat projects get reviewed. It expands the House's loophole allowing \nthe Corps to exempt projects that exceed the mandatory $45 million cost \ntrigger. The Corps can exempt Continuing Authority Program projects, \ncertain rehabilitation projects, and, most egregiously, projects it \ndetermines are not controversial or only require an Environmental \nAssessment rather than a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement.\n  It is this very decision, whether to do an EA or an EIS, that is \noften in need of review. Furthermore, a project's economic \njustification, engineering analysis, and formulation of project \nalternatives are critical elements that should be looked at for all \nmajor projects, not just those with significant environmental impact.\n  The conference report also prevents review of most ongoing studies. \nAlthough the conference report allows the Corps to exempt projects from \nreview, it does not give the Corps equal authority to include projects. \nThe bill includes restrictive language that prevents the Corps from \nreviewing studies that were initiated more than 2 years ago, or that \nwere initiated in the last 2 years but already have an ``array of \nalternatives'' identified, which occurs early in the process.\n  The Senate language would have allowed the Corps to initiate a review \nfor any project that does not have a draft feasibility report.\n  The conference report also eliminates the requirement that a review \nis mandatory if requested by a Federal agency. The Senate bill would \nhave made a project review mandatory if requested by a Federal agency \nwith the authority to review Corps projects. Instead, the conference \nreport gives the Corps the authority to reject the request and requires \nthe Federal agency to appeal the decision to the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality.\n\n[[Page S11979]]\n\n  The Corps should be required to conduct a review made by the head of \nanother agency that is charged with reviewing Corps projects or, at a \nminimum, to justify to the Council on Environmental Quality why it \nwants to deny such a request.\n  The final problem I wish to highlight is the conference report does \nnot make sure the Corps is accountable. The conference report \neliminated a key provision in the Senate bill that ensured \naccountability. Specifically, the provision would have required that if \na project ends up in court, the same weight is given to the panel and \nthe Corps' opinion if the Corps cannot provide a good example for why \nit ignored the panel's recommendations. By dropping this accountability \nrequirement, the conference report allows the Corps to ignore the \npanel's recommendations, as the Corps is currently doing with its own \ninternal review process.\n\n  I would love to be able to join my colleagues in claiming this is a \n``historic moment.'' I am pleased that some of the other reforms I \nfought for are included in this bill. We have come a long way in the \nlast 7 years, as evidenced by the overwhelming bipartisan majority of \nmy colleagues who supported the Senate's reforms last year and again \nearlier this year.\n  But we have not come far enough, and that is truly regrettable. Why \nshould the taxpayers of this country have to continue wondering if \ntheir dollars are being spent on projects that lack merit, hurt the \nenvironment or are not entirely reliable? Is not Congress finally \nwilling to put an end to the longtime practice of doling out projects \nto Members regardless of those projects' merits? How many more flawed \nprojects or wasted dollars will it take before we say enough?\n  I am pleased the conference report contains some modest reforms, but \nwe can do much better than that. In fact, we did much better than that \nwhen we passed the Senate bill not long ago. Congress needs to get this \nright; I think the stakes are too high.\n  Unfortunately, for the reasons I have explained, the conference \nreport fails to do enough. It contains severely compromised language \nthat does not fix the status quo under which Congress uses the Corps to \nfund pet projects that are not justified or adequately reviewed.\n  I wish to also express my concern with the cost of the bill which has \nballooned to $23 billion, $23 billion from the $14, $15 billion cost of \nthe House and Senate versions.\n  Nearly $1 billion of the additional cost is for 19 projects that were \nadded during conference, neither the Senate nor the House has \npreviously reviewed these projects.\n  My colleagues have previously stood on the Senate floor and said the \ncost of the bill does not matter because WRDA is merely an authorizing \nbill and not an appropriations bill. We will sort out our priorities \nlater, they say.\n  I think the American taxpayers join me in saying this is absolutely \nirresponsible and shirks our responsibilities as elected officials.\n  There is already a $58 billion backlog of construction projects \npreviously authorized, and with only $2 billion annually appropriated \nfor project construction, this means the Nation's most pressing needs \nface significant competition for funding and likely delays.\n  Furthermore, this bill authorizes a significant number of projects \nand studies that are beyond the Corps' primary mission areas. The Corps \ncannot be everything to everyone, and Congress does need to discipline \nitself and set priorities.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues to institute a system for \nprioritizing Corps projects and other critical reforms. We may have an \nopportunity to pass those reforms sooner than some had hoped. The \nadministration has indicated the President will veto this bill, this \nbloated bill.\n  Rather than overriding a veto, I hope the Congress will use that veto \nas an opportunity to rethink the flawed mindset that resulted in this \nbill and in previous WRDA bills. We do not do our constituents favors \nby spending their tax dollars on projects that are not justified or \nfully reviewed. We need reforms to make sure these tax dollars are \nspent in the most important priorities, not just on members' pork.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the WRDA conference report.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DURBIN.) The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate EPW Chair Boxer \nand Ranking Member Inhofe for bringing a balanced and much needed bill \nto the floor.\n  Normally this bill is a 2-year authorization, but there has not been \na bill, a WRDA bill, during this administration. So I will call it the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2001.\n  Now, my State has nearly 1,000 miles of Missouri and Mississippi \nRiver frontage in addition to our lakes. Our communities rely on Corps \nprojects for affordable water, transportation, flood protection, energy \nproduction, environmental protection, and recreational opportunities.\n  Nobody knows better than the farmers of Missouri and the Midwest how \nimportant river transportation is to serve the world market. This bill \nfor my constituents means jobs, trade competitiveness, reliable and \naffordable energy, drinking water, and protection from floods, which \ncan ruin property and kill people.\n  This is not of minor importance to those out in the world, in the \nMidwest, who work for a living. I am delighted we are completing our \nlong journey to permit modernization of the Mississippi River locks. \nThese locks were built during the Great Depression for paddle wheel \nboats 75 years ago. They were designed to last 50 years.\n  Well, they are 25 years past their design lifetime. This is a long, \nmuch needed, overdue investment in infrastructure, jobs, trade \ncompetitiveness, and environmental protection.\n  Sixty percent of all grain exports move through the bottleneck of \nobsolete locks. Some 30 percent of oil is shipped by barge, by \nwaterway, a significant amount of coal, of cement, of fertilizer. A \nsingle medium-sized barge tow carries the same amount of freight as 870 \ntrucks. There is a comparison for railroad, but the railroads are so \nfull they cannot carry any more; they are at capacity. But it carries \nsomething akin to 2\\1/2\\ trainloads.\n  These facts speak volumes for the cost, pollution, and fuel \nefficiencies of river transportation. Throughout this long and arduous \nprocess to complete a 2-year bill in 7 years, we have been blessed with \nstrong bipartisan support for modernizing the locks. I have already \nreferred to the relationship of our EPW Committee.\n  Senator Grassley has been supportive of this from the start. We would \nnot be here today without Senator Harkin, the occupant of the chair, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Obama, Senator McCaskill, and others from the \nMidwest playing a key role in this becoming law. I express my \ngratitude.\n  Outside Congress, modernization of the old bottleneck looks has won \nthe untiring support of agriculture, the waterways community, industry, \nlabor, and community leaders. I am concerned the administration may \nveto this bill because they say it is too big. Well, if it were a \nnormal 2-year bill, it would be big. But this is a 7-year bill; taking \ninto account three cycles which we should have and have not yet passed \na WRDA bill. So it is big by historic standards.\n  When we total the three WRDA bills passed during the 5-year periods \nof 1996 to 2000, a 5-year period, the authorization levels totaled \nalmost the same as this 7-year bill, almost $21 billion.\n  Now, if there is a veto, I look forward to overriding it on a \nbipartisan basis as soon as action can be scheduled. This is an \nauthorization bill. Without appropriations, it spends nothing. As \nSenators know, this bill simply adds projects to the list of items \neligible for appropriations subject to the binding budget limitations \nfaced under the appropriations process.\n  Put another way, this is a license to hunt. You still to have hit the \nbird and you can't go over the limit. So all it is is a license to ask \nfor appropriations. The backlog of unfunded items often referred to by \nopponents of this bill is unfunded because many of the projects are not \nsufficiently high priority within tight budgets. Some may be very good \nprojects but they do not make the cut given the limited budget. Does it \nmake sense to say that bills passed\n\n[[Page S11980]]\n\nmany years ago have to be funded before we can take a fresh look at \npriorities facing our waterway infrastructure and other waterway needs? \nI don't think so. Priorities change. Right now these items in this bill \nare the priorities that have been thoroughly vetted by the Corps, by \nall those who have input, and by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee in our body and in the Transportation Infrastructure \nCommittee on the other side. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  To oppose new authorizations is simply a way to pretend to save money \nwithout saving money, while unwisely assuming that all currently \nauthorized projects are of a higher priority than the newly authorized \nprojects contained in this bill. In many ways, this will cost money, \nand I will talk about that in a minute. But if there were to be a veto, \nthe unfortunate message for water States and agricultural States in the \nMidwest is that water resources are not a high priority to this \nadministration, despite the expectation of many supporters in 2000, \nwhen supporters of waterways in Missouri came out in record numbers to \ncarry the State for the current President. The previous administration \nwas not supportive and this administration is no better. Our concerns \nstarted with proposed construction budget cuts. Then they fired Mike \nParker, a strong proponent of water resources. Then they underfunded \nflood control and navigation on the Missouri River. Now it would be \ncapped off by vetoing WRDA. I truly hope that doesn't happen. They \nwould get a grade for consistency, except that they say they support \naggressive trade policies. But they say nothing about the \ntransportation capacity vital to move the goods they want to trade, so \nthey say. Bulk commodities can't be faxed or e-mailed or Fed-Ex'd or \nUPS'd in the real world to the rest of the world. Again, on our \nwaterways in Missouri, one medium-size barge tow carries the same \nfreight as 870 trucks with cost, pollution, fuel efficiencies, economic \nand environmental benefits that are obvious to all.\n  I was interested to read a November 2005 article in the Washington \nTimes which reported that the President noted during a press conference \nwith Panamanian President Torrijos: `` . . . it's in our nation's \ninterest that this canal be modernized.'' I know the administration \ndoes not oppose modernizing the Social Security-age locks on the \nMississippi River, built during the Depression for paddle-wheel boats, \nbut they also have not yet even endorsed it. Yet there was a rousing \nendorsement for upgrading the waterways in Panama. My colleagues and my \nconstituents back home believe our midwestern exporters deserve as much \nconsideration as Chinese exporters who transit the Panama Canal. I \nremain hopeful the administration will agree.\n  While no two of us would write the bill the same way, I am pleased so \nmuch work was done for so long by so many to find a compromise that \ncould serve the diverse needs of a nation that needs water resources to \nfunction. Among a very long list, this bill is supported by the \nNational Corn Growers Association, the Carpenters, operating engineers, \nlaborers, American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Soybean \nAssociation, and scores of members of the Waterway Counsel from coast \nto coast, communities large and small.\n  Our staffs have been working tirelessly on this not for days or for \nweeks but years. It has been a long process. We have gotten to know \nthem like family. There is almost some regret in knowing that our \nfamily will be broken up when this bill is signed into law. But maybe \nwe can get back on schedule and have another WRDA bill in 2 years. The \nstaff has been tremendous. They took on tough issues, set up difficult \ncriteria, helped to sort through competing objectives, and they never \nquit. While there were many who worked very hard on this over the \nyears, including Andy Wheeler, Ruth Van Mark, Angie Giancarlo, Ken \nKopocis, Jeff Rosato, Tyler Rushford, Jo-Ellen Darcy, Mike Quiello, and \nothers, I especially thank the bipartisan staff support of Let Mon Lee \nwith the committee. Let Mon has been working with us for all these \nyears. He is truly part of our family. We would hate to lose him, but \nif that is the price for passing WRDA, so be it.\n  The success of our economy and its people owes a great debt to \ninvestments that were made by those before us. I urge my colleagues to \nmake the investments now that will be providing the benefits for future \ngenerations and vote in favor of an opportunity and value for our \nfuture. We were reminded tragically a few weeks ago in Minnesota of the \nneed to be vigilant in upgrading our infrastructure. When you see what \nhappened in Minnesota, we saw a bridge collapse. There was a tragic \nloss of life. There was some disruption of commerce. But if one of \nthese locks midway on the river between Missouri and Illinois at the \nbottom of the chain fails completely and bailing wire and chewing gum \ncan only hold back the river so long and they leak not like sieves but \nby continuous sheets of water, if one of those locks were to blow out \nand fail, the impact on our economy, on commerce, would be huge, the \nimpact we almost felt when Katrina shut off the mouth of the \nMississippi River in Louisiana. Fortunately, they got that undone in a \ncouple of days. But even papers that don't normally think about water \ncommerce and agriculture were saying what a danger this was. A failure \nof one of these locks, one of these half-size, outdated, overaged locks \ncould tremendously cripple our economy, put our rural economies into a \nsignificant downturn.\n  I urge our leadership in this body to move quickly for a speedy \noverride vote should a veto materialize. But again, my thanks, my \ncongratulations, and deep appreciation to the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee leadership and the diligent staff who have brought us \nto this point.\n  It is time we pass the 2001 WRDA bill. It may be 6 years late, but it \nis even more needed now than it was in 2001.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is it a fact that I have 34 minutes \nremaining on my manager's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Feingold graciously said he would yield me the \nremainder of his time with the understanding that if he needed more, I \nwould give him some of it. So what is his amount that is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that that be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, again, in a way I am glad I didn't have a \nchance to speak before because there has been so much interest in this \nbill that I waited until we had a little quieter time on the floor, \nalthough several are coming.\n  Part of our work is making sure that in coordination with local \ngovernments and State governments and communities and the American \npeople, we do what we need to do so we can build our economy, so our \neconomy has behind it the infrastructure it needs. What happens when an \ninfrastructure fails? We saw that in Minnesota when the bridge \ncollapsed.\n  I am proud the Environment and Public Works Committee held a very \nstrong hearing at the behest of Senator Klobuchar, and we are moving \nforward on a way to ensure that we can fund those kinds of \nimprovements. We saw what happens when water infrastructure fails, when \nwe look at what happened in Hurricane Katrina. We saw that the levees \nwe thought were built to protect against category 5 storms simply \ndidn't stand up.\n  There is no way we can talk our way out of the problem we face in \nAmerica. The problem we face is we have an aging infrastructure. \nWhether it is our roads or bridges, our highways, or our water \ninfrastructure, these need attention. That is why today is such an \nimportant day and why I am so proud to stand here, because even though \nnot every Member will support this bill, I would say almost every \nMember will. Senator Feingold was eloquent and he was disappointed that \nwe didn't do everything he and Senator McCain asked us on Corps reform. \nI understand that. We are very close friends and colleagues. The fact \nis, I see it a little differently. We went a very long way. I know he \nand I have our differences. What I wish to do, rather than take the\n\n[[Page S11981]]\n\ntime to engage in an argument, is to place in the Record the program \nhighlights of Corps reform initiatives that are in this bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Water Resources Development Act of 2007 Corps Reform Initiatives--\n                           Program Highlights\n\n\n                           Independent Review\n\n       Creates a truly independent review process of projects \n     through a program of mandatory reviews with reviewers \n     selected by the independent National Academy of Sciences.\n       Projects over $45 million (with an expanded definition to \n     include beach nourishment projects), controversial projects, \n     and projects where a governor requests a review will all be \n     subject to independent review.\n       The review applies to project studies plus environmental \n     impact statements.\n       The review panels will be able examine all aspects of the \n     environmental, economic, and engineering aspects of the \n     proposed project.\n       The review panels will have the opportunity to receive, \n     evaluate, and comment upon input from States, local \n     governments, and the public.\n       Recommendations of the review panel must be a part of the \n     public project record, and any rejection of the \n     recommendations must be explained in the record.\n       The costs of the review are Federal and are not contingent \n     upon future appropriations.\n\n\n                        Safety Assurance Reviews\n\n       Creates a new responsibility to have outside experts review \n     and assist the Corps of Engineers in the design and \n     construction of flood damage reduction or hurricane and storm \n     damage reduction projects to improve the performance of these \n     critical, life-saving projects.\n\n\n                               Mitigation\n\n       Corps projects would have to comply with the same \n     mitigation standards and policies established under section \n     404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as any other \n     entity.\n       Corps mitigation plans must provide for the same or greater \n     ecosystem values as those lost to a water resources project \n     through implementation of not less than in-kind mitigation.\n       Corps studies must include detailed mitigation plans that \n     can be evaluated by the public and the Congress, including \n     specific statements on the ability to carry out the \n     mitigation plan.\n       Eliminates the Senate language that could have delayed \n     mitigation up to one year.\n       Establishes requirements for the Corps to conduct \n     monitoring of mitigation implementation until ecological \n     success criteria are met. In evaluating success, the Corps \n     must consult yearly with applicable Federal and State \n     agencies on mitigation status.\n       The increased mitigation requirements apply to all new \n     studies and any other project that must be reevaluated for \n     any reason.\n       Requires the Corps to develop and implement a publicly \n     available mitigation reporting system.\n\n\n                   Planning Principles and Guidelines\n\n       Requires the Secretary to revise the planning Principles \n     and Guidelines for the first time since 1983. The process \n     must be in consultation with Federal agencies, and must \n     solicit and consider public and expert comments.\n       The factors to be included in the revised Principles and \n     Guidelines include the elements from both the Senate and \n     House bills, ensuring the broadest look at the existing \n     document and incorporating the most current and accurate \n     concepts.\n       Establshes a national policy to maximize sustainable \n     economic development, avoid the unwise use of floodplains and \n     minimize adverse impacts and vulnerabilities in floodplains; \n     and protect and restore the functions of natural systems and \n     mitigate any unavoidable impacts.\n       Requires a comprehensive report on U.S. vulnerabilities and \n     comparative risks related to flooding.\n\n\n                        Watershed-based Planning\n\n       Increases Federal participation in watershed-based planning \n     to eliminate the lack of integration of the \n     interconnectedness of projects--a major short-coming of the \n     failure of the hurricane protection in New Orleans.\n\n\n                              Levee Safety\n\n       Creates a National Levee Safety Assessment program, in \n     cooperation with the States, to address the lack of \n     information on and assessment of levees.\n       Creates a publicly available database with an inventory of \n     levees.\n       Requires a Federal inspection and public disclosure of all \n     Federally-owned or operated levees, all Federally constructed \n     but non-Federally operated levees, and non-Federally \n     constructed levees if requested by the owner.\n\n\n                       Other Program Improvements\n\n       Expedites the process for deauthorizing the unconstructed \n     backlog of projects.\n       Creates a Federal responsibility to participate in the \n     monitoring of ecosystem restoration projects to ensure \n     project success.\n       Allows for non-profit entities to partner with the Corps of \n     Engineers in implementing projects, which is especially \n     important on small-scale environmental restoration projects.\n       Clarifies that the cost-sharing reforms enacted in 1986 \n     apply to all projects and studies, stopping the Corps of \n     Engineers from creating waivers and loopholes.\n       Expands opportunities for the beneficial reuse of dredged \n     material for restoration and preservation benefits.\n       Ensures the authority of the Corps of Engineers to \n     participate in ecosystem restoration projects that include \n     dam removal.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. What everyone will be able to read is the independent \nreview we now have in place in the bill that is truly independent, done \nby the National Academy of Sciences, which includes safety assurance \nreviews, mitigation, planning principles and guidelines, watershed-\nbased planning, levee safety, and other program improvements, including \nexpediting the process for deauthorizing the unconstructed backlog of \nprojects. Rather than get into a big argument, to me it is such a \npositive day today.\n  I see the Senator from Virginia coming to say a few words.\n  This is a very important day. We are struggling in the Senate to work \ntogether. The war in Iraq has torn us apart. It is very hard. But on \nthis matter of building an infrastructure and making sure it works, we \nare as one. This conference report has the support of my ranking \nmember, Senator Inhofe, the entire Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. It is important to note that the conference report was \nsigned by every conferee from both Chambers. The conference report was \nsigned by every conferee, Republican, Democratic, Independent, as they \nmay be, in both Chambers. The conference report has already received an \noverwhelming vote in the House: 381 in favor; 40 opposed. Imagine what \na wonderful message that is that we can work together.\n  I also say for the record that this conference report fully complies \nwith the rules of the Senate as amended by S. 1, the Honest Leadership \nand Open Government Act of 2007. Under the requirements of new rule \nXLIV, I certify that each congressionally directed spending item in the \nconference report and the name of each Senator who submitted a request \nto the committee for that item has been identified through a chart that \nhas been available on the committee Web site at least 48 hours prior to \nthe vote on this conference report. So we have been faithful as we must \nbe to the new rule XLIV on our ethics, where you can see what every \nSenator requested and a certification that in fact there is no conflict \nof interest, no pecuniary interest on the part of the Senator or any \nmember of the immediate family. This is truly a bipartisan bill.\n  I am going to make a unanimous consent request that at the conclusion \nof my 10 minutes, Senator Cardin be recognized for up to 10 minutes and \nthat then Senator Warner be recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe I was on the floor before the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, the Senator from Maryland has been on the floor all \nday.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Well, I am not trying to run this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time would my colleague wish?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am going to take 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then why don't we give you 5 minutes first and then 10 \nminutes for Senator Cardin.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does that accommodate my colleague?\n  Mrs. BOXER. He is very pleased with that.\n  How many more minutes do I have on my 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 23 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So, again, we have complied with the new ethics rules. I \nwant to say also, in terms of the Corps reform matters, there is an \nenvironmental organization, American Rivers, and they have written a \nvery important release that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    American Rivers, August 1, 2007\n\n    Water Bill Begins Process of Modernizing the Corps of Engineers\n\n       Washington, DC--In a move that will help communities, \n     taxpayers, and the environment, a House-Senate Conference \n     Committee has produced reforms in a bill that will improve \n     how the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) does business. The \n     Water Resources\n\n[[Page S11982]]\n\n     Development Act of 2007 (WRDA), H.R. 1495, will begin moving \n     the Corps into the 21st century.\n       The Corps is the nation's primary river management agency \n     and in 2006 accepted responsibility for faulty floodwall and \n     levee designs that led to the tragic flooding of New Orleans \n     following Hurricane Katrina. The Corps' designs were so \n     flawed that levees and floodwalls collapsed in the face of a \n     storm they should have withstood. Corps projects also \n     destroyed vital coastal wetlands that could have reduced the \n     Hurricane's storm surge, and funneled that surge into the \n     heart of New Orleans. The problems with Corps planning \n     highlighted by Katrina affect Corps projects across the \n     country.\n       The WRDA bill will produce critical improvements to the \n     Corps' planning process, including requiring an update of the \n     Corps' woefully obsolete planning guidelines that dictate how \n     the Corps evaluates specific projects. The bill will also \n     require the Corps to do a much better job of replacing \n     habitat lost to its projects. The Corps now routinely ignores \n     the basic wetlands mitigation standards that the agency \n     applies to private citizens. The bill will also establish a \n     new policy that gives a stronger emphasis on protecting the \n     environment and the natural systems that provide critical \n     natural flood protection to communities. It also directs that \n     there be a comprehensive study of the nation's flood risks \n     and flood management programs.\n       ``The reforms in this bill begin to put the Corps on track \n     towards becoming a more reliable and credible agency,'' says \n     American Rivers' president Rebecca Wodder. ``While we hoped \n     that Congress would go farther in several critical areas, we \n     are pleased with the passage of this first round of urgently \n     needed changes. We intend to see that these changes are \n     executed to their fullest extent and call out any weaknesses \n     in this new process.''\n       The gains in the WRDA bill would not have been possible \n     without the tireless work from lawmakers on both sides of the \n     aisle, and both sides of Capitol Hill. Senators Russ Feingold \n     (D-WI) and John McCain (R-AZ) have long championed the issue \n     of Corps reform, and Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Chairman Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and House Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Chairman James Oberstar (D-MN) deserve praise \n     for working to change key aspects of how the Corps operates.\n       Unfortunately, the conferees failed to adopt the robust \n     independent review provision that Senators Russ Feingold (D-\n     WI) and John McCain (R-AZ) and others had secured in the \n     Senate version of the WRDA bill in the last 2 years. The \n     conferees instead adopted a project review provision that \n     lacks complete independence. The final bill contains several \n     loopholes that would allow the Corps to avoid review under \n     certain circumstances and ignore a review panel's \n     recommendations. Worse still, the provision also inexplicably \n     disappears after 7 years. Independent review is particularly \n     important in light of the flooding of New Orleans and the \n     recent Government Accountability Office findings that Corps \n     project studies were so flawed that they could not provide a \n     reasonable basis for decision making.\n       ``The nation has been very well served by the critical \n     leadership of Senators Feingold and McCain to reform the \n     Corps,'' says Melissa Samet, Senior Director for Water \n     Resources for American Rivers. ``We look forward to working \n     with them to ensure that the Corps strictly adheres to the \n     reforms included in this bill and that additional reforms as \n     included in future legislation.''\n       ``Congress has taken a first step towards more responsible \n     river management,'' adds Wodder. ``American Rivers and our \n     colleagues throughout the nation will be watching to see that \n     the Corps lives up to the intent of the original authors of \n     this legislation and we will continue to fight further \n     reforms to ensure public safety and environmental \n     sustainability.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. They certainly believe we should have gone further with \nCorps reform. That is clear.\n  But they do say:\n\n       The reforms in this bill begin to put the Corps on track \n     towards becoming a more reliable and credible agency.\n\n  This is important. They do say:\n\n       The gains in the WRDA bill would not have been possible \n     without the tireless work from lawmakers on both sides of the \n     aisle.\n\n  They name some names of Senators.\n  Even though, as I say, they would have wanted 100 percent of what \nSenator Feingold asked for, they again say:\n\n       Congress has taken a first step towards more responsible \n     river management.\n\n  I feel pleased with this result. I know sometimes we see a glass half \nfull and sometimes we see it half empty. I see it half full. I am proud \nwe made these amazing strides toward Corps reform. Senator Feingold is, \nshall we say, very disappointed, and I respect that. I do not see it \nthe way he sees it.\n  So when I come back to some more of my time--but I will yield at this \ntime--I will talk about how important this bill is to the health and \nsafety of our families, our communities, and our economy. At this time \nI yield and we will go to the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to our \ndistinguished chairwoman. I say to her, I commend you on your \nleadership and that of our distinguished ranking colleague, Senator \nInhofe. It is quite an achievement. It has been 6 years of working to \nget here, and I have been pleased to be a member of this committee for \na couple decades almost now. But it is a great achievement. I strongly \nsupport what you have been able to do and personally thank you for your \ninclusion of an amendment that I have felt very important. Senator \nWebb, my colleague from Virginia, and I announced on July 30 the basic \ntext of that amendment. I am pleased today to add a few closing words.\n  The conference report--likely my last WRDA as a Senator--includes the \nhigh priority Craney Island Eastward Expansion project. Craney Island \nrepresents a significant opportunity for the Commonwealth to be home to \nthe development of state-of-the-art cargo operations. The project will \naccommodate a major new terminal for the Virginia Port Authority and \nwill create over 54,000 new jobs annually, with wages of about $1.7 \nbillion.\n  Now, this port serves not only the Commonwealth of Virginia, but its \ntentacles reach deep into America. Many States are served.\n  As home to the world's largest naval base; that is, the Tidewater \nregion, and as one of the business commercial ports on the east coast, \nHampton Roads is a strategic, critical port necessary for national \ndefense, commerce, and trade. So this project will also directly and \nindirectly serve our national defense.\n  This project will help position the Hampton Roads region to \nstrengthen its position as a major east coast port. The Port of \nVirginia serves as a gateway. It is an interesting term; it is a \n``gateway.'' In other words, things flow in, things flow out, and not \njust for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Almost every State in the Union \nships down through this port on some occasions. More than 55 percent of \nthe cargo we move comes from outside of the borders of the Commonwealth \nof Virginia. That is to say, this project is not just important for \nVirginians but for other States and companies that rely on their goods \nmoving through the port in a reliable and cost-effective, safe manner.\n  For that reason, I am pleased the cost share for this project will be \nequally divided--equally divided--between the Commonwealth of Virginia, \nthrough its port authority, and the Federal Government. This is clearly \na project with strong national benefits, and it is only fitting that in \nthis case the Federal Government help shoulder part of the cost because \nof the national security interests and the fact that we serve so many \nother States.\n  Again, I thank my distinguished chairman and the ranking member of \nour committee and others who made this amendment possible.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to my good friend and \ncolleague, such as he may continue with his speech.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I might make a unanimous consent \nrequest before my good colleague speaks.\n  First of all, because my friends on the other side are looking for \ntime, I yield them 3 minutes of my time, to Senator Inhofe, right off \nthe bat--3 minutes. If the Chair could add that to the time they have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator Cardin, Senator DeMint be recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. I start by thanking \nSenator Boxer for her incredible leadership and Senator Inhofe for \nbringing forward a process that allows us to reach this moment where, \nafter 7 years, we are going to be able to pass a Water Resources \nDevelopment Act.\n  Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe have developed a process where we \ncould come forward with programs that are extremely important to our \ncountry in a fiscally responsible manner,\n\n[[Page S11983]]\n\nwhere we can come together in a nonpartisan--not only bipartisan but \nnonpartisan--way to move forward on this legislation.\n  Let me start off by saying that in our country today we spend .3 \npercent of our gross domestic product on infrastructure and buildings. \nThat is deplorable. We saw the consequences of that failure to invest \nin our infrastructure--in our roads and our bridges and our buildings--\nin what happened in Minnesota with the collapse of a bridge.\n  In the Environment and Public Works Committee, we had a hearing on \nwhat we need to do as far as wastewater treatment facility plants and \nhow there are literally hundreds of projects that go unfunded that are \ndamaging our health and damaging our environment.\n  Well, today we are prepared to move forward with what I think is an \nextremely important bill. Once again, I congratulate the leadership on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Boxer, for making \nthis possible.\n  This bill is very important to our country. It is very important to \nour future. I am proud to be a member of the committee and proud to be \na supporter of this legislation.\n  Let me comment for a few minutes as to what it means for the region \nof the country I represent, in this general area where we all are \ntoday.\n  We have heard a lot about how this is going to help the people of \nLouisiana, which I strongly support. I think we all have a \nresponsibility to deal with the problems from Katrina. We heard how it \nis going to help in regard to the Everglades.\n  This bill is the most important act in regard to the Chesapeake Bay, \nwhich is a national treasure, and helps give a model as to how we can \nreclaim a body of water that is impacted by so many jurisdictions and \nStates. We not only provide for the restoration funds that are \nimportant for the Chesapeake Bay, but we also provide, for the very \nfirst time, that the Army Corps will supplement the Environmental \nProtection Agency's effort to repair and improve wastewater treatment \nfacilities that benefit the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Specifically, Blue Plains will benefit from this legislation. The \nusers in northern Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia--all \nof us--will benefit from the wastewater treatment facility improvements \nat Blue Plains.\n  The new EPA permit for Blue Plains requires that the nitrogen load \nfrom the plant be reduced by more than 4 million pounds annually. This \nwill be the largest single nutrient reduction project in the bay \nwatershed in a decade. All the experts say that should be our highest \npriority in regard to the Chesapeake Bay.\n  I am also pleased there is $20 million in regard to oyster \nrestoration included in this legislation, which is very important for \nthe Chesapeake Bay and very important for our environment. So we are \nimproving the Chesapeake Bay by this legislation, but we are also \ndealing with the economic realities of our waterways.\n  The Port of Baltimore contributes $2 billion to our State's economy, \nemploying 18,000 Marylanders directly, and tens of thousands more \nindirectly.\n  I listened to my colleague from Virginia talk about the Port of \nVirginia. As with the Port of Virginia, the Port of Baltimore is vital \nto our national security, our national interest. This legislation \nextends the authorization for the 50-foot dredging of the Baltimore \nHarbor and channels, which is very important to our economy, very \nimportant to our region.\n\n  But the legislation does more. It continues the commitment of the \nArmy Corps and our communities to Poplar Island. Poplar Island was once \nan inhabited island. It is no longer the case. But what we have done \nwith Poplar Island is we have made it a plus-plus. We have a location \nfor the dredge materials from the dredging in the Chesapeake Bay and \nour harbors, but we have also created an environmental advantage. \nPoplar Island has risen phoenix-like from the waters of the Chesapeake \nBay.\n  Mr. President, 570 acres of upland habitat and an additional 570 \nacres of wetland habitat are being created through the leadership of \nthis Congress. That is good news for our environment and good news for \nour economy. Poplar Island is a national model of how we should do the \ndredging and environmental improvements. There is more in it for our \nregion.\n  Smith Island is a remote inhabited island in the Chesapeake Bay on \nthe Maryland-Virginia border. It has lost 3,300 acres of wetlands, and \nit is threatened to be totally lost to erosion. This bill authorizes \nthe construction of 2 miles of breakwaters to protect over 2,100 acres \nof wetlands and underwater grassbeds. It is very important to our \nenvironment, very important to the people who happen to live on Smith \nIsland. I am pleased we have included that in this legislation.\n  This bill helps from the eastern shore of Maryland, to the Chesapeake \nBay, to the mountains of western Maryland. The rewatering of the C \nCanal near Cumberland will not only help as far as the historical \nrestoration of that part of our State but will also be important for \nflood control.\n  This legislation is comprehensive. It helps all the regions of our \ncountry, but helps our Nation as a whole. I am proud to be a supporter \nof this legislation. I am proud to have served on the committee that \nhelped create it. I urge my colleagues not only to support this \nlegislation but urge the President to please understand how important \nthis bill is to our country.\n  It is a modest investment. It starts to reverse the process where, \nfor too long, we have ignored our infrastructure in this country. It is \nthe right plan for America's future. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  I yield back my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns and \ndisappointment about a number of provisions that have been added to \nthis bill, the Water Resources Development Act, the bill we refer to as \nWRDA, that were not part of the bill we passed in the Senate or not \npart of the bill that was passed in the House.\n  These provisions are earmarks because they direct spending directly \nat the request of a Member to a specific entity in their home State or \ndistrict. Unfortunately, these earmarks were not passed by either body \nin an open or transparent way. Instead, they were added behind closed \ndoors in the dark of night, as we sometimes say here. As a result, \nthese earmarks cannot easily be debated, amended, or removed from the \nbill.\n  I am very disappointed these provisions were added in secret. That is \nnot how we should do things here, and it is a direct violation of a \nstated goal of the ethics bill that was recently passed and signed by \nthe President 10 days ago.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle came down to the floor \none by one and praised the new ethics bill because they said it would \nstop earmarks from being added in the dark of night. I questioned the \neffectiveness of these provisions at that time because they had been \nwatered down behind closed doors. Yet my colleagues on the other side \nsaid it was the most sweeping ethics reform in decades. They said there \nwould be no more secret earmarks added to our bills in conference.\n\n  According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, this WRDA conference report \ncontains numerous earmarks that were not part of either the House or \nthe Senate bill. Unfortunately, anytime we talk about earmarks, it \nseems very personal because it usually has a Member's name on it, so I \nwill start with South Carolina because one of the earmarks added in \nconference was for South Carolina. Obviously, I would like to do \neverything I can to help my own State, but this was not the time or the \nway to do it. There are a number of items for $10 million, $11 million, \nbut, unfortunately, there is one item in here for $1.8 billion. That \nearmark alone is more than 10 percent of the total cost of the original \nbill. This was added in conference. It was not debated or voted on. Now \nit is coming back and it is unamendable.\n  All of these projects that were added have added to the cost of this \nbill, and actually the cost has exploded. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the projects contained in this bill \ntotalled some $14 billion when it left the Senate, but then it was \ntaken to conference. Behind closed doors, amounts were raised, new \nprojects were added, reforms were dropped, and the bill now costs $23.2 \nbillion. That is right. The\n\n[[Page S11984]]\n\nprice of this bill has increased 66 percent since it left the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I know my colleagues, the Senator from California and the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, have worked very hard on this bill, and I believe there \nare some good things in it. I was very pleased to work with the Senator \nfrom California on some reforms that will help us deauthorize projects \nthat have not been funded in 5 years or more and are currently \ninactive. As my colleagues know, the long list of backlogged projects \nmakes it very difficult for the Corps of Engineers to focus on real \npriorities. I am looking forward to working with the Senator from \nCalifornia to get a good list of the inactive projects from the \nadministration so the committee can deauthorize them in the next WRDA \nbill. The Senator has told me she will deauthorize these projects, but \nif for some reason we are not able to get that done, this bill provides \nan automatic mechanism to deauthorize by the end of the fiscal year, \nfollowing the fiscal year in which the projects appear on the inactive \nlist. This reform is more important than ever because the bill we are \npassing now or bringing back up now increases the backlog of projects \nfrom $58 billion to approximately $80 billion. So while this bill takes \none step forward, unfortunately, it takes two steps back.\n  The pricetag of this bill is too high, and it violates an important \nprinciple we need to honor. It includes new provisions that were not in \nthe bills we passed, and that has to stop. That is why I offered an \namendment, along with Senator Ensign and Senator McCain, to the ethics \nbill earlier this year that would clarify that earmarks added in \nconference were subject to rule XXVIII of the standing rules of the \nSenate, which prohibits what we call out-of-scope matter from being \nadded to our bills in conference and which can only be waived by 67 \nvotes. Further, the amendment we offered would have created a 60-vote \npoint of order against earmarks added in conference. If this point of \norder was sustained, the provisions would be taken out of the bill.\n  Even the liberal Los Angeles Times editorial board this weekend made \ntheir support for such a rule known. In a weekend editorial entitled \n``The Value of Congressional Pork,'' the L.A. Times said such a rule \nwas a worthy proposal that would make it harder for lawmakers to insert \nlast-minute goodies during reconciliation of Senate and House bills. \nThis is just plain good Government.\n  Unfortunately, the clarification to rule XXVIII was eliminated from \nthe final bill, even though it was unanimously accepted here on the \nfloor in January. Even worse, the majority leader is now saying the 60-\nvote point of order against what we call airdropped earmarks should \nonly apply to appropriations bills. This is very disappointing. There \nis absolutely no reason why we should restrict authorization earmarks. \nThey can be as wasteful, as misguided and, I am afraid, as corrupting \nas appropriations earmarks. Authorization earmarks can be traded for \nbribes as easily as appropriations earmarks.\n  After checking with the Senate Parliamentarian, I understand there is \nsome confusion over the definition of earmarks for this particular \nrule. The rule says it applies to provisions that provide a level of \nfunding to a specific project. What could be clearer? All the projects \nI read about earlier fit that definition, regardless of whether they \nare appropriations or authorizations. If people want to parse these \nterms and say authorizations are not actual funding, then I am afraid \nwe are not being completely honest.\n  We all know how the Corps of Engineers works. We pass WRDA bills that \ntell the Corps what projects to do, and then their annual \nappropriations bills provide money to complete these projects. But \nwithout an authorization in WRDA, the projects will not go forward. \nAuthorizations are important, and we should be as open and as \ntransparent about them as we are for appropriations.\n  I intended to raise a point of order today against these new \nprovisions under rule XLIV which was part of the ethics bill, but I \nunderstand the unanimous consent agreement we are operating under \nprohibits me from doing so. In a minute I am going to ask for unanimous \nconsent to be allowed to make this point of order against the \nprovision, and if I am allowed to do that and the Chair rules that the \npoint of order is acceptable under the rule, then, of course, I would \nurge my colleagues to sustain this point of order so we can take these \nprovisions out. But before I do this, I would like to ask how much time \nI have remaining of my 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I would like to reserve the remainder of my time but \nyield 5 minutes to my colleague, Senator McCaskill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding me \nsome time. This is a unique bill in many ways. It is unique because \nthere is a different set of rules when it comes to the water projects \nbill and the water resources development in this country for the Army \nCorps of Engineers. I believe as a former auditor we should be allowing \nthe Army Corps of Engineers to direct funding based on a cost-benefit \nanalysis. A cost-benefit analysis would allow the prioritization of \nprojects based on the best value for our dollar.\n  The law requires, unlike any other place in our Government--it was \nexplained to me when I got here the law requires that Congress direct \nthis spending. I am uncomfortable with that. This is the only place \nthis year that my name is listed on a specific funding request for \nMissouri, and I am not comfortable with that. I understand it is a \nreality this law requires, that if Congress is not directing this \nfunding, there is no funding. I believe very much we should reform the \nway we fund the Army Corps of Engineers projects. I believe it should \nbe driven by a cost-benefit analysis.\n  It is hard to understand why in this area, unlike any other area, not \nonly are we in a position to decide level of funding, we are going to \ndecide every single project. Now, since this is so unique, it is even \nmore important that we have complete transparency. Even though I was \nuncomfortable with requesting specific funding, I understood the unique \nnature of this particular bill, but I was comforted by the fact that I \nbelieved all the projects were going to have a public airing, that they \nwere going to be included in either the House bill or the Senate bill, \nand that there were not going to be any projects that were put into the \nauthorization bill through the conference process. Unfortunately, that \nhappened. That would bring me to the point of having to vote no on this \nbill because I believe very strongly in the principle that whatever we \ninclude must be included in either the deliberations of the House or \nthe Senate.\n  This isn't about the projects and the merit of the projects. I am \nsure they are all very meritorious. In fact, painfully for me, one of \nthem is in Missouri. This isn't about the projects; this is about the \nprocess. This isn't about Democrats and this isn't about Republicans. \nThis is about a bad habit. This is about getting into the habit of \ndirecting authorization or spending in a conference report instead of \nunder the bright lights of the Senate floor, the House Floor or \ncommittee work. We need to stop putting projects in conference reports \nthat were not in the bill. Some people will say it doesn't matter; we \nhave a backlog of all these projects. Well, if it doesn't matter, why \ndo we need to do it? If it does matter, it ought to be important enough \nto be in one bill or the other.\n  I believe we need to reform not only the way we fund the Corps of \nEngineers, to give more deference to their discretion based on cost-\nbenefit analysis, and I believe we need to stop the bad habit of always \nputting projects in a conference report without the full affirmation \nand public airing that the House and Senate deliberations provide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague. \nI would like to confirm what she has said. I take no issue with the \nauthority of the Senate to designate spending, particularly in \nauthorization bills. While this practice has certainly been abused, \nparticularly in our appropriations bills over the years, my point\n\n[[Page S11985]]\n\ntoday is not to suggest that our committee and the floor of the Senate \ndo not have the right to authorize money for particular projects, but I \nbelieve, as Senator McCaskill has said and made clear, that in the \ndebate on the Senate floor, it seemed we unanimously agreed these \nprojects should be brought to the floor of the Senate and that if \nsomeone wanted to question them, we could have those amendments, and we \ncould ultimately vote on the whole package. But it seemed clear we all \nagreed that new earmarks should not be added in conference and then for \nthat conference bill to come back without any chance of amending it. \nThat is not the type of business we talked about in the whole ethics \ndebate. So my issue is not with our ability to earmark or even the \npractice of authorization bills designating spending but that they are \nadded in conference when we all agreed that if it was not added in \neither the Senate or the House bill, it could not be added in \nconference.\n  For that reason, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to raise a \npoint of order under rule XLIV.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, \nlet me say this. For 7 years, we waited for flood control and then we \nsaw Katrina. For 7 years, we have waited for environmental restoration. \nFor 7 years, we have waited for navigation improvements. For 7 years, \nwe have waited, and the bottom line is, every single project in this \nbill has a letter attached to it saying who asked for it, whether it \nwas added in conference, added in the first bill, the second or the \nthird.\n  I would urge that we get on with this today, and I object to the \nunanimous consent request that we slow this thing down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to suggest that one of the \nreasons New Orleans was not prepared for Katrina is we have so many \nproblems with our infrastructure in the way we politically meddle with \nthe priorities of States, particularly with the Corps of Engineers that \nhas a backlog of billions of dollars over many years. We refuse to \nclear out those backlogs so the Corps can focus on that which needs to \nbe done, such as the levees in New Orleans. Instead, year after year, \nwe add one earmark after another, until the Corps has no focus at all \non what they are doing, and we are trying to direct from Washington \nwhat our water projects should be.\n  The fact that we have plussed this bill up from $14 billion to over \n$23 billion, a 66-percent increase since this bill left the Senate \nfloor, says we have to have some shame. We have to have some honor in \nthis body. If we are going to do this, let's do it in a way that we all \nsaid we would, and that is to bring these to the floor so we can debate \nand vote on them instead of adding them in and trying to slip them by \nin a conference bill.\n  I am very disappointed in this body, particularly after all the grand \ndebate about ethics reform, the disclosure of earmarks, the fact that \nnone would be added in secret. Over the last few weeks, we have pretty \nmuch backtracked on everything we have talked about, to the point where \neven liberal publications across the country are talking about the pork \nwe are producing in the Senate. Instead of doing the Nation's business \nand delegating authority to States, we are in effect weakening our \nability to have a national infrastructure that is safe and works for \nall Americans. I am very disappointed not only that this has been done \nbut that a Member of the Senate is not even allowed to raise a point of \norder against the fact that it has been done.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from California \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes at this time.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that now I have 14 minutes \nremaining on my side. Senator Inhofe has how much time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 22\\1/2\\, and the Senator has about \n13\\1/2\\.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And Senator Feingold retains 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If he doesn't take that 20 minutes, Senator Inhofe and I \nwill share that time.\n  I am sorry that Senator DeMint has left the floor, which oftentimes \nhappens after a Senator speaks. But I have to say that when I said we \nneed to do these Katrina-related fixes, his answer was that the reason \nwe had a problem with Katrina in the first place is the Corps didn't do \na good job, and I think certainly the Corps didn't live up to our \nexpectations. But what Senator DeMint doesn't mention is that in this \nbill before us, because of the hard work of Senator Feingold and \nothers, we have now put into this bill an independent review process \nwhere there will be no projects going forward unless and until there is \nan independent report that the National Academy of Sciences will, in \nfact, oversee. We have gone light years from where we were before. That \nis why we have so much strong support for the bill. The Audubon Society \nsupports the bill, along with the Clean Water Fund, the Conservancy of \nSouthwest Florida, the American Shore and Beach Preservation Society, \nthe National Water Resources Association, and on and on and on. The \nfact is, if we had allowed the DeMint request to go forward, we would \nbe back to square one. We cannot afford that. It has been 7 long years.\n  Again, the health of our communities is at stake. The safety of our \nfamilies is at stake. I could talk about Sacramento. Finally, we have \nlanguage in the authorization to move forward with the proper flood \ncontrol for the community of Sacramento. Mr. President, 300,000 people \nlive there. It is the home of our State, the capital of our State. We \nfinally reached agreement. These are not agreements that come from the \ntop down; they come from local government up. I think it is important, \nas colleagues come to the floor to in a way demean this process, to \nunderstand if they demean the process, they are demeaning their own \ncommunities. In Oklahoma, or in California, or Georgia--I see Senator \nIsakson here. He and Senator Baucus were invaluable to Senator Inhofe \nand me in doing all of this.\n  The fact is these projects and these ideas and these needs come up \nfrom local governments. As a matter of fact, homeowners' associations \nfind themselves faced with dangerous circumstances because a river is \nrising and there have not been the needed improvements. Senator Inhofe \nand I share a commitment to shoring up our infrastructure, including \nwater resources, and I think when we look at all of the things that \ncome before us--and we are so torn in half here, Democrat versus \nRepublican--here we have an opportunity to move forward in a bipartisan \nfashion. As Senator Inhofe would say in his way, because he has been \nhammering at this, this is one step of a very important process. We \nhave added these independent reviews so that we have checks and \nbalances all the way through.\n  I will retain the remainder of my time. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have 22 \nminutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and Chairman Boxer and \nSubcommittee Chairman Baucus for their outstanding work on the WRDA \nbill. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report and point \nout the critical need for the infrastructure we have in this country.\n  Historically, every 2 years we have passed the WRDA bill. Now we have \ngone 7 years without that. What happened in the last 7 years? We have \nhad significant droughts, we have had Katrina, and we have had other \ngreat tragedies. It is about time that we came back to the floor and \npassed a comprehensive bill.\n  I know there has been criticism of the amount of the bill. I saw a \nCBO score of about $23 billion. I remind my colleagues that this is an \nauthorization, No. 1. No. 2, it is 7 years in the making, not 2. No. 3, \nwe have had significant tragedies and have significant threats in our \nown States that need to be addressed and need to be prioritized.\n\n[[Page S11986]]\n\n  I will take my own State as an example. I represent a State with a \nmajor metropolitan area, Atlanta. That city has 5 million people whose \nwater source is Lake Lanier and the Chattahoochee River. We don't have \naquifers in the north to draw from, only the surface water that we \nretain. Through the leadership of a visionary Governor a few years ago, \nwe passed the Metro North Georgia Water Planning District to take the \nconsolidated area of north Georgia and put it into a singular planning \ndistrict for water purposes, management of storm water, to see if we \ncould maximize the return we get on the investment we make in the most \nprecious thing we have, our water.\n\n  This legislation has money for conveyance systems. Local water \nauthorities joined together with a regional plan to cooperate and build \na solid water infrastructure.\n  Secondly, the Big Creek Water Management and Restoration Program is \nin here, which I started 9 years ago with the city of Roswell, which \nwas developed to manage storm water, its runoff, and control water \nbetter in a major urban area. It was cited by the EPA as one of the \nmost outstanding projects of its type in America.\n  Also in here is a very visionary agreement between the Governor of \nGeorgia and the Governor of South Carolina, who signed a bistate water \ncompact for the construction of a port to be operated jointly by the \nState of Georgia and the State of South Carolina in Jasper County, SC, \non the Savannah River. The Ports of Charleston and Savannah are two of \nthe major ports on the east coast of the United States. With this \nplanned agreement and the funding that pays for the study put up by \nthose States, and the study authorized in this legislation, these two \nStates will set a historic precedent to reach out together and form \npartnerships so as to make the maximum use of the port capabilities and \nfacilities of our States on the Atlantic Coast.\n  A lot of work has gone into this legislation. Senator Inhofe has \nworked tirelessly, as has Chairman Boxer, but I want to mention the \nones who don't get much credit: Mike Quiello and Caroline McLean, on my \nown staff; Angie Giancarlo; Let Mon Lee; Jeff Rosato; Ken Kopocis; \nTyler Rushforth; Paul Wilkins; and Jo-Ellen Darcy, all who spent \ncountless hours to make this legislation come to pass.\n  I thank the ranking member for the time. I commit my vote to passage \nof the conference report and ask my colleagues to join me and show a \nsignificant vote for the WRDA conference committee report.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nGeorgia. Working on these authorization committees is not easy. We have \na lot of hearings and a lot of expertise, people looking, studying to \nsee what is deserving to be authorized. I can tell you that the Senator \nfrom Georgia--I don't know of a member on the committee who has worked \nharder, or maybe even as hard as the Senator from Georgia. So I thank \nhim for coming here today and making his statement.\n  I know my good friend from South Carolina, Senator DeMint, would not \nintentionally misrepresent anything, but when he says once it is \nauthorized, it is just like spending, that isn't true. I know he hasn't \nthought that through or he would not make that statement. We have a \nbacklog, which has already been talked about several times here--a \nbacklog of some $32 billion of Corps projects that have been authorized \nbut haven't been done. That speaks for itself. They are out there. How \ncan you say that--by the way, it is worthwhile saying or some people \nmight say: Why are you authorizing more if they haven't even done \nthose? Maybe some of them are no longer necessary. I will give you a \ncouple examples. In Oklahoma, we have a channel that goes all the way \nto Muskogee, OK, or the Port of Katusa. A lot of people don't think of \nus as being navigable in Oklahoma, but we are. It is a short distance \nthat is 9 feet, where the choke is. So we have had it authorized for a \nlong period of time to make that a 12-foot channel. It would make a \nhuge difference. It hasn't been authorized.\n  The Passaic River in New Jersey has a flood control tunnel up there \nthat was authorized at $1.2 billion back in 1990. That wasn't last year \nor the year before. So far, no money has come in there.\n  Mr. President, I was disappointed in the way time was handled here. \nLet me make a few comments and then perhaps see if anybody else comes \ndown who needs to be heard.\n  Right now, let me first redeem myself. We have a lot of people \ntalking about this. I know a lot of people are watching, saying we are \ngoing to find out who the conservatives are. There are a lot of ``born-\nagain'' conservatives I have heard so far, who are not conservative but \nare opposing an authorization bill. I say that, redeeming myself, in \nthat--every organization, including Human Events and the American \nConservative Union, says I am not No. 2 or No. 3, Mr. President, I am \nNo. 1. Did you know that I am the No. 1 most conservative Member of the \nSenate?\n  I am here to tell you something that is very unpopular because nobody \nis going to understand it after I explain it to you. I will get right \ninto it. I am going to tell you what authorization is. I hope some \nMembers are listening, but I fear they are not. I think minds are made \nup. By the way, this bill will pass by an overwhelming majority. No \nquestion about that. In a way, we are wasting a lot of time right now. \nBut I think it is important that at least somebody says something that \nhas to be said: What is authorization all about?\n  The background of authorization goes all the way back to 1816. In \n1816, our permanent committees were put together. We didn't have \ncommittees prior to that. So the responsibilities of authorizing and \nappropriating were put into these 11 committees in accordance with \njurisdiction.\n  By 1867, 51 years later, the Senate created the Appropriations \nCommittee. The Appropriations Committee had the idea that there was to \nbe separate authorizing language with the appropriations. They were \ngoing to actually spend the money. Somebody else was going to do the \nauthorization.\n  In 1899, it was seen that they had kind of moved together, so the \nAppropriations Committee was actually legislating on appropriation \nbills.\n  In 1922, a major change took place. In 1922, after the Accounting Act \nof 1921, the Senate changed the rules. They established not only that \nthe Senators were going to be appropriating and not authorizing on the \nappropriations bills, but that is when the current rule XVI came into \neffect. It had been there for a different purpose. Rule XVI says if the \nappropriators appropriate something that is not authorized, it is going \nto take a 60-vote point of order. That is huge. That was very clear in \n1922. They said we want to make it virtually impossible for the \nappropriators, without going through any authorization, to unilaterally \nsay we ought to have all these projects; we don't care if they are \nworthwhile or not. That is what happened.\n  Then, slowly, since that time it has been going back to the \nappropriators getting more and more power. They have been diminishing \nthe power of the authorizers.\n  Put up the military chart.\n  I am on another committee.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee is an \nauthorization committee. Let me tell you why the process of authorizing \nis important. I could use almost any example I want to, but I will use \nmissile defense.\n  Right now, there are very few people around since 9/11 who don't know \nthat there are monsters out there who will send a missile into the \nUnited States. We now have a missile defense system we are still \ndeveloping. There are three phases: the boost phase, the midcourse \nphase, and the terminal phase.\n  In the boost phase, quite frankly, we do not have anything that will \nknock down a missile. We are working on two systems: one, a kinetic \nenergy booster, and the other is an airborne laser system. The airborne \nlaser system is going to be great for us, but we are not there yet.\n  Midcourse--we all have heard about the AEGIS system. I believe there \nare 16 AEGIS ships right now. They have the capability of knocking down \na missile during the midcourse phase. We also have ground-based \nsystems. We\n\n[[Page S11987]]\n\nknow we need this redundancy because we don't know from where these \nmissiles are going to be fired. We all know the President has been \ntrying to get a location in Eastern Europe and up around the old Soviet \nUnion, and it has been very difficult. What we ultimately have to have \nis a way of knocking these missiles down from anyplace in midcourse. We \nhave two systems. An appropriator might look at that and say: I know \nwhere we can save money. We don't need two midcourse systems; one is \nenough. But that is not right because the expertise in the authorizing \ncommittees says we have to have that coverage.\n  Lastly, the terminal phase. We know about the THAAD system, the PAC-\n3, the Patriot Capability-3 advanced system. One may say they are \nredundant, but they are not.\n  Here is the point I am trying to make. The reason we know, in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, it is important we have these systems \nis because we are staffed with a lot of really smart people. They are \nspecialists in this area of national defense. I could have used the F-\n22 versus the F-35 or any other system we have, but the point is that \nthe Armed Services Committee is an authorizing committee which is \nstaffed with experts. So is the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nWe have people who are experts in certain areas. The committee \nauthorizes projects for the future.\n  If we take away the Senate Armed Services Committee and the committee \nis no longer able to authorize, then we are going to have appropriators \nsitting around waiting for somebody to come up with what they want. \nMaybe it is a contractor they know who has a system and they will go \nahead and use that system, but they wouldn't have the expertise.\n  I am not bashing appropriators. That is a very important part of the \nprocess. But they have to have some kind of a discipline in their \nspending. There is no discipline.\n  Let me mention something else that would be very unpopular. I said \nthis on the floor during the Transportation reauthorization bill, \nwhich, at the time the Republicans were in the majority, I chaired the \ncommittee Senator Boxer now chairs. At that time, a lot of people were \ntrying to latch on to items that were wrong so they could use them to \ndemagog. Remember the famous bridge to nowhere? Actually, it would have \nbeen more accurate to say it is a bridge to nobody because the bridge \nactually went someplace where they couldn't get except by barge traffic \nand they could never develop that area.\n  One of the few things that works well in Government, in my \nestimation, is the way we do the Transportation reauthorization. \nEveryone pays at the pump, and then the money comes into the highway \ntrust fund. Then we establish criteria.\n  Senator Boxer will remember that we had some 30 criteria we used with \nthe Transportation reauthorization bill. One of the criteria was, What \ndo the people at home want? In the case of the bridge to nowhere, the \n100 projects the State of Alaska said they wanted to do with their tax \ndollars, it was No. 5 from the top. We, in our infinite wisdom in \nWashington, say we are smarter than the dumb people out in the States. \nWe said: Even though this is what you want or have to have, you can't \nhave it because we have this infinite wisdom in Washington.\n  I use these examples only because the authorizing system does work. \nWe are supposed to pass this water resources development \nreauthorization every 2 years. If we had done that every 2 years, we \nwould not be faced with what we are faced today. We would not be \nlooking at $21 billion. It averages out about $3 billion, if my math \nserves me correctly. We tried to get a bill in 2002, and we were not \nable to do it. We tried in 2004, and we were not able to do it. We \ntried in 2006, and that didn't work, either. In fact, we did our job; \nwe just ran out of time, as I recall. Now it is 2007. If we don't do it \nthis time, it is going to be another year, and it is going to mean the \nappropriators are going to go ahead and do these projects without going \nthrough the right authorizing process.\n  I have to say it, and I say it in all sincerity to my good \nconservative friends: This is not money we are spending; it is \nauthorizing projects as to what meets certain criteria. If we look at \nsome of the problems we are having right now--Hurricane Katrina, that \nwas not foreseen and that was a wake-up call. It could happen anywhere. \nIt was an infrastructure need. The collapse of the bridge in \nMinneapolis, that was a bridge on an interstate. In Oklahoma, on I-40, \nwe have a bridge built with the same technology at the same time, and \nright now chunks of concrete are dropping off that bridge and falling \ndown below. We have, in my State of Oklahoma, the worst bridge \nsituation. I am not proud of this fact, but it is true. We have more \ndeteriorating bridges than any other State. These are projects we need \nto be doing.\n  I am ranked as the No. 1 most conservative politician, but I have \nalways been a big spender in two areas: One, defend America--we need to \ndefend America; no one else is going to do that for us--and No. 2, \ninfrastructure. That is what we have talked about today.\n  We went through the long, involved Transportation reauthorization. \nMr. President, I am embarrassed to tell you, as sizable as that \nTransportation reauthorization bill was, if we were able to spend all \nthe money that was authorized, it would not even maintain the current \nsystem we have today.\n  Let me mention one other point. Where were my conservative friends in \n2000 when we passed this huge, open-ended bill called the Everglades \nRestoration Act? It didn't have any Corps of Engineers report. It did \nnot have a Chief's report. It was open-ended, and the vote was 99 to 1. \nGuess who the one was. It was me. Where were my conservative friends at \nthat time? That was huge.\n  In retrospect, I was right and the other 99 were wrong. They might \nargue with me on that point. But, nonetheless, in the current bill, \nthere are now some reports in the Everglades, so we are doing it the \nright way with this bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time in case somebody else wishes to \nspeak, but I have to say, in case I run out of time, I have a letter \nfrom the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Civil Works, Secretary \nWoodley, and the arguments they use as to why they would recommend the \nPresident veto this bill are not right.\n  Frankly, I am really disappointed. If we are going to pass this \nbill--and it is going to be passed by a veto-proof margin--if the \nPresident vetoes it, he knows it is going to be overridden, and I have \nto question why he would veto it. Again, we are reauthorizing. We are \nnot appropriating one nickel with this bill.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to Senator Landrieu of \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to follow up on the comments of \nthe good Senator from Oklahoma, who I believe made some very \nappropriate and strong arguments for this bill.\n  There are some reasons to vote against the bill, I guess, but I \nwouldn't say one of them is because you are a conservative. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is absolutely correct, this is a conservative approach to \ninfrastructure. This is the right approach. This is about investments. \nWhether one is representing the State of California, which tends to be \nsometimes more liberal on issues, or representing a State such as \nOklahoma, which tends to be more conservative, this is the right vote.\n  My colleagues can vote against this bill because they don't think it \nhas enough Corps reforms. Senator Feingold's position, although I \ndisagree with it, is a legitimate position. He just believes the Corps \nshould have more reforms. Actually, I agree with a lot of what he says. \nBut we couldn't get a majority of Senators to go along with his \nproposal. We had to drop it or sacrifice the whole bill. I did not \nthink it was worth sacrificing the whole bill. We have some reforms, \nand I am committed and others are committed to continuing to work to \nreform the Corps, to streamline the Corps, to force them to stop \nwasting so much money and time. I am committed to do that in the \nfuture.\n  But right now, we have wetlands to save and levees to build. The \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11988]]\n\nfrom Oklahoma is exactly correct. This is a chart that shows the civil \nworks as a percentage of the gross domestic product since 1929. There \nis a crisis in America. We are down below half a percentage point \nrelative to gross domestic product. We are spending less today than we \ndid in 1929.\n  I know nobody believes this information, but this is not a chart that \ncame from Mary Landrieu's office; this is a chart from the Corps of \nEngineers.\n  We can see in the runup to the wars, World War I and World War II, \nhow this bolted up because we had to make some of these investments. \nBut look at the precipitous slide, Mr. President. I say this because \nthe Senator is correct. The National Chamber of Commerce--not a bastion \nof liberalism--is supporting this bill. The Manufacturers of America--\nnot a bastion of liberalism--sent out a letter supporting this bill. \nWhy? Because business cannot operate without ports and navigation and \nflood control. Agriculture cannot operate if every year their fields \nget flooded.\n  I don't know how to explain this anymore. This is not porkbarrel, \nrunaway spending. This is critical investments, and it has been 7 years \nsince this bill has passed.\n  Senator Boxer didn't run up a big tab. She has worked her heart out \nwith Senator Inhofe to get a bill passed in 7 months that should have \npassed 7 years ago.\n  As to the argument from the good Senator from South Carolina--and I \nknow somebody has to come to the floor and read talking points from \nsome organization about this bill, but I wish to say something about \nSouth Carolina, Louisiana, Florida, and Texas. This chart shows the \nhurricanes that have hit since 1955. I don't know how many more \nKatrinas, I don't know how many more Ritas, I don't know how many more \nHugos we need. But these are the tracks of the storms. We have 300 \nmillion people who live in the United States. I am just going to take a \nwild guess that 50 percent of them live in the Northeast and the South \nbecause I know the interior West is very lightly populated, so I would \nimagine the gravity of the population is where we are looking now.\n  How many more storms have to hit before we pass a water bill? How \nmany more homes have to be flooded? We lost 275,000 in Louisiana and \nMississippi last year. Two years ago today, Rita slammed into south \nLouisiana and east Texas. I focus so much on my State, and, of course, \nI represent Louisiana, but I picked up the Houston Chronicle this \nmorning, front page, big headline: People in south Texas still waiting \nfor help from the Federal Government for homes destroyed 2 years ago.\n  This bill is not going to solve every problem. It is not going to \nbuild every levee. But we better get about raising this chart up a \nlittle bit or I don't know what our manufacturers and businesses are \ngoing to do. You can buy anything you want on the Internet, but every \nnow and then you have to ship it. You can purchase it with a mouse \nclick, but that product has to get on a ship, it has to get on a truck, \nit has to get on a barge. It has to go somewhere. If we don't start \nbuilding levees and protecting our people from these storms--and Lord \nhelp us if there is another terrorist attack--I just don't know what we \nare going to do. So there is some urgency about this situation.\n  I will say in my final minutes that I hope the President will not \nveto this bill. I hope he will reconsider his position and look at the \nvote, the overwhelming vote in the House--and I think we are going to \nhave an overwhelming vote in the Senate--and say: I thought about \nvetoing this bill, but I decided not to because the arguments have been \ngood.\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So I hope the President will reconsider this number, \nthe lowest investment since 1929. I hope he will look at the hurricane \nmaps, and then I hope he will look at the land loss in Louisiana.\n  I would like to just end with this. We have lost more than twice the \namount of land in just the last storm--these red dots represent \nsignificant land loss--that if an enemy came and took this land away \nfrom us, we would declare World War III. But it is not an enemy, it is \nourselves.\n  So let us pass the WRDA bill.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their extraordinary \nleadership. There are many good reasons to pass this bill, and I hope \nwe can get a good vote in just a few minutes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. The bill that is before \nus today contains key Corps reform measures. It helps move America \nforward in addressing a lengthy backlog of critical water \ninfrastructure projects, and it authorizes essential ecosystem \nrestoration efforts.\n  This bill contains a number of provisions that are vital to \nMaryland--from Cumberland in western Maryland to the great cities of \nBaltimore and Washington and down to tiny Smith Island, which sits in \nthe Chesapeake Bay.\n  Like so many other projects contained in this bill, the Cumberland \neffort will have multiple benefits. Increased public safety will come \nfrom the flood control provisions. The project also serves historic and \ncommunity restoration efforts, including the rewatering of the National \nPark Service's Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the reconstruction of the \nhistoric turning basin there.\n  For the first time, the Army Corps will supplement the Environmental \nProtection Agency's effort to repair and improve wastewater treatment \nfacilities to benefit the Chesapeake Bay. The Corps will be able to \nsupport sewage treatment upgrades such as the one at Blue Plains, which \nserves customers in the District of Columbia, northern Virginia, and \nMaryland.\n  The new EPA permit for Blue Plains requires that the nitrogen load \nfrom the plant be reduced by more than 4 million pounds annually. This \nwill be the largest single nitrogen reduction project in the bay \nwatershed in a decade.\n  The Port of Baltimore is one of the largest ports on the east coast. \nIt is a vital engine of economic activity, contributing $2 billion to \nthe State's economy and employing 18,000 Marylanders directly and tens \nof thousands more indirectly. WRDA 2007 extends the authorization for \nthe 50-foot dredging of the Baltimore Harbor and Channels. The dredging \nthat is authorized in this bill is essential to the economy of \nBaltimore and the entire region. But it produces millions of tons of \ndredge materials annually. In this bill, that sediment is being put to \nbeneficial reuse. The Corps is literally rebuilding an island in the \nChesapeake.\n  Poplar Island once was home to residents and hunting lodges. It had \nnearly vanished, the victim of rising sea level and unrelenting \nerosion. Since this project's authorization in 1996, however, the Corps \nhas restored over 1,100 acres of remote island habitat. Poplar Island \nhas risen, phoenix-like, from the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Five \nhundred and seventy acres of upland habitat and an additional 570 acres \nof wetland habitat are being created.\n  Today, even as the project continues, the island is once again home \nto migratory shore birds, mammals, and reptiles. It even serves as a \nnesting area for Maryland's famous terrapins. The expansion of \nauthorized in the bill will build upon this success. It will add an \nadditional 575 acres, about half upland and half wetlands, to the \nrestored island.\n  The Poplar Island expansion project authorized in this bill is \nimportant to the Port of Baltimore and to the ecological health of the \nChesapeake Bay. But it is also a model for the Nation, showing us how \nCorps projects can be engines of economic success while at the same \ntime serving beneficial ecological functions.\n  Smith Island is a remote inhabited island in the Chesapeake Bay on \nthe Maryland-Virginia border. It has lost over 3,300 acres of wetlands, \nthreatening the people who live there and degrading the Chesapeake Bay \nin the process. This bill authorizes the construction of 2 miles of \nbreakwaters to protect over 2,100 acres of wetlands and underwater \ngrass beds.\n  WRDA 2007 is unlike any earlier WRDA bill. It contains Corps reform \nmeasures, ecological restoration projects, and environmental \ninfrastructure projects. These provisions represent the future of the \nCorps of Engineers. It is the reason I support this legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me.\n\n[[Page S11989]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe that the passage of this bill \nis long overdue and I commend Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe for \ntheir efforts to pass this bill.\n  There are numerous projects in this bill that are important to each \nstate. I would like to take a few moments and highlight what this bill \nmeans to New Mexico and our environment.\n  I would like to point out that the New Mexico related projects in \nthis bill were included, at my request, in the WRDA bill we passed in \n2006. So the content in this bill should not be a surprise to any of us \nand I hope that we can get this bill signed by the President quickly.\n  One of the most critical New Mexico projects contained in this year's \nWRDA bill involves New Mexico's Bosque. I have long envisioned the \nrehabilitation and restoration of the Bosque. In fact, I have \nintroduced legislation in this Congress that would do just that. This \nbill will allow us to implement this vision that concerns this long \nneglected treasure of the Southwest.\n  The Albuquerque metropolitan area is the largest concentration of \npeople in New Mexico. It is also the home to the irreplaceable riparian \nforest which runs through the heart of the city and surrounding towns \nthat is the Bosque. It is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in \nthe Southwest, and one of the last of its kind in the world.\n  Unfortunately, mismanagement, neglect, and the effects of upstream \ndevelopment have severely degraded the Bosque. As a result, public \naccess is problematical and crucial habitat for scores of species is \nthreatened.\n  Yet the Middle Rio Grande Bosque remains one of the most biologically \ndiverse ecosystems in the Southwest. My goal is to restore the Bosque \nand create a space that is open and attractive to the public. I want to \nensure that this extraordinary corridor of the Southwestern desert is \npreserved for generations to come--not only for generations of humans, \nbut for the diverse plant and animal species that reside in the Bosque \nas well.\n  The rehabilitation of this ecosystem leads to greater protection for \nthreatened and endangered species; it means more migratory birds, \nhealthier habitat for fish, and greater numbers of towering cottonwood \ntrees. This project can increase the quality of life for a city while \nassuring the health and stability of an entire ecosystem. Where trash \nis now strewn, paths and trails will run. Where jetty jacks and \ndiscarded rubble lie, cottonwoods will grow. The dead trees and \nunderbrush that threaten devastating fire will be replaced by healthy \ngroves of trees. Schoolchildren will be able to study and maybe catch \nsight of a bald eagle. The chance to help build a dynamic public space \nlike this does not come around often, and I would like to see Congress \nembrace that chance on this occasion.\n  Having grown up along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque, the Bosque is \nsomething I treasure, and I lament the degradation that has occurred. \nBecause of this, I have been involved in Bosque restoration since 1991, \nand I commend the efforts of groups like the Bosque Coalition for the \nwork they have done, and will continue to do, along the river.\n  Another project that is of great importance to New Mexico is the \nSouthwest Valley Flood Control Project. New Mexico is a desert State \nprone to flash flooding during our monsoon season. In order to protect \nour cities we must take proactive steps to ensure that communities are \nprepared in the event of flooding. The Southwest Valley is one such \narea that is subject to flooding from rainfall runoff. Due to \nunfavorable topography, flood waters pond in low lying developed areas \nand cannot drain by gravity flow to the Rio Grande River. This project \nresolves this problem and calls for the construction of detention \nbasins and a pumping station in Albuquerque for flood control in the \nSouthwest Valley.\n  This legislation also has a significant impact on our environment. \nThe Rio Grande Environmental Management Program authorizes the Corps to \naddress environmental restoration and management on the Rio Grande and \nits tributaries through planning, design and construction of habitat \nrehabilitation and enhancement projects and a long term river data \nacquisition and management program. This simple provision establishes a \ncontinuing authority for addressing environmental restoration and \nmanagement on the Rio Grande and its tributaries within the state of \nNew Mexico. This project consists of two main components. The first \ncomponent consists of planning, design and construction of small \nhabitat rehabilitation and enhancement projects and the second \ncomponent calls for a long term river data acquisition and management \nprogram. The impacts that this project will have on New Mexico will be \ntremendous.\n  Another program outlined in this year's WRDA bill provides authority \nto the Corps to study, adopt, and construct emergency streambank and \nshoreline protection works for protection of public highways and \nbridges, and other public works, and nonprofit public services such as \nchurches, hospitals, and schools. This program provides authority for \nthe Corps to carry out ecosystem restoration and protection projects if \nthe project will improve environmental quality, is in the public \ninterest, and is cost effective. This is a worthy initiative that will \nbenefit the environment throughout the United States.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to help further enhance and protect our \nenvironment through passage of this legislation. I believe that each \nState stands to benefit from this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am proud to support this legislation \ntoday, which is so important for our Nation's water infrastructure. We \nneed to repair and upgrade our waterways because so many of our \nbusinesses--and millions of jobs--depend on them. The bill would also \nhelp restore aquatic ecosystems and habitats, and it includes several \nprovisions that are important for Michigan and the Great Lakes.\n  I wish to express my thanks to the chair and ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senators Boxer and Inhofe, for \ntheir work on this bill. I also want to thank them for including a \nnumber of important provisions for the Great Lakes, one of the world's \ngreatest natural resources. The Michigan and Great Lakes projects that \nI had requested, and which were included in the Senate bill, were \nretained in the conference report. Additionally, other important \nprojects included in the House WRDA bill that I asked to be included in \nthe conference report were retained.\n  I am also pleased that a provision that I added as an amendment to \nthe Senate WRDA bill was retained in the conference report. This \nprovision would expedite the operation and maintenance, including \ndredging, of the Great Lakes commercial navigation channels and \ninfrastructure. This is a key provision because the Great Lakes are in \nthe midst of a crisis: Freighters are getting stuck in shipping \nchannels, other ships are carrying reduced loads, and some shipments \nhave simply ceased altogether. This WRDA provision would work to \naddress the very serious dredging backlog in the Great Lakes, which has \nbeen exacerbated by historically low water levels. I am also thankful \nthat the bill includes a Sense of the Congress that states that the \nCorps' budget for dredging should be developed by using all available \neconomic data rather than focusing on a single metric such as the \namount of cargo being moved. I worked with the Senate bill managers to \naddress this problem when WRDA was being debated on the Senate floor. \nAt that time, the bill managers agreed to work with me to address this \nproblem in the conference committee, and indeed they did. And for that, \nI am grateful.\n  Also of vital importance for the Great Lakes navigation system is a \nprovision in the conference report that modifies the authorization to \nconstruct a second Poe-sized lock at Sault Ste. Marie, so that it will \nbe constructed at full Federal expense for a total cost of \n$341,714,000. Two-thirds of the carrying capacity of the U.S. Great \nLakes fleet is currently limited to the one large lock, the Poe lock. \nIf the Poe lock should fail, shipping between Lake Superior and Lake \nHuron would essentially cease, and the steel industry, coal-reliant \nindustries, and agricultural industries dependent on farm exports would \nbe severely harmed. This authorization to waive the non-Federal cost-\nshare requirement is an important step for ensuring the viability of \nthe Great Lakes shipping infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S11990]]\n\n  Another important provision for the health of the Great Lakes that \nwas retained in the bill is a provision that authorizes the completion \nof the dispersal barrier to prevent invasive species, such as the Asian \ncarp, from moving between the Mississippi River watershed and the Great \nLakes. Further, the bill directs the Corps to operate both barriers I \nand II at full Federal expense and provides credit to those States that \nprovided funds to begin construction of barrier II. The bill also \ndirects the Corps to conduct a feasibility study on other ways to \nprevent the spread of invasives between the Great Lakes and Mississippi \nRiver.\n  The bill also retains a Senate WRDA provision that I have been \nworking on for many years: the improvement of Michigan's water and \nsewage infrastructure. An authorization of $35 million is included in \nthe WRDA conference report for a statewide environmental infrastructure \nproject to correct combined sewer overflows, which is a major source of \npollution in the Great Lakes and other waterbodies in Michigan. \nCombined sewer overflows carry both stormwater and sewage, and these \ncan be discharged into streams, rivers, and lakes during periods of \nheavy rains. The $35 million provision in WRDA authorizes the Army \nCorps to partner with communities throughout Michigan to improve their \nsewer infrastructure. These improvements would not only benefit \ncommunities but would also help protect our precious water resources.\n  As the recent tragic collapse of a Minnesota bridge has made all too \nclear, the repair and modernization of this Nation's infrastructure \nneeds to be a much higher priority. Just as roads and bridges need \nurgent repairs, we cannot wait further for authorizing important water \nprojects that protect lives and property, support commerce and \nindustry, and preserve and restore our environmental resources. We have \nwaited 7 years for this bill. Now is the time to pass this bill, and it \nshould not be held up by a Presidential veto, which I am confident the \nCongress would override.\n  While these important provisions, as well as several others that I \nhave not mentioned, provide the authorization for addressing the \ndredging backlog in the Great Lakes, restoring the environmental \nintegrity of our waters, and providing critical flood protection \nprojects, the appropriations needed to make these provisions a reality \nare down the road. The next critical step is to appropriate the actual \nfunding for these necessary projects.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong \nopposition to the conference report on the Water Resources Development \nAct of 2007. The legislation being considered today far exceeds the \nalready outrageous spending that was approved in both the House- and \nSenate-passed bills and would drastically increase the backlog of Army \nCorps of Engineers construction projects while doing nothing to \nmodernize the system for funding these projects. I wonder, did we learn \nnothing from Hurricane Katrina?\n  In August of 2005, this Nation witnessed a horrible national \ndisaster. When Hurricane Katrina hit, it brought with it destruction \nand tragedy beyond compare, more so than our Nation had seen in \ndecades. Almost 2 years later, the gulf coast region is still trying to \nrebuild, and there is a long road ahead. I thought that we had learned \na few lessons from this tragedy, but as our Nation continues to \ndedicate significant resources to the reconstruction effort, we are now \nbeing asked to quickly approve a conference report that only \nperpetuates the problems with both the funding and management of the \nCorps of Engineers.\n  During Senate consideration of this bill, Senator Feingold offered an \namendment that I was pleased to cosponsor that would have established a \nsystem to give clarity to the process used for funding Corps projects. \nOf course, that amendment was not adopted. It is unacceptable to me \nthat this Congress isn't interested in how best to allocate our limited \nCorps resources or how taxpayer dollars would be used most effectively. \nMy question is, What is wrong with having some concept of what our \nNation's priorities are for waterworks projects? Why are we rejecting \npolicies to help us identify where the greatest infrastructure needs \nare? Are people worried that showing the American people how their \nmoney is really being spent may result in their pet project being moved \ndown the list for funding?\n  Today's practice, as illustrated again by this legislation, allows a \nMember of Congress to get a project authorized and funded without \nhaving any idea of how that project affects the overall infrastructure \nof our Nation's waterways--or whether it is even needed. There is \nalready a $58 billion backlog in Corps projects, and the bill before us \nincreases that backlog by an additional $23.2 billion according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. That is a 40-percent increase in the size \nof the existing backlog. Yet consider how much funding the Corps \nreceives annually on average--$2 billion. Anyone can do the math and \nrealize that we are perpetuating a significant problem. But that won't \nstop so many of my colleagues from congratulating themselves on passage \nof this bill--a bill the White House intends to veto.\n  I find it particularly ironic that just before the August recess this \nbody claimed to be turning a new page and taking significant steps \ntoward ending the process of secret earmarks and porkbarrel politics \nwhen it passed the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. \nThis bill is beyond more of the same with over 900 projects, up from \n600 projects in both the Senate and the House passed bills. As stated \nin a recent letter from the Director of OMB and Assistant Secretary of \nthe Army for Civil Works, ``Because the conference version of H.R. 1495 \nsignificantly exceeds the cost of either the House or Senate bill and \ncontains other unacceptable provisions discussed below, the President \nwill veto the bill.'' I applaud the President's vow to veto this bill.\n  While the bill before us today includes an ``independent'' review \nprocess in name, as Senator Feingold and I have pushed for during \ndebate on the last two Senate-passed bills, the conference report \nprovision does not promote true independent review at all. Senator \nFeingold and I championed language that would have established a \nprocess by which the planning and design of Corps projects could be \nreviewed by a panel of experts. As stated by an editorial in the \nWashington Post on August 6, 2007, entitled ``Watered Down,'' ``The \nCorps has a long history of overly rosy environmental and economic \nanalysis of such projects, tailored to the political needs of its \nfunders in Congress. Review of Corps projects by independent experts \nwould deter such behavior, which threatens not only the federal budget \nbut public safety. The Senate version of the legislation was very tough \non this point.'' I will ask to have the editorial printed in the Record \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  The legislation before us drastically dilutes the Senate-passed \nprovision and gives the Corps undue influence over this panel. The \nreview process will actually be housed within the Corps rather than \noutside the agency as the Senate bill required, and the Corps' Chief of \nEngineers is also given significant authority to decide the timing of \nreview, the projects to be reviewed, and whether to implement a review \npanel's recommendations. This new system will only compound the \nproblems with an agency that has brought about countless mismanaged and \nincredibly expensive construction and maintenance projects.\n  I believe this conference report is fundamentally flawed in many \nways, not the least of which is its cost. As stated by the Tax Payers \nfor Common Sense, ``In High School Civics students learn that \nconference committees are where lawmakers hash out the differences \nbetween House and Senate bills. But in the case of WRDA (H.R. 1495), \nthe Corps of Engineers water projects bill, a $14 billion Senate bill \nmet a $15 billion house and ballooned into a whopping $21 billion \nmonster. . . . The ultimate price tag will be far higher because of \nnumerous policy changes that are intended to shift costs from who \nbenefits onto the federal taxpayer. For these reasons, the President \ndid the right thing by promising to veto the bill if it gets to his \ndesk. . . . Lawmakers should start over again and come back with a \nfiscally responsible bill that includes stronger policy reforms for \nindependent peer review of costly, controversial, or critical projects, \nmodernized economic guidance and creates a system to prioritize\n\n[[Page S11991]]\n\nlimited federal funding. All these proposals will save taxpayers in the \nlong term.''\n  Mr. President, it is time that we end this process of blind spending, \nthrowing money at projects that may or may not benefit the larger good. \nIt is time for us to take a post-Katrina look at the world and learn \nfrom our experiences over the past years instead of being content with \nbusiness as usual. Shouldn't we be doing all that we can to reform the \nCorps and ensure that the most urgent projects are being funded and \nconstructed? Or are we more content with needless earmarks--too often \nat the expense of projects that are of most need?\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have the editorial to which I referred \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 6, 2007]\n\n                              Watered Down\n\n\nAnother pork-laden bill for the Army Corps of Engineers contains modest \n                       checks on future projects\n\n       When Last we checked, the Water Resources Development Act \n     was a $14 billion bill larded with pork-barrel projects. Now \n     it is a $21 billion bill, having taken on still more pork in \n     a House-Senate conference committee, and it appears headed \n     for passage. One small factor in the bill's growth was the \n     addition, during the closed-door conference, of tens of \n     millions of dollars' worth of pet projects not previously \n     debated in either chamber. Interestingly enough, Congress has \n     also just passed an ethics bill that was arguably designed, \n     in part, to prevent this sort of thing. But that legislation \n     has not yet taken effect.\n       Of greater concern are the bill's provisions for \n     independent review of proposed dams, levees and other \n     projects to be built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The \n     Corps has a long history of overly rosy environmental and \n     economic analysis of such projects, tailored to the political \n     needs of its funders in Congress. Review of Corps projects by \n     independent experts would deter such behavior, which \n     threatens not only the federal budget but public safety.\n       The Senate version of the legislation was very tough on \n     this point. It would have required peer review of projects \n     costing $40 million or more and permitted state governors, \n     federal agencies and the general public to initiate mandatory \n     peer reviews of other projects. It would have created a \n     separate federal office to oversee the reviews, and it stated \n     explicitly that federal courts did not have to defer to the \n     Corps' reasoning when the agency decided to reject the \n     findings of an independent panel. But, after negotiations \n     between the Senate and the House, which favored a nearly \n     toothless process, the final bill leaves out much of the \n     Senate language: It raises the minimum dollar amount \n     slightly, to $45 million, and says that only governors, not \n     federal agencies or public interest groups, can call for \n     mandatory peer review. The Corps can waive review of smaller \n     projects where it sees no environmental issues. Inexplicably, \n     the peer review law expires in seven years.\n       The good news is that the bill requires the Corps to assign \n     the reviews to the respected National Academy of Sciences; it \n     also wisely permits reviewers to consider a wide range of \n     issues. President Bush has understandably threatened a veto \n     because of the bill's cost, but there are more than enough \n     votes to override. Imperfect as it is, this bill is likely to \n     become law. Supporters of the compromise, such as Sen. \n     Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chairman of the Environment and \n     Public Works Committee, say that their tough oversight will \n     make it work, a promise that will itself be tested in the \n     months ahead.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, although I supported the Senate-passed \nversion of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, I cannot \nsupport the conference version of WRDA because it significantly exceeds \nthe costs of both the Senate and House-passed bills and includes many \nprojects outside the Army Corps of Engineers' traditional \nresponsibilities. I am not alone in my opposition. Indeed, the Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant Secretary of \nthe Army have indicated to Congress that the President will veto the \nbill in its current form.\n  The conference reported version of WRDA would cost approximately $21 \nbillion, which is about $7 billion more than the Senate and House-\npassed versions. The $21 billion ``compromise'' reached in conference \nis not a fiscally responsible bill and, therefore, should not pass.\n  The conference version also inappropriately contains many projects \noutside the Corps' primary missions of navigation, flood damage \nreduction, and ecosystem restoration, such as environmental \ninfrastructure projects. These environmental infrastructure projects \ndivert vital resources away from the Corps' primary responsibilities, \nand add to the backlog of Corps projects. This is especially troubling \nsince according to the Congressional Research Service the Corps' \nbacklog of authorized projects is currently estimated to be 800 \ntotaling nearly $38 billion to $60 billion.\n  I do recognize that the conference version of WRDA contains a number \nof important projects, some of which are located in my home state of \nArizona. I would like to thank the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for including many of the projects I requested in the bill. \nIt is important to note, however, that because of the backlog of Corps \nprojects and concerns relating to WRDA's costs, I limited the requests \nI made. The same cannot be said for the conference version of WRDA. \nConsequently, I cannot support the bill in its current form.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Water \nResources Development Act of 2007. We have waited a long time for this \nbill, almost 7 years.\n  I thank Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe for their hard work \non this legislation and getting this bill through a conference and here \nbefore us today.\n  The bill authorizes navigation, ecosystem restoration, and flood and \nstorm damage reduction projects all over the country. Most \nsignificantly for Illinois, the bill will increase lock capacity and \nimprove the ecosystem of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.\n  The Mississippi River is the backbone of our waterway transportation \nsystem and transports $12 billion worth of products each year, \nincluding over 1 billion bushels of grain to ports around the world. \nThis efficient river transportation is vital to Illinois. Shipping via \nbarge keeps exports competitive and reduces transportation costs. That \nis good for producers and consumers. More than half of Illinois' annual \ncorn crop and 75 percent of all U.S. soybean exports travel via the \nUpper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.\n  There are huge cost and environmental benefits to shipping by barge \nas well. Barges operate at 10 percent of the cost of trucks and 40 \npercent of the cost of trains. They release much less carbon monoxide, \nnitrous oxide, and hydrocarbons, and use much less fuel to operate.\n  But the system of locks and dams along the Upper Mississippi that \nmake travel possible are in desperate need of modernization. The \ncurrent system was built 70 years ago and needs to be updated to \naccount for modern barging. Many of the older locks are only 600 feet \nin length, while most current barge tows using the waterway are twice \nas long. That means these goods take twice as long to get down river \nand into the marketplace. The conference report before us today \nauthorizes replacing and upgrading many of the locks and dams along the \nMississippi.\n  The legislation authorizes $2.2 billion for replacing and upgrading \nlocks and dams and another $1.7 billion for ecosystem restoration along \nthe river.\n  As we have seen in the tragedy that occurred along Minnesota's 35W \nBridge, our country's infrastructure is aging and overburdened.\n  The projects included in the bill are sorely needed to shore up our \nwaterway system, a vital component of our national infrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, the President has threatened to veto the WRDA bill. \nThis bill is years overdue, and a veto by this Administration will mean \nyet another delay for important projects in Illinois and across the \ncountry.\n  The WRDA conference report passed the House this August by a vote of \n380-40. And when the Senate originally considered the bill earlier this \nyear, there were only four dissenting votes.\n  The bill will be sent to the President with broad bipartisan support \nfrom both the House and the Senate, and he should reconsider his threat \nto veto this bill.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield just on the time issue?\n  It is my understanding that Senator Feingold has yielded us 20 \nminutes, so\n\n[[Page S11992]]\n\nI ask unanimous consent that Senator Inhofe get an additional 10 \nminutes and I get an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me say to my good friend from \nLouisiana that I do agree with her. I hope the President doesn't veto \nthis bill, but whether he does or doesn't, it won't make any \ndifference. The outcome is going to be the same. We are going to have \nthis bill. But let me give him the assurance that the place to start \nusing his veto is when we start spending money in places we shouldn't \nspend money and not on this authorization.\n  I am going to make sure everybody understands, even though I have \nmade a number of statements here in support of this authorization bill, \nit doesn't mean I am going to support everything on it. There will be \nthings, when it comes up to appropriations time, that I will be down \nhere leading the opposition and asking the President to veto some of \nthese things. But you have to have discipline in some way. There has to \nbe some kind of a guideline, some kind of criteria used.\n  Let me for a minute talk parochially about my State of Oklahoma. \nThese are things that are in here for my State but things that should \nbe in here. These are things the Government should be doing.\n  Lake Arcadia is a good example. The city of Edmond is the fastest \ngrowing city in Oklahoma. Because of a set of circumstances, they were \nbeing billed and have been billed for years now for water they were not \neven using. All that is corrected in here. In the event this bill \nshould not pass, those people of the city of Edmond, OK, are going to \nhave to come up with money to pay for something they never got.\n  Lake Texoma--the same situation. The Red River Chloride Control \nProject in this bill clarifies the operation and maintenance of \nOklahoma chloride control projects at the Red River. This is critically \nimportant to our farmers in southern Oklahoma.\n  We have Ottawa County's Tar Creek. The most devastating Superfund \nsite in America that has been addressed now for 25, 26 years is Tar \nCreek in northern Oklahoma, which goes into southern Kansas, and \nnothing has been done. We have spent millions and millions of dollars, \nuntil 4\\1/2\\ years ago, when I became chairman of this committee, with \nthe help of the Democrats, Senator Boxer included, we were able to \nactually get in there and do something. We have some of the projects \nthat are necessary to ultimately take care of that devastating thing in \nnorthern Oklahoma.\n  Now, I spent several years--three terms--being mayor of a major city \nin Oklahoma--Tulsa, OK. In Tulsa, OK, one of the biggest problems we \nhad--and I daresay if you were to talk to any mayor in America they \nwould say the same thing--the biggest problem in my city was not \nprostitution or crime in the streets; it was unfunded mandates. So we \nhad the Federal Government coming along telling us what to do and \nmandating that certain things be done, and some of my poorer \ncommunities in Oklahoma were just not able to do it. Let me just give a \ncouple of examples.\n  All of these towns and cities in Oklahoma I have been in and I have \nseen different things the Federal Government has come in and told them \nto do and not funded them. They are projects in Ada, Norman, Wilburton, \nWeatherford, Bethany, Woodward, Langley, Durant, Midwest City--that \nproject in Midwest City is a water infrastructure type of project--\nArdmore, Guymon, OK, out in the panhandle. I was out there during the \nlast recess, and they were having a very serious problem with \nwastewater treatment. This would resolve that problem. Altus, OK; \nChickasha, OK; Goodwell, OK; Bartlesville, Konawa, Mustang, and Alva. \nAnd when you stop and you think about all these things, these are \nthings that--it should not be their responsibility. They do not have \nthe capability of doing it. They are all things that came from the \nFederal government. Here I am, the No. 1 most conservative Member, \nsaying Government does have a function. The major function I have \nalways said is defending America and its infrastructure.\n  Let me mention a couple of things, if I could, Madam President.\n  I have a letter here from the Department of the Army, the Assistant \nSecretary of Civil Works, which is the Corps of Engineers, and they say \nthe Corps already has an enormous backlog of ongoing projects that will \nrequire future appropriations of some $38 billion. Well, I use that in \nmy argument as to why this is necessary. There is a reason for the \nbacklog. At the time, they were authorized, but then circumstances \nchanged. Some of these projects don't need to be done and will never be \ndone.\n  By the way, when you talk about the amount of money that is going to \nbe authorized, you don't know, first of all, how much of that $21 \nbillion or $23 billion--maybe half of it--will ultimately be spent. We \ndon't know. Some may be spent next year, some 10 years from now. It is \njust authorizing, just saying that at this snapshot in time, these are \nthings which need to be done in America, these are legitimate, these \nmeet the criteria. So that argument is no good.\n  He says that adding excessive new authorizations to this backlog is \nunaffordable and unnecessary. This sentence implies it is inadvisable \nto authorize new projects until all current authorized projects are \ncompleted, and nothing could be further from the truth. Certainly \nproviding adequate hurricane protection in New Orleans is a higher \npriority than some of the already authorized projects, but we didn't \nknow it at the time these were authorized. That is why this is \nimportant.\n  It said in this letter that the bill will include numerous \nauthorizations that are outside of and inappropriate for the mission of \nthe Corps of Engineers, and so forth. Well, the conference report does \nnot include authorization of surface transportation projects for the \nCorps of Engineers. That isn't something we do.\n  So you look at the arguments they have, and it gets right back to the \nargument that the attack here, as I said, going all the way back to \n1816, is on the authorization process. The only discipline we have in \nspending in this body is to have an authorization process.\n  Again, I will repeat, there is going to be some of these that are \nauthorized that I would feel in my heart should not be appropriated, \nand I will fight against their appropriation. That is where the battle \nshould be fought, and I think it is going to be.\n\n  I don't want to question anyone's sincerity in their opposition, but \nI think there are a lot of people who will go home and have a press \nrelease saying: I voted against spending some $23 billion. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. You oppose the authorization system \nand you oppose discipline in spending.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, could you tell us how much time remains \nbetween Senator Inhofe and myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 6 minutes, and \nthe Senator from California has 13 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, let me say as we wind down that I think \nthis committee, of which I am so proud to be the chairman, and I am so \npleased to work with Senator Inhofe on these infrastructure issues, has \ndone its work. I think we have done our job.\n  Now, of course, you can always find something that somebody doesn't \nlike in a bill, but the fact is, as Senator Inhofe explained with a \nmost instructive set of charts--and I thank him so much for going back \nthrough the history of the difference between appropriations and \nauthorizations--this is an important step and a necessary step in the \nprocess but by no means the last step.\n  He talked about the appropriations process, and I talked about the \nprocess now that Senator Feingold and Senator McCain got added to this \nbill. Although they are still not happy with everything we have done, \nit creates an independent review. So we will have independent review, \nwe will have appropriations. Therefore, this is a very necessary first \nstep after these projects have come up really from our constituents, \nfrom our homeowners, from our city councils, from our boards of \nsupervisors, from our mayors and governors, et cetera. So I believe we \nhave put together a bill that meets our communities' needs, and I think \nwe have done it in the very best way we can. We have complied with the \nnew ethics rules.\n\n[[Page S11993]]\n\n  By the way, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter dated today from Majority Leader Reid and the Rules Committee \nchair, Senator Feinstein, replying to Senator DeMint on the issue of \nwhether the Senate rule XLIV point of order applies to authorization \nbills.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2007.\n     Sen. Jim DeMint,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeMint: Thank you for your letter last \n     Thursday regarding the earmark reform provisions in Public \n     Law 110-81, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of \n     2007. This law, which passed the House by a vote of 411-8 and \n     the Senate by a vote of 83-14, has been hailed by independent \n     congressional reform advocates as ``far-reaching reform'' and \n     ``landmark legislation.'' According to Democracy 21 President \n     Fred Wertheimer, ``this Congress has passed fundamental \n     government integrity reforms to respond to the worst \n     congressional corruption scandals in thirty years.''\n       The new law (and procedures adopted by Senate committees in \n     anticipation of the law's enactment) has already improved \n     public awareness of earmarking activity--activity that had \n     been obscured from public view even as the number of earmarks \n     exploded during Republican control of Congress over the last \n     decade. For the first time, earmarks and the identity of \n     their sponsors are fully disclosed on the Internet before \n     legislation comes to the Senate floor, and there is a \n     meaningful process to curb the inclusion of dead-of-night \n     spending in conference reports.\n       Your letter of September 20 challenges an anticipated \n     ruling by the Senate Parliamentarian regarding the scope of \n     the new point of order in Rule XLIV. But you fail to \n     acknowledge that the ruling you now claim to be ``saddened'' \n     by is compelled by key definitions in two amendments you \n     sponsored during Senate floor debate last January, both of \n     which were incorporated into the final bill essentially word-\n     for-word. Further, the anticipated ruling is grounded on \n     sound policy reasons involving the distinction between mere \n     authorizations and actual spending provisions--a distinction \n     that you and Senator Coburn openly discussed during floor \n     debate on your amendments.\n       At the outset, we note that many of the new rules in Pub. \n     L. 110-81 apply to authorization bills as well as spending \n     bills. For example, the newly strengthened Rule XXVIII, which \n     permits ``surgical'' points of order against out-of-scope \n     matter in a conference report, applies to all types of \n     conference reports, including authorizing bills and \n     appropriations bills. The Rule XXVIII point of order \n     maintains the longstanding definition of out-of-scope matter.\n       Similarly, the disclosure requirements in new Rule XLIV \n     apply to legislative items that merely authorize spending, as \n     well as those that actually spend money. Moreover, disclosure \n     is required for items in committee reports as well as in \n     legislative text. Information about such items, including the \n     identity of the members who sponsored them, must be posted on \n     a public Internet website 48 hours before a bill is \n     considered on the Senate floor.\n       The new point of order in Rule XLIV, however, applies to \n     actual spending rather than to mere authorizations. This new \n     point of order is extraordinary because, for the first time, \n     Senate rules prohibit conferees from including in a \n     conference report matter plainly within the scope of the \n     conference. The anticipated interpretation by the \n     Parliamentarian is compelled by the plain language of \n     amendments that you yourself sponsored during Senate debate \n     on the ethics bill.\n       Amendment No. 11, which you successfully offered and the \n     relevant part of which was included word-for-word in the \n     final law, requires public disclosure not only of certain \n     items ``providing'' funding but also items ``authorizing or \n     recommending'' funding. Thus, the explicit language requires \n     disclosure of items in appropriations bills, authorizing \n     bills, and even report language accompanying bills.\n       But Amendment No. 98, which you co-sponsored with Senators \n     Ensign and McCain and which was adopted by unanimous consent, \n     contains a completely different definition of items that \n     would be subject to a point of order if included in a \n     conference report. This definition, unlike the definition in \n     Amendment No. 11, makes no reference to authorizations; \n     instead, it describes an item ``containing a specific level \n     of funding for any specific account, specific program, \n     specific project, or specific activity, when no such specific \n     funding was provided for'' in either the House or Senate \n     bill. Further, a provision in that amendment made clear that \n     it only applied to appropriations conference reports--if a \n     point of order was sustained, ``any modification of total \n     amounts appropriated necessary to reflect the deletion of the \n     matter struck from the conference report shall be made'' \n     (emphasis added). The definition in Amendment No. 98 was \n     incorporated essentially word-for-word into Public Law 110-\n     81.\n       The inclusion of the word ``authorizing'' in Amendment No. \n     11 and the absence of that word--along with the trigger of \n     ``specific funding'' and reference to ``amounts \n     appropriated''--in Amendment No. 98 compel the \n     Parliamentarian's ruling that authorizations are subject to \n     disclosure but not subject to the new point of order in Rule \n     XLIV. An authorization bill does not contain ``specific \n     funding'' and it does not ``appropriate'' any amounts; it is \n     merely permission for possible funding in the future. An \n     analysis by the Congressional Research Service confirms this \n     interpretation:\n\n       In summary . . . both the originally-passed rule (Section \n     102) and the new Rule XLIV, paragraph 8, would seem to apply \n     to provisions providing appropriations and direct spending \n     only, generally to provisions that provide some form of \n     spending authority. Neither rule would seem to apply to \n     provisions simply authorizing or reauthorizing a program, \n     project, or activity, without providing any funding.\n\n     Memo from the Congressional Research Service to Majority \n     Leader Reid, September 11, 2007.\n\n       The remarks of you and your co-sponsors during the Senate \n     floor debate on S. 1 also reflect this understanding. In \n     arguing for earmark reform you spoke about ``spending'' and \n     ``appropriations'' bills. For example, you said: ``And if we \n     put that money in an appropriations bill designated just for \n     them, it is an earmark. That is a Federal earmark.'' (Cong. \n     Rec. 8417, Jan. 11, 2007). You urged that Congress ``show the \n     American people that we were going to spend their money in an \n     honest way.'' (Id. at 8416). You said you were ``trying to \n     let the American people know how we are spending their \n     money.'' (Id. at S417). And you made the point that ``in the \n     appropriations bills there were 12,852 earmarks.'' (Id. at \n     S426). (Emphases added in each case.)\n       In your floor colloquy with Senator Coburn, he repeatedly \n     emphasized that your shared concern was with ``appropriations \n     bills'' and ``spending.'' (See id. at 425-427). In fact, \n     Senator Coburn was very explicit in identifying the \n     difference between an authorizing bill and an appropriations \n     bill and stated flatly: ``you don't have an earmark if it is \n     authorized'' (Id. at S42); ``Items authorized are not \n     earmarks'' (Id. at S427).\n       Similarly, in Senator Ensign and McCain's comments \n     regarding Amendment No. 98, they spoke about federal spending \n     and appropriations bills, not authorizing bills--``We should \n     scrutinize how Federal dollars are spent''; ``We must ensure \n     that taxpayers'' dollars are being spent wisely''; ``The \n     growth in earmarked funding in appropriations bills during \n     the past 12 years has been staggering.'' (Id. at S 741, \n     emphases added). Nothing in the floor debate on S. 1 reflects \n     an intent to subject authorizing language in conference \n     reports to the point of order under Rule XLIV. Quite the \n     opposite--the plain language of the amendments and the floor \n     debate on earmarks was focused on spending and appropriations \n     bills. The sentiments you now express simply do not square \n     with relevant legislative history.\n       There are sound policy reasons for the distinction between \n     authorizations and spending provisions under Rule XLIV. The \n     availability of a surgical point of order against a \n     conference report represents an exception to the long-\n     standing parliamentary principle that a conference report may \n     not be amended. Since conference reports must be adopted in \n     identical form by both houses of Congress, endless amendment \n     of conference reports would disrupt the orderly resolution of \n     legislative disagreements. In order to instill needed \n     discipline in the legislative process, the new law creates \n     two exceptions to that principle: the surgical point of order \n     against out-of-scope material under Rule XXVIII and the point \n     of order against new spending items in conference reports \n     under Rule XLIV. But extension of the Rule XLIV point of \n     order to authorizing language in conference reports is \n     unwarranted and would thwart finality in the legislative \n     process.\n       Stronger safeguards are appropriate when Congress actually \n     spends taxpayer money, whether in appropriations bills or in \n     other bills which directly affect the federal budget. But \n     when Congress passes an authorizing bill, it is simply \n     expressing a goal. For instance, spending for disadvantaged \n     students under Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act was \n     authorized at $25 billion in FY07, but only $12.8 billion in \n     funding was actually appropriated. The pending Water \n     Resources Development bill authorizes billions of dollars for \n     water projects, but the actual funding of those projects will \n     occur through the appropriations process. In fact, tens of \n     billions of dollars worth of water resources projects have \n     been authorized over the years, but have not yet been \n     funded through an appropriations bill. Each of the \n     spending decisions in the appropriations bills will be \n     subject to the discipline that the new Senate rules impose \n     on such bills and may be challenged during consideration \n     of those bills.\n       When earmark abuse occurs, it involves the unjustified use \n     of taxpayer money--not the setting of authorization levels. \n     It is appropriate to require full disclosure of all items \n     that involve specific member-requested projects, including \n     authorizations, but only those items that actually spend \n     taxpayer money should be subject to the extraordinary \n     procedure of allowing a point of order to strike a provision \n     that is within the scope of conference from a conference \n     report.\n       Despite your ongoing campaign to discredit the Honest \n     Leadership and Open Government Act, we remain confident its \n     passage was a major accomplishment. 83 Senators and 411 House \n     members voted for the\n\n[[Page S11994]]\n\n     final bill because they recognized it for what it is: the \n     most sweeping ethics reforms in years and a huge step forward \n     toward restoring the confidence of the American people in \n     their government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n                                          Senate, Majority Leader.\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n                                    Chair, Senate Rules Committee.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. So, Madam President, we have complied in full with the \nEthics Committee, and we worked with the Parliamentarian every step of \nthe way to make sure we were in total concert with that new law because \nwe are respectful of it. We have letters from every Senator. We have a \ntransparent process here. Everyone who asked for a project put their \nname on the line, and we made sure there was no pecuniary interest of a \nMember or their family.\n  So this is an important day for our country. We have all said this in \ndifferent ways, but we are authorizing projects our communities need to \nhelp protect millions of people in our Nation from catastrophic \nflooding. It also will help restore the great wetlands, estuaries, and \nrivers of our Nation, places where wildlife thrive and that our \nfamilies enjoy today. We want to make sure they enjoy them in the \nfuture--the hunting, the fishing, the boating, the camping, the outdoor \nindustries.\n  By the way, those outdoor industries are a very important part of our \neconomy. We call it the recreation economy. Without these projects, \nthey simply won't be able to thrive.\n  WRDA makes other important contributions. It authorizes projects for \nour communities that they need to increase their capacity at their \nports, to make shipping easier, safer, and more efficient. It literally \nkeeps America's economy moving. You cannot have a great country if you \ndon't keep up with the infrastructure needs. We saw what happened when \na bridge collapses, and we are dealing with that in the committee as \nwell.\n  Look what happens if we don't keep up with our water projects. We are \nnot going to be able to move our ships. I know there are, for example, \nin California so many ports, but in many cases a lot of silt builds up \nand they can't move those ships through. So we need to do that. These \nare our gateways to the world. Our manufactured goods, such as computer \nchips, agricultural goods, grains, wines, and fruits, pass through our \nports and harbors to be sold around the world. We have $5.5 billion \nworth of goods passing through our ports each day and more than 2.5 \nbillion tons of trade moving through our ports each year. Colleagues, \nthat volume is expected to double over the next 15 years.\n  That is why we say to this President: Please, please sign this bill. \nWhy do we have to fight over every single thing? The fact is, you can't \nhave a great economy, the greatest economy in the world, if we can't \nkeep our goods moving. And we need to create thousands of new jobs \nright here in America. The port economy is responsible for \napproximately 5 million jobs--and ``jobs'' is your middle name, Madam \nPresident. So this bill will keep jobs being created and keep goods \nmoving. WRDA is essential for goods movement.\n  I mentioned recreation. Maybe some people don't know this, but the \nCorps of Engineers is the largest provider of outdoor recreation, \noperating more than 2,500 recreation areas at 463 projects and leasing \nan additional 1,800 sites to State or local parks and recreation \nauthorities or private interests. At these projects around the country, \nthe Corps hosts 360 million visitors a year at its lakes, beaches, and \nother areas. One in ten Americans--25 million people--visits a Corps \nproject at least once a year, and this generates 600,000 jobs related \nto all of this movement.\n  So, colleagues, we can all agree that public health and safety, \neconomic growth, and environmental protection are important goals, and \nthis bill helps to achieve them.\n  Finally, I wish to say a word of thanks to leader Harry Reid, who has \njust come onto the floor to make a statement of his own. I know Senator \nInhofe and I spoke to Senator Reid many, many times, and I know it is \ndifficult for him because, just so the public understands, everyone who \ngets a bill out of his or her committee goes right to the majority \nleader to beg for time.\n  He made a commitment to me. He told me, and I remember it: When the \nJewish holidays are completed, we will turn to WRDA. And that is what \nhe did. He is a man of his word. This is so very important for the \ncountry.\n  Finally, let me thank the staff. First, the Democratic staff: Bettina \nPoirier, Ken Kopocis, Jeff Rosato, Tyler Rushforth; EPW Republican \nstaff: Andy Wheeler, Ruth Van Mark, Angie Giancarlo, Let Mon Lee--I \nhave gotten to know these as family; also, the staff of Senator Baucus: \nJo-Ellen Darcy and Paul Wilkins; and staff of Senator Isakson: Mike \nQuiello.\n  This has been not an easy time. But when you get a bill that is \nsupported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the American Farm Bureau, and the three biggest \nconstruction labor organizations--Laborers' International, \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers, United Brotherhood of \nCarpenters and Joiners--when you get all those, plus a host of local \npeople, plus a host of water people, I think we are answering a need.\n  Again, I thank each and every member of the staff, my dear friend \nSenator Inhofe for being such a good fighter for this, and all the \nMembers of the Senate. I know we are going to have a great vote.\n  It is my understanding Senator Inhofe may have a closing word prior \nto Senator Reid speaking, so I yield my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding I do have more \ntime left than I will take. A quick word. I had a communication from my \nwife that she thought I was getting a little emotional about this, so \nlet me end on a very positive note and say, yes, I have a presentation \nI make to groups, to conservative groups, talking about the history of \nauthorizations since 1816. I gave an abbreviated edition a few minutes \nago.\n  It is so frustrating to me to see people saying, if for some reason--\nit isn't going to happen. This is going to pass by a huge margin. If \nthe President vetoes, he knows it will be overridden. But if for some \nreason this didn't pass, we would be right back where we were in 2002, \n2004, 2006, and we would be having appropriators out there without any \nkind of discipline or any kind of process to go through in making those \ndeterminations.\n  I think it would be the wrong thing to do.\n  Lastly--I didn't mention this--in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, we \nhad quite a number of floods. If it had not been for what the Corps of \nEngineers had already done that was previously authorized and then \nlater on was appropriated, it would have cost us, they now say, $5.4 \nbillion more in damages than it did.\n  I hope the good conservatives will look at this and realize we have \nto have authorization in the process.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. This will be the first and last vote today.\n  Madam President, I have been chairman of this committee on two \nseparate occasions, the Environment and Public Works Committee. This is \na masterful piece of legislation that was put together by the two \nmanagers of this bill; the chairman, Senator Boxer, ranking member \nSenator Inhofe. They have been in reverse rolls. Senator Inhofe was \nchairman of this committee.\n  People complain about the Senate not working together on a bipartisan \nbasis and perhaps that is true on a lot of occasions. But there are \nmany occasions where we need to look at the glass being half full \nrather than being half empty, and here is an example of the glass being \nhalf full. This is a fine piece of legislation that is being pushed by \ntwo Senators with ideological bents that are totally different. Senator \nBoxer has one political philosophy, Senator Inhofe has another. But \nthat is how things should work around here.\n  Being a little bit personal about this, I think people recognize that \nSenator Ensign and I work very well together. We are not political \nsoulmates, but we are friends and we work together. That is what has \nbeen accomplished. We don't have political soulmates, but they work \ntogether, giving and taking, and legislation is the art of compromise, \nconsensus building. That is\n\n[[Page S11995]]\n\nwhat this is. Senator Boxer didn't get all she wanted. Senator Inhofe \ndidn't get all he wanted. But they got something good for this country.\n  I want the record spread with the fact that this is an extremely \nimportant piece of legislation that literally could not have been \naccomplished--not only with what they did in committee--they got it \npassed on the floor--frankly, without the persistence they have had. \nAnytime I tried to turn away from it, they would head me in the right \ndirection. I am glad we are here. This bill deserves a big vote. This \nis one of the finest pieces of legislation this body has passed all \nyear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and \nthe Senator from Oregon (Mr. Smith).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we conclude this historic vote, I \nthank colleagues on both sides of the aisle and briefly will put a few \nnames into the Record. I know we are moving to another bill. I wish to \nthank Senator Boxer, Senator Inhofe, and Senator Reid, for living up to \nhis commitment.\n  For the Record, there were several people on my staff who worked so \nhard over the last 7 years: Herman ``Bubba'' Gesser, Allen Richey, Paul \nRainwater, Kathleen Strottman, Jason Matthews, Jason Schendle, \nStephanie Leger, Robert Bailey, Jennifer Lancaster, Tanner Jackson, \nMark Tiner, Lauren Jardell, Elaine Kimbrell and Lucia Marker-Moore.\n  That is how long this bill has been going on. I have literally had 12 \npeople in and out of the Projects Department working on this bill.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from the \nvote today on the conference report of the Water Resources Development \nAct. Had I been present, I would have supported the conference report \nbecause it authorizes a number of essential flood control, navigation \nand ecosystem projects in Massachusetts and around the Nation. We have \na responsibility to safeguard our environment, and this legislation \nwill help ensure that future generations will be able to take full \nadvantage of all that nature offers in Massachusetts.\n  The conference report directs the Army Corps of Engineers to study \nthe Gateway region of Lawrence to determine whether to fill abandoned \nchannels along the Merrimack and Spicket Rivers. Filling the channels \nwill allow for the site to be redeveloped safely and stop chemical \nleakage into the Merrimack River. It also requires the Army Corps to \nconduct a navigation study of the Merrimack River in Haverhill to \ndetermine whether the agency should proceed with dredging to improve \nnavigation.\n  The conference report modifies the coordinates of the Federal \nnavigation channels in the Mystic River in Medford and the Island End \nRiver in Chelsea. The modifications will support waterfront development \nby increasing access to the channels.\n  It also directs the Army Corps of Engineers to study Woods Hole, the \nEast Basin of Cape Cod Canal in Sandwich, and Oak Bluffs Harbor to \ndetermine whether the Army Corps should proceed with dredging in those \nareas to improve navigation. It modifies the coordinates of the federal \nnavigation channels in Chatham's Aunt Lydia's Cove and Falmouth Harbor. \nThese modifications will support waterfront development by increasing \naccess to the channels.\n  An earlier Army Corps of Engineers restoration plan for Milford Pond \nrecommends that the pond be dredged. The conference report authorizes \nthe Army Corps of Engineers to assist the community in removing the \nexcess sediment.\n  Finally, the conference report directs the Army Corps to prepare an \nenvironmental restoration report on Mill Pond in Littleton. This report \nis an essential step before the Army Corps can assist the community in \nremoving excess sediment and restoring the pond.\n  Much good will come from the provisions I have described here, all of \nwhich I worked to include in the final version of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. However, we must recognize that our work to improve \nCorps of Engineers project planning is not done. Corps project planning \nmust account for climate change, and Corps projects should use \nnonstructural approaches whenever practicable to help protect the \nnatural systems that can buffer the increased floods, storms, storm \nsurges, and droughts that we will see as the Earth's temperature \ncontinues to rise. The safety and well-being of communities across the \ncountry are at stake.\n  Many of my colleagues have already expressed their support for this \nimportant change. In May of this year, 51 Senators voted for a \nbipartisan climate change amendment to the Water Resources Development \nAct that I offered along with Senators Collins, Feingold, Sanders, \nCarper, Reed, Biden, Whitehouse, Cantwell, Snowe and Nelson. \nUnfortunately, we needed 60 votes to sustain the amendment.\n  I remain deeply committed to ensuring that the Corps, and all of our \nfederal agencies, plan for the future climate that we know will be upon \nus, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this fight.\n  It is clear that climate change is real and that its affects must be \nfactored into our public policy. It is equally clear that climate \nchange will have very significant consequences for the safety and \nwelfare of the American people, and people across the globe.\n  The basic facts are these: At both poles and in nearly all points in \nbetween, the temperature of the Earth's surface is heating up at a \nfrightening and potentially catastrophic rate. Temperatures have \nalready increased about .8 degrees Centigrade, about 1.4 degrees \nFahrenheit. Even if we could stop all greenhouse gas emissions\n\n[[Page S11996]]\n\ntoday, the current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere almost \ncertainly will produce additional temperature increases. Realistic \nprojections of future warming range from 2 to 11.5 deg. F.\n  These are the findings of scientists and governments from across the \nglobe, as set forth in the most recent report of the IPCC, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That report was written by \nsome 600 scientists and reviewed by 600 experts. It was then edited by \nofficials from 154 governments. The IPCC report concludes that it is \n``unequivocal that Earth's climate is warming as it is now evident from \nthe observations of increases in global averages of air and ocean \ntemperatures, widespread melting of snows and ice, and rising global \nmean sea level.''\n  Scientists expect that the earth's increased temperatures will cause \nan increase in extreme weather events, including more powerful storms, \nmore frequent floods, and extended droughts. These changes threaten the \nhealth and safety of individuals and communities around the globe. \nThese changes also pose a significant threat to the economy, and will \nput added pressure on water resources, increasing competition among \nagricultural, municipal, industrial, and ecological uses.\n  The United States is extremely vulnerable to these threats. Coastal \ncommunities and habitats, especially along the gulf and Atlantic \ncoasts, will be stressed by increasing sea level and more intense \nstorms, both of which can lead to greater storm surges and flooding. In \nthe West, there will be more flooding in the winter and early spring \nfollowed by more water shortages during the summer. The Great Lakes and \nmajor river systems are expected to have lower water levels, \nexacerbating existing challenges for managing water quality, \nnavigation, recreation, hydropower generation, and water transfers. The \nSouthwestern United States is already in the midst of a drought that is \nprojected to continue in the 21st century and may cause the area to \ntransition to a more arid climate.\n  The Corps of Engineers stands on the front lines of all of these \nthreats to our water resources. They are our first responders in the \nfight against global warming. Hurricane and flood protection for New \nOrleans, levees along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, levees in \nSacramento, CA, and ports up and down our coasts, east and west are \njust a few of the many hundreds of Corps projects that will feel the \nstrain, impact, and consequences of global climate change.\n  Corps planning currently does not take climate change into account. \nTo the contrary, the Corps' current planning guidelines are explicitly \nbased on the existence of a stable and unchanging climate, and on the \nassumption that flooding is not affected by climate trends or cycles. \nContinued reliance on these outdated guidelines is like driving down \nthe highway at 80 miles an hour with blinders on. It is bound to lead \nto disaster.\n  The only climate change impact addressed by the Corps' guidelines is \nsea level rise. Under its internal planning guidelines, the Corps is \nsupposed to take account of sea level rise when planning coastal \nprojects. Those guidelines do not require the Corps to assess any other \neffects of global warming like increased hurricanes, storm surges, and \nflooding. The Corps' compliance even with its internal requirement to \nlook at sea level rise is spotty at best. For example, in proposing a \n$133 million dredging project for Bolinas Lagoon in northern \nCalifornia, the Corps said it would not address sea level rise because \nit was too complicated to do so.\n  As importantly, despite a statutory mandate to consider non \nstructural approaches to project planning, the Corps rarely recommends \nsuch approaches. This is true even where such approaches could provide \nthe same or better project benefits. The Corps instead relies heavily \non its traditional approaches of straight jacketing rivers with levees \nand floodwalls. These types of projects sever critical connections \nbetween rivers and their wetlands and floodplains, and lead to \nsignificant coastal and floodplain wetland losses. These approaches \nhave left coastal communities, like New Orleans, far more vulnerable, \nand have exacerbated flood damages by inducing development in high \nrisk, flood prone areas and by increasing downstream flooding.\n  Nonstructural approaches should be used whenever possible as they \navoid damage to healthy rivers, streams, floodplains, and wetlands that \ncan help buffer the increased storms and flooding that we are seeing as \na result of climate change. These systems protect against flooding and \nstorm surge by acting as natural sponges and basins that absorb flood \nwaters and act as barriers between storm surges and homes, buildings, \nand people. Healthy streams and wetlands also help minimize the impacts \nof drought by recharging groundwater supplies and filtering pollutants \nfrom drinking water. Protecting these resources also provides a host of \nadditional benefits, including providing critical habitat for fish and \nwildlife, and exceptional recreational opportunities.\n  Hurricane Katrina showed us the tragic consequences of an intense \nstorm running head on into a badly degraded wetlands system and faulty \nCorps project planning. Coastal wetlands lost to Corps projects were \nnot available to buffer the Hurricane's storm surge before it slammed \ninto the city. One Corps project, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, \nfunneled the storm surge into the heart of New Orleans. Corps projects \nin New Orleans also were not designed to address the increased sea \nlevel rise or land subsidence, and were not strong enough to withstand \nthe type of storm that scientists say may become all too common.\n  I am committed to ensuring that future Corps planning does not repeat \nthe mistakes of the past, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this \nfight as we consider future WRDA bills. Corps project planning must \naccount for the realities of climate change, and protect the natural \nsystems that can buffer its affects.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak with \nSenator Feingold in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  I understand the other side is going to object to a unanimous consent \nrequest. I am going to ask if you would like me to do it upfront. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I always oblige the Senator from Nevada. So if I have \nunanimous consent, that will be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, the Senator is going to \nask for unanimous consent on the bill?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may finish. It is my understanding that the \nSenator has another commitment, and therefore I am happy to accommodate \nhim in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to ask, you are going to ask \nunanimous consent on H.R. 1255 also?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to do that also.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I will wait then.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will do them both first and then both Senators can \nobject, and then Senator Feingold and I will have some time to speak, \nif that is agreeable.\n  Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 96, S. \n223, a bill to require Senate candidates to file designations, \nstatements, and reports in electronic forms; that the committee-\nreported amendment be considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, \nbe read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, I have no objection to the \nunderlying bill, but there is an issue that I had an amendment that I \nwish to add to the bill, if the Senator from California would agree. We \nhave a problem going on in the Senate where there are outside groups \nthat are filing ethics complaints and they are doing it for purely \npolitical reasons.\n  I think we could fix that, at least having transparency, to where if \nsomeone files an ethics complaint against a Senator from the outside, \nthey would have to disclose their donors. So if this is being done \npurely for political reasons, then we would find that out, because we \ncould see who the donors are. We need to protect the institution. We \nneed to protect individual Senators from purely politically motivated \nethics complaints that come against us that sometimes we will have to \nrun up legal bills and all kinds of other things. If it is done purely \nfor partisan reasons, we need to know that, and transparency is the \nbest way to do it. If the Senator from California would modify her \nunanimous consent request to reflect and to add this portion, that at a \ntime to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to consideration of Calendar No. \n96, S. 223, under the following limitations: that the committee-\nreported amendment be agreed to, and that the only other amendment in \norder be an Ensign amendment related to transparency and disclosure, \nwith 1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual form on the bill and \nthe amendment to run concurrently, and that following the use or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to \nthe Ensign amendment, and that the bill, as amended, then be read a \nthird time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, \nwith no intervening action or debate. Would the Senator modify her \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, reserving the right to object, I wish to \nmake a comment or two, if I might. This proposal would require all \norganizations that filed ethics complaints to publicly disclose any \nindividual or entity that has donated $5,000 or more to that \norganization. If the good Senator from Nevada would be willing, I would \nbe very willing to have this proposal considered in the Rules Committee \nin a prompt way. I would not like to hold up passing this commonsense \nsimple filing bill, and I don't want to debate the merits at this time. \nThis bill Senator Ensign is proposing is not germane to the basic bill \nbefore us. It would quite likely be a poison pill that would kill any \nchance of us getting the electronically filed bill enacted into law at \nthis time.\n  I reiterate the offer to hear it in a prompt manner in the Rules \nCommittee, but I must object to it at this time. I do so object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I object to the original unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard on that as well.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, on the original bill, which has just been objected to, \ntwice in April, first on April 17 and then on April 26, I rose to ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate take up and pass S. 223. It was \nreported out by the Committee on Rules on March 28. In the first case \nSenator Alexander objected on behalf of a Republican Senator. In the \nsecond, Senator Bunning rose to object on behalf of the Republican \nside. But to this date, no Republican Senator has come forward to \nacknowledge placing a hold on this bill and say why the bill should not \nbecome law.\n  I wrote the minority leader on May 27 asking for his help in learning \nwho was opposed to the bill and why. But no Members have yet come \nforward to identify themselves. This is a simple, direct bill with \nrespect to transparency. It is an idea whose time has long come. \nEverybody else does it, and so it is very hard for me to understand who \ncould oppose this and what their reason for opposing it could be.\n  At our hearing on March 14 and at our markup on March 28, it was \nclear there was no public opposition to this proposal. I believe it is \ntime for the Senate to act. The bill is entitled Senate Campaign \nDisclosure Parity Act. It is sponsored by Senator Feingold, who sits \nbehind me in the Chamber, Senator Cochran, and 30 other Senators. It \nwould require that Senate campaign finance reports be filed \nelectronically rather than in paper format.\n  Currently House candidates, Presidential candidates, political action \ncommittees, and party committees are all required to file \nelectronically. But Senators, Senate candidates, authorized campaign \ncommittees of Senators, and the Democratic and Republican Senate \ncampaign committees are exempted. So we operate the Senate separately \nfrom everybody else.\n\n  Is this practical? The answer is no. It is cumbersome. Paper copies \nof disclosure reports are filed with the Senate Office of Public \nRecords. They scan them. They make an electronic copy, and they send \nthe copy to the FEC on a dedicated communications line. The FEC then \nprints the report, sends it to a vendor in Fredericksburg, VA, where \nthe information is keyed in by hand and then transferred back to the \nFEC database at a cost of approximately $250,000 to the taxpayers. Of \ncourse, during this convoluted period, there is no transparency. \nTherefore, the reports are not available for public scrutiny.\n  It is long past time to bring the Senate into the modern era and to \nrecognize that transparency is a part of a political process. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in ensuring timely \naccess and disclosure of campaign finance activities to the public. The \nsponsor of this bill, Senator Feingold, has joined me today to urge \npassage of this bill.\n  Thanks to the enactment of S. 1, there is a new reason why we are \ndoing this today. Section 512 of S. 1 now requires Members placing a \nhold on a bill to come forward and identify themselves. To the best of \nmy knowledge, no Member has yet used this section to break through the \nanonymity of a Senate hold. I believe it is appropriate that this \nprovision be asserted now for the first time in connection with a bill \nthat is all about transparency. I think it might be useful for me to \nread it, since it is now the law:\n\n       Section 512 (a) In General.--the Majority and Minority \n     Leaders of the Senate or their designees shall recognize a \n     notice of intent of a Senator who is a member of their caucus \n     to object proceeding to a measure or matter only if the \n     Senator (1) following the objection to a unanimous consent to \n     proceeding to, and, or passage of, a measure or matter on \n     their behalf, submits a notice of intent in writing to the \n     appropriate leader or their designee; and (2) not later than \n     6 session days after submission under paragraph (1), submits \n     for inclusion in the Congressional Record and in the \n     applicable calendar section described in subsection (b) the \n     following notice: ``I, Senator [whoever it is] intend to \n     object to proceeding to [name the bill], dated, for the \n     following reasons.''\n\n  So if 6 Senate days from now the hold on this bill will become \nevident, it has been a rolling hold up until now, but now, after 6 \ndays, we must know who it is.\n  I would believe if there are efforts to obfuscate this section of the \nlaw candidly, we should amend the law to prevent that from happening. \nThis is a simple bill. Everybody is for it. Nobody wants to say who is \nagainst it. I think that should become apparent. I believe Senator \nFeingold and I hope Senator Cochran, the cosponsor of the bill--and \nthey have dozens of cosponsors--would agree.\n  I wish to acknowledge Senator Feingold, if I may, and I yield the \nremainder of my time to him and also thank him for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I, of course, thank the Senator from \nCalifornia, who is chair of the key committee on this bill, for her \npersistence in trying to get this bill through the Senate. We came to \nthe floor twice this\n\n[[Page S11998]]\n\nspring to try to get consent to pass the Senate Campaign Disclosure \nParity Act. Each time an objection was made on behalf of an \nunidentified Republican Senator. Yet no Senator had come to us to let \nus know what his or her objection to the bill is. The source of the \nobjection apparently didn't want to be identified, but when the \nPresident signed the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act last \nweek, as Senator Feinstein pointed out, S. 1, fortunately, secret holds \nbecome a thing of the past, and I am very proud to have been deeply \ninvolved with passage of that legislation. So if an objection was \nlodged today, the objecting Senator would have had to come forward in 6 \nsession days.\n  As far as I know, this was going to be the first test of the new rule \non secret holds, and I was looking forward to learning who the real \nobjector was, as the rule requires, if an objection was made on behalf \nof an unidentified Senator. But now it appears that the Senator from \nNevada has actually identified himself as the objector to the bill, so \nwe know what is going on here.\n  I believe the new provision under the new law is the reason this \nindividual identified himself. I don't think that would have happened \nhad it not been for the positive deterrent effect this new legislation \nhas. Senator Feinstein and I can cite this as the first time this was \nsuccessfully forced in the case of a secret hold.\n  This underlying bill about disclosure, which I authored along with \nothers, is completely noncontroversial. This simply put Senate \ncampaigns under the same obligation to file their reports \nelectronically that the House and Presidential campaigns have been \nforced to do for years. There is simply no reason that the information \nin Senate campaign finance reports should remain less accessible to the \npublic than any other campaign finance reports. We are now at 41 \nbipartisan cosponsors. As the Senator from California pointed out, not \na single concern about the bill was heard in the Rules Committee. The \nbill passed by voice vote, and no one has come to us with any concerns \nabout it at all. So the time has come to get it done. The Senator from \nNevada has made an alternative proposal to bring up the bill but to \nmake an amendment in order. The amendment he wants to offer, however, \nhas nothing to do with this bill. Indeed, it is a very controversial \nproposal to require groups that file ethics complaints to disclose \ntheir donors. I am sure the charitable and advocacy organizations will \nfind this amendment quite controversial. It should be referred to the \nappropriate committee and given very searching study before it is \noffered on the floor. As the Senator from California said, it would \ncertainly be a poison pill for the underlying bill, which thus far has \nhad no public opposition whatsoever. So I am pleased the Senator from \nCalifornia objected. We are happy to make that objection very public.\n\n  I thank the chairman of the committee, the Senator from California. I \nwill say again, it looks as though we made a little bit of progress. No \nlonger is there a secret hold on the bill. Instead, the Senator from \nNevada has made it plain he is the one holding up the bill by insisting \non offering an unrelated amendment. That is unfortunate, but at least \nwe know what we are dealing with. I hope in the days ahead we will be \nable to prevail on him to change his approach.\n  There are some bills where it is simply not appropriate to seek to \nadd extraneous and controversial amendments. The amendment he has \nproposed is surely a poison pill for this bill, and we need to get this \nbill in place soon so these requirements of disclosure will apply \nduring the 2008 election season.\n  Once again, I truly thank the Senator from California, and I look \nforward to getting this bill passed in the near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Children's Health Insurance Program is \na sound investment. It protects our children. It fosters their \ndevelopment. It helps them thrive. Children without health insurance \nare children taken to emergency rooms instead of doctors' offices. They \nare children whose care is delayed and delayed, until simple sickness \nbecomes serious illness. They are children who need our attention, our \ncompassion, our help.\n  The President has said he opposes this legislation because \nphilosophically he thinks children should be covered by private \ninsurance, not by the Children's Health Insurance Program. It does not \nmatter whether these children in reality should be covered by private \ninsurance. What matters is that these children are not covered by \nprivate insurance. Simply, they are not covered at all.\n  By lodging a veto threat against this bill, the President is saying \nthat if private insurers have not made room for low-income children, \nthen we should not make room for them either. That is not just faulty \nlogic, it is faulty ethics. At the same time, the President argues that \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program is too expensive.\n  We are suggesting--bipartisanly, in both Houses, with a program that \nstarted 10 years ago, with a Democratic President, Bill Clinton, a \nRepublican House, a Republican Senate; a bipartisan initiative from 10 \nyears ago--we are suggesting an increase of $7 billion a year over the \nnext 5 years--$35 billion.\n  Contrast that with the war in Iraq. Mr. President, $7 billion a year, \nto cover 4 million uninsured children in this country, 75,000 in my \nState of Ohio--$7 billion a year--contrast that with $2.5 billion a \nweek on the war in Iraq. Mr. President, $7 billion a year; $2.5 billion \na week. Yet the President says that is too much to take care of 4 \nmillion children.\n  Uninsured children do not have the luxury of time. They cannot will \nthemselves to remain healthy until individual insurance becomes more \naffordable or employer-sponsored coverage stops eroding or the \nPresident becomes more pragmatic. It is up to this body, this week, to \ntake action.\n  In Ohio, the Demko family can tell you why they value the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. Emily Demko, 3 years old, has Down Syndrome. \nBecause of her condition, she is automatically denied private health \ncoverage because Down Syndrome is considered a preexisting condition.\n  Emily was covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program until \nMarch 31 of this year. Under the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nEmily was able to receive the therapy she needed to reach all of her \ndevelopmental milestones in an age-appropriate way. But in March, Emily \nwas cut off from this program because her father made $113 too much per \nmonth for the family to qualify.\n  Her father is self-employed. Her mother stays at home to care for \nher. Without health insurance, the bills for Emily's care total $3,700 \nper month, which, of course, is impossible for the Demkos to pay.\n\n  The Demkos' family income falls within the range of 250 and 300 \npercent of poverty. Emily has now been without health insurance for 6 \nmonths. Governor Strickland and the Republican legislature, \nbipartisanly, raised the threshold for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram in Ohio if the Feds go along, if the President signs our bill, \nto 300 percent of poverty--not for families living in the lap of \nluxury, but families such as the Demkos who have seen their daughter \ncut off from her health insurance because of a preexisting condition \nand falling out of eligibility because her father makes $100 too much \nper month.\n  So far, Emily is not regressing, but there is that possibility with \nDown Syndrome. Her parents cannot afford the insurance for themselves \neither. But more than anything, they want to see 3-year-old Emily \ncovered. They worry about what will happen to her without the therapy \nshe needs. She does not qualify for any other programs despite her \ndisability.\n  I wish President Bush would talk to the Demko family, would keep them \nin mind as he considers whether to sign the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. I hope he wants to make life better, not harder, for this \nhard-working family and help Emily to thrive.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program will expire September 30 \nunless\n\n[[Page S11999]]\n\nthe President signs this bill. The House and Senate have found a \ncompromise that works for both parties. The version we passed in the \nSenate passed with 68 votes, more than enough to override a veto. The \ncompromise version is very much like the Senate version, even though \nsome of us would like to see us do a bit more.\n  The compromise would cover 4 million American children, as I said, \n75,000 of them living in my State of Ohio. These children did not \nchoose to be uninsured. They are not uninsured because their families \nwalked away from private insurance. Understand, most of the children in \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program are sons and daughters of \nworking parents, parents who are working hard, playing by the rules, \nsimply not making enough money to buy private insurance, and their \nemployers are not providing that insurance.\n  The fact is, private insurance too often steers clear of too many \nworking families in Akron and Toledo and Zanesville and Marion and Lima \nand Marietta. These families are uninsured because they have no choice. \nTheir children have no choice. But we have a choice. We can choose to \nhelp them. Let's do it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about H.R. 2640--it is \ncalled the NICS Improvement Act--and the Leahy-Schumer amendment.\n  I have worked long and hard on this bill. It has been a long time in \ncoming. Now it is time to get it passed. To put it simply, the young \nman who was behind the great tragedy at Virginia Tech had a long \nhistory of mental illness but still fell through the cracks of our \nchecking systems and bought guns and ammunition.\n  It is against the law for someone with serious mental illness to buy \na gun. When the system fails, we are all less safe. This bill will get \ndesperately needed resources to the States to help improve our Federal \nbackground check process. This bill will make it harder for someone to \nget lost in the system.\n  We cannot wait any longer before passing this commonsense piece of \nlegislation. We cannot sit back and watch another Virginia Tech \nshooting happen without doing everything we can to stop it.\n  I have worked hard on this bill for more than a decade and the \nbackground check system to which it is added. In 2002, Representative \nCarolyn McCarthy and I introduced legislation similar to what I am \ndiscussing today. It was in response to another senseless shooting. \nThis one was at Our Lady of Peace Church, in our State, in Lynbrook, on \nLong Island. That was where someone with a long history of mental \nillness bought a gun, walked into Our Lady of Peace Church, killed \nFather Lawrence Penzes and a long-time parishioner, Eileen Tosner.\n  So back then we introduced a bill to get money to the States to help \nthem get important records--on mental illness, convictions, things such \nas that--into the NICS system. But because of the climate of mistrust \non all sides of the gun issue, that bill was never passed into law. I \nbelieve it passed the House once. I believe it passed the Senate once. \nBut the two never hooked up.\n  Now, here we are again. It saddens me that it has taken this long--it \nhas been years since Our Lady of Peace; it has been 5 months since \nVirginia Tech--to move the debate forward and try to get something done \nabout safety on our streets and college campuses.\n  Now we are so close. The House has passed similar legislation that \nwent through with the support of both the NRA and the Brady Campaign. \nThat does not happen too often. As you know, when the NRA and I agree \non an issue, there is a good chance some good can come of it.\n  We already have a comprehensive background check system, but since \nthe system relies on up-to-date computer searches to produce fast \nresults, it is only as good as the automated information the States \nprovide. That is why the focus of the bill is to get more records into \nthe system. So under the bill, States that opt into the system that do \nwell will be rewarded with grants and financial incentives. States that \ndo not will be punished.\n  We have modified that so smaller States that have more difficulty \nkeeping the records because they have smaller budgets will not be \npenalized. Senator Leahy correctly insisted that be done to protect his \nState of Vermont. But it affects smaller States as well. The amendments \nSenator Leahy has suggested and been added to this bill, I believe, \nimprove it without getting any of our delicately balanced coalition out \nof kilter in any way. So I thank Senator Leahy for doing that.\n  Perhaps the most important thing I can say about this bill is it is \nall about public safety. It is all about enforcing the laws on the \nbooks. This is not--and this is important--is not a gun control bill. \nNo lawful gun owners are going to have their guns taken away. Nobody \nwho should be allowed to get a gun will have his or her rights \nrestricted.\n  The bill targets only those records that are supposed to be in the \nsystem already--records that demonstrate whether someone is seriously \nmentally ill, a felon, or so on. What Virginia Tech showed us is when \nthe background check system fails, the consequences can be terribly \ntragic.\n  Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy and I saw that in Long Island and, of \ncourse, the Nation saw it at Virginia Tech. Nothing can bring back the \n33 young people who died last April, and we do not know if we can \nprevent another Virginia Tech from happening, but our bill will take a \nsubstantial step toward making the system better and keeping our \nstreets and schools safer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/24/senate-section/article/S11999-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was unable to cast a vote on Friday, \nSeptember 21, on amendment No. 2898 to the Defense authorization bill. \nI have voted against similar measures in the past, and had I been \navailable to vote on Friday, I would have again voted against this \nattempt to direct a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.\n  The terms of this amendment would have required U.S. troops to begin \nleaving Iraq within 90 days of the Defense authorization bill's \nenactment and complete that withdrawal within 9 months. While I \nunderstand public frustration with the war, I believe a precipitous and \narbitrary withdrawal mandated by Congress is not a wise solution to the \nsituation in Iraq. I cannot support attempts to set an arbitrary \ndeadline for withdrawing our forces from Iraq, which endangers our \ntroops, our safety at home and the overall stability of Iraq and the \nMiddle East.\n  I believe our military commanders should determine how and when our \ntroops begin leaving Iraq based on conditions on the ground. General \nPetraeus announced this month that he would be able to begin \nwithdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq. I believe Congress should rely on \nthe guidance and leadership of General Petraeus and our other \ncommanders on the ground to determine how best to eventually bring our \ntroops home from Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/24/senate-section/article/S11999-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11999-S12000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., \nwrote: ``The time is always ripe to do right.''\n  This week, the time is ripe to do right by America's children.\n  Last Friday, my colleagues and I unveiled a strong, bicameral \nagreement to renew and improve the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  CHIP covers kids whose parents don't qualify for Medicaid, but who \ncannot afford costly private insurance.\n  CHIP works to get health coverage to uninsured kids in America's \nworking families.\n  The agreement we reached to renew CHIP will make sure that more than \n6\\1/2\\ million children with health coverage today will keep that \ncoverage.\n  The agreement we reached will make sure that millions more low-\nincome, uninsured American children get a healthy start.\n  It is a good agreement. It is fiscally responsible. It has broad \nsupport across the Congress. And most importantly, it puts children \nfirst.\n  In August, 68 Senators voted for nearly the exact same $35 billion \nagreement to renew and improve the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nThey\n\n[[Page S12000]]\n\nvoted to reach millions more uninsured children in low-income, working \nfamilies.\n  This week, Senators can stand up for kids again.\n  I know that there is pressure from the White House. The White House \nis asking Senators to turn away this time.\n  But the President is endangering children when he distorts what this \nbill does. The President is endangering children when he repeats his \nveto threats.\n  Moreover, the agreement does exactly what the President says it \nshould.\n  The agreement will target the Children's Health Insurance Program \ntoward the lowest-income eligible children. It will give States bonus \nfunding for enrolling the poorest kids for health care. And it will \nreduce Federal funding for children in higher-income families.\n  The agreement will not raise the eligibility level for CHIP. That \nwill still be for the administration and the States to decide. That is \nhow the CHIP law was written in 1997, by a Republican-led Congress. We \ndo not change that.\n  Our goal is to reach more of the low-income, uninsured children who \nare already eligible for CHIP today. Our goal is to keep the program \nfor kids.\n  That is why our agreement will curb coverage of adults in CHIP.\n  It will improve the kids' coverage in so many ways, from outreach for \nminority communities to dental care for every child who enrolls.\n  In addition, a straight extension of CHIP at current funding, or at \nthe President's cut-rate budget proposal, will cause thousands, even \nmillions of children to lose their health coverage.\n  Many families would have no choice at all to get health care for \ntheir kids. They would have no way to pay the doctor. They would have \nno way to buy the medicine.\n  But CHIP can get kids in working families the doctor's visits and \nmedicines that they need when they're sick. CHIP can get them the \ncheckups that they need to stay well.\n  In 10 years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has reduced the \nnumber of low-income children living without health insurance by one-\nthird.\n  And 82 percent of Americans want Congress to cover more low-income, \nuninsured kids with CHIP.\n  This week, Congress is heeding the call. This week, we will choose to \ndo right by America's kids.\n  The President should look beyond politics. The President should look \nto the faces of America's uninsured children.\n  The President should see that the time is ripe for him to do right, \nas well.\n  I thank my colleagues, and urge their support for America's children \nthis week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/24/senate-section/article/S12000-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Robb Rolfing\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to SSG Robb Rolfing \nand his heroic service to our country. He was killed in action on June \n30, 2007, by enemy small arms fire while on a mission near Baghdad. \nRobb was a member of the elite Green Berets as a special forces \nengineer to Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, \nAirborne, in Fort Carson, CO. Robb was on his second tour of duty when \nhe was killed.\n  Robb Lura Rolfing was born on December 4, 1977, to Rex and Margie \nRolfing in Sioux Falls, SD. He grew up admiring ``MacGyver,'' prompting \nhim to start carrying duct tape everywhere he went.\n  Before Robb became a soldier, he attended Vassar College in \nPoughkeepsie, NY, majored in physics and astronomy, and played soccer. \nDuring his time as captain on the Vassar soccer team, he took the team \nto Vassar's first ever NCAA tournament postseason playoff, in any \nsport, where he scored the winning goal in the first round of games. To \nfurther demonstrate his talent as a soccer player, he was named to the \nNSCAA/Adidas All-Region Team and the All-New York Team. A Vassar \nbasketball coach told the Rolfing family that he would often see Robb \npracticing soccer out on the field by himself in the morning and after \nregular scheduled practices. The coach said, ``If I had 5 Robb's we \nwould win every game because of the determination and focus he \nshowed.'' After college, he went to work in field management at Rollins \nCollege in Winter Park, FL, and then moved on to coach soccer at Currey \nCollege in Boston.\n  Robb's mom Margie says that she has started a list called ``Amazing \nRobb.'' This list is a compilation of stories, thoughts, and \nrecollections that the family has gathered from family and friends of \nRobb. Margie recalls one particular moment when Robb's sister, Tiffany, \nwas about to graduate from high school. The family thought that he was \nstill overseas during his first tour, but he showed up at home wearing \na blanket of Tiffany's college over his head just standing at the door. \nThe only way Tiffany recognized it was Robb was because of his shoes--\nhe had them duct taped because he refused to buy new shoes as the ones \nwith duct tape were far too comfortable to throw away.\n  Robb always wanted something more out of the life he was given. After \nthe events of September 11, 2001, Robb's calling to help serve his \ncountry was jolted into action and he joined the Army in January of \n2003. He completed his basic training at Fort Benning, GA, and was \nassigned to the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell, KY. Shortly after \nreturning from his first tour, he qualified and was accepted into the \nspecial forces unit where he became a Green Beret.\n  Robb's good will and service touched the lives of many people. \nAlthough his life was cut short, he continues to inspire all those who \nknew him. Our Nation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to \nhonor his life is to emulate his commitment to our country.\n  Mr. President, I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my \ndeepest sympathy to the family of SSG Robb Rolfing. He will be missed, \nbut his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/24/senate-section/article/S12000-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12000-S12001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      2007 DAVIDSON FELLOWS AWARD\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with great admiration that \ntoday I recognize some of the most intelligent, driven young minds in \nthis country. I would like to acknowledge the 17 recipients of the 2007 \nDavidson Fellows Award, a scholarship awarded to exceptional students \nto assist them in furthering their education. These scholarships are \ngiven by the Davidson Institute for Talent Development to inspiring \nindividuals under the age of 18 who have completed academically \nrigorous projects that demonstrate a potential to make a significant, \npositive contribution to society. This year's recipients achieved \nacademic excellence in the areas of science, literature, mathematics, \ntechnology, and music. As I read through the accomplishments these \nyoung minds have achieved, I can assure you that this year's recipients \nare more than deserving of such an honor. I would like to take a few \nmoments to describe what each recipient has accomplished.\n  Richard Alt II, a 17-year-old from Fredericksburg, VA, has compared \nthree weather forecasting methods to formulate a brandnew forecasting \nmethod. He has done this through detailed interpretation and analysis \nof varying aspects of climatology. Through his findings, Richard has \ncreated a universal process that allows meteorologists to compile more \naccurate forecast data and help public officials prepare seasonal \nresponse plans for various weather patterns.\n  Another 17-year-old from Vienna, VA, Christina Beasley has explored \nhuman perception and beauty in her portfolio, ``An Experiment in Free \nSpeech.'' This young lady has compared emotion in famous literary works \nto her own pieces of writing to reveal the tucked away beauty of common \noccurrences. She has realized through careful research and \ninterpretation that a person must make the connection between emotion \nand rationality to fully understand the intricacies of the human mind.\n  Sixteen-year-old Nate Bottman of Seattle, WA has found an array of \nsolutions to the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation, NLS, that shows the \npattern of waves in fluids and plasmas that have sharp boundaries and \ndissipation. Nate has developed a method of finding\n\n[[Page S12001]]\n\nsolutions to integrable equations and has discovered that stationary \nsolutions of the NLS are spectrally stable. His work will help in many \nareas of math and science, including but not limited to the study of \nBose-Einstein condensates and plasma physics.\n  A young woman from Davis, CA, Alexandra Courtis, has developed an \ninnovative method used in areas such as cancer research to track \ndifferent biological functions via luminescent silicon nanorods and \nquantum dots. At just 17, she has developed a less expensive method of \nusing sodium silicide and ammonium bromide that has made it possible to \nproduce silicon nanoparticles on a larger scale. Alexandra's \naccomplishment is a significant advancement in targeting cancerous \ntumors and individual cells.\n  Billy Dorminy, a 15-year-old from McDonough, GA, has invented a \nsecure method of message encryption using reduced redundancy \nrepresentations of improper fractional bases. This new method of \nencryption takes up far less computer memory while also utilizing \nconfusion and diffusion to keep a message hidden. Billy's method allows \nfor the placement of a second undetectable encrypted message in the \nbody of the first, opening the door for further advancement in the area \nof message encryption.\n  Another 15-year-old, Yale Fan, from Beaverton, OR, has furthered the \nbinary quantum computational Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover algorithms to \ncreate multivalued logic problems. These two algorithms were among the \nfirst in the creation of a quantum computer. His work is relevant in \nmany areas including the vision systems in computers, various economic \nissues, and aspects related to space, including transportation, \nscheduling, and manufacturing.\n  Madhavi Gavini, a 17-year-old from Starkville, MS, has developed an \ninnovative method to restrict the augmentation of biofilm-forming \npathogens. For example, Pseudomonas, a pathogen that is resistant to \nmany drugs, produces a biofilm that protects it from antibiotics. This \nyoung woman's progress was done through the combination of traditional \nIndian medicine and molecular biology that will be used to treat \nmillions dealing with Pseudomonas infections.\n  A 17-year-old from Bridgewater, NJ, Michael Harwick wrote a piece \nentitled ``Highways: The Road as Existence'' that utilized prose, \npoetry, and dialogue to depict relationships that oscillate between \nisolation and connection. Michael consistently astounds the reader with \na unique voice filled with streams of symbolic and linguistic meaning. \nThrough his choice of short dialog and extravagant descriptions of a \nvisual world, he has shown the lack of dialog in a world filled with \nnoise.\n  Todd Kramer, a 17-year-old from Port Jefferson, NY, produced a \nportfolio that followed his growth as a composer since he was 12 \nentitled ``Finding My Voice Through Music.'' He believes that each \ngeneration needs its musicians, composers, and performers that create \nartistic conventions that grow and mature with the times. This young \nman just graduated from the Juilliard Pre-College Division and is a \nstudent at the Perlman Music Program. He has performed in such \nprestigious places as Carnegie Hall in New York and the Kennedy Center \nright here in Washington, DC.\n  Fifteen-year-old Shannon Lee of Plano, TX, is another very talented \nmusician who believes that music is a cornerstone of communication, \nwhich she has shown through her violin portfolio, ``Creating a Musical \nBond.'' Shannon specifically enjoys keeping tradition alive by playing \na variety of distinguished composers to captivate her audiences. She \nearned the silver medal at the Stulberg International String \nCompetition, and she received a scholarship from the Texas Commission \non the Arts, where she also performed as a soloist in the Dallas \nSymphony.\n  Danielle Lent, a 17-year-old from Cedarhurst, NY, has developed an \ninnovative, cost-effective, and earth-friendly method of recycling \nplastics. Her process involves the exposure of plastic polymers to \nsupercritical carbon dioxide, creating a plastic that has equal or \nsuperior properties in comparison to the original.

When he was just 7 years old, Yuqing was one of the \nyoungest candidates ever to be accepted to the Juilliard School Pre-\nCollege Division, where he later went on to win the Junior and Senior \nConcerto Competitions. In 2007, he also received the Jack Kent Cooke \nYoung Artist award.\n  Katherine Orazem, a 17-year-old from Ames, in my home State of Iowa, \nhas written a collection of sonnets, short stories, and essays entitled \n``After Elegies'' that delves into the human issue of death and \nexamines those who have gone through loss. She looks at these issues \nfrom many perspectives, including the loss a widow must face, the \ndenial of his wife's death by a husband, and the pain an apostate feels \nwho has lost her faith. Through her work, we have come to understand \nthe human condition and its variety of responses to death and loss.\n  A 15-year-old from Norristown, PA, Janet Song has created a urine \ntest to detect the early signs of cancer. She has been able to isolate \nshort circulatory DNA found in urine to identify tumor sites. Janet's \nnew method has made cancer screening less unpleasant, less invasive, \nand cheaper than current methods.\n  Columbia, SC, native Graham Van Schaik has researched pyrethroids \nthat are found in common household and garden pesticides.

ALVIN SMITH\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record \nan article on the death of Dr. Alvin Smith, who passed away last week \nat the age of 75. The son of sharecroppers, he went on to become a \nnoted physician who worked throughout his life to increase access to \nthe health care system, an issue that is near and dear to my heart. My \ncondolences go out to his wife Ann, his three son, and his six \ngrandchildren.\n  The article follows.\n\n              [From newsjournalonline.com, Sept. 19, 2007]\n\n             Noted Area Physician Dies With Family at Side\n\n                            (By Anne Geggis)\n\n       Dr. Alvin Smith devoted his life to saving the lives of his \n     patients and curing the ills of the health-care system.\n       Smith, 75, died Tuesday morning at his Ormond Beach home. \n     His family was at his side.\n       The son of Alabama sharecroppers overcame meager beginnings \n     to become one of the most respected physicians in the area.\n\n[[Page S12002]]\n\n       The 1952 Mainland High School graduate was perhaps best \n     known to the community as the director of the Herbert D. \n     Kerman Regional Oncology Center at Halifax Health Medical \n     Center and as the owner of Angell & Phelps Chocolate Factory \n     that his son, Alvin Jr., now runs.\n       In addition, he felt a strong pull toward changing the \n     system so more people had access to medical care, serving as \n     president of the Volusia County Medical Society and the \n     Florida Medical Association.\n       Smith was a self-confessed truant who went to fifth grade \n     for only one day and didn't come back to school for a year. \n     He quit high school in 10th grade and finally graduated from \n     Mainland at the age of 21. But then he went on to become the \n     first college graduate in his family, earning a biology \n     degree from the University of Florida before getting his \n     doctorate from the University of Miami.\n       It was as president of the Florida Medical Association in \n     the 1990s, however, that Smith achieved one of his most \n     enduring accomplishments: convincing then-Gov. Lawton Chiles \n     to form an autonomous state Department of Health. During that \n     time, he also lobbied for legislation allowing the state of \n     Florida to sue the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid \n     costs.\n       ``He wanted to make sure that no patient in Florida went \n     without the best health care they needed, regardless of their \n     ability to pay,'' said Dr. Carl ``Rick'' Lentz, also a past \n     president of the Florida Medical Association and a Daytona \n     Beach surgeon.\n       His voice choking, Lentz recalled how Smith recently handed \n     him his Florida Medical Association president's pin because \n     Lentz never got one during his term as president.\n       ``He's a wonderful human being who's been a blessing to the \n     whole world,'' Lentz said. ``There's not a patient who has \n     been with him that doesn't love him. Anytime you call on Al, \n     he's there for you.''\n       Former County Councilman, local talk show radio host and \n     gadfly Big John recalled meeting Smith as an ``intern'' at \n     Halifax Health Medical Center in which community members were \n     invited to spend time with doctors to learn about the \n     hospital's functions.\n       ``He was a great guy--great personality,'' John said.\n       Smith's boyhood longing for chocolates he couldn't afford \n     in the window at Angell & Phelps gave way to occasional \n     indulgence. When the chocolate factory came up for sale, he \n     bought it to make sure all his favorite recipes stayed the \n     same.\n       Daytona Beach Mayor Glenn Ritchey served with him on the \n     Halifax Community Health System Board.\n       ``I have known him to be a great community servant, as well \n     as a wonderful doctor who has meant so much to our area,'' \n     Ritchey said. ``He'll be greatly missed.''\n       Smith served in the U.S. Army, retiring as a major, and \n     from the U.S. Army Reserves as a lieutenant colonel. He was \n     active in civic organizations, ranging from the Boy Scouts to \n     the People to Prevent Nuclear War. He served on boards \n     including the United Way, Hospice of Volusia/Flagler and A \n     Child's Place.\n       ``Alvin's one of the really good guys,'' said John E. \n     Evans, a former TV personality and spokesman for what was \n     then called Halifax Community Health System.\n       Survivors include his wife of 50 years, Ann; three sons, \n     Alvin Jr., Ormond Beach, and Chuck and Mike, both of Palm \n     Coast; a sister, Ginny Little, Ormond Beach; and six \n     grandchildren.\n       Viewing will be from 5 to 7 p.m., Friday at the social hall \n     at Central Baptist Church, 142 Fairview Ave., Daytona Beach. \n     Services will be at 11 a.m. Saturday at Central Baptist \n     Church.

IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROCESS FOR THE ISSUANCE OF \n                   SECURITY CLEARANCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The process for issuing security clearances is an \n     antiquated, paper-driven effort that costs thousands of \n     dollars and requires hundreds of days to process one request \n     for a security clearance.\n       (2) Years of promises to improve the process have resulted \n     in no reduction in the amount of time and money required to \n     process a request for a security clearance and such process \n     is hopelessly backlogged.\n       (3) The inability of civilians, intelligence officers, \n     military personnel, and contractors to perform their jobs due \n     to delays in receiving a security clearance results in \n     substantial costs every year and poses a significant threat \n     to the national security of the United States.\n       (4) The Secretary of Defense and the Director of National \n     Intelligence have begun to work together to improve the \n     process for issuing security clearances and have established \n     a team known as the ``Tiger Team'' to address problems in \n     that process.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National \n     Intelligence should continue to work together to rapidly \n     update the antiquated security clearance process using \n     existing commercial technology and innovative new approaches \n     to transform the process to the maximum extent possible; and\n       (2) funding for processing of requests for security \n     clearances should be made available directly through \n     appropriations of funds for\n\n[[Page S12010]]\n\n     that purpose and not through a fee-for-service arrangement \n     with the Office of Management and Budget or the Office of \n     Personnel Management.\n       (c) Demonstration Projects.--\n       (1) Requirement for demonstration projects.--Not later than \n     6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall implement multiple demonstration projects \n     that apply new and innovative approaches to improve the \n     processing of requests for security clearances. Each such \n     project shall utilize proven commercial technologies and \n     methods to the maximum extent possible.\n       (2) Exemption from executive orders.--No executive order \n     that delegates responsibility for the issuance of security \n     clearances to the personnel of the Office of Management and \n     Budget shall apply to a demonstration project carried out \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Director of National Intelligence shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the status and progress of the demonstration \n     projects carried out under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Director of National Intelligence such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this subsection.\n       (d) Evaluation and Report.--\n       (1) Requirement for evaluation.--The Secretary of Defense \n     and the Director of National Intelligence shall carry out an \n     evaluation of the process for issuing security clearances and \n     develop a specific plan and schedule for replacing such \n     process with an improved process.\n       (2) Requirement for report.--Not later than 30 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Director of National Intelligence shall \n     submit to Congress a report on the evaluation carried out \n     under paragraph (1) together with the plan developed under \n     such paragraph.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3032.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 328.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 328) condemning the assassination on \n     September 19, 2007, of Antoine Ghanem, a member of the \n     Parliament of Lebanon who opposed Syrian interference in \n     Lebanon.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded \nto consider the resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the coming days there will be more \nfunerals in Lebanon for fresh victims of despicable terror attacks. On \nWednesday, September 19, 2007, Lebanese member of Parliament Antoine \nGhanem and at least six others were killed in a massive car bomb attack \nin the suburbs of Beirut.\n  Tragically, this is an all-too-frequent occurrence for the people of \nLebanon. The wave began with the February 14, 2005, assassination of \nformer Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others. On the 1-month \nanniversary of Prime Minister Hariri's assassination, something \nremarkable happened--hundreds of thousands of people gathered in \nMartyr's Square in downtown Beirut--spontaneously giving birth to the \nMarch 14 movement and the Cedar Revolution. Just 6 weeks after the \nMarch 14 movement began, the thousands of Syrian military forces that \nhad occupied Lebanon for nearly three decades were out of the country.\n  But although the military occupation of Lebanon ended in 2005, \nLebanon has remained under siege, as Wednesday's events remind us. Six \nLebanese parliamentarians have now been killed in 2\\1/2\\ years. These \nsix, and other prominent Lebanese figures who were also killed during \nthe same period, shared one important attribute--they were outspoken \ncritics of the Syrian domination of Lebanon.\n  Senator Lugar, Senator Sununu and I are introducing a sense of the \nSenate resolution condemning the despicable assassination of Antoine \nGhanem and urging that the international community continue its support \nfor the government and people of Lebanon.\n  To the families of victims of Wednesday's attack and to the people of \nLebanon, the Senate offers its deepest condolences for your losses. \nWednesday's attack seeks to undermine the international tribunal set up \nearlier this\n\n[[Page S12011]]\n\nyear to try the killers of Prime Minister Hariri and other Lebanese \nvictims of political violence. So we call on the Bush administration to \nredouble its support for the tribunal and to work to ensure that \nWednesday's crime is included in its jurisdiction.\n  These attacks on Lebanon must stop. This resolution expresses \nbipartisan support for holding accountable any state sponsor or \nofficial implicated in the string of political assassinations beginning \nin February 2005. To many an observer it is no accident that this \nassassination occurred as we approach the critical period during which \nLebanon will choose its next president. Many informed voices, both in \nand out of Lebanon, are pointing to Damascus. So to the regime of \nBashar al-Assad, know that we in Washington are watching events in \nLebanon very carefully. Lebanon must be free to choose its next \npresident without intimidation or violence.\n  Lebanon's enemies must understand that they face a united \ninternational front. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, France, and the broader \nEuropean Union all have lead roles to play. So does the United States. \nSo we call upon the international community to intensify the efforts to \nsupport the people and fragile democratic institutions of Lebanon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc, and that any statements relating to this \nmatter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 328) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 328\n\n       Whereas Antoine Ghanem and at least 6 others were killed in \n     a car-bomb attack in the Sin el-Fil suburb of Beirut on \n     September 19, 2007;\n       Whereas Mr. Ghanem was a member of the Parliament of \n     Lebanon from the Lebanese Kataeb Party representing the \n     Baabda and Aley districts of Mount Lebanon;\n       Whereas Mr. Ghanem is the 6th member of the Parliament of \n     Lebanon who had opposed Syrian interference in Lebanon to be \n     assassinated since February 2005, including former Prime \n     Minister of Lebanon Rafik Hariri, former Economy and Trade \n     Minister Bassel Fleihan, Gebran Tueni, Industry Minister \n     Pierre Gemayel, and Walid Eido;\n       Whereas other prominent figures in Lebanon who have opposed \n     Syrian interference in that country have also been \n     assassinated in the same time period, including politician \n     George Hawi and journalist Samir Kassir, while others have \n     escaped assassination attempts, including Defense Minister \n     Elias Murr, Telecommunications Minister Marwan Hamadeh, and \n     television presenter May Chidiac;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1757 of \n     May 30, 2007, created a special international tribunal to try \n     suspects in the assassinations of former Prime Minister \n     Hariri and others;\n       Whereas, by agreement between the United Nations and \n     Lebanon, the special international tribunal can receive \n     jurisdiction for other attacks in Lebanon that ``are of a \n     nature and gravity similar to the attack of 14 February \n     2005''; and\n       Whereas these continuing assassinations are intended to \n     undermine the sovereignty of Lebanon and damage its fragile \n     democratic institutions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its deepest condolences to the families of \n     Antoine Ghanem and other victims of the attack of September \n     19, 2007, as well as to all the people of Lebanon;\n       (2) condemns in the strongest terms this cowardly attack \n     and urges that its perpetrators, including any state sponsor \n     or official, be held accountable for their crimes;\n       (3) underscores its full support for the special \n     international tribunal and urges the United Nations Security \n     Council to extend its jurisdiction to include the Ghanem \n     assassination;\n       (4) urges the President to increase coordination with key \n     partners in Europe and the Middle East to more actively \n     support the sovereignty of Lebanon and strengthen its \n     governing institutions and security forces; and\n       (5) reasserts its strong belief that the people of Lebanon \n     should be permitted to choose their next president, in a \n     process scheduled to begin in September 2007, free from all \n     foreign intimidation, interference, and violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/24/senate-section/article/S12011-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12011-S12012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY-EDWARDSVILLE ON ITS 50TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 329.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 329) congratulating Southern Illinois \n     University-Edwardsville as it celebrates its 50th \n     anniversary.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Southern \nIllinois University Edwardsville, SIUE, as it marks its 50th year as a \ncenter of educational advancement in Southern Illinois. Southern \nIllinois University Edwardsville marks its 50th anniversary this year \nwith a year-long celebration that begins on September 24, 2007.\n  SIUE is a public university built by the people of Illinois for the \npeople of Illinois in response to the clear need for a campus of higher \neducation in the Metro-East area of greater St. Louis. Fifty years ago, \nonly three percent of the adult population had completed four years of \ncollege. Since there was no nearby higher education center and most \nfamilies could not afford the cost of sending their kids far away for \ncollege, the community appealed to Southern Illinois University to \nestablish a satellite campus at Edwardsville.\n  Today, SIUE continues to serve the community that initiated its \nfounding and has helped improve the quality of life for all citizens of \nthe area. The university has grown from 1,776 students to nearly 13,500 \nstudents from 101 Illinois counties, 43 other States, and 46 nations. \nIt offers a broad choice of degrees ranging from liberal arts to \nprofessional studies. The university gives back to the surrounding \ncommunity through programs, including its East St. Louis Center, which \nprovides social services to families in East St. Louis and surrounding \nurban communities. Each year, more than 8,000 individuals benefit from \nthe programs and services housed at the East St. Louis Center. SIUE \nalso contributes to the economic welfare of the entire region as both \none of the largest employers in Madison County and a producer of many \ngraduates who remain in the area after college. The number of college \ngraduates in Madison and St. Clair counties has risen from three \npercent to 20 percent, largely made up of SIUE graduates. These \ngraduates give back to the community every day, and the highly \neducated, skilled workforce they form is one of the greatest resources \nin Southern Illinois.\n  If you visit the campus at SIUE, you will see some of the truly \nexceptional and innovative educational programs taking place there \ntoday. The University's Senior Assignment Program, an integrative \nlearning experience required of all seniors, was ranked as a national \nmodel for learning assessment by the Association of American Colleges \nand Universities in 2007. The SIU School of Dental Medicine, the only \nIllinois dental school outside Cook County, is rated among the top \ndental schools in the Nation on national board dental exams and serves \nas a primary oral healthcare provider for Southern Illinois. SIUE's \nUniversity Park, an applied research and technology park, is the home \nto the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center which explores the \nviability of alternative fuels. In athletics, SIUE is currently \ntransitioning to NCAA Division I status and proudly brought home the \nNCAA Division II championship in softball in 2007.\n  Over the last half century, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville \nhas grown to become a tremendous asset to the students and citizens of \nIllinois. It's my honor to congratulate the University on its 50th \nanniversary, and I look forward to many more years of excellence in \neducation in the future.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 329) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.
