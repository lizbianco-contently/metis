Mr. President, being from the desert and seeing, on \noccasion, storms in the northern part of the State, it is hard for me \nto understand the power of nature we see so often--and that we see more \noften than we used to with these tornadoes occurring throughout this \ncountry.\n  Last night and this morning, violent storms raged through five \nStates, including Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, and \nTennessee. They were violent. It appears there will be more than 50 \npeople declared dead, scores of people have been injured, and there was \na tremendous loss of personal property. Our thoughts, of course, this \nmorning go out to the victims. We, in all our States, have had \noccurrences relating to natural disasters. But I think we should all \npause and think about the lives of these people who have been snuffed \naway by this violent set of storms throughout the country and the loss \nto their loved ones, their neighbors, and their families.\n  We have heard reports this morning of how our first responders \nreacted. The police, firefighters, and National Guard medics worked \nthrough the night, around the clock, to save lives. The latest event we \nhad in Nevada was so minor compared to this. We had a levy break and \nflood waters inundated hundreds of homes. We were very concerned about \nthat. But the one thing we did recognize is how the police, \nfirefighters, and other first responders reacted so quickly. What took \nplace last night is so much more significant than what we had in \nNevada. It is difficult to comprehend the severity of what happened \nlast night. The work of the first responders, and others, will continue \naround the clock for some time. Rebuilding will begin and I am \nconfident that, as a congressional body, we will be called upon to help \nin some form or fashion.\n\n\n                              the economy\n\n  Mr. President, the top priority of this Congress right now is to \nbring relief to Americans who are struggling through a troubled \neconomy. One need only listen to the morning news, as I did, to\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\nsee that the economy is stumbling and staggering. The stock market fell \nby 3 percent yesterday. The Japanese markets, after that--we got \nreports today on that--fell by almost 5 percent. The European markets \nare down.\n  Today, our work continues to try to focus attention on this troubled \neconomy, to try to help in some way. As I have indicated, at 5:45, we \nwill hold a cloture vote on the plan to proceed to the Senate Finance \nCommittee's economic stimulus plan. I spread on the record of this body \nlast night editorials from around the country supporting the Senate \nstimulus plan. It is the one that will get money into the pockets of \npeople who need it and will spend it very quickly. This is in no way to \ndenigrate the House plan. It was only a start.\n  Why do we need a stimulus plan? Look at the stock market, look at the \nrising gasoline prices, heating for our homes, and the housing crisis, \nthe foreclosure rate, which is more than 600 percent in Reno, NV. It is \n275, on average, in Florida. It is more than 300 percent in California, \nwith 37 million people. The Labor Department's recent jobs report \nshowed the economy lost 17,000 jobs in January. That is a few of the \nproblems we should be concerned about.\n  Whether American families are investing in the market--some are and \nsome aren't--the gathering storm clouds point to the need for Congress \nto take action.\n\n  The Finance Committee's plan builds on the House bill and makes it \nbetter. I repeat, this is not Harry Reid speaking, it is from all over \nthe country, talking about the need to do something quickly and focus \nattention on the Senate stimulus plan.\n  A couple of my friends on the other side have talked about why didn't \nwe do this. One referred to what we have in the stimulus package as \n``Christmas tree ornaments.'' Another referred to them as ``pet \nprojects.'' I have to plead guilty to the pet projects.\n  Providing rebate checks to 21.5 million seniors is a pet project of \nmine. I think it is a good program. All 51 Democrats agree it is a pet \nproject we all support. Providing rebate checks to 250,000 wounded \nAmerican veterans is another of my pet projects. Give the money to the \nseniors and to the wounded American veterans and they will spend it. \nProviding tax incentives to small and large businesses is also a pet \nproject. Why? Because it will stimulate the economy and give them the \nmoney and they will spend it.\n  I was at a breakfast at 8 o'clock this morning. We had a number of \ngroups there, but the homebuilders were there. They are out in force. \nThey have covered Washington. They are focusing attention on Republican \nSenators because this legislation is the most important legislation for \nthe homebuilding industry to come about in the past decade. This is \nimportant legislation. The homebuilders have representatives in \nWashington trying to help them.\n  One of the pet projects we have is extending unemployment benefits to \npeople who have been out of work for a long time. I very much \nappreciate the homebuilders being advocates for our Senate stimulus \npackage.\n  Those who are unemployed don't have anyone here. They don't have \nlobbyists calling for Republican Senators to support it. This is the \npackage we got from the Senate Finance Committee. This is an important \npart of the stimulus package--to give rebates to people who are out of \nwork and have been for an extended period of time. They will spend it.\n  Helping Americans struggling to pay their heating bills through the \nLIHEAP is a pet project. I have supported this project for years. We \nsupport this project. You give these people the money and they will \nspend it--and they will spend it now.\n  The growing housing crisis is certainly a pet project of mine, as \nindicated by the statistics we have in Reno, NV, and other places in \nNevada. We should join to build on the House bill. The bill that comes \nfrom the House has to go to conference anyway because there is language \nin the House bill dealing with people who are undocumented who would \nhave benefits.\n  I hope we can join to put this package out as quickly as possible, \ntake it to conference and work with the President and come up with \nsomething better than the House bill.\n  The stimulus package will put money in the pockets of those who will \nspend it and help our country recover from this troubled economy. We \nare in for a long, slow grind, but we can shorten it by doing something \nto stimulate the economy now. The Senate Finance Committee package does \nthat. It is bipartisan, and it needs to be done as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S680-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The authorities are still working to determine the \nextent of the damage.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in praying for the families of the \nvictims and to all who have been touched by these terrible storms. \nState and local officials are working as hard as they can to survey the \ndestruction and get help to anybody who needs it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S680-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been 19 days since the President \ncalled for a stimulus plan, and economists called for swift action on \nit.\n  Republicans and Democrats in the House got the message, and they made \nsome hard choices, showed restraint, and forged a bipartisan compromise \nliterally within days.\n  Unfortunately, Senate Democrats didn't follow suit. They turned the \nidea into political gamesmanship, with the head of their campaign \ncommittee calling for ``tough votes.''\n  The American people are tired of political ``gotcha.'' We don't have \ntime for it. The economy needs a boost right now. So I think we need to \nstep back and ask ourselves what this exercise was all about in the \nfirst place.\n  My preference is to modify the House package to include rebate checks \nfor seniors and disabled veterans and certainly eliminate the \npossibility that any illegal immigrants will get checks.\n  The White House and Treasury Secretary have indicated support for \nsuch a plan, so we can expect it will be signed into law.\n  Meanwhile, we have no such assurance for the alternative, larger \nproposal Senate Democrats apparently are still hashing out. We read \nthis morning that ``negotiations are still ongoing'' among Democrats \nabout what to include in the final package.\n  We started out united behind a proposal to help struggling taxpayers \nand stimulate the economy. Now some are insisting on a plan that might \nnot even be signed into law.\n  However, there is still another choice. We can still pass a bill that \nis targeted and timely and which helps seniors and disabled veterans--\nand that is the amendment I will be offering later today with Senator \nStevens.\n  The Reid amendment, on the other hand, might not even get signed.\n  So should the Reid amendment fail, we should immediately move to \ninclude seniors and disabled veterans, exclude those who are not legal \ncitizens, and then quickly send this good, bipartisan, House-passed \nbill, as amended, back to the House, which I am sure will pass it \nquickly, and send it to the White House for signature. To do less would \nbreak faith with the American people who were told nearly 3 weeks ago \nthey could expect relief quickly.\n  I urge my colleagues and the whole body to support it so we can \ndeliver timely help to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S681-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S681]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation that \nhas been given the number S. 2593, the Forest Landscape Restoration Act \nof 2008. I developed this legislation with Senators Domenici and \nFeinstein, who are cosponsors of the bill. We also have as cosponsors \nSenators Allard, Wyden, Salazar, Cantwell, Craig, Akaka, and Crapo. I \nalso am pleased to point out that Chairman Grijalva in the House of \nRepresentatives is introducing a companion bill, and I look forward to \nworking with him as his subcommittee in the Natural Resources Committee \nmoves forward with that bill.\n  This legislation establishes a program to select and fund projects \nthat restore forests at a landscape scale through a process that \nencourages collaboration, relies on the best available science, \nfacilitates local economic development, and leverages local funds with \nnational and private funding.\n  As many of my colleagues know, we are facing serious forest health \nand wildfire challenges throughout our country. A century of over-\naggressive fire suppression, logging, and other land uses have \nsignificantly deteriorated entire landscapes.\n  These conditions have played an important role in the extraordinary \nwildfires and insect-caused mortality that we have seen literally on \nmillions of acres of national forest and other lands. To address these \nproblems, it is critical that we begin trying to restore our forests on \na landscape scale.\n  Landscape-scale restoration is key for controlling wildfire \nsuppression costs. It is an important component of successful economic \ndevelopment. It is important for the health of many of our forest \necosystems.\n  Despite the importance of landscape-scale restoration, neither the \nNational Fire Plan nor the Healthy Forest Restoration Act nor any of \nthe other efforts we have made to date have been very successful in \nfacilitating restoration and hazardous fuels reduction on landscape \nscales. A lack of sufficient funding is one of the primary reasons. \nRestoring landscapes takes a significant amount of funding over a \nsignificant period of time.\n  To address that problem, the Forest Landscape Restoration Act \nauthorizes $40 million per year for 10 years to be paid into a national \npool. Eligible landscape restoration projects from around the country \nwould compete for a portion of that money. Mr. President, $40 million \nis not nearly enough money to fund landscape-scale treatments in all of \nthe forest landscapes that need restoration, but it is a realistic \namount for us to pursue at this time, and it is enough to make \nlandscape-scale restoration a reality.\n  Because of funding and other challenges, landscape-scale restoration \nremains largely theoretical. As a result, this legislation is designed \nto be both practical and experimental. It does not redirect existing \nefforts. Instead, it adds to existing efforts by creating a program \nthat will make planning, funding, and carrying out at least a handful \nof these landscape-scale restoration projects possible.\n  Again, I thank Senators Domenici and Feinstein and the other \ncosponsors of this legislation for working with me on this bill. I also \nthank the many stakeholders from across the spectrum for their input on \nthe legislation, including the Nature Conservancy which has been very \nsupportive of this effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S681-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S681-S684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, \nwho was here earlier today talking about the economic stimulus package. \nWhat I have tried to do is to understand at this moment where the \nRepublicans are, and it is hard to follow because initially there was \nagreement between the Republican and Democratic leaders in the House--\nSpeaker Pelosi, Congressman Boehner, and Secretary Paulson of the Bush \nadministration. They came up with the notion that to get the economy \nmoving forward, we should send a rebate check of about $600 for \nindividuals and $1,200 for families and additional money for children \nacross the country, which is certainly an excellent starting point \nbecause the administration was persuaded to include the lower income \nfamilies across America, and there were limits on family income as to \neligibility.\n  The Senate Finance Committee took up this proposal from the House and \nsuggested a few changes. I think each one of them is a positive change. \nFor instance, they said: Let's include 21 million seniors receiving \nSocial Security checks. If the idea is to put the money in the hands of \npeople who will spend it, certainly our seniors on fixed incomes, many \nwho struggle with utility bills, keeping their homes warm, paying for \ngasoline, the cost of food and prescription drugs, they can use the \nmoney. An additional $500 or $600 will be spent by them. That was \nincluded in the Senate finance package. That was not in the original \nHouse version. I think that is a positive improvement.\n  Then they also said: If we are talking about groups of people who \nshould be recognized, those disabled veterans from previous conflicts \nand certainly from Iraq and Afghanistan should be included as well. \nThere is argument here. Those men and women certainly deserve special \nconsideration for all they have given to America. So that was added to \nthe House version of the bill on the part of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  Then they went to another category, and this is one the economists \nsay is a very important category: people who are currently unemployed, \nthose folks looking for jobs, many of whom are struggling to keep their \nfamilies together while they find a job after they have been laid off \nfrom previous employment. If they receive additional money, economists \nsay they are most likely to spend it in a hurry. So they encouraged us \nto include them in the relief we are providing with this tax rebate.\n  I have been listening carefully to see if our Republican colleagues \nbelieve these people deserve help as well. I am beginning to believe \nthis is the real problem the Republicans have. They are concerned about \ngiving additional money to people who are currently unemployed. \nYesterday, one Senator from Texas on the Republican side said that just \nencourages them not to find work. I took a look at the amount of money \nthat is paid to people on unemployment. It is hard to believe that is \nthe kind of money that will lead to a life of leisure, where you \ndecide: Heck, I don't need a job; I have unemployment benefits.\n  It turns out that unemployment benefits are not that generous--$500 a \nweek would be a big number, and for many it is a lot less. If we \nsuggest people will stop working with that kind of income, I think it \noverlooks the obvious. Many people in lower income categories struggle \nfrom paycheck to paycheck. Losing a job creates a family emergency. \nWhat we are talking about is whether we should provide additional help \nto those unemployed. This has been done before. It is not a new \nconcept. In fact, historically, if you want to fire up the economy and \nput spending power in the hands of people across America, helping the \nunemployed is one of the first places you turn.\n  The way the Finance Committee does it is to extend unemployment \nbenefits, currently at 13 weeks, another 13 weeks, which will be \nanother 3 months or so, except for States with the highest \nunemployment, and then they would be extended another 26 weeks\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\ntotal. That is a way of providing special help in areas of high \nunemployment.\n  I took a look at the estimated number of people who will exhaust \ntheir jobless benefits State by State. In my State, it is 57,000 \npeople. Let's take a look at a State such as Senator McConnell's State \nof Kentucky: 11,458 people will see their unemployment benefits end \nunless we enact this Senate Finance Committee version of the bill; \nArizona, Senator Kyl's home State, 18,846. Let's go down to Texas where \nSenator Cornyn says he thinks this encourages people not to look for \nwork: 49,000 people are about to lose their unemployment insurance \nbenefits.\n  The point is, unemployment is at a relatively low level in this \ncountry, according to Senator Kyl. These are his words:\n\n       Unemployment is at a relatively low level in this country, \n     and it would be a huge mistake to exacerbate the unemployment \n     situation by extending unemployment benefits.\n\n  I am quoting from a statement that Senator Kyl made, not Senator \nCornyn. I want to make that correction for the record. Senator Kyl was \nthe one who questioned the wisdom of extending unemployment benefits.\n  So in Senator Kyl's home State, it appears that 18,846 people are \nabout to see their unemployment benefits come to an end, and he, I \nassume from his argument, believes that is a good thing because now \nthis will prod them into looking for work, and he is not supporting \nextension of these unemployment benefits for 18,846 people in his home \nState.\n  That has become one of the major elements of debate in terms of \nwhether the Republicans will support the Senate Finance Committee \nversion. Let me add, it was a bipartisan vote that brought the bill out \nof committee--Senator Grassley of Iowa, joining with, I believe, \nSenator Smith of Oregon and Senator Snowe of Maine, if I am not \nmistaken. All three voted for the Senate Finance Committee version of \nthe bill that was brought to the floor.\n  Let's take a look at some other States where unemployment benefits \nmight be important. In the State of Mississippi, 7,819 are about to \nlose their unemployment benefits unless the Senate finance version \npasses as an economic stimulus. As I mentioned, in my home State of \nIllinois, 57,000 are looking for assistance in that regard.\n  As I go through this list--North Carolina is another good example. \nNorth Carolina, 48,000 people in the State, obviously suffering from \nsome high unemployment, are about to lose their unemployment benefits. \nThe State of Ohio, 35,320 otherwise will lose their unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis table so all the States, based on the current U.S. Department of \nLabor data, will be reported officially in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

Mr. President, as this economy continues to deteriorate \nand we see these wild gyrations in the stock market, there are a lot of \npeople concerned. Yesterday, the stock market went down over 300 \npoints. I know it has its good days and bad days, but it has had more \nbad days than good days for a long time.\n  A lot of people in days gone by paid little or no attention to the \nstock market. My mom and dad did not own a share of stock during their \nmarried life. They were too busy raising three kids. They could not \nafford anything like that. If they could put a few bucks in the savings \naccount to save up for the next used car, that is all they looked \nforward to.\n  A lot of people view it differently because that stock market \nreflects the value of 401(k) plans, IRAs, retirement plans, and savings \nthat people count on in years to come. When the stock market is heading \nsouth, people are looking at it in worried terms.\n  What we are trying to do is invigorate this economy and get it moving \nagain. For the longest time, the Republicans have argued that the best \nway to invigorate the economy in good times and bad is to give tax cuts \nto the wealthiest people in America. They have this notion that if \nwealthy people have more money, they somehow will fire up the economy.\n  I come from a different economic school. It started with Principles \nof Economics that I took at Georgetown University not too far from here \nwhen Father Zyrinyi came into our class and explained the marginal \npropensity to save. If you are a wealthy person, you are more likely to \nsave the next dollar handed to you than a poor person, who is more \nlikely to spend it. So if you want to get the economy going and fired \nup, you would give as many dollars as you can to those in lower income \ncategories.\n  Historically, the Republican approach has been just the opposite: \nGive the tax cuts, give more spending power to people who are \nwealthier--folks who have not asked for it and folks who, in many \ncases, do not need it. In my opinion, a tax code, if it is to be fair, \nis going to be progressive and say to those struggling at the lower \nends--the working families and middle-income families--let's be \ngenerous to them because they are the ones living paycheck to paycheck.\n  Well, now the chickens have come home to roost with this economy. As \nthe economy is heading downward, the Bush administration has discovered \npoor people. They have discovered working families. It is no longer \njust a matter of tax cuts for people making over $300,000 or $400,000 a \nyear.\n  So if we are going to be sensible and really want to enliven this \neconomy, the unemployment benefits are the obvious place to turn. \nExtending unemployment benefits is not only humane and moral for \nfamilies out of work, but it works to try to breathe some life into \nthis economy and start more consumer demand and, with that consumer \ndemand, the expansion of business and the expansion of employment and \nprofits and ultimately an improvement in the stock market. That is just \nfundamental Keynesian economics that we have studied over the years.\n  This resistance on the Republican side to helping unemployed people \nis troublesome. It is the same mindset that was in vogue on the \nRepublican side for years when they opposed increasing the basic \nminimum wage in this country. That used to be bipartisan. It wasn't \npolitically dogmatic to be against increasing the minimum wage. Even \nRepublican Presidents did. But then came this new mindset which said \nthat even if people are working for a small amount of money, they can \njust get another job if they need to get by. That is hardly consistent \nwith family values, but it prevailed. Over a long period of time--10 \nyears, in fact--there was no increase in the Federal minimum wage, \nuntil Democrats took control of Congress last year. We point to that \nwith pride because it is something House and Senate Democrats promised \nwould be high on the priority list, and we did it. Again, we were \nfocusing on people left behind in an economy that\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\nis not as powerful and as healthy as we would like it to be. Now \nunemployment benefits fit the same category.\n  When I think of plants across Illinois that have closed, putting \npeople out of work--not to mention smaller businesses--it is through no \nfault of their own that people who once worked at a good manufacturing \nplant in Illinois or any other State don't have a job today. They have \nlost their benefits, lost their health insurance in many instances, and \ndon't know which way to turn. Some have limited education and need time \nto at least get back to school or back for some training so that they \ncan make some money again. Why wouldn't we want to help these people?\n  Beyond the economics of it, doesn't it seem only fair, if we are \ngoing to try to help people and help the economy, that we would start \nwith the unemployed? The list which I have submitted, which will be \nprinted in the Congressional Record, is an indication of how many, \nnationwide, it would help. The number is roughly 1.3 million who would \nbe helped by the extension of unemployment insurance benefits.\n  When Senator Kyl argues it would be a huge mistake to help the \nunemployed in America, he is arguing against the bipartisan approach to \nfighting recession which we have had for the longest period of time. I \nhope his opinion on this bill does not prevail. We need to do our best \nto try to help the families who are trying to get by.\n  In my home State of Illinois, since President Bush took office 7 \nyears ago, relative to inflation, the median household income has \ndecreased by 10 percent. So instead of an improvement in income, \nfamilies in my State have seen their income go down during President \nBush's administration.\n  The number of residents of my State living in poverty since President \nBush came to office has grown by 10 percent in that same period of \ntime. And that was a period of time when the Republicans and the \nPresident were resisting the idea of increasing the minimum wage, \nincidentally.\n  Health care premiums in Illinois have risen 29 percent since \nPresident Bush took office, and 152,000 more people in my State don't \nhave health insurance since President Bush came into office.\n  Those families lucky enough to get their kids in college are facing \nsticker shock. The cost of college in Illinois has risen 51 percent \nsince President Bush was sworn in.\n  A gallon of gas, of course, is up 77 percent in cost, which is an \nadded expense, particularly to low-income families.\n  To make ends meet, families across America, and certainly in \nIllinois, have no place to turn but debt. Debt for these families has \nincreased at a rate four times faster than it did in the 1990s. And it \nis not just families sinking in debt. The President's new budget makes \nit clear that America is sinking in debt. Senator Conrad, chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, made a presentation to us yesterday indicating \nthat President Bush inherited a surplus when he came into office and a \nnational debt in the area of $5.7 trillion, and now it could virtually \ndouble by the time he leaves office. So this is the reality that faces \nus.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On the majority side, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Ten minutes. I see no other Members seeking recognition, \nso I will stay on this point in recognition of the economic situation \nwe are facing.\n  The national debt of America has doubled in the last 7 years under \nPresident Bush. We have accumulated more debt under President Bush than \nunder all of the previous Presidents of the United States combined. \nNow, that is the kind of statement that could easily be challenged but \nI don't think will be because we have the facts to back us up. We have \nincurred this debt because we have had a war the President has not paid \nfor, nor asked Congress to pay for, and we have had a tax cut policy \nwhich is unique in the history of our country. No President of our \ncountry has ever asked for a tax cut in the midst of a war.\n  Here is a figure that ought to concern us as well. Since March 2001, \nforeign investors have financed nearly 80 percent of our Federal budget \ndeficit. So in order to get by, if you are spending more than you are \nraising in taxes, we have to borrow it, and we borrow it from foreign \ngovernments, which increasingly become our bankers and mortgagers. It \nis not a healthy relationship when countries such as China, Japan, \nKorea, and the OPEC nations become the largest creditors of the United \nStates. They have a lot more clout than we might like to see.\n\n  It was just a few months ago that there was speculation by one \neconomist in China that they may decide to move away from a dollar-\ndenominated international transaction to use the Euro, which is a \nstronger currency than the American dollar. Just that rumor, from a \nlow-level economist in China, sent chills through the stock market, and \nwe saw stock prices go down. It is an indication of how dependent we \nare becoming as a nation as we go further in debt to fund a war which \nnow costs $4 billion a week and also to fund tax cuts in the midst of \nthat war primarily for the wealthiest people.\n  The President has said many times that he believes in the so-called \nownership society. But the ownership society hasn't given most American \nfamilies greater control over their financial destiny. The owners of \nthe ownership society, by and large, have zip codes overseas. They are \nforeign investors who own the debt of America.\n  There are a lot of suggestions of how to get out of this. Some have \nsuggested corporate tax cuts and others, but I think direct help to \nworking families is the most effective way to do it. The rebates we \nwould send to those families is money that could be well spent. I think \nthis extension of unemployment insurance has been proven to be very \neffective. Mark Zandi, who is with Moody's Economy.com, estimates this \nwould be the second most effective stimulus measure of all the ideas \nunder consideration, generating $1.64 in increased economic activity \nfor every dollar of rebate. This money can be distributed very quickly, \nsince the weekly benefits are capped at $350 for a single individual in \nIllinois, and it wouldn't cost that much to extend it.\n  The Senate finance package is a great bill. We could have done \nbetter. I wish we could have included, for example, an improvement in \nfood stamps. Over the holidays, last Christmas season, I went to food \nbanks around Illinois. These are some great people. They do not work to \nmake a lot of money, but they work to do a lot of good in their \ncommunities. They gather surplus food and distribute it to families who \nneed it, and they are finding that more and more working families are \nshowing up at food banks, and more and more families, even if they are \nworking, can qualify for food stamps. So food stamps, which, \nunfortunately, don't provide enough money to really cover the cost of \nmeals, could be improved, and that would help our economy. It is not \nincluded in the Senate finance package, but it should be.\n  Finally, I think we need to understand that one of the other ways we \ncan help bring this economy forward is to invest in the infrastructure \nof America. I just flew in this morning from Chicago--one of our great \nAmerican cities. But even that city, with its mass-transit system, \nneeds a massive capital investment, not only to repair what is there \nbut to extend it for service to other areas. It would be good for our \neconomy, certainly good for the environment, and it will create good \njobs. These are jobs that can't be outsourced. When we are doing \ninfrastructure projects in Maryland or in Tennessee, we are doing \nprojects that have real value, not only for the communities but for the \nmen and women who are at work and whose paychecks are invested back \ninto the communities.\n  So I am hopeful that at some point beyond this current discussion \nabout an emergency stimulus package, we can extend our stimulus \napproach to even more investment--investment in highways and mass \ntransit; in bridges, in making certain they are safe and we don't \nwitness the kind of tragedy we had not that long ago in Minneapolis; \ninvestments in water resource development--for instance, the locks and \ndams on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, desperately in need of \nrebuilding. All those are good opportunities to put people to work, to \nreduce the unemployment rate, and to put money back into the economy. \nThere is hardly a\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\nState in our Nation that can't come up with critical infrastructure \nprojects we could invest in to make America stronger. It is one of the \nfew things Government does which we can show has a direct relationship \nto economic growth.\n  Certainly we understand that this current economic crisis we face had \nits genesis in the subprime mortgage market, and we shouldn't overlook \nthe fact that 2.2 million Americans stand to lose their homes to \nforeclosure. I think the administration's proposal so far has been \nanemic. This notion that we would ask mortgage companies and financial \ninstitutions to voluntarily restructure mortgages will take us, \nperhaps, a short walk down the road but not where we should be. We need \nto find better ways to give these families, if they can, the ability to \nstay in their homes and make their mortgage payments.\n  I have a bill that changes the Bankruptcy Code, that allows a \nbankruptcy court to take an honest look at a person's income potential \nand restructure a mortgage so that they can stay in their home and \nwon't face foreclosure. Foreclosure is a disaster not only for the \nfamily losing the home but for those who loaned the money for that home \nand, ultimately, for the neighborhood surrounding it.\n  So Mr. President, there is certainly much we can do. I am sorry we \ndidn't get a lot more done yesterday. We tried, but the Republicans \nresisted again. They wanted another day off, and we had it. Instead of \ngetting serious about amendments to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, instead of having the debate leading up to amendments \nand the vote on the economic stimulus package, the clock ran out.\n  Well, it is about time for the Senate to roll up its sleeves and get \nto work so America can get to work. I hope that today the votes that \nare scheduled will be the beginning of an honest debate and that at the \nend of the day we will pass an economic stimulus package, conference \nwith the House, and send it to the President for his signature before \nwe break for our Presidents Day recess period which begins next week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S684-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TENNESSEE TORNADOES\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I had originally scheduled time to speak a \nlittle about the stimulus package and the many frailties I see with \nthis package. However, due to the tragedy last night in Tennessee, I \nwish to talk on a different subject matter.\n  The senior Senator from Tennessee joins me on the floor this morning, \nand, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield half of my time to \nthe great Lamar Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee, if that \nwould be acceptable.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Tennessee \nis recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Chattanooga \nfor his courtesy. I, too, would like to talk about the economic \nstimulus package and how we Republicans have been ready to go to work \non it for 2 weeks, and will later today. But Senator Corker and I have \nsomething that is closer to our heart today, and that is the \ndevastation that came across our State last night from a string of \ntornadoes that was as rough and as pervasive as anything I have seen in \nmy lifetime.\n  Most Americans saw reports of it while they were watching coverage of \nthe elections, but the trouble began in Memphis in the middle of the \nday, with schools being closed because of tornadoes. It moved on to \nJackson, where 3,300 students at Union University barely escaped, \nalthough the school was heavily damaged.\n  Often, tornadoes and severe weather of this type head in one \ndirection and then the other, but this one just kept going. It kept on \ngoing into middle Tennessee, to Sumner County and Macon County, where \nseveral lives were lost, and moved into east Tennessee and the mountain \narea just this morning. So there is a lot of trouble in our State as a \nresult of that, and Senator Corker and I want the people of our State \nto know we have been monitoring that during the night, and we and our \nstaffs are working together today.\n  We have talked to the Governor and State officials, local officials. \nI talked to the athletic director of Union University on his cell phone \na few minutes ago. I was trying to reach David Dockery, the president \nof Union University.\n  So for the next several days, we will be doing all we can do from the \nFederal level to assist the Governor and the local officials in dealing \nwith the devastation that was caused last night by the severe storms. \nForty-five people were killed, more than another 100 injured, a lot of \ndamage to buildings in areas across our State.\n  I thank Senator Corker for taking this time to allow us to express to \nour constituents our feelings for them. We do want them to know they \nhave our full attention today. The Governor is at the front of the \nline. That is the way we do things in Tennessee. We work easily with \nhim and his staff and the local official. We will stay in touch with \nthem, and those who need to be in touch with our Senate offices can do \nthat.\n  We will move promptly to deal with applications for disaster relief. \nSometimes they say they need to take enough time to be accurately \nfilled out rather than have a race to the mailbox to get those in. But \nwe will be working with local officials with those to do all we can.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker, for his courtesy in \nallowing me to express my remarks, and I look forward to working with \nhim to help deal with the pain that has been caused to many \nTennesseans.\n  I yield for Senator Corker.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, thank you for letting me spend a few \nminutes on this topic that is such a huge issue in the State of \nTennessee. I certainly thank our senior Senator for his leadership. Our \nsenior Senator was also the Governor of Tennessee. I know he knows full \nwell what many people across our State today are facing.\n  Again, I thank him for his leadership on so many issues. I know both \nof us today have spent time talking with county mayors across the State \nof Tennessee, talking with our Governor, talking with officials at \nUnion University and other places. I know that for all of us our hearts \nand prayers go out not only to the people of Tennessee but also the \nMississippi, Arkansas, and Kentucky people who also are dealing with \nsome very tragic circumstances.\n  I know people in Tennessee are looking to their county mayors and our \nGovernor for leadership, their officials with the National Guard, and \nFEMA. My understanding is they are providing outstanding leadership and \nthat people have worked throughout the night to make sure that relief \nhas been given, that people have been taken into homes and other \nplaces. Today, as they begin to dig out, if you will, and really see \nthe extent of the damage, that will continue.\n  I am very proud to serve with Lamar Alexander and to be with him \ntoday. I know both of us want the people of Tennessee to know we are \nvery aware of the tragedy they are dealing with. We are with them and \ntheir elected officials at the local and State level. We want to work \nwith them as time goes on to make sure that much needed Federal relief, \nwhich will be on the way down the road, is forthcoming.\n  I wish to thank all of those volunteers. I have heard stories of \nheroic things throughout our State where ordinary citizens have done \nthings to ease the pain and to create safety for many of our citizens \nin harm's way.\n  Again, our thoughts and prayers are with all of our citizens, \nespecially those who have been so tragically affected by the events of \nthe last 24 hours.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S684-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S684-S685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. DeMINT.

It is something \nwe definitely need to address. It is equally important, as we look at \nour economic situation, to make sure we allow economic growth and \nprosperity to work for more people. It is not just about our economic \nsituation as a whole growing but making sure everyone can share in that \nprosperity.\n  It is important, as we look at the best way to stimulate the economy \nand keep it going, to remember that good jobs and a good economy depend \non successful companies making good profits. In order for that to \nhappen, we have to create a good business environment. Our goal as a \nCongress should be to make sure America is the best place in the world \nto do business. Unless we do that, we will continue to lose ground to \ncountries all over the world. It is going to be increasingly difficult \nto sustain long-term economic growth. The world is becoming \nincreasingly competitive. We hear it every day. We hear from Asia and \nIndia which are actually courting businesses with incentives to \nencourage companies to locate in their countries, creating a good \nbusiness environment with less regulation and less taxes so that people \nwill bring their manufacturing plants, their people, and their capital \nto their countries. It is working. Even stodgy old Europe that we \nimagine to be a high-tax and highly regulated network of countries is \nchanging to be more competitive in the world economy. They have lowered \ntheir corporate tax rate to an average of about 25 percent. Some of \ntheir countries such as Ireland have gone down close to 10 percent and \nhave seen remarkable economic growth as they have lowered their tax \nrate.\n  Why is this country not responding in the same way? It hasn't been \ntoo long since I have been in the private sector working with \nbusinesses. I continue to hear the same sentiment. If we are going to \ndo business in America today, before we get to the equipment and the \npeople actually making the products or providing services, a medium-\nsized American company today is likely to have a large tax department. \nIt could spend millions on dealing with our Tax Code. We have the most \ncomplex tax system in the world and probably the highest corporate tax \nrate in the world. Some will say it is second. Some say it is first. \nBut we are definitely near the top at around 35 percent. So they start \nwith a large tax department.\n  Then most of our companies also have large legal departments because \nwe are the most litigious society in the world. The most liability for \nany country is to do business in America. It is not unusual to talk to \nsuccessful, well-known American companies that are dealing with \nhundreds, if not thousands, of lawsuits at the same time. So they keep \na full-time fleet of lawyers and law firms on retainer dealing with the \nlawsuits and the legal situations.\n  These same companies also have large human resource and compliance \ndepartments to deal with all of our regulations--some of them good, \nmany unnecessary. A lot of regulations related to capital and \nreporting, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, are costing companies millions of \ndollars unnecessarily because Congress is unwilling to fix those things \nwe know are wrong. So there is a large tax department, a large legal \ndepartment, a large human resource compliance and regulatory \ndepartment, before we get to manufacturing and actually making things. \nWe are making it very difficult for our companies to compete.\n  Add to that the cost of energy which is one of the highest in the \nworld. That goes back to bad policy as well. For years we have known we \nhave large oil and natural gas reserves. We have known we could develop \nmore nuclear generation of electricity. Yet we have not allowed nuclear \nplants to be developed. We have large reserves of oil in Alaska, which \nwe have consistently voted down in the Congress, and natural gas we \ndon't go after. Therefore, we are not only spending hundreds more for \nevery family for gasoline for cars or oil to heat homes or more for \nelectricity, we are sending hundreds of billions of dollars a year out \nof this country that could support our economy yet is supporting the \nMiddle East and other economies around the world. Yet we will not \nchange the policy. We will not develop our own energy resources. \nInstead, we are making it harder to produce automobiles in this \ncountry, putting the burden on them consistently.\n  Now, instead of trying to fix some of the systemic policy problems, \nwe are talking about an economic stimulus plan which I have yet to \nhear, at least on the Republican side in our private meetings, one \nRepublican defend as good policy. Maybe some will come out here and do \nso. But everyone on both sides is talking about good politics. We are \ndoing nothing for long-term growth. We are doing nothing to create a \nsimpler, more predictable Tax Code or reducing our regulation or \nlitigation. What we are going to do in time for the election is to get \na check in the hands of as many people as we can, and we are borrowing \nit from the future. The debt is growing. We are going to borrow the \nmoney to send checks home to Americans.\n  In 10 years on the present course, bonds for the American Government \nwill be rated as junk bonds in the world because we continue to look at \nthe next election rather than the future of the country.\n  It is obvious what we could do to develop a long-term, sustained \neconomic growth pattern. If we made the current tax rates permanent, \nthe ones we know have stimulated our economy, that would allow \ncompanies to plan past 3 years to build new plants, to buy new capital \nequipment, to hire new people. Right now American companies trying to \ndo business in this country do not know what their tax rates are going \nto be after 2010. In fact, if we do nothing in Congress, they know they \nwill experience the highest tax increase in history. Yet we are not \neven willing to talk about it. All of us know we need to lower our \ncorporate tax rate to at least be comparable to Europe at 25 percent. \nYet we are not doing it. So more of our capital, more of our jobs, more \nbusinesses will continue to move offshore. Sending people a few hundred \ndollars to pay down their credit cards is not going to help grow our \neconomy.\n  There are other things we know we can do. We know we can bring \ncapital from overseas back home for investment and growth if we lower \nthe corporate tax rate as we did a few years ago, what we call \nrepatriating those dollars. Even temporarily lowering that rate would \nbring capital home and encourage growth.\n\n  The one part of the stimulus package that does make sense is to allow \ncompanies to expense or to speed up depreciation of capital they buy so \nit will encourage them to grow and make decisions now because the \npeople who make that equipment have jobs, and those who operate that \nequipment have jobs. So it would provide some stimulus. But it is most \nimportant that we have a predictable, permanent system where people can \ndo business and be competitive around the world. It is unfortunate in \nall this debate that we are not even willing to talk about it.\n  I appreciate the time to express my concerns. I am thankful everyone \nis concerned about the economy and those who have lost their jobs and \nmay lose them in the future. But what we are doing as a Congress is \ntalking about doing something that we are not really doing: we are not \nstimulating the economy. This is not an economic stimulus package. It \nis a political stimulus package that is designed to help folks in \nNovember.\n  I know every American needs a check and probably none will turn it \ndown. But, unfortunately, we are making false promises that will not \ncarry into long-term economic growth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be \nconsidered as in morning business but fall in line with regard to the \nbill before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to briefly mention my opposition \nto amendment No. 3913 offered by the Senator from Wisconsin. This \namendment relates to reverse targeting, which is a theory that the \nGovernment could target a foreign person abroad when the real intention \nis to target a U.S. person, thus circumventing the need to get a \nwarrant for the U.S. person. Quite simply, reverse targeting is already \nconsidered illegal under FISA. Going even further, the Intelligence \nCommittee bill has a very explicit prohibition against reverse \ntargeting. The amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin adds \nsubjective language which completely alters the meaning of the original \nbipartisan provision.\n  I asked Attorney General Mukasey this during a hearing on Wednesday, \nand here is our exchange.\n\n       HATCH: Now the topic of reverse targeting has been \n     mentioned often during the FISA reform debate. From an \n     intelligence perspective, reverse targeting makes no sense. \n     From an efficiency standpoint, if the government was \n     interested in targeting an American, it would apply for a \n     warrant to listen to all of that person's conversations, \n     wouldn't it? Not just his conversations with terrorists \n     overseas?\n       MUKASEY: Correct.\n       HATCH: Now, I asked General Wainstein about this during the \n     Judiciary Committee hearing last October, and he reiterated \n     the government's view that FISA itself makes reverse \n     targeting illegal. Does the DOJ still consider reverse \n     targeting illegal under FISA?\n       MUKASEY: Absolutely.\n       HATCH: Are you aware of any instances of intelligence \n     analysts utilizing reverse targeting?\n       MUKASEY: I am not aware of any such instances.\n\n  We are enacting national security legislation, and it is our \nresponsibility to ensure that this bill does not lead to unintended \nconsequences which provide protections to terrorists. This amendment is \nabsolutely unnecessary, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3920\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a few remarks with regard to my dear \nfriend, Senator Whitehouse's amendment to authorize the FISC, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, to assess compliance with \nminimization techniques. I rise to express my opposition to the \nWhitehouse amendment No. 3920.\n  My opposition to the Whitehouse amendment is related to the totality \nof this bill. This is an amendment that greatly expands the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court's jurisdiction. Keeping in mind that \nthe bill before us already expands FISC jurisdiction of foreign \ncollection to an unprecedented high historical level, this amendment \ntips the balance and could lead to real-life instances of intelligence \nanalysts' operational decisions being second guessed by the court.\n  The original approach and goals of this legislation were simple and \ntwofold. Goal No. 1: Wire communications taking place in 2008 should \nreceive the same treatment as radio communications taking place in \n1978; and goal No. 2: Our intelligence community's sources and methods \nshould not be subject to exposure by litigation brought about by \nhearsay and innuendo.\n  I am pleased the legislation before us provides more protections to \nAmerican citizens than any intelligence bill in my recent memory, and \ncertainly more than the original FISA law.\n  Over the last several months, a great deal of attention has been \ngiven to the FISC, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The \nFISC was created by the original FISA law, and its jurisdiction was \nextremely limited by that law. Here is what the FISC was created to do.\n  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court: ``A court which shall have \njurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders approving \nelectronic surveillance.''\n  This jurisdiction is purposefully limited, as the task of reviewing \napplications to intercept electronic communications is among the most \nimportant tasks our Government can do to protect our country and its \ncitizens. Terrorists have to communicate to plan and execute attacks, \nand our interception of these communications is paramount to stopping \nthe next attack.\n  The jurisdiction of the FISC is greatly expanded by this legislation. \nCombined with other provisions in this bill, the new oversight created \nis prevalent and comprehensive. Since the breadth of this new oversight \nis critical when determining the necessity of the amendment we are \ndebating, let's look at the oversight created by this legislation.\n  Let me read these five charts.\n  No. 1, for the first time the FISC will review and approve \nminimization procedures used by the intelligence community.\n  No. 2, for the first time the FISC will review and approve targeting \nprocedures used by the intelligence community. The FISC will determine \nwhether the procedures are reasonably designed to ensure targeting is \nlimited to persons outside the United States.\n  No. 3, for the first time, a court order will be required to target \nU.S. persons regardless of where they are in the world--for the first \ntime.\n  No. 4, for the first time the Attorney General and the Director of \nNational Intelligence will be required to assess the intelligence \ncommunity's compliance with court-approved targeting and minimization \nprocedures. These assessments must be provided to the FISC and \ncongressional Intelligence Committees.\n  No. 5, new congressional oversight--for the first time Congress is \ncreating statutorily required inspector general--that is the Department \nof Justice and intelligence elements--semiannual assessments of \ncompliance with court-approved targeting and minimization procedures. \nThese assessments must be provided to congressional Intelligence \nCommittees.\n  Now, given the staggering amount of new oversight, we should be very \ncareful when creating mechanisms which could negatively impact our \nintelligence analysts, particularly when these mechanisms provide no \nbenefit, in this case, to the privacy of American citizens.\n  The intelligence community has a great deal of experience in the \ntechniques used to minimize incidental communications, and very \ndetailed procedures for handling these communications are contained in \nthe United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18, which has been in \neffect for over 28 years.\n  Remember, the Government is gathering information relating to foreign \nintelligence in order to protect national security, not necessarily for \ncriminal prosecution. That is why different procedures are necessary. \nOtherwise, all national security information gathering would be changed \nto fit within the procedures of title III criminal wiretaps, which is \nimpossible.\n  Minimization techniques deal not just with retention and \ndissemination, but with acquisition. Analysts make decisions up front \nwhether to acquire, keep, or share U.S. person information based on \nwhether it has foreign intelligence value.\n  This means if a judge is reviewing compliance with minimization \nprocedures, this review is much more than a factual check. The judge is \nnot limited to simply making sure that technical and administrative \nguidelines are followed. Rather, this amendment could allow a judge to \nquestion specific decisions by intelligence analysts on why they chose \nto acquire, keep, or share certain communications.\n  Now this begs the question: Are judges better trained in intelligence \ncollection than the intelligence analysts whose job it is to repeatedly \nperform this task? Not only do I think the answer is no, but we should \nremember what the FISC said in their recently publicly released \nopinion, which is only the third public opinion released in the history \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\n  Here is what the FISC said:\n\n       Although the FISC handles a great deal of classified \n     material, FISC judges do not make classification decisions \n     and are not intended to become national security experts. \n     Furthermore, even if a typical FISC judge had more expertise \n     in national security matters than a typical district court \n     judge, that expertise would still not equal that of the \n     Executive Branch, which is constitutionally entrusted with \n     protecting the national security.\n\n  Enactment of this amendment could result in judges making foreign \nintelligence determinations in place of trained intelligence analysts. \nBased on this unjustified scrutiny, our intelligence analysts could \nbecome overly cautious when determining whether to\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\ndeem information as having intelligence value in order to avoid \nunwarranted judicial scrutiny. This could result in less foreign \nintelligence information being accumulated, and thus could mean we may \nmiss a vital piece of information. Do we want to take this chance? That \nis what this amendment would do. Should we risk this type of unintended \nresult?\n  In October of 2007, I asked Assistant Attorney General Wainstein if \nputting the FISC judges in the position of assessing compliance would \neffectively put the judge in the role of an analyst. Here is what he \nsaid in response:\n\n       And that is the problem, that it would get the FISC in the \n     position of being operational to the extent that it's not \n     when it assesses compliance for, let's say, the minimization \n     procedures in the typical or traditional FISA context where \n     you're talking about one order, one person. Here, some of our \n     orders might well be programmatic, where you're talking about \n     whole categories of surveillances, and that would be a tall \n     order for the FISA Court to assess compliance.\n\n  The Whitehouse amendment also contains language which lets the FISC \nfashion remedies it determines are necessary to enforce compliance. \nThis is very broad language and gives the court the ability to come up \nwith whatever methods it chooses to enforce compliance. Does this mean \nthat the FISC could shut down collection of information from foreign \ntargets overseas while the Government addresses technical issues which \nhave little to do with the privacy of American citizens? We do not \nknow, since this amendment does not answer this question. Remember, we \nare talking about targeting foreign terrorists to prevent terrorist \nattacks. This is not the same thing as wiretapping a cocaine dealer in \nLos Angeles for criminal prosecution. If we approve an amendment which \ncreates numerous unanswered questions, we are putting Americans at risk \nin unprecedented ways.\n  Given that the Government has adequately utilized minimization \nprocedures for many years, what is the pressing need for FISC expansion \ninto this area? There is no need to continue unlimited expansion of the \nFISC into unsuitable areas.\n  If this amendment does not pass, it does not mean that American \ncitizens are not protected. Incidental communications of Americans will \ncontinue to be minimized, and the minimization procedures will have \nbeen approved by the FISC. But if the Whitehouse amendment passes, we \nwill be taking a great risk that the unnecessary judicial oversight \nwill cause very harmful unintended consequences that I have already \nmentioned. We are too far along to introduce guesswork into the \ncarefully crafted compromise bill before us. I will oppose this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3930\n\n  Now, Mr. President, there is one other amendment I wish to refer to. \nIn October of last year, the Intelligence Committee passed a bipartisan \ncompromise bill which would modernize our foreign intelligence \nsurveillance activities. Unfortunately, this bipartisan bill contained \na 6-year sunset provision which would automatically curtail our ability \nto protect our homeland unless Congress acted.\n  Let me be clear, I am opposed to any sunset in this legislation. \nWhile I believe the inclusion of this sunset provision was not \nappropriate, it was a result of the bipartisan negotiations in the \nIntelligence Committee. Now this serves as yet another example that not \nall of us who support this bill are happy with every provision, and \nevery Senator will need to make concessions to get this bill passed and \nsigned into law.\n  Given my opposition to any sunset, I will oppose the Cardin amendment \nNo. 3930, which would change the sunset from 6 to 4 years. Proponents \nof this amendment have propounded several arguments, none of which \njustifies this change. I am going to discuss three of those arguments \ntoday.\n  The most common argument cited is that this legislation is too \ntechnical and too complex to have a 6-year sunset. This is certainly a \ncomplex bill, but this is not the first time the 110th Congress has \ntackled complex issues. We have already waded through several different \nand complex bills, such as immigration reform, ethics and lobbying \nlegislation, and even a vast energy bill.\n  We are not reinventing the wheel with surveillance law, as this is a \nFISA modernization bill. But it is important to note how Congress has \npreviously legislated in this area. The 1978 FISA law made dramatic \nchanges to our surveillance laws and oversight mechanisms. While FISA \nhas been discussed extensively, what has not been stated nearly enough \nis that the 1978 FISA had no sunset. Given that FISA had no sunset, \nlet's look at how Congress has previously legislated FISA amendments \nwith regard to sunsets.\n  Sunsets are not common in previous laws amending FISA. Other than the \nPATRIOT Act and the PATRIOT Act reauthorization, seven of the eight \npublic laws amending FISA had no sunsets on FISA provisions, and the \nremaining public law had a sunset on only one of those provisions.\n  Now, this statistic speaks for itself. What is so different about \nthis bill? I do realize it contains massive new congressional oversight \nprovisions which could possibly hinder our collection efforts, and that \nwe may need to revisit it for this reason. However, if this is the \ncase, we obviously do not need a sunset to do this. We can legislate in \nthis area whenever we want to.\n  A second reason I have heard that some support the Cardin amendment \nis that this sunset will keep Congress more engaged. One of my \ncolleagues previously stated that a sunset ``gives Congress the ability \nto stay involved.'' Congress should not need sunsets to stay involved. \nWe do not need legislative alarm clocks to go off in 4 years in order \nto address national security. I wake up every day thinking about how we \nmight protect our fellow Americans. I certainly do not need a \nsunsetting bill to remind me about national security and oversight, and \nneither should my colleagues.\n  The final reason I have heard for a 4-year sunset is the idea that \nthe next administration should be given an opportunity to address this \nissue and that a sunset fosters cooperation between Congress and the \nWhite House. Along these lines, one of my colleagues previously stated: \nHaving a sunset gives us a much better chance to get cooperation . . . \nbetween the Congress and the White House. Once again, the next \nPresident can weigh in on this topic whenever and however he or she \nwants to. And regarding the idea that we should include a 4-year sunset \nto foster cooperation between two branches of Government--do we need a \nstatute to influence the separation of powers? I say to my colleagues \nthat the relationship between the branches of Government should be \nfostered by natural restrictions contained in the Constitution of the \nUnited States, not by an artificial sunset provision in an intelligence \nbill.\n  The very idea of a 4-year sunset understates the importance of \ntimeline implementation of new legislation. It takes a great deal of \ntime to ensure that all of our intelligence agencies and personnel are \nfully trained in new authorities and restrictions brought about by \ncongressional action. This is not something that happens overnight. We \ncannot wave a magic wand and have our Nation's intelligence personnel \ninstantaneously cognizant of every administrative alteration imposed by \nCongress. Like so many other things in life, adjusting for these new \nmechanisms takes time and practice.\n  While certain modifications are necessary, do we want to make it a \nhabit of consistently changing the rules? Don't we want our analysts to \nspend their time actually tracking terrorists, or is their time better \nspent navigating administrative procedures that may be constantly in \nflux?\n\n  I know my preference is that our analysts be given the time to use \nthe lawful tools at their disposal to keep our families safe.\n  I do not want to see them spending all their time burying their heads \nin administrative manuals which change from day to day whenever the \npolitical winds blow.\n  After all of the efforts by many in this body to write a bill that \nprovides a legal regime to govern contemporary technological \ncapabilities, I am certainly not alone in my opposition to a sunset \nprovision. In fact, my views are completely in line with what the \nSenate has done in the past when amending FISA. The administration \nstrongly opposes a sunset, and Attorney General Mukasey confirmed this \nopposition during last week's oversight hearing here in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\n  The fact is that this administration will not be here to see this \nsunset occur. Why would they care if there is a sunset in the bill or \nnot? Their opposition demonstrates that those who are in charge of \nprotecting our country know that a sunset is a bad idea and their \nopposition is based in logic and practical application. The \nadministration knows that they will not be here, but the intelligence \nanalysts who protect our country will. These analysts are not \npolitically appointed, and do their job regardless of who the President \nis or what party the President represents. They need the stability of \nour laws to effectuate long term operations to prevent terrorist \nattacks, not guesswork which could hinder intelligence gathering \npractices.\n  We have already had a trial run with the 6-month sunset of the \nProtect America Act. Enough of the quick fixes, let's have confidence \nin the work product created by the nearly 10 months we have spent on \nthis issue. A shorter sunset gives us an excuse to not legislate with \nconviction, and this is an excuse we should not make.\n  The 95th Congress had the ability to decipher complex problems and \npass FISA with no sunset, and the 110th Congress can certainly \nmodernize it without second guessing our capabilities by approving the \nCardin amendment. I will oppose this amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the remaining moments of morning \nbusiness, I wish to highlight a couple important points about our \neconomic stimulus efforts in the Senate.\n  We have had an opportunity over the last couple weeks to analyze \ncarefully what the American people expect in terms of a jolt to our \neconomy and what they expect this body to do. Unfortunately, we have \nbeen stymied by a lot of politics. I think it is important to point out \nvery briefly the elements of what the Senate is trying to do, at least \non the Democratic side and, secondly, to highlight its importance to \nthe American people.\n  First of all, with regard to the basic elements--I will not go into a \nlong discussion--in order to stimulate this economy, we have to invest \nin strategies we know will work. One of those is unemployment \ninsurance. We know that. All the economists say that. It is not because \nDemocrats assert that; economists say one of the only ways that is \nproven to jolt our economy is to invest in unemployment insurance. This \nproposal on the Democratic side does that. The House proposal doesn't \ndo that in the area of unemployment insurance. It doesn't address that.\n  The package this side of the aisle has been pushing is a $500 rebate. \nIt is across the board for everyone and obviously for those who are \nmarried it is double that. But significantly, in this proposal 20 \nmillion American senior citizens are provided some relief. That wasn't \naddressed in the House proposal. I think that is an important omission. \nIn order to get this right, in order to jolt our economy, we need to \nhelp seniors. We also need to make sure a quarter of a million disabled \nveterans are helped as well. That is an important feature.\n  Thirdly, avoiding foreclosure; doing everything we can in this \nstimulus package in a short-term way to help families avoid foreclosure \nis another critically important element.\n  Home heating costs: In my home State of Pennsylvania--and I know the \nsame is true in Ohio and across the country--there has been a 19-\npercent increase in the costs that families have to heat their homes, \nin 1 year. So if that is happening in Pennsylvania, we know it prevails \naround the country. This proposal in this Chamber does that. It adds $1 \nbillion for home heating costs.\n  Finally, helping businesses and energy: As to the cost to businesses, \nI think small businesses should get help in this rough economy, and \nthis proposal helps our businesses. It also makes investments we should \nhave--or I should say implements strategies we should have done months \nago when it comes to incentivizing energy efficiency and other tactics \nto move toward a more energy independent economy.\n  So whether it is energy, whether it is helping businesses, whether it \nis making sure our seniors get relief, that our families get relief and \nthat we focus on unemployment insurance, home heating costs, all these \nelements are critically important. It is not perfect. The Presiding \nOfficer knows--and he shares this view with me--we wanted to do more \nwith regard to food stamps. We are still going to try on that. But if \nthat doesn't happen and some other things don't happen that I want, we \nstill have to move this forward. I wish the other side of the aisle \nwould allow us to go forward in a way that addresses these basic \nproblems. We have seen a lot of talk on the other side but not nearly \nenough action to say we are going to support a proposal, not just what \nthe House sent us but an improved and a much more significant proposal \nto hit this economy in the way we should hit it: With a stimulus to get \nthe economy moving, to create jobs, to provide relief for our families, \nand to move into the future together.

The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments on the \namendment of the Senator from Wisconsin and what he referred to as the \n``bulk collection'' amendment which he discussed yesterday and which is \namendment No. 3912. I would ask that this time be taken from the \nopponents of the amendment, if that is all right with my vice chairman.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is offering an amendment that he argues \nwill prevent what he calls ``bulk collection''. The amendment is \nintended, as described by the Senator from Wisconsin, to ensure that \nthis bill is not used by the Government to collect the contents of all \nthe international communications between the United States and the rest \nof the world. The Senator argues that the amendment will prevent ``bulk \ncollection'' by requiring the Government to have some foreign \nintelligence interest in the overseas party to the communications it is \ncollecting.\n  I regret to say I must oppose this amendment strongly. I do not \nbelieve it is necessary. I do believe, as drafted, the amendment will \ninterfere with legitimate intelligence operations that\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nprotect the national security of the lives of Americans.\n  In considering amendments today, we need to consider whether an \namendment would provide additional protections for U.S. persons and \nwhether it would needlessly inhibit vital foreign intelligence \ncollection. I do not believe the amendment, as drafted, provides \nadditional protections. Furthermore, intelligence professionals have \nexpressed their concern that this amendment would interfere with vital \nintelligence operations, and there are important classified reasons \nunderlying that concern.\n  Let us review why the amendment is unnecessary. First, bulk \ncollection resulting in a dragnet of all the international \ncommunications of U.S. persons would probably be unreasonable under the \nfourth amendment. No bill passed by the Senate may authorize what the \nfourth amendment of the Constitution prohibits. What is more, the \ncommittee bill, in fact, explicitly provides that acquisitions \nauthorized under the bill are to be conducted in a manner consistent \nwith that same fourth amendment of the Constitution.\n  Second, the committee bill stipulates that acquisitions under this \nauthority cannot intentionally target any person known to be located in \nthe United States. And to target a U.S. person outside the United \nStates, the Government must get approval from the FISA Court.\n  Third, the committee bill increases the role of the FISA Court \noverseeing the acquisition activities of the Government. The bill \nrequires court approval of minimization procedures that protect U.S. \npersons' information. It maintains the prior requirement of court \napproval of targeting procedures.\n  In the unlikely event the FISA Court would give its approval to \ntargeting procedures and minimization procedures that allow the \nGovernment to engage in unconstitutional bulk collection, the committee \nbill also strengthens oversight mechanisms in the executive and \nlegislative branches, such as requiring assessments by the inspectors \ngeneral in the Department of Justice and relevant agencies. These \nmechanisms are intended to ensure that such activity is detected and \nprevented.\n  The sponsor of the amendment says his amendment only requires the \nGovernment to certify to the FISA Court that it is collecting \ncommunications of targets for whom there is a foreign intelligence \ninterest. But the committee already requires the Attorney General and \nthe Director of National Intelligence to certify to the FISA Court that \nthe acquisition authorized under the bill is targeted at persons \noutside the United States in order to obtain foreign intelligence \ninformation. Because the remedy does not improve upon the protections \nin the bill for Americans and places new burdens on the surveillance of \nforeign targets overseas, I thus oppose this amendment and urge that it \nbe rejected.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the opponents' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes from the opposition \nto the amendment No. 3979, the Feingold-Webb sequestration.\n  During yesterday's sessions and prior sessions, there have been, \nregrettably, a number of inaccurate statements about the amendments we \ndebated. Several of these amendments go to the very heart and strike at \nthe very heart of foreign targeting. It is not an understatement to say \nthat if they are adopted, they could shut down our intelligence \ncollection and cause irreparable damage to our national security. So I \nam compelled to set the record straight. Working with my colleague and \ngood friend, the chairman of the committee, Senator Rockefeller, we \nwant our colleagues to know what impact these amendments have.\n  We have made great progress in the Senate Intelligence Committee on \nthe FISA Amendments Act of 2008 in providing additional protections, \nbut we did so working with the intelligence community to make sure the \nmeasures we put in the bill would actually work.\n  Now, the first amendment we debated was amendment No. 3979, the \nsequestration amendment supported by and sponsored by Senators Feingold \nand Webb. In explaining this amendment, supporters claimed the Protect \nAmerica Act was ``sold repeatedly'' as a way to collect foreign-to-\nforeign communications without a court order and this amendment allows \nthis collection. We saw from the House RESTORE Act, which the DNI has \ntold us--the Director of National Intelligence, whom I will refer to as \nthe DNI--and from the debate on the Protect America Act that the focus \non foreign-to-foreign communications is misplaced. The Protect America \nAct was intended to allow foreign targeting, just like this bill and \nfor good reason. We cannot tell if a foreign terrorist is going to be \ncalling or communicating with another foreign terrorist whether in some \nother country or whether some of that communication may occasionally \ncome to the United States, and there is no way to tell. So it does no \ngood to give the intelligence community authority to collect only \nforeign-to-foreign communication. You can't tell. That means you can't \ncollect on any without getting a FISA Court or a FISC order. That was \nan impossible burden that the FISC judges told us overwhelmed and shut \ndown their operations and did not protect American citizens. Yet we \nwere told yesterday this amendment will not damage or slow down \ncollection.\n\n  This amendment will not just slow down collection; it will stop it. \nIt will stop it. In the words of one intelligence official, it would \n``devastate our operations.''\n  Now, our bipartisan bill gives the intelligence community the ability \nto target terrorists, foreign terrorists overseas. That targeting is \nnot, as has been suggested on the other side, ``dragnet surveillance.'' \nRather, the intelligence community will be acquiring communications of \nforeign terrorists, spies, and others who seek to do us harm. That is \nnot a dragnet; that is targeted. But if this amendment were to be \nadopted, its unreasonable limitations will prevent the intelligence \ncommunity even from beginning the collection.\n  Now, I argued yesterday this amendment would prevent the intelligence \ncommunity from intercepting the communications of Osama bin Laden with \nsomebody in the United States. The Senator from Wisconsin disagreed, \ncalling my argument questionable and claiming the amendment in no way \nhampers the ability to fight al-Qaida. That is not true. I find it \ninteresting because that is not what his amendment says. First, the \nintelligence community can't even start the collection because there is \nno way to know if a terrorist, including bin Laden, is going to call or \nbe called by a person in the United States. Second, from the amendment, \npage 2, lines 10 to 16:\n\n       Such communications may be acquired if there is reason to \n     believe that the communication concerns international \n     terrorist activities directed against the United States, or \n     activities in preparation therefor.\n\n  That means if bin Laden were planning an attack against the United \nKingdom or against our foreign military bases or our foreign embassies \nabroad and calls into the United States to talk with an associate, we \ncould not capture that call and protect our troops, protect our \ncitizens, protect our officers overseas, because under the terms of the \namendment, it does not concern activities directed against the United \nStates. Not only is the limitation dangerous, it is unwise, unhelpful, \nand could lead to significant intelligence shortfalls.\n\n  Another dangerous aspect of the amendment is that it would foreclose \nthe collection of foreign intelligence relating to nonterrorist \nthreats. Our Nation faces daily threats, for example, from the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I have an amendment that \ndeals with this issue specifically. What about North Korea, Iran, and \nSyria? Under this amendment, none of that information could be \ncollected if the communication was to or from the United States. That \nis a limitation that should make all of us uncomfortable. There is no \nbasis for it, it is unreasonable, and it could lead our country into \nsevere jeopardy.\n  The DNI and the Attorney General agree with my reading of the \namendment. Yesterday, we received a letter from them expressing their \nviews about these amendments. The DNI and Attorney General stated that \nif this amendment is part of the bill presented to the President, they \nwould recommend a veto. They wrote this in their letter:\n\n       This amendment would have a devastating impact on foreign \n     intelligence surveillance\n\n[[Page S690]]\n\n     operations; it is unsound as a matter of policy; its \n     provisions would be inordinately difficult to implement; and \n     thus it is unacceptable.\n\n  Ironically, this amendment is being advertised as the best way to \nprotect America's privacy. But a fundamental problem with the amendment \nis that we can never know ahead of time what a communication says. \nLet's think it through. In order to figure out whether the \ncommunication concerns international terrorism, for example, an analyst \nwill have to review the content of it. That actually results in more of \nan invasion of privacy than would ever occur under the standard \nminimization procedures that NSA uses every day. That makes no sense if \nwe are trying to protect privacy.\n  Mr. President, it is news to me that the Intelligence Committee bill, \nas claimed on the other side, has no judicial involvement and no \njudicial oversight. I have said it before. This bill has more judicial \noversight and involvement in foreign intelligence surveillance than \never before. There is court review and approval of the joint \ncertification by the Attorney General and the DNI and of the targeting \nminimization procedures. If the court finds any deficiency in these \ndocuments, the Government must correct it or cease the acquisition. \nThat is not an empty oversight.\n  The Intelligence Committee bill doesn't stop there. We took \ntremendous care to make sure there were specific protections for \nAmericans' privacy in the bill. I suggest all Members look closely at \nthese protections: express prohibitions against reverse targeting, \nagainst targeting persons inside the United States without a court \norder, against conducting any acquisition that doesn't comply with the \nfourth amendment. This bill goes further than ever before in ensuring \nthat there are protections for Americans in the area of foreign \ntargeting.\n  We heard the tired accusation that this bill will allow the \nintelligence community to intercept communications of anyone; that it \ngives ``unrestrained access to communications of every American.'' That \nis just plain wrong. Communications of U.S. persons will be intercepted \nonly if those persons are talking to foreign terrorists or spies. And \nbecause of the minimization procedures, only those specific \ncommunications will be intercepted, and if they don't contain foreign \nintelligence value, then they will be minimized or suppressed.\n  According to the Senator from Wisconsin, this amendment is necessary \nbecause the minimization procedures in FISA are ``quite weak'' and \ninadequate. I am sure the FISA Court judges who have reviewed and \napproved these procedures would appreciate the implication that they \nare doing a bad job of protecting the privacy of Americans. Ironically, \nit is that same court that, under the Senator's amendment, will control \nthe Government's access and use of incidental communications.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will use some of my time on a couple \nof these amendments. I know it must be difficult for the Chair to \nfigure out which time to apply to which amendments, but I will try to \nidentify them.\n  First, I will speak with regard to Feingold-Webb-Tester amendment No. \n3979, which the Senator from Missouri was addressing. He referred to \nour concern that the rights and privacy of Americans could be affected \nby this bill as a ``tired accusation.'' I object to that \ncharacterization. I think this is clearly the kind of thing we should \nbe worried about. I will tell you what is a tired accusation: the \nnotion that somehow our amendment would affect the ability of the \nGovernment to listen in on Osama bin Laden. That is a tired and false \naccusation. The Senator has said that if bin Laden or his No. 3 man--\nwhoever that is today, because we killed the last No. 3 man--calls \nsomebody in the United States, we cannot listen in to that \ncommunication unless we have an independent means of verifying that it \nhad some impact on threats to our security from a terrorist threat. \nThat is what he claims, that we would not be able to listen in on that \nconversation. That is false.\n  The Feingold-Webb-Tester amendment specifically does not require a \nFISA Court warrant to acquire and disseminate the communications of any \nforeigner overseas who is suspected of terrorism. Mr. President, there \nis no separate threat requirement. The amendment merely requires that \nthe Government label terrorism-related communications that have one end \nin the United States so they are traceable for subsequent oversight. \nAnd it simply requires that when the Government accesses and \ndisseminates terrorist-related communications that it has already \nacquired that the court just be informed with the brief certification. \nI don't know where the Senator gets this bizarre idea that somehow you \ncannot listen in on a conversation of Osama bin Laden. I don't think it \nis credible to anybody that that would be the case.\n  Finally, he raises the concern that somehow we are insulting the FISA \nCourt, saying they are not doing a good job. To the contrary, we are \ntrying to give them the power to enforce their will. We are trying to \ngive them the ability to say: Wait a minute. You guys are not doing \nwhat you said you were going to do. That is not an insult. That is \nessential for the court to be able to do its job. Let's worry less \nabout the alleged and, frankly, false notions about the feelings of a \nsecret court and worry more about the rights and privacy of perfectly \ninnocent Americans.\n  Mr. President, I turn now to amendment No. 3915, another amendment I \noffered known as the use limits amendment. As I explained earlier this \nweek, my amendment simply gives the FISA Court the option of limiting \nthe Government's use of information about information about U.S. \npersons that is collected under procedures the FISA Court later \ndetermines to be illegal. That is about as minimal a safeguard as you \ncan get.\n  It is unfortunate that some of those who oppose my amendment are \nmischaracterizing what it does. The Attorney General and the DNI sent \nthe majority leader a letter yesterday in which they expressed their \nobjections to this amendment. Twice in the letter, they stated that \nthis amendment would place limits on the use of information that \ndoesn't concern U.S. persons. That is flat-out false, Mr. President. \nThe use limits proposed in this amendment specifically apply to \n``information concerning any United States person.'' That is what it \nsays. Use limits in this amendment apply only under those \ncircumstances. There is nothing ambiguous about this language. These \npatently false claims that the amendment applies to information about \nnon-U.S. persons just show the lengths to which opponents of the \namendment will go to generate opposition to this or any other \nreasonable amendment.\n  We have also heard that the amendment would create a massive \noperational burden. Mr. President, that also just isn't true. The \nGovernment already does what is necessary to implement the use limits \nin the amendment.\n  First, declassified Government responses to oversight questions of \nthe Congressional Intelligence Committees reveal that the Government is \nalready labeling communications obtained under the so-called Protect \nAmerica Act. So the Government already tracks which communications are \nacquired under these particular authorities, which would be the first \nstep here.\n  Second, the Government already has to comply with minimization \nrequirements that are supposed to protect information about U.S. \npersons. These requirements kick in whenever the Government wants to \ndisseminate any acquired communications that include information about \nU.S. persons. That means intelligence analysts already have to \ndetermine, before any communications collected under these authorities \ncan be used in any of the contexts we are talking about here, whether \nthey contain any information about U.S. persons. Indeed, the \nadministration constantly reminds us of this fact when claiming that \nminimization requirements do enough to protect Americans.\n  Mr. President, given that the Government is already required and \nequipped to examine any communications it proposes to use in order to \ndetermine whether U.S. person information is present, the argument that \nthe amendment somehow imposes a massive new burden is very difficult to \nunderstand.\n  Perhaps the explanation lies in the administration's repeated \nstatements\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\nthat the amendment would put limits on the use of information about \nnon-U.S. persons. If this were true, then it is conceivable that my \namendment would create an additional operational burden. But those \nstatements are completely and utterly false, as I have explained. The \namendment explicitly states that the use limits apply to ``information \nconcerning any United States person''--information that is already \nsubject to minimization requirements.\n\n  I want to also address the argument the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee made that this amendment is somehow different than the \nexisting use limits for emergency surveillance. The chairman argued \nthat the amendment, unlike the emergency use limits, could affect \n``thousands'' of communications. As I pointed out yesterday, the \namendment addresses that concern by creating a huge exception to the \nuse limitations, an exception that is not present in the emergency use \nlimits provision. Under the amendment, the FISA Court can allow the \nGovernment to use even information about U.S. persons that is obtained \nby unlawful procedures, as long as the Government fixes the problem \nwith the procedures. So, in fact, this amendment is far less \nrestrictive than the use limits for emergency surveillance, despite the \nclaim of the chairman otherwise.\n  Even more important, we have to remember what these thousands of \ncommunications are. The only information that would be subject to use \nlimits is information about U.S. persons collected under illegal \nprocedures--procedures that failed to reasonably target people \noverseas. The underlying bill prohibits the Government from collecting \nthis information in the first place. My amendment gives this \nprohibition some teeth by limiting the use of information that has been \nillegally collected.\n  The opponents of this amendment may argue that the government has no \nintention of doing anything that would be unreasonable under the law. \nMy response is, if it does, there ought to be some enforcement. There \nought to be a way to make sure that doesn't happen, not just the \nassurance of the chairman and vice chairman.\n  Moreover, if the Government has collected thousands of communications \nillegally, isn't that all the more reason to try to contain the damage \nand limit the impact on innocent Americans? That is not hamstringing \nthe Government; it is just requiring the Government to comply with the \nlaw that we are actually passing.\n  My amendment simply provides an incentive for the administration to \nfollow the law as it is written. If we pass a law that has no \nmeaningful consequence for noncompliance with the law, I think we are \ntaking a real gamble as to whether the administration will choose to \ncomply. I am not personally willing to accept the odds on that one.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I \nreserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask my esteemed vice chairman if I \nmight have 6 minutes to oppose Senator Feingold's reverse targeting \namendment No. 3913.\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield that time to the chairman.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from Wisconsin has an amendment that \nrequires a FISA Court order if the Government is conducting \nsurveillance of a person overseas, but a significant purpose of the \nsurveillance is to collect the communications of a person inside the \nUnited States with whom the target is communicating.\n  I share the Senator's goal in protecting the privacy interests of \nAmericans, but I am afraid this amendment, as drafted, is unworkable \nand unnecessary.\n  The amendment is described as a way to prevent reverse targeting--\ncircumstances in which the Government would target persons overseas \nwhen its actual target is a person within the United States with whom \nthe overseas person is communicating.\n  The fact is, reverse targeting is prohibited under FISA today. I \nrepeat, it is prohibited under FISA today. If the person in the United \nStates is the actual foreign intelligence target, the Government must \nseek a FISA order, and, in fact, the Government would have to have \nevery incentive to do so in order to conduct comprehensive surveillance \nof such a person.\n  What is more, the base bill, S. 2248, makes the prohibition on \nreverse targeting explicit. The Government cannot use the authorities \nin this legislation to target a person outside the United States if the \npurpose of such acquisition is to target for surveillance a person \nwithin the United States.\n  In addition, the base bill, the Intelligence Committee bill, also \nstrengthens the protection of U.S. person information that is collected \nin the targeting of foreign targets overseas by requiring that the FISA \nCourt approve the minimization procedures that apply to this collection \nactivity.\n  The Feingold reverse targeting amendment, however, goes too far. The \namendment would prohibit the Government from using the authorities of \nthis act ``if a significant purpose'' of the acquisition is to \n``acquire the communications'' of a particular known person within the \nUnited States. In order to acquire such communications, the Government \nwould be required to seek a regular FISA Court order.\n  The problem is that we are revising the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act today in large measure precisely because we want the \nintelligence community to have the ability to detect and acquire the \ncommunications of terrorists who call into the United States. In other \nwords, in order to detect and prevent terrorist attacks, finding out if \na foreign terrorist overseas is in contact with associates in the \nUnited States is actually a significant purpose of this legislation, \nand it will always be a significant purpose of any targeting of a \nforeign terrorist target overseas by the intelligence community.\n  As the Statement of Administration Policy--that is objections usually \nthat come over from the White House--points out:\n\n       A significant purpose of the intelligence community \n     activities is to detect communications that may provide \n     warning of homeland attacks and that may include \n     communication between a terrorist overseas who places a call \n     to associates within the United States. A provision that bars \n     the intelligence community from collecting those \n     communications is unacceptable.\n\n  Who is to say that person from overseas is not a terrorist and he is \ncontacting a person in the United States to discuss something which is \nnot in the national interest or which has intelligence implications? \nYou cannot in good conscience bar the intelligence community from \ncollecting these communications. That is unacceptable.\n  Again, reverse targeting is prohibited under current law. I think \nthat is the third time I have said that. Reverse targeting is \nprohibited by the committee bill. The amendment is not needed to \nachieve its stated goals. It will harm vital intelligence collection. I \nurge the amendment be defeated.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will speak with regard to amendment \nNo. 3913, the one about which the chairman just spoke, the so-called \nreverse targeting amendment I have offered. Reverse targeting is what \nhappens when the Government wiretaps persons overseas when what they \nare really interested in is the Americans with whom these foreigners \nare talking. I think most of my colleagues would agree that this bill \nshould not open up a backdoor to get around the requirement in FISA for \na warrant to listen in on Americans at home.\n  The lack of any substantive arguments against my amendment is made \nclear by the letter the DNI sent on Tuesday. The arguments just offered \nby the chairman were almost identical to the arguments offered by the \nDNI and by the Attorney General. In fact, that letter, which severely \nmischaracterizes the amendment, actually underscores why the amendment \nis good both for civil liberties and for national security.\n  First, the letter confirms that reverse targeting is not, in fact, \nprohibited by the underlying bill. We keep hearing the chairman and \nvice chairman say it is already prohibited. It is not. The DNI writes \nthat the Intelligence Committee bill only prohibits warrantless \ncollection when the American is ``the actual target.'' That cannot be \nread as a prohibition on reverse\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\ntargeting. That is just a prohibition on direct targeting of an \nAmerican at home, and it does nothing to protect Americans from what \nthe DNI himself has said is unconstitutional.\n  Second, the letter cites ``operational uncertainties and problems,'' \nbut it does not bother to identify what those are. Yes, my amendment \nwould require a new procedure, just like everything else in this bill, \nbut the Government should already have procedures to protect the \nconstitutional rights of Americans. If it does not, that is all the \nmore reason to adopt the amendment.\n  Third, the letter actually makes one of the strongest arguments in \nfavor of my amendment when it warns of insufficient attention to the \nAmerican end of an international terrorist communication. If a foreign \nterrorist is talking to an American inside the United States, the \nintelligence community should get a FISA warrant on that American so it \ncan listen in on all his communications, and it certainly would have no \nproblem getting that warrant. Without that warrant, the Government will \nnever get the full picture of what that American is doing or plotting. \nYet the DNI's letter seems to argue that the Government would not want \nto get a FISA Court warrant to listen in on all the communications, \nincluding the domestic communications, of a terrorist inside the United \nStates. I do not believe this is a serious argument, but if it were, it \nwould suggest that our Government is not doing everything it can do to \ntrack down terrorists.\n  Finally, the letter seriously mischaracterizes the amendment. The \namendment does not bar acquisition of communications between terrorists \noverseas and their associates in the United States. It does not in any \nway affect the Government's ability to discover and collect those \ncommunications. It does not apply to incidental collection of \ncommunications into the United States, and it does not even apply when \nthe Government has identified a known individual with whom the foreign \nterrorist is communicating. Only when a significant purpose of the \nsurveillance is to get information on a person inside the United States \ndoes the Government need to get a court warrant. That is not just \nrequired by the Constitution of the United States, it is how the \nGovernment can most efficiently and effectively protect us.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this modest proposal to prevent \nthese new powers from opening a huge loophole to the requirement in \nFISA that the Government get a court order to target Americans in the \nUnited States.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time on this amendment, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes on amendment No. \n3913.\n  It is interesting to hear that the proponent of this amendment thinks \nthe letter laying out the reasons against the amendment are reasons for \nit. That is a trick I have not learned, to say that when somebody says \nthat the reverse targeting amendment would make it impossible when that \nperson and those people really represent the agency responsible and the \noversight body of the Department of Justice somehow makes their case.\n  I also call the attention of my colleagues to a statement from the \nCivil Liberties and Privacy Office of the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence. In that statement, the Civil Liberties and \nPrivacy Office says:\n\n       Concerns have been raised that the PAA could result in the \n     interception of U.S. person communications. As explained in \n     the Department of Justice September 14 letter, and in a \n     letter by the DNI's Civil Liberties Protection Officer dated \n     September 17, 2007, U.S. persons' privacy interests are \n     protected through ``minimization procedures,'' which must \n     meet FISA's statutory definition. In addition, ``reverse \n     targeting'' is implicitly prohibited under existing law.\n\n  As a side note, Mr. President, this measure explicitly prohibits \nreverse targeting, but the Privacy Office goes on to say:\n\n       The SSCI bill in addition requires review of minimization \n     procedures and explicitly prohibits reverse targeting. In \n     addition, the bill provides the FISA court with ongoing \n     access to compliance reports and information about U.S. \n     person disseminations and communications, and the explicit \n     authority to correct deficiencies in procedures. The bill \n     also requires annual reviews of U.S. person disseminations \n     and communications and extensive reports to Congress.\n\n  This is a clear statutory framework. As a practical matter, if there \nwas a desire to target someone in the United States, if that person was \nthought to have foreign intelligence information and acting as an agent \nof a foreign power, an officer, or employee, a FISA Court order is the \nsimplest way to do it. Nobody has explained how you can target a \nforeign terrorist to get collections on a particular U.S. person unless \nthat person is engaged in a terrorist activity, and you have to target \nan overseas person who has foreign intelligence information, and that \nis the legitimate reason for making the collection against the foreign \ntarget. No terrorist information. The information is minimized and not \nused.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Pending Nominees\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a friend. I have known him for a long \ntime. His name is Steve Walther. Steve Walther was a very prominent \nNevada lawyer, a senior partner in a law firm, with qualifications that \nare unsurpassed. I have always liked Steve very much. And he made a \ncomfortable living. I called him once and said: Steve, have you ever \nconsidered doing something different?\n  A wonderful story about Steve, to show what a tremendously good guy \nhe is. He has a little boy named Wyatt. Steve married a woman and he \nraised their children. They were his children once married, but he had \nnever had his own child. His wife went to the doctor, and she was \nnearing 50 years old and was sick, and found out she was having a baby. \nSo late in life they had this baby, and I will never forget what she \nsaid. She said: When I had my first two babies, time went by so slowly. \nBut she said: Now I am older and understand, and I want everything to \nbe fine, so I can't take enough time to make sure the baby is fine. And \nthe baby is fine.\n  Anyway, I said to Steve: You could afford to come back here. How \nwould you like to be a member of the Federal Election Commission? He is \nnot a Democrat; he is an Independent. He has done things for decades \nwith the American Bar Association, held all kinds of prominent \npositions with the American Bar Association nationally. He said: OK, I \nthink it would be a good idea. Wyatt can come back and spend some time \nin Washington. So he served for nearly two years on the Federal \nElection Commission. Everybody said he was outstanding, as I knew he \nwould be.\n  Also on that Federal Election Commission, prior to the first of the \nyear, was another Democrat by the name of Bob Lenhard. He had served on \nthe FEC with Steve. He and Steve worked well together. They worked well \ntogether with everybody on the Commission, and he and Steve did a good \njob.\n  The Federal Election Commission is critically important because it \nenforces our Nation's campaign finance laws. Both these nominees lost \ntheir jobs at the end of last year because the Republicans refused to \npermit a vote on their nominations to the FEC. They said they would not \nallow an up-or-down vote on these nominations of Lenhard and Walther. \nNothing about their qualifications. They were both outstanding members \nof the Federal Election Commission. The reason they would not allow a \nvote on them is they would not allow a vote on their own nominee, a man \nby the name of Hans von Spakovsky. They are filibustering their own \nnominee.\n  I said: Let's vote on all of the FEC nominees, any order you want. We \nwill vote on ours first, last, we don't care. Let's just have a vote on \nthem. No. Unless we would guarantee von Spakovsky would pass, no. I \ndon't know if Mr. Spakovsky would pass. I suspect the Republicans don't \nthink so. But it seems fair to me that we should have votes on these \nnominees.\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\n  The record over the years is full of remarks by my Republican \ncolleagues characterizing the up-or-down vote as the gold standard of \nreasonableness in Senate process. That is apparently not the view when \nit comes to one of their nominees, who would actually stand a chance of \nlosing a vote. Republicans won't allow a vote on our Democrats unless \nwe approve this person. That doesn't make sense.\n  The reason these FEC nominees, including Steve Walther, have not been \napproved rests squarely with the White House and the Republicans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo editorials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 31, 2008]\n\n                  While the Election Watchdog Wanders\n\n       The presidential campaign's heated fund-raising sweepstakes \n     finds lobbyists hurriedly ``bundling''--amassing additional \n     hundreds of thousands from donors to re-stake surviving \n     contenders for the next primary rounds. (Lobbyists reportedly \n     bundled $300,000 for Senator John McCain in one night in \n     Washington after his stock revived on the campaign trail.)\n       In packaging political influence by superlarge chunks, \n     money bundlers are at least as crucial to understanding where \n     candidates stand as their campaign vows. Fortunately for \n     voters, a new election law mandates the disclosure of the \n     names of lobbyists and other bundlers working the high-roller \n     realm of donations of $15,000 or more. Unfortunately for the \n     same voters, this vital law cannot yet be implemented.\n       A partisan standoff blocks the Senate from filling four \n     existing vacancies on the Federal Election Commission. The \n     six-member panel is powerless to form a quorum and write the \n     regulations needed to shed sunlight on bundling. Senator \n     Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, is refusing \n     to allow individual up-or-down majority votes on nominees for \n     the commission. Mr. McConnell threatens a filibuster unless \n     they are voted on as a single package--an obstructionist \n     tactic to protect a highly unqualified Republican nominee, \n     Hans von Spakovsky, from rejection in a fair vote.\n       Mr. von Spakovsky is a notorious partisan who previously \n     served the Bush administration as an aggressive party hack at \n     the Justice Department. There, he defended G.O.P. stratagems \n     to boost Republican redistricting and mandate photo ID's in \n     Georgia--a device to crimp the power of minorities and the \n     poor who might favor Democrats at the ballot.\n       President Bush refuses to withdraw the von Spakovsky \n     nomination, while the Democrats demand he be considered on \n     his individual record, not yoked to three less controversial \n     nominees. We urge the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, to \n     highlight this blot on democracy by moving the von Spakovsky \n     nomination as a separate measure and demanding a cloture \n     vote. Force the Republicans to either filibuster against \n     their own unqualified partisan or dare to vote for him in \n     broad daylight.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 28, 2008]\n\n                               Up or Down\n\n       ``We need to get him to the floor for an up-or-down vote as \n     soon as possible,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said of \n     Michael B. Mukasey, then the nominee for attorney general. \n     John R. Bolton ``deserves an up-or-down vote so that he can \n     continue to protect our national interests at the U.N.,'' Mr. \n     McConnell said of the nominee to be United Nations \n     ambassador. ``Let's get back to the way the Senate operated \n     for over 200 years, up-or-down votes on the president's \n     nominee, no matter who the president is, no matter who's in \n     control of the Senate,'' he said during the dispute over \n     judicial filibusters.\n       Mr. McConnell's devotion to the principle of up-or-down \n     votes for nominees, it turns out, has limits: Apparently \n     fearing defeat if a simple majority vote were allowed, the \n     minority leader has refused to accept Senate Democrats' offer \n     for such a vote on President Bush's choice for a Republican \n     seat on the Federal Election Commission. The consequence is \n     that, as the country begins an election year, the agency \n     entrusted with overseeing enforcement of the federal election \n     laws is all but paralyzed: Only two commissioners are in \n     place, meaning that the agency, six members when it is at \n     full strength, cannot initiate enforcement actions, \n     promulgate rules or issue advisory opinions.\n       The standoff involves Hans A. von Spakovsky, a former \n     official in the Justice Department's civil rights division \n     who had been serving as an FEC commissioner until his recess \n     appointment expired last month. Democrats and civil rights \n     groups argue, with some justification, that Mr. von \n     Spakovsky's tenure at Justice was so troubling that he does \n     not deserve confirmation to the FEC post. Some Democrats had \n     threatened to filibuster the nomination, but Senate Majority \n     Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) managed to offer an up-or-down \n     vote on each of the four pending nominations to the agency, \n     two Republicans and two Democrats. But Mr. McConnell and \n     fellow Republicans have insisted that the nominees must be \n     dealt with as a package, with no separate votes allowed. To \n     be fair to Mr. McConnell, the practice has been to vote on \n     FEC nominees as a package to ensure that the politically \n     sensitive agency remains evenly divided between the two \n     parties. But that has not been an absolute rule; indeed, the \n     last nominee who generated this much controversy, Republican \n     Bradley A. Smith, had a separate roll call vote and was \n     confirmed 64 to 35 in 2000. But Senate Democrats could commit \n     to a quick vote on a replacement nominee, if they were able \n     to muster the votes to defeat Mr. von Spakovsky.\n       We have suggested previously that it is more important to \n     have a functioning FEC than to keep Mr. von Spakovsky from \n     being confirmed. But Mr. McConnell ought to explain why the \n     up-or-down vote he deemed so critical in the case of Mr. \n     Mukasey, Mr. Bolton or appellate court nominee Miguel A. \n     Estrada is so unacceptable when it comes to Mr. von \n     Spakovsky.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can gather one thing from the President's \nunwillingness to resolve the Federal Election Commission problem. That \nis that they would rather have no election watchdog in place during an \nelection year.\n  The background on the FEC makes the call from Mr. Walther \nparticularly remarkable. Listen to this, now. It even gets better.\n  Steve Walther called to tell me he had been invited to the White \nHouse by the President to push for his nomination. I got calls from \nother people whom I had placed in the works to get approved by the \nSenate. They were all invited to the White House tomorrow morning. All \nnominees that the President has pending were invited to the White \nHouse, Democrats and all. Why? To complain about the Democrats not \napproving them.\n  This leads me to tell you a little experience I have had, and we have \nall had, with this President. The President is in fact hoping to have \nbreakfast with all the nominees, Democrats and Republicans, now pending \nin the Senate, in an effort to force the Senate to confirm all these \npeople. They must live in some alternative universe. I talked yesterday \nabout the Orwellian nature of this White House, and this is it. He has \ninvited people to the White House to complain about our not approving \nthem when they--the President and the White House--are the reason we \nare not approving many of them.\n  He invited Mr. Walther, Mr. Lenhard and other Democratic nominees to \nthe White House, along with all his Republican nominees, to get them to \nbe a backstop, a picture, so he can come out and give one of his \nOrwellian speeches that these people are not being approved because of \nthe terrible Democrats in the Senate. Actually, we are waiting for him \nto allow us to have votes on a number of these nominees.\n  The President's breakfast only needed one attendee. Only one. That is \nbecause only one nominee matters to this President. It should be an \nintimate breakfast between President Bush and a man by the name of \nSteven Bradbury. Why do I say that? I say that because of all the \nnominees the President will profess to care about at this breakfast, \nSteven Bradbury stands head and shoulders above all the others in the \nPresident's esteem. I am not guessing; I was told so by the White \nHouse.\n  Right before the Christmas recess, I called the President's Chief of \nStaff, Mr. Bolten. A wonderful man; I like him; easy to talk to and \neasy to deal with. I said: I tell you what, Josh. We are going to go \ninto recess, and why don't we have an agreement on who the President \nwants to have recess appointed and, in fact, I will give you some \nsuggestions. You can have a member of the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors, you can have a Federal Aviation Agency, and you can have a \ncouple of other Chemical Safety Board members. I said: Not only that, \nthere are 84 other Republican nominees we will approve. There are 8 \nDemocrats, 84 Republicans. Pretty good deal. He said: Let me check.\n  He called me back and he said: Well, what we want is to have a recess \nappointment of Steven Bradbury. I said: Josh, I didn't recall the name. \nLet me check. I checked with Chairman Leahy, I checked with Senator \nDurbin, who is a member of that committee, I checked with Senator \nSchumer, who is on that committee, and they and others said: You have \nto be kidding. This is a man who has written memos approving torture, \nand that is only the beginning.\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\n  Senator Durbin--I don't know if he has time today--will lay that out \nin more detail.\n  I called Josh back and I said: Josh, that man will never get \napproved. He has no credibility. He said: Well, let me check with the \nPresident. He called back and said: It is Bradbury or nobody. I said: \nYou are willing to not allow 84 of your people to get approved because \nof this guy? He said: Yes, that is what the President wants.\n  Now there are 84 nominees, and among them somebody Secretary Chertoff \nwanted badly. Secretary Chertoff called me personally on someone and he \nsaid: You have to give us this person. We have important things to do \nhere. If I don't get her, they will send me somebody from OMB, and that \nwill be a person who doesn't know anything from anything. You have to \nhelp me with this.\n  The head of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, four Department of Defense \nassistant secretaries, the Deputy Director of the National Drug Control \nPolicy, the Director of the Violence Against Women's Office, Assistant \nAttorney General, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, \nDirector of the Census, Solicitor for the Department of Labor--these \nare only a handful of the jobs of the 84.\n  Now, these jobs, all Republicans, all names given up to us by the \nPresident, are jobs these people have sought for their whole lives. \nHead of the Census, head of the National Drug Control Policy, Director \nof Violence Against Women's Office, Solicitor for the Department of \nLabor. Nope, they are not going to have a job.\n  I thought about that. That was a decision the President made, willing \nto throw 84 people under the bus, run over them, for one person he knew \nhe couldn't get. That is 84 plus the 4 he could recess appoint. So what \nwe did, we stayed in session during the entire holiday recess. But \nbefore we went out, I thought to myself, I don't know these 84 people. \nSome of them I have met, but these are jobs that are important to our \ncountry, jobs that are important to these individuals and their \nfamilies. I made the decision that because the President is willing to \ndo what I think is so unfair, so unreasonable, that doesn't mean I am \ngoing to be unfair and unreasonable. So I called Secretary Chertoff and \nothers and said: Just because your boss is unreasonable and unfair, I \nam not going to be that way. So I am going to walk out on the floor and \napprove every one of them, which we did. So for him to have that \nmeeting tomorrow takes about as much gall as I can even imagine, to \nhave a meeting where he brings in all the people who have not been \napproved. And had I not been, in my own words, generous, he would have \nhad 84 more people he would have had to invite down there.\n  I can't imagine how he could invite Democrats down to the White \nHouse. Several of them are being blocked in this body by Republicans. \nSame goes for a number of Republican nominees. Democrats are willing to \napprove them and Republicans stand in the way. Why would he invite them \ndown there also? But he did, because there is an Orwellian thought \nprocess that goes on down there saying Democrats aren't allowing these \npeople to get approved, which is the direct opposite of the truth.\n  All for one person it appears, Mr. Bradbury. Whatever the White House \nwants, Bradbury would give it to them in a legal opinion. We are not \ngoing to accept that. What the President is trying to do with this show \ntomorrow is so unreasonable, so unfair, and so out of step with \nreality--as is the budget he gave us on Monday--that I hope the \nAmerican people understand what is going on in this country.\n  It is too bad we have a situation where the President of the United \nStates would have a meeting in the White House and invite everybody to \nsay: I am sorry you are not going to be approved, it is their fault, \nwhen the truth is, it is his fault.\n  Now, here are the people we confirmed. They are right here. Everybody \ncan see them. We confirmed all of them. And had it been up to the \nPresident, not a single one would have been confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am glad the majority leader has come to \nspeak about this issue. It is hard to imagine what is going through the \nmind of the President that he believes he can make an argument tomorrow \nwith the meeting at the White House, that we have been unreasonable in \ndealing with his nominations.\n  Senator Reid spelled out what happened. We tried, in many ways, to \nget some balance in nominations. That is done all the time so \nRepublicans and Democrats will be appointed. It is done by both \nparties. I have seen it in the years I have been around the Senate. \nWhen Senator Reid made that offer in December, the White House said: \nNo, they would not do it unless they could have this one nomination, \nMr. Bradbury. And I will have to say I think Senator Reid went that \nextra mile, an extra 84 miles, as a matter of fact, and he basically \nsaid 84 of those Bush nominees would be confirmed.\n  The majority leader recounted several phone calls he received this \nweek from Democratic nominees to bipartisan commissions. I heard from \nmy friend, Tom Carper, not the Senator from Delaware but a friend of \nmine from McComb, IL, who has been nominated to serve on the board of \ndirectors of Amtrak.\n  Tom has been working on passenger rail issues for 20 years, 12 years \nas mayor of the city of McComb, IL, which is served by Amtrak. As \nmayor, he served as the chairman of the Amtrak Mayor's Advisory \nCouncil. He received national recognition for his leadership on Amtrak \nissues.\n  He saw firsthand the enormous potential that passenger rail service \ncan have for towns, such as McComb, small towns that might be \noverlooked otherwise. He helped to make the potential of Amtrak service \na reality. We have such a success story of Amtrak in Illinois in the \nlast year or two, with dramatic increases in ridership. Tom saw this \ncoming and was a real leader. He convinced the State of Illinois to \ndouble its State investment in Amtrak. He worked with a broad coalition \nof passenger, business, labor groups, and elected officials to increase \nAmtrak service across our State.\n  We are experiencing a renaissance in terms of passenger rail in our \nState in a short period of time. Senator Reid was given an opportunity \nto fill a vacancy on the Amtrak board. I asked him to consider former \nMayor Tom Carper of McComb, IL. He was kind enough to recommend him. \nThere are seven voting members on the Amtrak bipartisan board--three \nRepublicans, three Democrats, and the Secretary of Transportation. \nCurrently, there are four vacancies on the board, which means the board \ndoes not have enough members for a quorum, and it forces the board to \nconduct business via an ``Executive committee.''\n  On our last day of session in December, Senator Reid, I think through \ngreat effort and courtesy, rose above the President's refusal to \ncooperate on nominations and worked to confirm more than 80 nominations \nin a single day. But we could have--and should have--confirmed at least \ntwo more. Senator Reid and I worked together and offered to confirm two \nnominees to the Amtrak board--one Democrat, Tom Carper, and one \nRepublican, both of whom had been favorably reported by the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  The Republicans objected. They insisted that we confirm one Democrat \nand two Republicans or none at all. Now, this ``all-or-nothing'' \napproach is not new. We have seen this before when it comes to \nnominations.\n  As the majority leader described, I think the most glaring example of \nthis is the nomination of Steven Bradbury to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral. The majority leader was willing to allow additional \nconfirmations--and even recess appointments--for a number of \nnominations.\n  I can tell you, having dealt with Senator Reid, he bends over \nbackward to be balanced in this approach. That is the way it has to be \nin the Senate. That is the way the institution operates. But the White \nHouse turned down his offer. They turned down his offer because of one \nnomination, the nomination of Steven Bradbury.\n  It was clear this request, Mr. Bradbury, was going to be rejected. \nMr. Bradbury's nomination has been returned to the White House four \ntimes since he was first nominated for the job in June 2005. What part \nof ``no'' does the White House fail to understand?\n  Why does the President care so much about this one nominee that he is \nwilling to sacrifice all these other nominees? He is going to fill the \nWhite\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nHouse with people who are going to have this fine White House china in \nfront of them, sipping coffee and tea and eating little cookies and \ncomplaining that somehow or another the Democrats in the Senate are \nignoring their need to serve our Government.\n  We are not ignoring it. Senator Reid has offered repeatedly to \nconfirm these nominees on a balanced basis, even giving the President \n84 nominees without this balance. They have said: No deal unless we get \nSteven Bradbury. He is the only appointment, clearly, who is important \nto this administration. Why? What is it about this man? What would \npossibly be in his background or his potential for future service that \nwould be so important?\n  Well, this is worth talking about for a minute. Steven Bradbury is \nthe head of the Office of Legal Counsel, also known as OLC. OLC is a \nsmall office and most people have never heard of it, but it has a great \ndeal of power, especially in this administration. The Office of Legal \nCounsel issues legal opinions that are binding on the executive branch \nof Government.\n  In the Bush administration, OLC has become a rubberstamp for torture \npolicies that are inconsistent with American values and laws. In August \nof 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel issued the infamous torture memo. \nThis memo sought to redefine torture, narrowing it to a limited \nsituation of abuse that causes pain equivalent to organ failure or \ndeath. These words meant the United States was preparing to abandon \ngenerations of commitment to outlawing and prohibiting torture. This \nmemo also concluded the President has the right to ignore the torture \nstatute, which makes torture a crime. This memo was official Bush \nadministration policy for years, until it was finally leaked to the \nmedia, and the administration was forced to repudiate it.\n\n  Jay Bybee, who was then the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, \nsigned that memo. Unfortunately, Mr. Bybee was confirmed to a lifetime \nappointment on the Federal bench in the Ninth Circuit before Congress \nand the American people learned about his complicity in the creation of \nthis infamous torture memo, a memo that was repudiated by the Bush \nadministration once it became public.\n  Jack Goldsmith succeeded Jay Bybee as head of the Office of Legal \nCounsel. Mr. Goldsmith is a very conservative Republican, but even he \nwas disturbed when he heard what was happening at the Office of Legal \nCounsel.\n  As head of that office, he revoked the misguided OLC opinions dealing \nwith warrantless surveillance and torture. He decided those opinions \nwent too far.\n  Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey supported Mr. Goldsmith's actions. \nLet me say a word about Mr. Comey. My colleague and friend for years, \nSenator Schumer, first told me about Jim Comey when he was chosen to be \nthe Deputy Attorney General under Attorney General Ashcroft. Senator \nSchumer told me Jim Comey was a straight shooter, an honest man who \nwould not compromise his principles in public service. He said I could \ntrust Jim Comey. During the period Jim Comey served in our Government, \nChuck Schumer was right. Jim Comey enjoys that reputation because he \nearned it.\n  We now know what happened because it has come to light that there was \nan infamous showdown at the bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft, \nwho was hospitalized in an intensive care unit, where White House Chief \nof Staff Andrew Card and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales tried \nto pressure a then-ailing John Ashcroft into overruling Jack Goldsmith \nand his acts in the Office of Legal Counsel. It is hard to imagine that \nthey would go into a hospital wing, with the acting Attorney General \nand with the President's Chief of Staff, to a man in an intensive care \nunit and try to persuade him to sign a document to overrule Jack \nGoldsmith.\n  Fortunately, Attorney General John Ashcroft, to his credit, refused. \nWhen Jack Goldsmith finally left the Justice Department, the \nadministration realized they did not need any more trouble from the \nOffice of Legal Counsel, they needed someone in that office who would \nnot rock the boat, would not question their opinions, someone who would \nrubberstamp their policies.\n  So, in June 2005, President Bush nominated Steven Bradbury to succeed \nJack Goldsmith--Steven Bradbury, the person who has now become the \ncenterpiece of the entire appointment agenda of the Bush \nadministration. Although Mr. Bradbury has never been confirmed in this \nposition, he has effectively been head of OLC for 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  In 2005, Mr. Bradbury reportedly signed two OLC legal opinions \napproving the legality of abusive interrogation techniques. One \nopinion, on so-called ``combined effects,'' authorized the CIA to use \nmultiple abusive interrogation techniques in combination.\n  According to the New York Times, then-Attorney General Alberto \nGonzales approved this opinion of Mr. Bradbury over the objections of \nthen Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey, who said the Justice Department \nwould be ashamed if the memo became public.\n  Mr. Bradbury also authored and Alberto Gonzales approved another \nOffice of Legal Counsel opinion, concluding that abusive interrogation \ntechniques, such as waterboarding, do not constitute cruel, inhumane or \ndegrading treatment. This opinion was apparently designed to circumvent \nthe McCain torture amendment. I was proud to cosponsor John McCain's \ntorture amendment. We are in the midst of a Presidential campaign, and \nI suppose you have to be careful as a Democrat saying anything positive \nabout a man who may be the Republican nominee.\n  But I could not think of another Senator who could speak with more \nauthority on interrogation and torture than John McCain, who spent over \n5 years in a Vietnam prison camp. He came to this floor and made an \nimpassioned plea for us to make it clear that torture would not be part \nof American policy.\n  In the end, he won that amendment by a vote of 90 to 9, an amendment \nwhich absolutely prohibits cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. \nSteven Bradbury, now infamous for his role in memo after memo relating \nto torture, felt he found a way, through an opinion, for the \nadministration to avoid the impact of the law the President signed, the \nMcCain torture amendment.\n  That is what this is about. This is not a casual situation where I \nfind Mr. Bradbury personally offensive. We are going to the heart of a \nquestion as to whether this man can serve this country in this critical \nposition in the White House based on what we have seen over and over \nagain: his complicity in some of the most embarrassing chapters in this \nadministration, including some that have been publicly repudiated.\n  Last fall, while the Senate was considering the nomination of Judge \nMichael Mukasey to be Attorney General, the judge pledged to me in \nwriting that he would personally review all of the Office of Legal \nCounsel's opinions dealing with torture. He said he would determine \nwhether each of these opinions can be provided to Congress and whether \nhe agreed with the legal conclusions of each of these opinions. This \npromise made by Attorney General Mukasey to me, to the Judiciary \nCommittee, and to the Senate is a matter of public record.\n  Last week, Attorney General Mukasey appeared before the same \nJudiciary Committee for the first time since he was confirmed. I asked \nhim point-blank whether, as he had promised, he had reviewed all of the \nOLC torture opinions. I specifically asked him about Steven Bradbury's \n``combined effects'' opinion, which Jim Comey said would shame the \nJustice Department if it became public. Sadly, the Attorney General \nsaid he had not reviewed those opinions. He realized that he had made a \npromise to me that he would, and we left it at that. He did acknowledge \nin the course of his testimony how much he respected Jim Comey, how he \nhad turned to him for advice and believed he was an honorable man. I \nfeel the same. I trust that Attorney General Mukasey is also an \nhonorable man who will keep his word.\n  In the meantime, while all of this continues, Steven Bradbury remains \nas the effective head of the Office of Legal Counsel, even though it \nhas been 2\\1/2\\ years since he was nominated and he has never been \nconfirmed. Legislation known as the Vacancies Reform Act prohibits a \nnominee from serving for this long without confirmation. It makes a \nmockery of the confirmation process that Mr. Bradbury assumes a role he \nhas never been given under the law. Apparently, he is so important to\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\nthe Bush administration, they are willing to violate this law to keep \nhim in his position, and they are prepared to toss overboard scores of \nnominations which could be approved by this bipartisan Senate if they \nwould only relent on this nominee, who is obviously not going to be \napproved. The fact that Mr. Bradbury continues to serve as the \neffective head of the Office of Legal Counsel appears to be an attempt \nto circumvent the confirmation process in order to install this \ncontroversial nominee in a key Justice Department post in the closing \ndays of this administration.\n  Ironically, the Vacancies Reform Act to which I referred was passed \nby the Republican-controlled Congress in 1998 to limit the ability of \nthen-President Clinton's nominees to continue to serve in an acting \ncapacity. The legislation was specifically targeted at Bill Lann Lee, \nthe first-ever Asian-American head of the Civil Rights Division. \nApparently, the Bush administration is ignoring the very law which a \nRepublican Congress passed to make it clear that the President does not \nhave the authority to appoint people like Steven Bradbury in an acting \ncapacity without confirmation.\n  Why has Mr. Bradbury not been confirmed? For years, the Justice \nDepartment has refused to provide Congress with copies of the opinions \nMr. Bradbury authored on torture. Mr. Bradbury has refused to answer \nstraightforward questions from myself and other members the Judiciary \nCommittee regarding his role in this.\n  Here is what I said in November 2005 about Mr. Bradbury's nomination:\n\n       Since the Justice Department refuses to provide us with OLC \n     opinions on interrogation techniques, we do not know enough \n     about where Mr. Bradbury stands on the issue of torture. What \n     we do know is troubling. Mr. Bradbury refuses to repudiate \n     un-American and inhumane tactics such as waterboarding.\n\n  As I have said before, I believe that at the end of the day, when the \nhistory is written of this era, there will be chapters that will not be \nfriendly to this administration.\n  In past wars, Presidents of both political parties have been guilty \nof excessive conduct, in their own view, as part of national security. \nOne can remember the suspension of habeas corpus by President Lincoln \nduring the Civil War, the Alien and Sedition Act of World War I, and \nthe Japanese internment camps of World War II. All of these examples, \nas we reflect on them in history, do not reflect well on this country. \nDecisions were made which many wish could be undone. The same is likely \nto be true when it comes to the issue of torture and the war on \nterrorism under the Bush administration; this issue of warrantless \nsurveillance, where for years, literally, this administration went \nbeyond the law and attempted to intercept communications when they \ncould have come to Congress and received bipartisan support for an \napproach which would have kept America and our Constitution safe.\n  Yesterday, we learned why Steven Bradbury is so important to the \nWhite House. We also learned why he refuses to condemn waterboarding. \nIt was Super Tuesday, so a lot of political minds were focused on other \nplaces and other things. Unfortunately, it didn't get a lot of \nattention, but every American should know what happened yesterday on \nCapitol Hill.\n  In testimony before the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, CIA \nDirector Michael Hayden acknowledged that the United States of America \nhas used waterboarding, a form of torture, on three detainees. \nWaterboarding, or simulated drowning, is a torture technique that has \nbeen used since at least the Spanish Inquisition. It has been used by \nrepressive regimes around the world.\n  Every year, the State Department issues a report card on human rights \nin which we are critical of other countries that engage in what we \nconsider to be basic violations of human rights. Included in those \nbasic violations is torture of prisoners. Included in that torture is \nwaterboarding. So once a year we stand in judgment of the world and \ncondemn them for engaging in waterboarding and torture techniques on \ntheir prisoners. Yet it is clear from the testimony yesterday of \nGeneral Hayden that we have engaged in some of those techniques.\n  Following World War II, the United States prosecuted Japanese \nmilitary personnel as war criminals for waterboarding American \nservicemen. The Judge Advocate Generals, the highest ranking military \nlawyers in each of the U.S. military's four branches, have stated \npublicly and unequivocally that waterboarding is illegal.\n  Now the United States of America has acknowledged engaging in conduct \nthat we once prosecuted as a war crime. This is unacceptable.\n  Yesterday, I sent the Attorney General a letter. I wanted to spell \nout clearly for him, so there is no misunderstanding, why it is \nimportant that he respond to several requests which I have made for \ninformation. At the heart of it is a good man, a judge named Mark \nFilip, who serves in the Northern District of Illinois, a man whom I \nsupported for his confirmation as a Federal judge and who has received \npositive reviews for his service on the bench.\n  Attorney General Mukasey would like Judge Filip to be his Deputy \nAttorney General. That is a good choice. But I have said to the \nAttorney General, there is only one thing between my enthusiastic vote \nfor Mark Filip and his remaining on the calendar: The Attorney General \nhas to respond to inquiries I have made, some of which were made months \nago, on this critical issue of torture. I wanted to make certain that \nthere was real clarity in my request. So I sent a letter to the \nAttorney General yesterday and said: Here is exactly what I am looking \nfor, the letters we have sent, the questions we have asked, and I want \nyou to respond to them. I hope I receive that response by the end of \nthe day. If I receive that response and it is a good-faith response, \neven if I disagree with it, if it is a good-faith response, then Judge \nFilip can move forward. I hope he will. It is now in the hands of \nAttorney General Mukasey.\n  Let me highlight two of the questions I am asking: First, does \nAttorney General Mukasey agree with the legal conclusions of the Office \nof Legal Counsel torture memos written by Steven Bradbury, that Jim \nComey believes the Justice Department would be ashamed of if they were \nmade public? Second, will the Justice Department investigate the \nadministration's use of waterboarding to determine whether any laws \nwere violated? I didn't call for prosecution but simply for an honest \ninvestigation.\n  I recognize the Bush administration wants to confirm Steven Bradbury, \nto ensure they have a firewall to protect their torture policies. But \nwhat is at stake here is more important than this one nominee. This is \nabout who we are as a country. This is about the United States, our \nvalues, our standards of conduct. This is about whether the United \nStates can, with a straight face, be critical of regimes and countries \naround the world that engage in abusive interrogation techniques. This \nis about whether we protect American soldiers and American citizens \nfrom torture by unequivocally condemning those forms of interrogation. \nThe United States cannot be a country that defends a practice which the \ncivilized world has considered torture for over five centuries.\n  Democrats are willing to work with the President, in a bipartisan \nmanner, to confirm nominations. But the President's response to the \nmajority leader's work in confirming more than 80 nominations in \nDecember by renominating Steven Bradbury last month is not encouraging. \nIf the President truly wants to confirm his nominations, he should not \nbe pouring coffee and tea at the White House.\n  He ought to have his Chief of Staff, Mr. Bolten, pick up the phone \nand say: Let's get down to business. There are important Democrats and \nRepublicans who can be appointed tomorrow if the President will \nunderstand that the entire fate and future of his administration should \nnot hang on this one nominee, Steven Bradbury, who has been implicated \nin some of the most questionable practices of this administration. I \nhope the President and his Chief of Staff, after they have had their \ncoffee with these potential nominees, will pick up the phone and work \nwith us for the right result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts on \nthe FISA legislation. It is critically important, and we need to pass \nthe Intelligence Committee bill.\n  I will first say, in response to my able colleague from Illinois, \nthat General Hayden's comments in which he indicated three people had \nbeen subjected to waterboard torture are something we ought to think \nabout. First, I am glad, as he said and has been repeated, \nwaterboarding was only used three times early on after 9/11 against \nsome of the most dangerous people we have ever dealt with.\n  As a result of the debate and discussion about that, we had an \namendment on the floor of the Senate, which Senator Kennedy offered to \nthe Military Commissions Act in 2006, to prohibit waterboarding. It \nfailed 46 to 53. We have a statute that does prohibit torture--Congress \npassed it overwhelmingly and it was supported by Senators Kennedy, \nLeahy, Biden, and others--that defined torture as infliction of severe \nphysical or mental pain or suffering. I am glad we are no longer \nutilizing waterboarding. I hope we never have to do it again.\n  I just want to say to my colleagues, be careful how you portray the \nUnited States around the world.\n  Mr. Goldsmith, who has been quoted here and previously testified \nbefore our committee, has written a book. He said this war on terror \nhas been the most lawyered war in the history of the Republic. Lawyers \nhave been involved in everything. Great care has been given to ensure \nthe law was followed. To compare waterboarding of 3 individuals to what \nwas done to American prisoners by the Japanese in World War II is just \nunthinkable. To date, not a single prisoner whom we have captured in \nthe War on Terror has died, to my knowledge, in American custody--maybe \nor one or two from some disease, but certainly not from abuse.\n  I just finished reading the book ``Hells Guest'' by Mr. Glenn Frazier \nfrom Alabama, a Bataan Death March survivor. About 90 percent of those \nprisoners died. They starved to death. They were beaten on a regular \nbasis and abused in the most horrible way.\n  To even compare what was done to American soldiers wearing a uniform \nlawfully being a combatant to what has been done to a few people \nwithout any physical or permanent injuries is not fair. It is part of a \nrhetoric designed for political consumption at home that has \nembarrassed our country around the world and led decent people around \nthe world to believe our military is out of control and we are \nsystematically abusing and torturing prisoners when it is not so. We \nought to be ashamed of ourselves to go on again and again about it.\n  We continue to be confused. Our country faces very real dangers. \nTerrorists are determined to damage this country. It is not just talk. \nWe know it is true. They have done it before. They have attacked us \naround the world. They attacked us repeatedly before 9/11, and they \ndesire to destroy our country.\n  Our administration made a decision after 9/11 that we could not treat \nthese kinds of military attacks, designed to destroy our country by \norganized foreign forces, as normal law enforcement. I was a former \nFederal prosecutor. In a criminal prosecution, you try to catch people \nafter they have committed the crime. But these acts are so horrible \nthat the nature of them is such that they are acts of warfare and not \ncrimes, and they need to be treated in that fashion. We remain somewhat \nconfused about it. So the old policy meant you would investigate after \nthe crime was committed. It was basically a stated or implicit policy \nof the Clinton administration. We cannot return to that kind of \nstrategy.\n  One of the most important legal powers and authorities we have to \ndefend America is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It has \nplayed a key role in preventing subsequent attacks on U.S. soil for the \nlast 6 years. We are dealing with very real, very imminent threats, and \nwe must continue to assist the fabulous military and intelligence \npersonnel who are working this very moment long hours to protect our \nNation.\n  I have visited our National Security Agency and met with the people \nwho gather the intelligence under this act. They love America. These \nare not people who are trying to harm our country and deny us our \nliberties. They are sterling individuals who carefully follow the rules \nwe give them. They follow the rules. They say they cannot continue \neffectively to do their job unless we pass this legislation. They \ncannot continue to do what they need to do.\n  The terrorists waging war against our country do not fight according \nto the rules of warfare, international law, moral standards, or basic \nhumanity. They have even, in recent days, apparently used mentally ill \nwomen as suicide bombers, setting off bombs that have resulted in the \ndeaths of other people, as well as the poor people who had the bombs \nstrapped to them.\n  So, historically, we have provided the protections of the Geneva \nConventions only to those whose conduct falls within the rules of war, \nthose who fight under a flag of a nation, who wear uniforms against \nother organized military units. However, under a twisted rationale, \npredicated on the belief by some that we are not fighting a real war, \nwe have given more rights to these individuals, who flatly reject any \nrule of war, than we have provided to legitimate prisoners of war who \nhave followed the rules of war. We have done that in a number of \ndifferent instances--it is sort of amazing to me--including providing \nthem with habeas corpus relief to go to Federal court. These are not \ntraditional prisoners of war, but prisoners who are unlawful enemy \ncombatants. So we have endangered, sometimes I really believe, not only \nour troops, who put themselves in harm's way--and are in harm's way \nright now--to carry out the policies we gave them, but innocent \nAmericans here at home.\n  We have to keep this threat in the forefront of our minds. These are \nindividuals dead set on the destruction of our country at any cost. \nThere is nothing they will not do.\n  Let me state that the FISA law should be made permanent. It should \nnot merely be extended with another sunset provision. It is a \nfallacious argument to claim we cannot revisit a law unless there is \nsome sunset when it ends. As Members of this Congress, it is incumbent \nupon us to continually review legislation we pass to ensure that the \nlaws are accomplishing the goals set forth and that no unintended \nconsequences occur. There is no sound reason to pass critical \nlegislation such as the Protect America Act and slap an expiration date \non it.\n  Fighting the war on terror is a long-term enterprise that requires \nlong-term institutional changes. As the Vice President said in a recent \nspeech:\n\n       The challenge to the country has not expired over the last \n     six months. It won't expire any time soon, and we should not \n     write laws that pretend otherwise.\n\n  The Intelligence Committee bill is a collaborative, bipartisan \ncompromise that was crafted in consultation with members of the \nIntelligence Committee, the Director of National Intelligence, the \nDepartment of Justice, and the intelligence community after months of \nnegotiation and review of highly sensitive information, most of which \nwas classified, secret, about the current surveillance procedures and \nhow they were being used by the Government to obtain critical national \nsecurity information. We cannot overstress that the committee most \nintimately involved with this process and the electronic measures being \nutilized voted their bill out by an overwhelmingly bipartisan 13-to-2 \nvote.\n  Remember, it has been over 6 years 4 months since the terrible \nattacks of September 11, and we may be most thankful that not one \nattack has been carried out on our soil since that day. As we move \nfurther from that dreadful day, I fear our memories have begun to fade. \nOtherwise, there is no sound justification for doing anything other \nthan reauthorizing the Protect America Act, which would allow the \nintelligence community to simply continue, uninterrupted, their work \nwhich has been protecting this Nation and can continue to protect it in \nthe future.\n  After the intelligence Committee passed a bill, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, of which I am a member, got involved and produced a partisan \nbill. We already voted to table the partisan Judiciary substitute, and \nwe debating the bipartisan Intelligence Committee bill. Let me point \nout, however, something that happened in the Judiciary Committee. The \nbill produced by\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\nthe committee was given very little process during one committee \nmeeting where 10 Democratic amendments were accepted along a strict \nparty-line vote, and the bill itself, ultimately, was voted out with \nonly Democratic support. No Republican voted for it. It was a purely \npartisan bill.\n\n  Strikingly, the one vote that garnered bipartisan consideration was \nagainst an amendment that was offered by Senator Feingold to strip the \nretroactive liability protections found in section 2 of the \nIntelligence bill.\n  We had a discussion and vote on whether the liability protections to \nkeep the companies that helped us and responded to Government \nrequests--whether they should be sued for doing so--should be stripped \nfrom the bill. We voted in the Judiciary Committee, 12 to 7, to follow \nthe recommendation of the Intelligence Committee bill that they passed \n13 to 2, and keep the limited liability protections. So it was a 12-to-\n7 vote to defeat the Feingold amendment that would have removed those \nliability protections.\n  Directly after that vote, however--it was curious how it all \nhappened--but directly after that vote, Chairman Leahy moved to report \nonly Title I of the Judiciary substitute bill out of Committee. When \nthat passed, that effectively stripped the liability protection \nprovisions the committee had just voted to keep.\n  The point is that the Democratic-controlled Judiciary Committee, when \nvoting directly on removing retroactive liability, voted 12 to 7 to \nkeep it. But by the time we passed out the Judiciary Committee's \nversion of the bill, we had taken it out. I'm not sure people fully \nunderstand how that occurred, but it certainly was an odd thing that it \npassed out of committee without liability protection, when we \nspecifically voted to keep that language in the overall bill.\n  Now, the main area of disagreement is over this important question \nthat will be coming up, I understand, in the amendment offered by \nSenator Dodd, amendment No. 3907--and a Specter-Whitehouse amendment \nthat will allow substitution--which will, in effect, allow litigation \nto continue against telecom companies that responded to the requests of \nthe Attorney General of the United States, certified by the President. \nSo our disagreement is whether we should provide these good corporate \ncitizens who cooperated with a formal written request by the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, certified by the duly-elected President \nof the United States, to provide information for a surveillance program \nimplemented shortly after the attacks on September 11--and at that \npoint in time, we did not know how many terrorist cells there were in \nthe country and what plans they may have had.\n  Now, the nature of the program is highly classified, but after an \nuproar of complaints, the procedures were studied carefully by \nCongress, and we reacted by giving approval to the program in passing \nthe Protect America Act overwhelmingly last August. I did not want to \nbe too lighthearted about it, but I remember all the brouhaha that this \nprogram was somehow wrong and had to be eliminated, and people made all \nthese unsubstantiated allegations. But after we went in great depth, we \nfound, as Mr. Goldsmith said, that the lawyers have been on top of this \nsince day one. It was a carefully constructed program. A court opinion \nissues last spring caused us to not be able to continue the way it was \nbeing done, and the Intelligence community asked us for legislation so \nit could continue. The Congress passed the Protect America Act this \nsummer, but it was a short-term bill that lasted only 6 months.\n  All I would want to say is, nobody apologized to President Bush or \nthe Attorney General of the United States or the people at the National \nSecurity Agency for all the bad things they said about them. After \nhaving studied what they did, we concluded it is constitutional and \nlegal and proper and necessary, and we actually passed a law to \nauthorize it to continue.\n  But still, there have been over 30 lawsuits now filed against telecom \nproviders for their alleged participation in the terrorist surveillance \nprogram--30 lawsuits. Analysis of these lawsuits leads only to the \nconclusion that the plaintiffs are substituting speculation and a \nfevered brow for fact and are ignoring the dangerous consequences these \nlawsuits can have on our national security.\n  I do not know who is actually filing these lawsuits. I will just say \nthis, parenthetically: Last October, before the last election, Lancet \nmagazine produced a report--a medical magazine in England--that said \n500,000 to 700,000 Iraqis were killed by the American military in Iraq. \nAnd ABC, CBS, and our Democratic colleagues all raised cane that, \nunbelievably, we would kill this many people. After the election was \nover--and by the way, the guy who wrote the report said he wanted to be \nsure it came out before the election--we learned some things about it.\n  In a fabulous article in the National Journal, an unbiased magazine, \nthey detailed the fraudulence of that article, and pointed out that \neven an antiwar group said, at most, it was 50,000, not 500,000 or \n700,000. And where did they find out the money for the Lancet article \ncame from? George Soros, and the MoveOn.Org crowd. The ``blame America \nfirst'' crowd. Well, I don't know who is actually funding these \nlawsuits. We ought to ask some questions about it. Certainly there is \nno indication that anybody's liberties have been impacted adversely.\n\n  If these suits are allowed to continue, we face a number of problems. \nThe sources and methods relied on by our intelligence community to \nconduct surveillance are highly classified, and if these lawsuits are \nallowed to proceed, even allowing for the Government to be substituted \nfor the telecom companies, we run the risk of exposing the things our \nenemies really want: classified national security information. Make no \nmistake, if forced to defend themselves against lawsuits brought about \nbecause they cooperated with a government request certified to be \nlegal, companies will certainly hesitate or refuse outright to \ncooperate in the future. Even where substitution by the Government is \nan option, we would be putting national security decisions in the hands \nof corporate counsels in the future whose duties--and their first \nresponsibilities--extend to the stockholders of their company, and not \nthe national security.\n  If we ask a company to help us, do we want all the lawyers in that \ncompany to say: Wait a minute. The last time we worked with you \ngovernment we got sued, and we are going to review all of this because \nsome court may hold this--or George Soros may fund some lawsuit and tie \nus up in court. We don't think we want to help. I think they would \nnaturally take that tack in the future to resist cooperation.\n  During floor debate in December, the distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, our Democratic colleague Senator Rockefeller, \nsaid this. This is what he said about the matter:\n\n       Our collective judgment--\n\n  and he is talking about the Intel Committee members--\n\n       Our collective judgment on the Intelligence Committee is \n     that the burden of the debate about the President's authority \n     should not fall on the telecommunications companies--\n\n  In other words, the debate about whether the President had authority \nto do this shouldn't fall on the telecommunications counsels--\n\n     because they responded to the representations by Government \n     officials at the highest levels that the program had been \n     authorized by the President and determined to be lawful and \n     received requests, compulsions to carry it out. Companies \n     participated at great risk of exposure and financial ruin for \n     one reason, and one reason only: in order to help identify \n     terrorists and prevent follow-on terrorist attacks. They \n     should not be penalized for their willingness to heed the \n     call during a time of national emergency.\n\n  Senator Rockefeller said that.\n  The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee who favors substitution \nhas stated this, flat out:\n\n       The telephone companies have acted as good citizens.\n\n  Certainly they have. In many instances, the Government must seek \nassistance from the private sector and private individuals to help \nprotect our national security and even local security in our \ncommunities. In order for this practice to continue, we must allow them \nto rely on assurances that the assistance they provide is not only \nlegal but essential to protect our national security without fear that \nthey will have their names dragged through\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\nthe mud by protracted litigation initiated by the ``blame America \nfirst'' crowd which subscribes to wild theories about Government \nconspiracies to deny people their liberty. They are forgetting the \nsafety of America, and they are ignoring sound legal precedent.\n  Some in this body sincerely believe that liability protection is not \nneeded if these companies did nothing wrong, they say. Well, this is \nfaulty reasoning since either allowing the lawsuits to proceed or \nsubstituting the Government will still force them to be a party to \nlawsuits that run the risk of exposing national security information or \ndoing irreversible financial and reputational damage to companies \ninnocent of any wrongdoing. We are putting these companies in harm's \nway when they, bound by a sense of patriotism and civic responsibility, \nparticipate in a government program that was certified to be legal by \nthe Attorney General of the United States and the President of the \nUnited States.\n  If the Government is substituted--in accordance with one of the \ntheories that has been offered--in the place of a particular company, \nit will most certainly assert the state secrets privilege, leaving, in \neffect, the company virtually impotent when it comes to mounting a \ndefense and showing what their legitimate actions were. Due to the \nnature of this state secrets privilege, a company will be forbidden \nfrom making their case and will be left without the ability to even \nconfirm or deny their participation in the program. We should applaud \nthe actions of these citizens, not stab them in the back by suing them \nfor their actions.\n  To refresh everyone's memory, the Intelligence Committee, after \nmonths of negotiation in highly classified settings, rejected an \namendment to strip liability protection from the bill for these \ncompanies by a vote of 12 to 3. It then passed the bill out in toto by \na bipartisan vote of 13 to 2, protecting these companies from lawsuits.\n  The Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, had one markup after less \nthan 2 weeks of reviewing the Intelligence Committee's legislation, and \nrejected an amendment specifically that would have denied liability \nprotection by a vote of 12 to 7. So we voted not to allow them to be \nsued either. Furthermore, the Judiciary Committee rejected an amendment \nto allow the Government to be substituted for the plaintiffs by a vote \nof 13 to 5. We rejected substitution too, although the liability \nprotections were ultimately removed from the bill the Judiciary \nCommittee passed.\n  Even if the Government is substituted, plaintiffs in litigation will \nseek discovery, they will file depositions and ask for interrogatories \nand motions to produce. They will seek trade secrets and highly \nclassified technologies. Companies would still face many litigation \nburdens. They would be--we would be subjecting them to harm, not only \nfrom consumer backlash, but their international business partners will \nbe pressured around the world.\n  Under the limited liability protections incorporated in the Intel \nbill, plaintiffs seeking to question the Government will have their day \nin court as it only protects good corporate citizens from civil suit. \nSo the liability protections in this bill do not preclude lawsuits \nagainst the Federal Government from going forward. In fact, there are \nat least seven lawsuits currently pending against the Government that \nwill proceed against the Government or Government officials. This was \naccepted by the Intelligence Committee. Some wanted to say you couldn't \nsue the Government for these activities also, but the Intel Committee \nreached an agreement, an overwhelmingly bipartisan agreement, that \nwould allow those lawsuits to proceed.\n  The companies that helped the Government did so to help protect us \nfrom further attack, and valuable information has been gathered with \ntheir help. I have been out to the National Security Agency. I have \ntalked with the people. I know they scrupulously follow the rules we \ngive them, and I know they have gained great, valuable information \nthrough this program, and I know they lost very valuable information \nwhen the program had to be stopped. This information has saved \nundoubtedly countless American lives by enabling our intelligence \ncommunity to thwart attacks.\n  Some have said this amounts to amnesty, but that couldn't be further \nfrom the truth. Amnesty is an act of forgiveness for criminal offenses, \nsuch as granting citizenship to people who broke the law to come into \nour country illegally. The companies were operating under a \ncertification of legality in a time of national danger doing what they \ncould as Americans to follow the law and prevent future attacks. At no \npoint during their participation were their actions illegal. For \nHeaven's sake. To grant liability protection is to adhere to that great \nAnglo-American legal tradition for hundreds of years that when called \nupon by a law officer, with apparent legal authority, wearing a \nuniform, out on the street, a citizen is not to be held legally liable \nif, in responding to the officer, the officer was wrong. That is all we \nare talking about. That is a fundamental, historical, legal principle. \nThe only question--the legal question has always been simply this: \nwhether the citizen was responding to a legitimate request by a \ngovernment law officer, a police officer to chase a bad guy. Was the \ncitizen acting reasonably in believing this was a legitimate law \nenforcement request and he was helping by being a good citizen. That is \nthe test. If he participated knowingly with somebody acting illegally, \nthen that citizen could be liable. Certainly certification by the \nAttorney General and the President of the United States in written \ndocuments suffices as a legitimate request.\n  The bottom line is, we do not need to pass legislation that panders \nto the extreme interest groups in America who find fault in everything \nour people do, our law enforcement and intelligence officers, and that \nfosters a fundamental mistrust of those officials who are working daily \nto serve all of us. The burden should not fall on the shoulders of good \ncorporate citizens who are acting patriotically to help save lives and \nprotect our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to support the Intel Committee bill, a \ncarefully crafted, carefully studied, bipartisan bill. I also urge my \ncolleagues to support the liability protections in the Intelligence \nCommittee legislation and a vote against any amendments that attempt to \nstrip these provisions or in any way alter the carefully structured, \nlimited provisions of the bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Senate \namendment No. 3907 offered by Senators Dodd and Feingold to the \nIntelligence Committee's FISA legislation. I compliment my friend from \nAlabama for some very strong, very pointed remarks on this issue as \nwell as the other issues he addressed.\n  I am pleased the leaders of the Intelligence Committee were able to \ncome up with an agreement on how to proceed on this important \nlegislation. I look forward to the debate on many of these amendments.\n  A couple of the amendments have been offered relating to title II of \nthe bill which provides immunity to those telecommunication carriers \nthat currently face lawsuits for their alleged assistance to the \nGovernment after September 11 and their participation in what is known \nas the terrorist surveillance program, or TSP. Senators Dodd and \nFeingold have offered an amendment striking this section. Senators \nSpecter and Whitehouse have offered an amendment which would substitute \nthe Government as a defendant for the telecommunication providers \ncurrently being sued for their alleged support to the President's TSP \nprogram. I do not support either of these amendments.\n  As a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, I had access to \nclassified documents, intelligence, and legal memoranda, and heard \ntestimony related to the President's TSP program. After careful review, \nas stated in the committee report accompanying this legislation, the \ncommittee determined:\n\n       That electronic communication service providers acted on a \n     good faith belief that the President's program, and their \n     assistance, was lawful.\n\n  The committee reviewed the correspondence sent to the electronic \ncommunications service providers stating that the activities requested \nwere authorized by the President and determined by the Attorney General \nto be\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\nlawful, with the exception of one letter covering a period of less than \n60 days in which the counsel to the President certified the program's \nlawfulness. The committee concluded that granting liability relief to \nthe telecommunications providers was not only warranted but required to \nmaintain the regular assistance our intelligence and law enforcement \nprofessionals seek from them.\n  Although I believe the President's program was lawful and necessary, \nthis bill makes no such determination. This is not a review or \ncommentary on the President's program; rather, it is a statement about \nhow important this assistance by the electronic communication providers \nis to our Government.\n  I cannot understate the importance of this assistance--not only for \nintelligence purposes but for law enforcement purposes also. The \nDirector of National Intelligence and the Attorney General stated:\n\n       Extending liability protection to such companies is \n     imperative; failure to do so could limit future cooperation \n     by such companies and put critical intelligence operations at \n     risk. Moreover, litigation against companies believed to have \n     assisted the Government risks the disclosure of highly \n     classified information regarding extremely sensitive \n     intelligence sources and methods.\n\n  There is too much at stake for us to strike title II and substitution \nis not an acceptable alternative. This week, we have been alternating \nbetween legislation geared to helping our taxpayers and FISA. Yet \nsubstituting the Government in these lawsuits will force the American \ntaxpayer to front the heavy legal bills associated with this \nlegislation.\n  Substitution would allow these trials to continue and could risk \nexposure of classified sources and methods through the discovery \nprocess in the litigation. As a defendant in these frivolous lawsuits, \nthe Government may be required to expose some of our most sensitive \nintelligence sources and methods. Let me emphasize the committee \nalready found that these communication providers acted in good faith \nunder assertions from the highest levels of our Government that the \nprogram was lawful. If an individual alleges he or she has a claim due \nto this program, that claim can be brought against the Government and \nshould not be brought against the providers. The Intelligence Committee \nbill left open the option for Americans to sue the Government. An \naggrieved individual may sue the Government and attempt to prove \nstanding and a cause of action. However, substituting the Government \ndoesn't shield our American business partners from these cases, nor \ndoes it relieve them of the liability to their stockholders they may \nunjustly face and which may be borne out in our economy. Substitution \nonly increases the risk of leaks, and these potential revelations only \nmake our enemies better informed on the tools we have to conduct \nelectronic surveillance.\n  Some of my colleagues have complained about access to the documents \nregarding the President's program. It is true many Members of Congress \nhave not had access, nor have they had an opportunity to review these \ndocuments. There is a good reason for that. These documents are highly \nclassified and represent details about intelligence sources and \nmethods. I worry that expanding the number of people who have access to \nthese documents will increase the likelihood that intelligence will get \nleaked into the public. It is more appropriate that the oversight \ncommittee review and report back to the Senate on the various \nintelligence activities of the United States. That is why the Senate \nhas an Intelligence Committee. As a member, I am familiar with handling \nclassified material and receiving classified briefings. I have made \ncommitments to safeguard the information I learn behind closed doors \nwithin the Intelligence Committee. Given the wide array of information \nI have heard on the Intelligence Committee, I question the benefits a \nMember would gain from such a limited, yet specific, review of the \noperations of our intelligence community. Rather, I urge my colleagues \nto support the determination of the Intelligence Committee, which is \ncharged with regularly reviewing the intelligence activities of the \nUnited States and oppose the amendments offered by Senator Dodd and \nSenator Feingold. Providing our telecommunications carriers with \nliability relief is the necessary and responsible action for Congress \nto take. The Government often needs assistance from the private sector \nin order to protect our national security and, in return, they should \nbe able to rely on the Government's assurances that the assistance they \nprovide is lawful and necessary for our national security. As a result \nof this assistance, America's telecommunications carriers should not be \nsubjected to costly legal battles.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto address the Senate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, we are on a very important piece of \nlegislation, and I thank Senator Bond for all his hard work, and other \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee. I hope we can very soon pass a \ngood FISA bill on the floor.\n  I want to deviate from that debate for a second to talk about a \nheadline many of my colleagues read yesterday, and that we are all \nreading repeatedly around the United States, and that is the rapid \nincrease in the number of houses going into foreclosure. I want to \naddress that in the context of the economic stimulus package and in the \ncontext of a possible recessionary tendency in the economy, and also \nfrom a historical perspective, in that we have been down this road \nbefore, and suggest there is an action the Senate and the Congress \ncould take, and the White House could endorse, that could avoid an \nawful lot of foreclosures, improve the housing market, reverse the \ntendencies toward recession, and be a private sector solution to a \nproblem that is going to be a tremendous burden if we don't act.\n  I understand the short-term surgical benefits of the stimulus that \nwas passed by the House, the other benefits that the Finance Committee \npassed. We will work ourselves through that in the next few weeks, and \nshortly thereafter the American people will more than likely be \nreceiving a check of $300 or more with which to infuse some energy into \nthe economy. But while that is going on, these numbers of a 200-percent \nand 300-percent increase of houses going into foreclosures are going to \nmaterialize into houses in foreclosure.\n  When we get into the second quarter of this year and the middle of \nthe summer, we are going to find ourselves in a difficult situation \nwhere the following has happened: a tremendous number of houses \nforeclosed on, the banks and lenders taking back inventory--and there \nis a term called REO, real estate owned--and the regulators coming in, \nlooking at their books and telling them to get rid of that inventory. \nThe lenders are going to then write them down, take them to the \nmarketplace with deep discounts, and sell them.\n  Now what that is going to do to your homeowners Jim Weichert sells to \nin New Jersey, mine in Georgia Harry Norman sells to, and those from \nall around the country, is those people who are in houses making \npayments and they are in good shape, their value is going to plummet \nbecause of the number of foreclosures that is flooding the market. What \nhappens is the equity, the difference between their existing mortgage \nand the value of the house, decreases because the value of the house \ngoes down. If they are like 87 percent of the American people who have \nan equity line of credit, where they use the equity in their house as a \nline of credit, if you will, their available credit is going to be \nsqueezed.\n  You know what is going to happen then? They are going to stop \nspending. When that happens, we will have the full pressure of the \neconomy in a downward spiral, and it begins to feed upon itself. That \nis precisely what happened in 1975.\n  In 1973 and early 1974, there was a great housing boom in the United \nStates, like we have had over most of\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\nthe last decade. And like what happened over most of the last decade \nwith subprime loans and underwriting, back in 1974, money got awfully \nloose. Banks made loans with very little underwriting criteria, and we \nhad a plethora of new homes built all over the United States by \nnewfound homebuilders who had a hammer, a pickup truck, and easy \ncredit. We found ourselves at the beginning of 1975 with a 3-year \nsupply of vacant housing on the market in the United States. A viable \nreal estate market is a 6-month supply. So you had six times the volume \nof houses that would be considered a balanced market, and we went into \na deep recessionary spiral.\n  A Democratic Congress and a Republican President passed a $6,000 tax \ncredit available to any family who purchased a standing vacant house in \ninventory, and that allowed them to collect that credit over 3 years--\nthe 3 succeeding tax years after the year of their purchase. The only \nthing they had to do, other than qualify for their loan, and qualify \nunder good qualifying standards, is they had to occupy the home as \ntheir residence. In a 1-year period of time, we absorbed a 2-year \nsupply of housing and returned the housing market to balance and the \neconomy stabilized. Although we had the impacts of the oil embargo, \nwhich was causing problems with inflation, the economy returned to a \nrelatively stable time period.\n  I, along with a number of Members of the Senate, have introduced \nlegislation--Senate bill 2566--which takes that model from 1975 and \napplies it to our problem in 2008. What it very simply does is, it \noffers a tax credit of $15,000 for the purchase of any house that falls \nin the following category: a new house permitted before September 1 of \nlast year that is standing and vacant; a house owned by a lender that \nwas foreclosed on in the last 12 months from an owner occupant; and any \nhouse pending foreclosure owned by an owner occupant who is willing to \nsell. That is where all this inventory that is beginning to flood our \nmarket comes from. The tax credit would be available if the purchase \nwas made between March 1 of this year and February 28 of next year. So \nthere is a 1-year window to incentivize those who may be reluctant to \ngo in the marketplace to do so.\n\n  The Joint Tax Committee has scored this, and guess what the score \nis--$9.1 billion over 5 years. Put that in the context of the stimulus \npackage that is before us of $150 billion to $160 billion. It is a \nrelatively small inducement to provide a private sector solution to \nwhat is about to become a huge burden to the taxpayers of the United \nStates and this Government.\n  I come to the floor at this time in hopes that some of our colleagues \nwho have not found an interest in this legislation yet will take a look \nat it. As the author, it is not original thought. I happened to have \nbeen a real estate broker in 1975 trying to hang on and make a living \nto educate my three children, and I saw my Government come to the \nrescue of the housing economy through energizing people to go in and \npurchase houses that were in trouble, rather than bail them out \nsomewhere down the line, and it worked. The cost to the Government was \ninfinitesimal, yet the benefit to the public was astronomical.\n  I hope, as we finish talking about a surgical, strategic, short-term \nstimulus to get the consumer buying, which is what we are talking about \nin terms of either the Senate Finance Committee bill or the House bill, \nwe take a look at what is coming. Because, believe me, in July of this \nyear, if we do nothing, we are going to be dealing with a housing \nsupply in this country bigger than it has ever been, with vacant houses \nby the thousands in neighborhoods, declining values on the value of \nhousing, and people who are in good shape are not going to be able to \neither have their equity line of credit work or be able to move their \nhouse in the marketplace because of the tremendous inventory available.\n  History is a great teacher both in terms of things you should never \nrepeat but also in terms of things that work and you should repeat \nagain. I would submit the tax credit to qualified individuals to \npurchase and occupy a troubled house in this economy is an incentive \nthat worked not only for the betterment of the market but for the \nbetterment of our economy and in the best interest of the United \nStates. Senate bill 2566 is an opportunity for us to join together to \ndo something good and right for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, across the Nation, millions of Americans are \nstruggling to make ends meet as our economy has slowed dramatically. In \nDecember, I spoke on this floor about how President Bush has presided \nover a period of divided prosperity in the United States, where a \nprivileged few have done remarkably well but the rest of us have been \ntrying to get by. For most working people, the trademark of the Bush \nadministration and their economy is wage stagnation. Indeed, in my home \nState, real median wages have not increased since 2000.\n  Rhode Islanders are coping not only with flat wages but increasing \nprices in critical commodities they must consume. Energy, education, \nand health care have all gone up. In January, in Rhode Island, gas was \n$3.11 cents a gallon; heating oil costs in the Northeast are projected \nto be at least $2,000 this year, which is about a $400 increase from \nlast year. These price increases would be difficult to manage even in \ngood times, but again paychecks for most working families have not kept \nup. In fact, they have been flat.\n  With prices accelerating, wages flat, and a huge gap in the capacity \nof middle-income working Americans to keep up and try to get ahead, the \nsubprime crisis is real. This housing crisis is having huge and \ndevastating effects. Two years ago, most of our constituents, the vast \nmajority of them, were sitting around the table thinking: Well, when my \ndaughter is ready to go to college in 2008, we will go ahead and borrow \nfrom the house to provide the extra income she will need to go ahead \nand make it through college. A lot of those families now are \nrecognizing they can't do that. They are more concerned about a health \ncare incident, because, unlike a few months ago, there is no reservoir \nin the value of their house to cushion the blow of unexpected expenses.\n  So this housing crisis, together with this wage stagnation, together \nwith increased prices for energy and health care and education, and so \nmany other things, is putting middle-class Americans in a vise and \nsqueezing them.\n  We have to do much better. The Joint Economic Committee and others \nhave estimated some of the costs already in terms of this mortgage-\nrelated foreclosure crisis. In my home State, they think $670 million \nwill be lost to the family incomes of Rhode Island from 2007 through \nthe end of 2009.\n  These economic conditions are being felt across the country. They are \nnot localized warnings. The weakness in housing has spread to all parts \nof our Nation and across our economy. Growth in the fourth quarter of \nlast year was .6 percent compared to a 4.9-percent increase in the \nthird quarter.\n  We are slowing down, moving into a recession. Yesterday the market, \nWall Street, went down over 300 points, largely due to a very weak \nreport of a survey on the service sector. We have known for many months \nnow that the manufacturing economy was having difficult times, but the \nservice sector was holding up a bit.\n  Yesterday, there was a chilling indication the service sector has \nalso contracted. The market took the news very badly. The market also \ntook the news very badly a few days ago, when we showed a loss of \n17,000 jobs, the first time we have actually lost jobs in more than 4 \nyears.\n  Again, the administration's performance in terms of creating jobs has \nbeen less than stellar, barely keeping up with the new entrants into \nthe labor market on a monthly basis. Now, for the first time in more \nthan 4 years, we have lost jobs.\n  Furthermore, the average length of unemployment is increasing from \n16.6 weeks in December to 17.5 weeks in January. More people are losing \njobs and it is harder to find a new job.\n  Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released a survey of senior bank loan \nofficers who indicated that the credit\n\n[[Page S702]]\n\ncrunch is spreading from consumer loans into the commercial and \nindustrial loan sectors and that foreign banks are tightening their \nlending terms, in fact, even more so than some U.S. financial \ninstitutions.\n  Taken together, it clearly shows Wall Street is going into what one \nanalyst called a recession panic mode and many economists are seeing \nsigns that weaknesses in our economy are spreading internationally. In \nfact, one investment banker today, in a speech reported on the \nInternet, suggested that in the credit markets fear has overtaken \ngreed, creating a situation of near panic in many respects.\n  So there is no doubt we have to act quickly on this stimulus package, \nnot only to inject needed spending power into the economy to try to \nrevive our consumer sector but also to signal to the American public we \nwill act decisively to try to moderate, if not head off, the effects of \na pending recession.\n  We have, I think, a lot to be grateful for in the work of Senator \nBaucus and Majority Leader Reid and Senator Grassley in terms of taking \na House proposal and increasing it with important provisions, such as \nexpanding the eligibility criteria for income tax rebates, including 20 \nmillion seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans.\n  The package we are considering also includes $10 billion for a \ntemporary extension of unemployment insurance and $1 billion of \nemergency funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nthe LIHEAP program. Both of these initiatives are targeted to families, \nseniors and low-income households, and they would help jump-start the \neconomy.\n  Economists agree these programs among others are a good use of \ntaxpayer money. Last week before the Budget Committee, Alan Blinder \nfrom Princeton University and Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com both \nrecommended that unemployment insurance and LIHEAP be included in the \nstimulus package. They also included other elements, but at least these \nelements are part of the list they feel will provide a bang for the \nbucks we are going to invest in the economy.\n  They meet the three T test--timely, targeted, and temporary.\n  Now, Friday's disappointing jobs report showed that the ranks of the \nunemployed are unfortunately growing. Nonfarm payrolls actually \ndecreased, as I said, by 17,000 workers last month. In fact, even \nPresident Bush acknowledged ``troubling signs in the economy.''\n  So given these facts, I was surprised to hear Treasury Secretary \nPaulson say yesterday, in testimony before the Finance Committee, that \nhe does not support including unemployment benefits in the stimulus \npackage because national unemployment is only 4.9 percent, which is not \nhistorically high.\n  What we want to do is take preemptive action to prevent the situation \nfrom further deterioration. We want to move now so we do not see \nunemployment rates climb, so we do not see the duration of unemployment \ncontinue to grow, so that we give Americans a real chance to get back \nto work; and if they are not back to work, then at least we provide \nsomething to sustain them in these difficult moments.\n  In Rhode Island, my home State, we have reached a very high \nunemployment rate, 5.5 percent. Many other States are creeping up there \ntoo. We should, I think, move quickly, move decisively and support the \nSenate Finance package.\n  We are also beginning to see that unemployment insurance provides a \nvery good return on the investment. Mark Zandi, the economist I \nmentioned before, indicated that for every dollar the Government spends \non unemployment insurance, it adds $1.64 to the national GDP. In other \nwords, it leverages the investments we are making.\n  So contrary to what some have talked about as excessive spending, \nthis is exactly the targeted, temporary, timely spending that will \naccelerate, not decelerate, the economy.\n  The stimulative effects of unemployment insurance will get more money \ninto the hands of people who will spend it right away in their local \ncommunities, which is generally the whole purpose of our stimulus \napproach.\n  Moreover, providing these benefits to these individuals will give \nthem not just some dollars but a sense, I hope, of hope, that their \nGovernment is responding to their concerns and that we will respond in \nthe future, if necessary.\n\n  Making the long-term unemployed eligible for a temporary extension of \nan additional 13 weeks at this time also makes good sense and is the \nright thing to do. Two weeks ago, I wrote a letter to the majority and \nRepublican leaders asking that they include unemployment insurance in \nthe stimulus package, and 26 other Senators joined me.\n  Senators Durbin and Kennedy have long led the fight on this issue. I \ncommend them for their efforts. I hope unemployment insurance is part \nof the final package we are able to vote out of this body.\n  Now, there is another aspect of the package we will consider later \ntoday, I hope; that is the LIHEAP support. We have seen a huge increase \nin energy costs. On average, Americans are spending about 11 percent \nmore to heat their homes this winter. For Rhode Islanders who rely on \nheating oil, that is about 39 percent higher than last year in terms of \ntheir heating oil expenses.\n  We know that the timely, targeted, and temporary aspects of stimulus \nhave to be met. LIHEAP will do this. It is timely because it will be \ndelivered very quickly. We have a delivery mechanism in place. It is \nalso something that will fund families, low-income families, who \ndesperately need this money.\n  I do not have to belabor the point that today, around the kitchen \ntable, people are figuring things out. They are thinking, first of all, \nthey probably need to take off sending their first born or their second \nor third child to the expensive school; that may be off the table for a \nfew years. But they are also talking very basically about which bills \nto pay this month? Do we pay our mortgage? Do we pay the energy bill? \nDo we pay the credit cards which we are using to buy food at the \nsupermarket these days?\n  I mean, these are the debates American families are having. They are \nnot talking in terms that we are here, such as what is the best \nmacroeconomic policy or how we can delay these expenditures, they are \ntalking in terms of a real crisis in the family. We have to respond. \nOne way we can respond quite clearly is with this LIHEAP money because \nthat will go to one of their major concerns: How do we keep the heat on \nin the Northeast for the next several weeks and month; and in the \nSouthwest, in anticipation of the grueling temperatures down there in \nthe summertime, too. This additional money will provide an advance \npayment on cooling problems in the Southeast and the South, parts of \nthe country that will soon encounter warm temperatures, not cold \ntemperatures, which cause their energy costs to rise.\n  Again, these are the households who need LIHEAP. And so we know we \nhave a program that works in LIHEAP. If we can deliver additional \nresources, it will get to the families who need it, particularly \nseniors, it will get out immediately. It will add to the stimulus \neffect because as the economists--both Mr. Blinder and Mr. Zandi--\npointed out, it will leverage our investment in the economy.\n  So with the escalating costs for energy I would urge my colleagues \nthat we go ahead and accept this amendment, particularly the funds for \nLIHEAP. I urge us all to support the Senate Finance Committee package, \na package that provides for greater coverage to seniors and disabled \nAmerican veterans and also provides unemployment insurance for those \nwho desperately need it and heating assistance for, again, the families \nwho desperately need it.\n  I hope that today, not only good sense, good economic sense, but a \nsense of our obligations to the most vulnerable in this country will \npersuade us to support this package strongly.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes and then for Senator Crapo to have up to 10 amendments \nto speak on the FISA bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think our \ncolleague is going to speak in morning business. But I will be happy to \nyield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Was there an amendment?\n  Mr. BOND. If we can yield to the Senator from Texas for 10 minutes on \nthe bill, the Senator from Idaho for morning business, and then go to a \nMember on the majority side of the aisle.\n  I believe there is a consensus developing for the unanimous consent \nrequest I have proposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator repeat his unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. BOND. Ten minutes to the Senator from Texas on the FISA bill, 10 \nminutes in morning business for the Senator from Idaho, and then a \nmember of the majority side will be recognized for whatever he or she \nwishes to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do rise to speak on the FISA bill, \nwhich I certainly support, and also to oppose some of the amendments \nthat will be coming forward.\n  I hope very much that we will be able to start voting on amendments, \nbecause we now have an agreement for voting on amendments, and I hope \nwe can clear the FISA bill in due course and in short order. It is \nimportant because there is a deadline.\n  We are going to see the capability for our law enforcement officials \nand our intelligence officials, to monitor calls between known \nterrorists and suspected terrorists, whether it is into our country, or \nout of our country from foreign countries, we need to have this \ncapability continue.\n  We have it right now. The Senate passed a good bill about 6 months \nago. It has now been extended. But we do have a deadline, and the \ndeadline is on us in the middle of this month. So we do need to pass \nthis bill. We need to make sure the technology of the day is covered by \nthe foreign intelligence surveillance act and subject to the security \nneeds of our country.\n  There are amendments that would take away the immunity for \ntelecommunications companies that allegedly cooperated with \nintelligence officials.\n  One amendment, No. 3907, would strip the immunity from the bill \ncompletely. The Intelligence Committee is the key committee that has \nlooked at all of the information and assessed the need for the ability \nto survey known terrorists and suspected terrorist helpers in our \ncountry and in foreign countries. It is important that we allow our \nintelligence agents to go to telecommunications companies and get the \nhelp they need to do this kind of surveillance. Amendment No. 3907 \nwould take away immunization for companies that may have cooperated \nwith government requests.\n  The telecommunications companies allegedly assisted the intelligence \ncommunity because of the need to assure that plots against our country \nand our citizens were uncovered before they are implemented. Now we \nhave the potential for catastrophic liability from a number of \nlawsuits, and some of my colleagues want the country to turn away from \nproviding protection for these companies. We will not allow these \ncompanies the freedom to provide the evidence in court because the \nintelligence community says the evidence is too sensitive to be allowed \nin court. We put the telecommunications companies in a situation in \nwhich they cooperate. They are sued. But they don't have the ability to \ndefend themselves in court because they cannot produce the evidence. It \nis untenable, and I hope we will reject such an amendment.\n  There is another amendment that would allow the Government to be \nsubstituted for the telecommunications companies as the defendant when \nthey are sued. The problem with this amendment is that the companies \nwould still have to spend thousands of hours and millions of dollars on \nthese lawsuits. They would have to subject their employees to \ndepositions. They would need to participate in evidence gathering and \nthe discovery process, which will drain their resources in an \nunnecessary lawsuit in which they would be peripheral.\n  There is yet another amendment that would grant the immunity after \nreview by the FISA Court. While certainly well intentioned, there are \nsome problems with giving this to a court that doesn't have the \ncapability to process this kind of request. They don't have statutory \nprocedures. They don't have the administrative capacity to receive \nwitnesses, to hear evidence, or to carry out the major provisions of \nthe amendment.\n  Furthermore, it is unclear that there is appellate authority from the \nimmunity related rulings of the FISA Court this amendment creates. The \nFISA Court has operated in secret and has been more of an \nadministrative court processing warrants. So this would put the court \nin a whole new administrative mode for which there are no precedent or \nappropriate regulations. There does not appear to be an appellate \nprocess from the FISA Court once it decides whether or not to grant a \ncompany immunity.\n  I respect the work of my colleagues. They are trying to find good-\nfaith compromises. However, I put my faith in the Intelligence \nCommittee. This is a committee that passed this bill, with immunity \nprovisions in it, out of committee by a vote of 13 to 2. It was \nbipartisan. This is the committee that had the hearings, heard all of \nthe evidence, and knows more about the processes than people who are \nnot on the committee. They have spent a considerable amount of time \nreviewing the materials in these cases, including the Government's \nlegal justifications for the program. We need to respect the judgment \nand expertise of our committees, particularly the intelligence \ncommittee. This is a committee that has done a very good job on a \nbipartisan basis to assure that we continue to protect our intelligence \ncapabilities and to shield the companies necessary to gathering \nintelligence information from unfounded lawsuits.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for the bill the Intelligence \nCommittee produced. Protecting the American people is our ultimate \nresponsibility. This bill is absolutely essential for that \nresponsibility to be implemented. We must protect the American people. \nWe must protect the companies that have helped our law enforcement and \nintelligence-gathering agencies. We must make sure we proceed with a \nvision of foreign surveillance that would protect the American people \nfrom future attack.\n  It is not an accident that we have not been attacked since 9/11. All \nof us know that our country was not prepared for this kind of warfare. \nBut our country's eyes have been opened. We have been a sleeping giant \nin many ways, as was said about us before World War II. But we have now \nbeen awakened, and we are going to take the measures necessary within \nthe framework of our Constitution, which this bill provides, to assure \nthat we protect the American people from future attack.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Idaho is recognized for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n\n\n       Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Senator from Texas and my colleagues on both \nsides for allowing me this few minutes to have a break in the debate on \nthe FISA bill to discuss a very important issue to the people of Idaho \nand, frankly, to the people in rural communities throughout the \ncountry. I rise to talk about the need to reauthorize the Secure Rural \nSchools and Communities Self-Determination Act of 2000 and to fully \nfund the payments in lieu of taxes, or the PILT payments, which we call \nthem in Congress. I encourage my colleagues to make this overdue \nextension and funding a top priority for Congress in the coming days.\n  This year marks the 100-year anniversary of the passage of the act \nrequiring the U.S. Forest Service to return 25 percent of its gross \nreceipts to the States to assist counties that are home to our national \nforests and other Federal lands with school and road services. This \nprogram was put into place to compensate local governments for the tax-\nexempt status of national forests which we all enjoy. Otherwise, many \nrural communities that neighbor these beautiful national treasures are \nunable to fully meet the school and road needs of their communities.\n  One hundred years ago, the impact of large Federal forest reserves on \nneighboring local economies was discussed and debated on the floor of \nthe Senate, as former Idaho Senators Weldon B.\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\nHayburn and William Edgar Borah joined their Senate colleagues in \ndebating this issue which remains an issue today. However, the \nunfortunate reality of today is that in recent years, timber receipts \nhave eroded to the point that the Federal obligation to our local \ncommunities is simply not being met. The receipts are not adequate for \nthe needs of the communities and have been dropping off dramatically. \nCongress has acted in recognition of this to ensure that communities \nhave the necessary assistance.\n  In the year 2000, I joined with my colleagues, Senators Larry Craig, \nRon Wyden, Gordon Smith of Oregon, and many others to support and \nsecure enactment of the Secure Rural Schools and Communities Self-\nDetermination Act of 2000. This law provided the necessary assistance \nknown as county payments to communities where regular Forest Service \nand Bureau of Land Management receipts-sharing payments had declined so \nsignificantly. The assistance has prevented the loss of essential \nschool and road infrastructure needs in our local rural communities. \nThe law also enabled very significant forest improvement projects.\n  The best solutions to natural resource challenges are achieved \nthrough local collaboration, and the more than 70 Resource Advisory \nCommittees--or RACs, as we call them--provided for in this law have \ncreated valuable partnerships in carrying out projects to address a \nwide variety of improvements on public lands. These projects include \nhabitat and watershed restoration, reforestation, fuels reduction, road \nmaintenance, campground and trail enhancements, and noxious weed \neradication. At a time when increased public demands are being placed \non our Nation's natural resources, the RACs have provided the necessary \ncooperation to help resolve natural resource challenges throughout \nthese local rural communities.\n  Additionally, payments in lieu of taxes, known as PILT payments, have \naugmented county payments to provide local governments with the means \nof offsetting a part of the tax revenues they lose because of the tax-\nexempt status of these Federal lands in their jurisdictions. PILT \npayments have supported community services such as firefighting and \npolice protection in rural communities. Through PILT, the Federal \nGovernment partners with counties to provide public lands the \nstewardship and community services they need. Unfortunately, PILT \nfunding is also not meeting this obligation, and we need to work \ntogether in Congress to achieve full and adequate PILT funding.\n\n  I am proud of the largely bipartisan effort in the 110th Congress to \nextend the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act \nand to fully fund PILT. Progress has been made but more needs to be \ndone to achieve the Federal Government's commitment to these \ncommunities.\n  In March of 2007, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an amendment which \nI cosponsored to the fiscal year 2007 emergency supplemental \nappropriations act to reauthorize county payments for 5 years with \noffsets. However, this language was replaced with a 1-year extension, \nwith the final payments made at the end of December 2007.\n  In December last year, Senators McCaskill, Craig, Smith, Dole, \nMurkowski, Stevens, and Bennett joined me in urging the Senate \nleadership to attach a reauthorization of county payments and PILT \nfunding to any legislative vehicles expected to be enacted before \nCongress concluded its work last year. Unfortunately, the \nreauthorization was attached only to the energy package which also \nwould have increased taxes on domestic oil and gas producers to pay for \nincentives for renewable power, energy efficiency, electric vehicles, \nand other technologies.\n  I support incentives for alternative energy resources and the \nextension of county payments, but I am opposed to paying for those \nincentives by increasing taxes on our domestic oil and gas production. \nWe are facing real and increasing constraints on our energy supply, \nresulting in higher energy costs daily. We simply cannot meet those \nneeds by decreasing conventional energy production in the United \nStates, which would further our dependency on foreign energy supplies \nand dramatically increase the cost for gasoline and electricity. This \nwould negatively impact communities across the Nation, not just the \nrural communities we are seeking to help.\n  We need to again turn our attention to focusing on the \nreauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools legislation and increasing \nand achieving full and adequate PILT funding. It is unfortunate that \nthe county payments extension was dropped from the enacted Energy bill \nand was not included in other legislative vehicles before the end of \nlast year. However, today is another day. As we embark on the second \nsession of this Congress, we have every opportunity to work together to \nextend and fund county payments and fully pay for PILT payments for \nstudents in rural areas. We must do this to prevent the closure of \nnumerous isolated schools and to enable rural county road districts to \naddress severe maintenance backlogs.\n\n  Time is of the essence for many rural communities across the Nation, \nand this important legislation impacts millions of students and their \nfamilies in more than 4,000 school districts and more than 7,000 \ncounties. I am hearing from Idaho communities that, absent an \nextension, personnel layoffs as a result of program closures are \nexpected soon. Communities in more than 40 States are facing similar \npressures.\n  Just as the economic impact of Federal land ownership on neighboring \nrural communities has not been worn away by time, neither has this \nNation's responsibility to the States worn away. It is my hope that \nothers will join me in working to meet this Federal responsibility by \nreauthorizing the Secure Rural Schools Act and providing the full \nfunding for PILT. This must be achieved in a timely manner that \nprevents the cutoff of needed services in rural communities nationwide \nand provides some long-term certainty to those rural communities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask that I be given unanimous \nconsent to speak on the underlying bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I say to the Presiding Officer that \nfar and away the most contentious issue in this FISA debate is whether \nprivate companies that assisted the Government in implementing the \nPresident's warrantless surveillance program should be provided \nliability protection.\n  Three amendments will be offered that relate directly to this issue.\n  First, Senators Dodd and Feingold have an amendment that would strike \nall of title II of the underlying bill--that is, S. 2248--on liability \nprotection as reported by the Intelligence Committee.\n  Second, Senator Specter will offer an amendment--I think at 3:30--\nthat provides for a different remedy; namely, the substitution of the \nU.S. Government itself for the carriers in the lawsuits that have been \nfiled against the carriers.\n  Third, Senator Feinstein has prepared an amendment that would keep \nthe basic structure of title II--to wit, liability immunity--but would \nhave the courts, rather than the Congress, determine whether carriers \nrelied in good faith on the representation made to them by the \nexecutive branch of our National Government.\n  I will address the particulars of each amendment as it is offered, \nbut first I would like to describe the background behind the \nIntelligence Committee's approach to this whole issue of immunity.\n  Critics have suggested that providing liability protection for \ntelecommunications companies is akin to congressional endorsement of \nthe President's warrantless surveillance program. I understand the \npassion stirred by this issue. Rather than consulting with Congress or \nthe courts, the President created a secret surveillance program--no \nquestion about that--based on very dubious legal reasoning. That was \nunnecessary, that was unwise, that would, therefore, cause passions and \nsuspicions.\n  But anger over the President's program should not prevent us as a \ndeliberative body from addressing the real problems the President has \ncreated.\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\nBecause of the lawsuits over the program and the damage to the \ntelecommunications companies' reputations, companies that were once \nwilling to help the Government, based on assurances of legality from \nthe highest levels of Government, may now be questioning that \nassistance.\n  Let's reflect on that for a moment. These are corporations. They have \nno names at the present time. They have to make money. The Government \ncomes to them, as they have in the past on much smaller matters, and \nwith the authority of the President saying, this is in the national \ninterest; with the legal advice of the Attorney General saying, this is \nlegal; and then the Director of the National Security Agency sending \nout letters that say, we require you, we compel you, we request to \nyou--or other words--that you cooperate with us.\n  People say: Well, they cooperated. Of course they cooperated right \nafter 9/11. I think anybody who is in the intelligence business \nunderstands what I am saying. There is no difference between the day \nafter 9/11 and this day in terms of the threat to our country or those \nwho are planning, plotting to do us harm.\n  The fact that no attacks have happened does not excuse the sense of \nrelaxation on the whole subject--perhaps the congressional sense of \nrelaxation on the whole subject. We need to continue this intelligence \ncollection.\n  What is it, I am wondering, that the telecommunications companies get \nfrom this? What prestige? What large amount of money? What praise? What \ndo they get from this? Do they get good public relations? No. They get \n40 lawsuits, most of which are not based on anything to do with the TSP \nprogram. In other words, they are picked out of newspapers. People are \ndissatisfied, and class action suits arise.\n  So maybe they have been sued $10 billion. Maybe they have been sued \n$40 billion. We will not speculate on that at the present time. But in \nthat they are corporations and in that they have no reward at all for \ndoing this service for their country--which we call patriotism, and \nthen cast that aside because that must mask some evil intent--they go \nahead and they do it. Then, since they are corporations, their \nshareholders get extremely unhappy about it, which could be happening \nat the present time, and then they decide that maybe they will be less \nwilling to do this. Several have done that. Several at the beginning \ndid that.\n  Now, corporations are in business also to make a profit. The \ncorporations that are involved in this are doing nothing but losing \nprestige, losing reputation, have angry shareholders. And I ask myself, \nwhat is it they get out of doing this, because people, particularly on \nmy side of the aisle, are sometimes inclined to be suspicious of \ncorporations, that they have some kind of a purpose behind all of this. \nNothing could be further from the truth. They are losing. They are \nbeing criticized. They are being sued. It is costly. It takes away from \ntheir energy to carry out their other missions. It is not a situation \nin which a whole bunch of people are sitting around in these corporate \nheadquarters discussing this, because only a very few people are \nallowed to know, and they have criminal sanctions against them if they \ntell anybody, should they have received any of these instructions from \nthe Government.\n  So we are not talking about people here trying to undo the safety of \nthe United States or to gain some kind of advantage for themselves. If \nthis intelligence collection stops, I say to the Presiding Officer, we \nwill be in a very sorry situation. I do not know how to say that more \nsincerely, more deeply felt, more based upon exhaustive study, \nincluding numerous meetings in committee with these folks and other \nmeetings outside.\n\n  So they have been told it is legal, and by the National Security \nAgency Director they have been required, compelled, and in other words, \nsome of which are quite strong, to do it. So they do start to do it, \nand they are paying one heck of a price for it.\n  What price are we paying? We are paying no price because they are \nstill doing it. What price might we pay should they stop--because they \nare corporations, and they are responsible to their shareholders--if \nthey should stop this type of activity? The price we would pay would be \noverwhelming. Without the cooperation and assistance of private \ncompanies--not compliance forced by a court but true cooperation--this \ncountry's law enforcement and intelligence agencies cannot obtain the \ninformation they need to protect this country. It is a fairly heavy \nstatement to make. I chair the committee. I am not naive on these \nmatters. I make that statement again. Without the cooperation and \nassistance of private companies, this country's law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies cannot obtain the information they need to \nprotect this country.\n  Making the question of liability protection a proxy for disagreement \nwith the President's program is, therefore, shortsighted, in this \nSenator's view, ignoring the reality that the Nation and future \nPresidents will depend on the assistance of these same companies for \nyears to come.\n  In analyzing the question of liability protection, the Intelligence \nCommittee sought to weigh these very real concerns about future \nintelligence collection against the possible outcome of lawsuits. We \ndiscussed it at length. Understanding this issue requires some \nbackground on the lawsuits that have been filed.\n  Currently, providers are subject to approximately, as I indicated, 40 \ncivil lawsuits, some of which are class actions, which seek billions of \ndollars of damages--and I have given you a range--for privacy \nviolations based on the companies' alleged provision of assistance and \ninformation to the intelligence community. The suits are based--many of \nthem--on media reports about all sorts of intelligence activities. Many \nof them are not limited to the warrantless surveillance program \ndisclosed by the President. That is ironic, but it is a heavy burden \nfor the companies. If suits are brought that have nothing to do with \nthe warrantless surveillance program disclosed by the President, they \nare out of order. But, as I will proceed to explain, the companies can \nnever explain to a court that they are out of order. Although these \nsuits involve different types of legal claims that are in varying \nstages of litigation, they share a common reality: that the Government \nhas refused to publicly reveal the classified documents and information \nthat would allow them to proceed.\n\n  The current fight in the courts is, therefore, not about whether \ndamages should be awarded, whether the underlying program is legal or \neven whether any company participated in the President's program in \ngood faith. Instead, the parties are fighting about access to \nclassified information about the President's program. I have not heard \nthat much discussed in this Chamber. This litigation could continue for \nyears without a court ever addressing the underlying issues about the \nlegality of the program. We seek wrongdoing whether, as some say, it is \nin the corporate boardroom or, as others would say--as I would say--in \nthe halls of Government.\n  I stress the point: No court is likely to resolve the question of \nwhether the President or any private company violated the law in the \nnear future.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that without these lawsuits, the \npublic will never learn the details about the President's program. But \nlitigation is highly unlikely to tell the story of what happened with \nthe President's program. Too many of these facts dealing with \nintelligence sources and methods remain appropriately classified, and \nthe executive branch is highly unlikely to agree to declassify \nadditional information if it could affect the ongoing litigation.\n  Thus, the litigation is unlikely to result in a ruling in the near \nfuture about the legality of the conduct of the President nor any \nprivate company, nor, for that matter, the public disclosure of any \nadditional information about the President's program. Instead, it is \npossible the cases, as I indicated, will continue for years as the \ncourts debate whether information must be disclosed.\n  In the meantime, however, as I mentioned, the litigation poses a \nserious risk to U.S. intelligence collection. That is my job and that \nis the job of the committee I chair and the job of the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee in the House. We are not about being courts, we \nare about trying to balance civil liberties as best as we can\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\nwith the ability of this country to collect an entirely different kind \nof intelligence that we were so busy doing recently in the Cold War \nera. Without the assistance of telecommunications providers, our \nintelligence community simply cannot obtain the intelligence it needs.\n  Is that a serious statement? Do Members of the Senate concern \nthemselves with that? Is this just me, this Senator, standing up making \na statement trying to win some votes? Or is there the possibility it \ncould be true? If there is a possibility--and I think it is a \nprobability it is true--then I don't understand why people can be \nconfused on this subject because I think the choices are clear. \nAllowing companies to be dragged through the court system because of \ntheir alleged cooperation with the Government encourages them not to \ncooperate with any request, even those that are clearly legal without \ncourt compulsion. It also sends a message to all private companies: \ncooperate with the U.S. Government at your peril. Is that a bit of an \noverstatement? In the corporate boardrooms around this country, my \nguess is that is the discussion. Very few corporations have the \ncapacity to help the Government in the way telecommunications companies \ndo.\n  Discouraging private sector cooperation with the Federal Government \nis not, in the feeling of this Senator, the right long-term result for \neither the intelligence community or the American people.\n  Many have argued that providers who act unlawfully should be held \naccountable. I totally agree that all Americans, including corporate \ncitizens, must follow the law and be held accountable for their \nfailures. Companies that deliberately seek to evade privacy laws or \nlegal restrictions on electronic surveillance can and should be subject \nto civil suit, but that is not the issue here, I would say to the \nPresiding Officer. That is not the issue.\n  The Intelligence Committee spent a lot of time, as I have indicated, \nthis year looking into what happened over the past 6 years. Before \ndeciding to provide liability protection for the companies, the \nIntelligence Committee heard testimony from relevant witnesses and \ncarefully reviewed the written communications provided to participants \nin the program.\n  Participants were sent letters, all of which stated the relevant \nactivities had been authorized by the President and all but one--and \nthat was done by the legal counsel to the President--of which stated \nthe activities had been determined to be lawful by the Attorney General \nof the United States. Shouldn't private companies be entitled to rely \non the written representations of the highest levels of Government \nofficials that their cooperation is necessary and has been determined \nto be lawful? Can you argue that if they get those notifications from \nthe NSA Director and it has been approved by the Attorney General and \nhas been declared essential for the national interest by the President, \nshould they instead say: Oh, well, we don't care about that. That is \nnot our business. We are not going to do that.\n  And isn't it reasonable to assume that a U.S. citizen who has been \ntold the Attorney General has found their cooperation to be lawful is \nacting in good faith? If they have been through this process and they \nproceed to act on it, why is it so easy to stipulate they are not \nacting in good faith? How does one show that? How does one imagine \nthat?\n  I have been through this, this whole question of what the companies \nget from it, and it is the thing that bothers me so much. They get \nnothing but grief. They get suits. They get costs. They get a \ndiminished reputation. They begin to pull away. Their shareholders lose \nconfidence. Do they get money? No. They get nothing. So why would they \nwant to continue to cooperate would be my question.\n  The answer to these questions are at the heart of the Intelligence \nCommittee's determination that it is essential that Congress protect \nprivate companies that assisted the Government after the terrorist acts \nof 9/11.\n  Mr. President, I will complete this part of my presentation and yield \nthe floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:05 \np.m. today the Senate return to the Cardin amendment No. 3930, with the \ntime from 3:05 until 3:15 equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the \namendment, with other provisions of the previous order remaining in \neffect.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. No.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish \nto secure the ability, following this vote, to call up one of my \namendments, if I might. My understanding is that maybe I can do it now.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This is a total of 10 minutes or less amendment, but \nwe will not start until 3:05. The Senator can call it up.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. All right.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3910 to Amendment No. 3911\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npresent amendment be set aside in order for me to call up amendment No. \n3910 on FISA exclusivity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \n     Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Snowe, \n     and Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 3910.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a statement of the exclusive means by which \nelectronic surveillance and interception of certain communications may \n                             be conducted)\n\n       Strike section 102, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 102.

Statement of exclusive means by which electronic \n              surveillance and interception of certain communications \n              may be conducted.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I voted for this FISA legislation in \nthe Intelligence Committee. I indicated then that I had some concerns \nabout it. I filed additional views with respect to the need for \nstronger exclusivity provisions. Then the Judiciary Committee reported \nout a bill that included its view with respect to strengthening the \nfact that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be the \nexclusive manner in which electronic surveillance against Americans \ncould be conducted.\n  The Judiciary bill subsequently failed on the floor of the Senate. \nThe amendment I have at the desk is essentially the exclusivity \nlanguage from that Judiciary Committee amendment. It has several \ncosponsors: the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. \nRockefeller; chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Leahy; Senator \nNelson of Florida; Senator Whitehouse; Senator Wyden; Senator Hagel; \nSenator Menendez; Senator Snowe; and Senator Specter.\n  As filed this is an amendment that only covers exclusivity. In the \ninterim period, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee \napproached me about the possibility of a modification of the amendment \nthat would allow the administration to be able to operate outside of \nFISA for a time.\n  We have not been able to come to terms on that amendment. I could not \nagree to the length of time that Mr. Bond proposed, which was 45 days \nplus an additional 45 days, for a total of 3 months, enabling the \nadministration to operate without a FISA warrant.\n  The fact is, since January of 2007, the entire Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram has operated within the confines of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act and under orders from the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. That is, I believe, as it should be.\n  I have a modification to my exclusivity amendment that would limit \nthe period of time outside of FISA following a declaration of war, an \nauthorization for the use of military force, or a major attack against \nthe nation to 30 days. The question is whether I would have unanimous \nconsent from the vice chairman to be able to call up that modification \nof my amendment. But that has not been given to me yet.\n  So at this time, I am going to rest my case on the exclusivity \namendment, and I will have an opportunity, I hope, to argue it later.\n  I would now like to call up my amendment, No. 3919.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Amendment No. 3910 is pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3919 to Amendment No. 3911\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to make another amendment \npending, so I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up amendment No. 3919. This is the FISA Court review of \nimmunity amendment. This is my second amendment which is part of the \nunanimous consent agreement. I do this just to get it before the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Cardin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3919 to amendment No. 3911.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the review of certifications by the Foreign \n                    Intelligence Surveillance Court)\n\n       On page 72, strike line 13 and all that follows through \n     page 73, line 25, and insert the following:\n       (6) Foreign intelligence surveillance court.--The term \n     ``Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court'' means the court \n     established under section 103(a) of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803(a)).\n       (7) Foreign intelligence surveillance court of review.--The \n     term ``Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review'' \n     means the court of review established under section 103(b) of \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. \n     1803(b)).\n\n     SEC. 202.

I ask that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3930\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, shortly we will be voting on the amendment \nI offered that provides for a 4-year sunset in the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  I thank first Senator Rockefeller for his help, Senator Leahy, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\nMikulski, Senator Kennedy, and others who have been instrumental in \nmaking sure that we have provisions in this bill so that we continue \nour congressional oversight.\n  This amendment is not unusual. Every major change in the FISA law has \nbeen accompanied by a sunset. When we passed the PATRIOT Act, we had a \n4-year sunset on most of the provisions. When we revised it, we had a \n3-year sunset on the most controversial provisions. When we passed the \nProtect America Act, we had a very short sunset on it because we were \nnot certain we were getting it right.\n  This change is controversial. If my colleagues think it is not \ncontroversial, look at all the debate that has taken place on the floor \nof this body. We want to make sure that we get it right.\n  It is interesting that as we get close to the time when Congress has \nto act, we seem to get a lot more cooperation from the executive branch \nof Government. The sunset will ensure that we get the type of \ncooperation we need to carry out our responsibilities, to get the \ndocuments we need to make sure we get it right.\n  As I pointed out, technology is changing quickly. I think a 4-year \nperiod is reasonable for us to take a fresh look at this issue.\n  This is not a question of whether we should have a sunset in the \nbill. There is a 6-year sunset in the bill. So why is it so important \nto have a 4-year sunset versus a 6-year sunset? The answer, quite \nfrankly, is we want the next administration that is going to take \noffice in January to focus on this issue and work with us so they can \noperate collectively with the authority of Congress and the laws we \npass in the executive branch. It is important that the next \nadministration focus on this issue, and that is why this amendment is \nparticularly important.\n  My friend from Missouri pointed out that this is an election year. \nNo, it is not. The sunset provision would terminate in December of \n2011, so it is a year before the elections. I think it is the right \ntime for a sunset.\n  I know the administration does not want any sunset in this bill. I \nunderstand that. As I pointed out before, they don't want any \ncongressional oversight. They don't even think they need congressional \nlaws on this subject. They don't even think they need a Congress. But \nwe have our responsibility, and I hope we would want this issue \nrevisited during the next administration. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have discussed this issue before on the \nfloor. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. As I have \nstated previously, the current bill, the Protect America Act, had a 6-\nmonth sunset on it only because we were not able to bring a full, \ncomplete FISA modernization bill to the floor, given the failure of \nCongress to act. We had been requested in April, May, June, and July to \nchange the law. This is a bill that should establish a permanent \noperating authority for the intelligence community and the private \npartners who work with it.\n  As part of the compromise we reached in passing the bill, I did not \nbelieve we should have a sunset, but we agreed on a 6-year sunset. That \nwas part of the deal. The 6-year sunset at least gives us certainty \nover the 6 years in time, that both the intelligence agencies, our \nprivate partners, and our allies abroad who depend upon us would have \ntime to make this system work.\n  The problem we face is that any sunset withholds from our \nintelligence professionals and the private partners the certainty and \nthe permanence they need to protect Americans from terrorism and other \nthreats to national security.\n  Attorney General Mukasey has said there are no fatwahs with \nlimitations by the terrorist leaders who seek to do us harm. They put \nout orders to keep trying to kill us, and these are not going to go \naway. There should be no sunset on this bill.\n  I disagree very strongly with my friend from Maryland that Congress \nis an important part of this. We passed a good bill that adds far more \nprotections than Americans have ever had in intelligence collection. \nThis bill is a good bill, but I can assure him that we have a strong \nbipartisan committee and a strong staff that will continue to oversee, \nsupervise, and watch the surveillance to make sure it works. If we find \nit does not work, we should not wait for a 4-year sunset or a 6-year \nsunset. We should make those changes when they are needed.\n  We can see how long we have had to fight to get this authorization \nthrough. There was no action from the majority from April, May or June, \nuntil the very end of July. We put this bill out on the floor in \nOctober. We could not get the bill up in December because of \nfilibusters. We had to get another 15-day extension so it would not \nexpire.\n  We can act on the bill any time we need, but we cannot deprive our \npartners, our intelligence community, and our allies the protection if \nCongress cannot work.\n  I yield time to the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Presiding Officer, I find myself in \ndisagreement with my vice chairman. I originally wanted 4 years and we \nwent to 6 years because of accommodations that yielded other results. \nIn the wisdom of the joint Intelligence Committee and Judiciary \nCommittee, settling on 4 years makes a lot of sense. I urge the \nadoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Cardin has \noffered is very simple, but it is absolutely critical to this bill. The \namendment would move up the bill's sunset date from 6 years to 4 years. \nCongress would need to revisit the law by the end of 2011 instead of \n2013.\n  The amendment is good public policy. Whenever a significant new law \nis enacted, it is important to require Congress to revisit it at an \nearlier rather than a later date.\n  The FISA bill we are considering is highly complicated legislation \naffecting Americans' security and liberty. It grants the executive \nbranch vast new authority for electronic surveillance at a time of \nrapidly changing technology and rapidly changing threats. Even the \ncountry's leading national security experts cannot say for sure what \nour national security challenges will look like in 3 years, much less \nhow this legislation will work out in practice.\n  This is also highly controversial legislation. I don't need to remind \nanyone in this Chamber of the intense debate that has been taking place \nover many parts of this bill. The FISA rules on electronic surveillance \naffect every American. They are the only thing that stands between the \nfreedom of Americans to make a private phone call, send a private e-\nmail, or search the Internet, and the ability of the Government to \nlisten in on the call, read the e-mail, and review the Internet search.\n  In this information age, FISA gives Americans basic protection \nagainst Government tyranny and abuse, and we owe it to the American \npeople to revisit it promptly to make sure its protections are \neffective.\n  Congress also needs an earlier sunset because we need more \ninformation to assess how these new policies will work in practice. The \nongoing confusion and controversy in this area mean that Congress does \nnot have enough knowledge or confidence to be sure the legislation is \nadequate.\n  With an early sunset, Congress will have to make an early assessment \nof how the legislation is being interpreted and implemented. We will be \nable to identify problems and abuses much sooner. If changes are made \nto the law in 2011, it will be because experience has shown that \nchanges are needed.\n  We passed this exact same amendment in the Judiciary Committee in the \nmiddle of November, and in the weeks since then, I have heard only two \narguments against it, both from the White House. Neither of them holds \nup.\n  The first objection is that there has already been sufficient \nconsideration of these issues, so that Congress should be able to pass \na permanent FISA reform right now. Everyone agrees that short sunsets \nare valuable when Congress has not had time to consider an issue \nthoroughly and develop a factual record. But the Bush administration \nclaims there has already been a detailed and informed discussion of \nFISA modernization.\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\n  That objection is wrong on the facts. The administration has recently \nstarted to work with Congress more openly, but there is still a great \ndeal we don't know about how it has been conducting its electronic \nsurveillance. Much of what we have learned has come from leaks to the \npress.\n  A few months ago, the White House decided to share with the Senate \ncertain documents on the role of the telecommunications companies in an \neffort to obtain retroactive immunity for them. This was the first time \nthe administration had ever shown Congress any documents on its \nwarrantless surveillance. So far, however, the White House has shared \nonly a small number of documents with a small number of Senators--and \nuntil late last month, not with any Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. Such selective disclosure is a pale shadow of the real \ndisclosure Congress needs to enact good legislation.\n  That objection is also wrong as a matter of policy. No matter how \nmuch discussion there may have been, this is highly complicated \nlegislation that makes major, untested changes in our surveillance \nlaws. It is impossible for Congress to analyze these issues in the \nabstract, without any track record to evaluate. With a law as complex, \nnew, and important as this, a short sunset is responsible policy.\n  The second objection I have heard is that a short sunset introduces \ntoo much uncertainty to the rules affecting our intelligence \nprofessionals. The administration says it is not efficient for agencies \nto develop new policies and procedures, only to have the law change \nwithin a brief period. They say the intelligence community operates \nmore effectively when the rules governing intelligence professionals \nare well-established, and are not in doubt.\n  This objection is more serious, but it too dissolves upon \nconsideration. It is true that there may be a little extra uncertainty \nthat comes with a short sunset. But the much more significant \nuncertainty is whether all of the changes made by this bill will be \ngood for the country--and there is no way to be sure about this ahead \nof time.\n  Intelligence professionals should not be locked into a surveillance \nsystem that doesn't work well for them, and Americans should not be \nlocked into a system that fails to protect their security or their \nrights. The early sunset guarantees that Congress will review these \nextremely complicated, untested, and powerful new authorities and how \nthey are actually being used by the executive branch.\n  The administration's argument against a sunset is an argument against \ncongressional oversight of FISA. The White House wants Congress to pass \na new FISA law, and then to look the other way while the executive \nbranch implements and interprets its new powers. They want Congress to \ntrust them when they tell us how the law is working, rather than look \ninto it ourselves.\n  Given this administration's track record of warrantless illegal \nspying, ``trust us'' is not an acceptable way to proceed. Congress \nneeds to stay on top of this issue to make sure that our surveillance \nlaws are keeping Americans safe and protecting their freedom. That is \nwhat we have been elected to do, and that is what the Constitution \nrequires us to do.\n  As I said at the start, this amendment is very simple. It moves the \nsunset date up by 2 years. Yet it may well be the single most important \nthing Congress can do to ensure that we reform FISA in a responsible \nand effective way.\n  This sunset amendment is a win-win for national security and civil \nliberties. It will ensure that Congress remains engaged on the crucial \nissues of electronic surveillance that affect all Americans. To make \nsure that our new FISA law actually gets the job done, I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me briefly summarize the comments \nSenator Bond made. It is true that the terrorist groups do not have any \ntypes of restrictions on what they can do. They do not have any \nlegislature. They do not have any courts. They do not have any \nconstitution. They have no respect for human life. They have no civil \nliberties with which they have to deal. But that is what makes this \nNation the great nation it is. It is our responsibility to make sure \nthat we carry out what the people of our Nation expect us to do.\n  Let me point out that the PATRIOT Act, when it was passed, had a 4-\nyear sunset. Then we reauthorized some of the provisions, but we kept a \n3-year sunset. We have used sunsets that have been shorter, and on \ncontroversial laws, a 4-year sunset is the minimum we should have.\n  I urge my colleagues to understand that it is important that the next \nadministration work with us so we never get back to where we are this \nyear, where the executive branch is heading in one direction and we \ndon't know what they are doing. Let's work together so we can keep \nAmericans safe, having the administration work with us next year so we \nunderstand what they are doing, they have our support and, if \nnecessary, we modify the laws to give them the tools they need to keep \nAmerica safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 10 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is a great nation because we have kept \nour country safe. We have kept our country safe, and we are working \nvery closely with the intelligence community. That is why we have a \ngood bill. The intelligence community says we must have the certainty \nat least of 6 years. I wanted to see none. That is why we came to an \nagreement in the Intelligence Committee and a 13-to-2 vote said we \nshould have this bill with a 6-year sunset.\n  We have a solid bipartisan product addressing civil liberties \nconcerns, while making sure the intelligence community has the tools \nand authorities it needs to keep us safe.\n  As I said, this was an important part of our compromise to get the \nbill through. Our intelligence collectors and troops on the battlefield \nneed certainty, not rules that will expire in 4 years. That is why both \nthe Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General strongly \noppose shortening the 6-year sunset in the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, quickly, in closing, I thank the chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee for his support of this amendment. This \namendment does nothing to jeopardize the bipartisan work of the \nIntelligence Committee. It preserves the appropriate role of the \nlegislative branch of Government, and I would hope all my colleagues \nwould want to support that change to make it clear that the next \nadministration must come back to Congress.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is a 60-vote agreement on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3930. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr.  Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nGraham), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and table that \nmotion.\n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n\n\n           Congratulating Senator Inouye on His 15,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 2LT Daniel K. Inouye distinguished himself \nby extraordinary heroism in action on April 21, 1945, in the vicinity \nof San Terenzo, Italy.\n  While attacking a defended ridge guarding an important road junction, \nSecond Lieutenant Inouye skillfully directed his platoon through a hail \nof automatic weapons and small arms fire in a swift and enveloping \nmovement that resulted in the capture of an artillery and mortar post \nand brought his men to within 40 yards of the hostile force.\n  Emplaced in bunkers and rock formations, the enemy halted the advance \nwith crossfire from three machine guns. With complete disregard for his \npersonal safety, Lieutenant Inouye crawled up the treacherous slope to \nwithin 5 yards of the nearest machine gun and hurled two grenades, \ndestroying the emplacement.\n  Before the enemy could retaliate, he stood up and neutralized a \nsecond machine gun nest. Although wounded by a sniper's bullet, he \ncontinued to engage other hostile positions at close range until an \nexploding grenade shattered his right arm.\n  Despite the intense pain, he refused evacuation and continued to \ndirect his platoon until enemy resistance was broken and his men were \nagain deployed in defensive positions.\n  In the attack, 25 enemy soldiers were killed and 8 others were \ncaptured. By his gallant, aggressive tactics, and by his indomitable \nleadership, Lieutenant Inouye enabled his platoon to advance through \nformidable resistance and was instrumental in the capture of the ridge.\n  Lieutenant Inouye's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in \nkeeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect \ngreat credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, these are the words that \ndescribe the actions of heroism of Senator Inouye, when, as a young \nman, he put his own safety aside for others. As a result of that he was \nawarded America's highest honor for gallantry and heroism, the Medal of \nHonor.\n  The reason I bring this to everyone's attention today is that we have \na lot of new Senators. I want every one of them to know this man Dan \nInouye is a man who was born to be a hero. He never thinks of himself \nbut of others. In my 25-plus years in Congress, that is how I have \nfound him to be.\n  I rise to express joy and honor for my friend and colleague Senator \nInouye on the occasion of his 15,000th rollcall vote, which was just \ncompleted.\n  Dan Inouye was born to Japanese-American immigrants in Honolulu, the \neldest of four children. Did he ever set an example--he sure did--for \nhis siblings. On the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, with chaos \nreigning, and being only 17 years old, he volunteered to provide \nmedical help to the injured, and there were a lot of injured. After \nhigh school, he wanted to become a medical doctor. At the time the U.S. \nArmy banned Japanese Americans from becoming soldiers. The war broke \nout, but this ban was dropped, and as a teenager, Dan Inouye \nimmediately put his medical ambition aside and signed up to serve his \ncountry in the military. Perhaps it was fate that Dan Inouye joined the \nlegendary 442nd regimental combat team which in no small part, thanks \nto his bravery, became the most highly decorated unit in the history of \nthe U.S. Army.\n  I can't improve the words of praise this great man earned upon \nreceiving the Medal of Honor for his courageous service. I read that. \nBut I think we all here recognize we serve with a very extraordinary \nhuman being. While he was recovering from his injuries--and it was more \nthan his arm; his whole body was hurt and, as a result he spent years \nin a military hospital--in the military hospital, he met another \nwounded warrior, a man named Bob Dole. They recuperated together, both \nhaving severe arm injuries, among other things. The only injuries you \ncould see with Senator Dole and Senator Inouye were the arms. But, of \ncourse, their injuries were much more severe than that. While there, \nSenator Dole told Senator Inouye, both to be Senators: I am going to \nrun for Congress. Senator Inouye beat him there by a few years. That \nchance encounter began a lifetime of friendship that took these two \nwounded warriors from hospital beds in Battle Creek, MI, to seats in \nthe Senate. The friendship and close working relationship they have \nshared is emblematic of Senator Inouye's lifelong commitment to \nbipartisanship in the pursuit of progress.\n  In his decades of public service, Senator Inouye has been a leader on \nissue after issue of concern to the American people. As chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Defense Appropriations, he is the leading expert and \nnational advocate for national security, strengthening the military, \nand honoring our troops and veterans.\n  As the first person of Japanese descent to serve in the Senate, Dan \nInouye is a soft-spoken trailblazer.\n  On a personal level, I was a very new Senator and he had made a \ncommitment to do a fundraiser for me in Florida. He didn't know at the \ntime he made this commitment that there would be other things that \nwould be in the way of that. There was a little thing in the way, his \nwife's birthday. She understood. He understood. And he, because he had \nmade a commitment, made the personal sacrifice and came down there. I \nhave never forgotten that. That is why when he sought a leadership \nposition in the Senate, I was the first to stand in line to support \nSenator Inouye. His heroism and extraordinary lifetime of public \nservice are an inspiration to us all.\n  But on a personal note, Landra and I, and all my colleagues, are so \nhappy and pleased to hear the recent news that Dan and Irene will be \nmarried this May. All of us in the Senate family wish them happiness \nand joy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate has been conducting its \nbusiness here in Washington for just over 200 years. For more than one-\nfifth of that time, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii has been casting \nrollcall votes. And just now, he cast his 15,000th, making him the \nfourth most prolific voter in Senate history.\n  If Senator Inouye had anything to say about it, I have no doubt the \nmoment would have passed without fanfare. Some Senators make their \npresence felt by talking a lot or by being flamboyant. Dan Inouye has \nalways been another sort of Senator.\n  He is one of only 107 Americans alive today to have received the \nMedal of Honor for combat bravery. He is the iconic political figure of \nthe 50th State, the only original member of a congressional delegation \nstill serving in Congress. And he has ensured through many years of \ndiligent service on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that an \nentire generation of America's uniformed military has gone well \nprepared into battle and was well cared for when they returned.\n  Despite all this, Dan's quiet demeanor and adherence to a code of \nhonor and professionalism has made him a stranger to controversy and to \nthe fleeting fame that often comes with it. He is a man who has every \nreason to call attention to himself but who never does. He is the kind \nof man, in short, that America has always been grateful to have, \nespecially in her darkest hours, men who lead by example and who expect \nnothing in return.\n  Historians tell us about one of those dark moments early in our \nNation's\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nhistory, just after the surrender at Yorktown. Hostilities with the \nBritish had ended, but America was on the brink of a military coup. \nCongress had promised to give officers and soldiers back pay, food, and \nclothing, and hadn't delivered. The situation grew so serious that U.S. \nofficers threatened an armed revolt.\n  In a meeting at Newburgh, George Washington urged patience. He \nassured the officers Congress would act justly. And then, with anger \nand impatience still in the air, he pulled a letter from his pocket \nfrom Congress. Staring at it for a few moments with a look of \nconfusion, he reached into his pocket again and pulled out a pair of \nreading glasses that only his closest advisers had ever seen. ``You \nwill permit me, gentlemen, to put on my spectacles,'' he said. ``For I \nhave not only grown gray, but almost blind, in the service of my \ncountry.''\n  Some of the officers wept with shame. One man's heroism was enough to \ndissolve whatever hostilities remained. Revolt was averted, peace \npreserved, and a roomful of men learned that day what it meant to be an \nAmerican.\n  More than a century and a half later, after another dark moment in \nour Nation's history, another roomful of men would learn a similar \nlesson. The year was 1959, the place was the U.S. Capitol, and a young \nman named Daniel Inouye was being sworn into office.\n  The memory of a hard-fought war against the Japanese was fresh in \nmany minds as the Speaker, Sam Rayburn, prepared to administer the \noath--not only to the first Member from Hawaii, but to the first \nAmerican of Japanese descent ever elected. Rayburn spoke: ``Raise your \nright hand and repeat after me . . .''\n  Here's how another Congressman would later record what followed: \n``The hush deepened as the young Congressman raised not his right hand \nbut his left and repeated the oath of office. There was no right hand. \nIt had been lost in combat by that young American soldier in World War \nII. And who can deny that, at that moment, a ton of prejudice slipped \nquietly to the floor of the House of Representatives.''\n  As a young boy growing up in Hawaii, Dan and his friends always \nthought of themselves as Americans. But after Pearl Harbor, they found \nthemselves lumped together with the enemy. It was one of the reasons so \nmany of them felt such an intense desire to serve. Their loyalty and \npatriotism had been questioned, and they were determined to show their \npatriotism beyond any doubt.\n  At first they weren't allowed to volunteer. A committee of the Army, \ncaving to prejudice, recommended against forming a combat unit of \nJapanese Americans. But they persisted, and on June 5, 1942, the policy \nchanged.\n  In reversing the previous order, President Roosevelt said, quote, \n``Americanism is a matter of the mind and heart. Americanism is not, \nand never was, a matter of race or ancestry.''\n  The overwhelming response of Japanese Americans proved Roosevelt \nright. Eighty percent of the military-age men of Japanese descent who \nlived in Hawaii volunteered for the first-ever, all-Japanese-American \ncombat team. And among the 2,686 accepted was an 18-year-old freshman \nat the University of Hawaii named Dan Inouye. \n  The 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the famous ``Go for Broke'' \nregiment, would become the most decorated military unit in American \nhistory. SGT Dan Inouye was one of its combat platoon leaders. He spent \n3 bloody months in the Rome Arno campaign and 2 brutal weeks rescuing a \nTexas battalion that was surrounded by German forces, an operation \nmilitary historians often describe as one of the most significant \nmilitary battles of the 20th century.\n  After the rescue, Sargeant Inouye was sent back to Italy, where on \nApril 21, 1945, he displayed ``extraordinary heroism,'' in leading his \nplatoon through tough resistance to capture an important strategic \nridge. Crawling within five yards of the nearest machine gun, he \ndestroyed it with grenades, then stood up and destroyed several others \nmachine gun nests at close range--even as a sniper's bullet shattered \nhis arm. Despite the pain, he continued to direct his men until the \nenemy's retreat, and become one of the most decorated soldiers of the \nwar.\n  Dan would later spend nearly 2 years in an Army hospital in Battle \nCreek, MI, and it was there that he met a wounded soldier, as the \nmajority leader mentioned, from Kansas. Dan had always wanted to be a \nsurgeon, but that dream faded away on a ridge in Italy. He decided to \nask his friend what he had in mind for a career. Politics was the \nreply. Dan was intrigued. And many years later, as a freshman in \nCongress, he wrote a note to Bob Dole, playfully taunting him for not \nmaking it here first.\n  It is fitting that Dan owes his Senate career, in a sense, to a \nRepublican. He has never let narrow party interests stand in the way of \nfriendship or cooperation on matters of real national importance. His \nfriendship with Senator Stevens is one of the most storied in all of \nSenate history. And I know I have never hesitated to call Dan when I \nthought something important was at stake. As Dan has always said, ``to \nhave friends, you've got to be a friend.''\n  It is a good principle, and it is one he has always lived up to. But \nit is just one of the remarkable traits that have made him one of \nAmerica's great men.\n  On the morning of his first day in the Army, Dan rode part of the way \nto the barracks on a bus with his dad. He later recalled that at one \npoint his father grew somber, offered his first son some brief advice \nabout the importance of having good morals, then said something about \nthe country he would soon defend.\n  ``America has been good to us,'' his father said. ``And now--I would \nnever have chosen it to be this way--but it is you who must try to \nreturn the goodness of this country.''\n  Dan Inouye would make his father very proud. He has more than repaid \nthe goodness of this country. I know I speak for every other Senator \nwho has served with him, the people of Hawaii, and anyone who respects \nthis institution or loves this country, when I say thank you for the \ndignity, the grace, and the heroism with which you have lived your \ngreat American life. You are an example and an inspiration to all of \nus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, in the year 1924, a child was born to a \nwoman who was nurtured by a Hawaiian family. He was born in Hawaii as \nan American of Japanese ancestry. He was brought up in Hawaii and went \nto school there, graduated from McKinley High School in 1942, and \ndecided to serve our country, as he did. You have heard others tell \nabout his activities as an Army person. But he went on to finally \nreceive the Medal of Honor from this country, which is the greatest \nmedal anyone can receive. This is Senator Dan Inouye.\n  When he finished his service, he used the GI bill, of which he was a \nrecipient, to be educated. When he returned to Hawaii, he entered into \npolitics and served in the State legislature.\n  When Hawaii became a State in 1959, he was Hawaii's first U.S. House \nof Representatives Member. It was from there he did run for the Senate \nand was elected and has been here since that time. Dan Inouye has \nserved our country well over these years, and he has served Hawaii \nwell.\n  So today I rise to mark a historic occasion, which is Senator \nInouye's 15,000th vote. This historic milestone is compelling evidence \nof Senator Inouye's devotion to public service. The people of Hawaii \nhave given him their trust, and in return he has fought relentlessly \nfor our State and our country.\n  Dan Inouye is an institution, without question, in the Senate, and I \nlook forward to casting many more votes with my good friend and mentor \nand brother to benefit Hawaii and strengthen the United States.\n  God bless you, Senator Inouye, and with much aloha.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I am deeply moved and most grateful for \nthe generous and warm remarks of my colleagues. I shall do my very best \nto live up to their praise.\n  I thank you very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3927 To Amendment No. 3911\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the substitution of the United States in \n                         certain civil actions)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I now call up amendment No. 3927.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Mr. Whitehouse, proposes an amendment numbered 3927 to \n     amendment No. 3911.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Friday, January 25, 2008, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, there are 2 hours set aside for this \namendment. We have about 24 minutes between now and 4:30, when the \nSenate will move on to other business.\n  I have just discussed with my distinguished colleague, Senator \nWhitehouse, and the managers--Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman \nBond--my intent to speak relatively briefly on an opening statement and \nthen yield to Senator Whitehouse and give an opportunity for opponents \nof the amendment to speak because I think that will tell the Senators \nand staffs what this is about and perhaps generate more interest and \nmore concern to follow, and then have additional debate at a later time \non the remainder of our time.\n  At the outset, I compliment my distinguished colleague, Senator \nWhitehouse, who is in his first term in the Senate. I thank him for the \nwork he has done coordinately with me and others on this bill.\n  Senator Whitehouse brings a very distinguished record to the U.S. \nCongress. He has served as U.S. attorney for Rhode Island. He served as \nRhode Island's attorney general. And he has made quite a contribution \nto the Judiciary Committee on what is a very complex matter.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin and \nSenator Cardin be added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The essence of the pending amendment is to substitute \nthe U.S. Government as a party defendant for the telephone companies, \ninstead of having the current provision which provides for retroactive \nimmunity to the telephone companies. The bill under consideration would \ngive those companies retroactive immunity and foreclose litigation \nwhich is now pending in some 40 cases.\n  This issue is at the heart of the balance of values between national \nsecurity and constitutional rights. There is no doubt, at least on this \nstate of the record--where we do not know all of the details as to what \nthe telephone companies have been doing--but it is presumed, for \npurposes of this argument, and I think accurately so, that what the \ntelephone companies are doing has produced very high-level intelligence \nfor the U.S. Government.\n  There is no doubt of the importance of high-level intelligence in our \nfight against terrorism. We sustained 9/11. We fight a deadly enemy \naround the world--al-Qaida. We want to protect the United States and \nits people and others, so that high-level intelligence is very \nimportant.\n  At the same time, constitutional rights are very important. I believe \nthe substitution which Senator Whitehouse and I are proposing \naccomplishes the objective of a continuation of getting this very vital \nintelligence information for national security and, at the same time, \nprotects constitutional rights.\n\n  The essence of the proposal is that the U.S. Government would step \ninto the shoes of the telephone companies, have the same defenses, no \nmore and no less. The Government could not assert governmental immunity \nbecause the telephone companies could not assert governmental immunity. \nThe Government could assert the State Secrets Doctrine, just as the it \nhas by intervening in the cases against the telephone companies.\n  I believe it is vital that the courts remain open. I say that because \non our delicate constitutional balance of separation of powers, the \nCongress has been totally ineffective on oversight and on restraining \nthe expansion of executive authority. But the courts have the capacity, \nthe will, and the effectiveness to maintain a balance.\n  But we find that the President has asserted his constitutional \nauthority under article II to disregard statutes, the law of the land \npassed by Congress and signed by the President.\n  I start with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which \nprovides that the only way to wiretap is to have a court order. The \nExecutive Branch initiated the Terrorist Surveillance Program in flat \nviolation of that statute. Now, the President argues that he has \nconstitutional authority which supersedes the statute. And if he does, \nthe statute cannot modify the Constitution. Only a constitutional \namendment can. But that program, initiated in 2001, is still being \nlitigated in the courts. So we do not know on the balancing test \nwhether the Executive has the asserted constitutional authority.\n  But if you foreclose a judicial decision, the courts are cut off. \nThen the executive branch has violated the National Security Act of \n1947, which mandates that the Intelligence Committees of both the House \nand the Senate be informed of matters like the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram. I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the 109th \nCongress. The chairman and the ranking member, under protocol and \npractice, ought to be notified about a program like that. But I was \nsurprised to read about it in the newspapers one day, on the final day \nof argument on the PATRIOT Act Re-authorization. It was a long time, \nwith a lot of pressure--really to get the confirmation of General \nHayden as CIA Director--before the executive branch finally complied \nwith the statute to notify the full Intelligence Committees. Now, on \nthe other hand, the courts have been effective--and I will amplify this \nat a later time because I want to yield soon to Senator Whitehouse and \ngive the opponents an opportunity to speak before 4:30. But in the \nHamdan case, the Supreme Court held that the President does not have a \nblank check in the war on terror. Justices held that the President \ncannot establish military commissions unless Congress authorizes it. In \nHamdi, the Supreme Court concluded due process required that a citizen \nheld in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful \nopportunity to contest the factual basis for that contention. In Rasul \nv. Bush, the Supreme Court held that the Federal habeas corpus statute \ngave district courts jurisdiction to hear challenges by aliens held at \nGuantanamo Bay.\n\n  Well, this is not Pakistan, where President Musharraf can suspend the \nSupreme Court Justices and hold the Chief Justice under House arrest. \nThis is America. The balance is maintained only because the courts are \nopen. I believe it would be a major mistake to close the courts on \npending litigation when the courts have provided the only effective way \nto check expanded executive authority, which we have seen in many \nlives. I will amplify those later, on matters such as signing \nstatements.\n  But that is the essence of the argument. I am going to yield now to \nmy distinguished colleague from Rhode Island because I think it is \nuseful, as we move forward in the debate, to crystallize the issues. We \nknow Senators and even staff don't pay a great deal of attention until \nthe time for a vote is near, and when we see the essence of the two \npositions, I think we may create some more interest and have more \npeople join this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I consider it a great personal honor to join him in \nsponsoring this important amendment. He has served with great \ndistinction as a prosecuting attorney for Philadelphia for many years \nand then has served in this Senate for 27 years with great distinction, \nmaking him the longest serving Senator in Pennsylvania's history.\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\nHe has chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, and he has always shown \ngreat intelligence and independence. In addition to all that, I am the \njunior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and he also has shown \nexceptional courtesy and good will toward me, notwithstanding my junior \nstatus and notwithstanding my position on the other side of the aisle. \nSo it is with considerable pride and also considerable affection that I \njoin him in supporting this amendment.\n  We face, as Senator Specter said, the critical balance between \nfreedom and security, which will always be difficult to maintain as \nlong as a threat of terrorism looms. As we all know, one of the many \ndifficult issues that balance presents to us is the question of whether \nto grant immunity to telecommunications carriers who may have assisted \nthe Government in this surveillance program.\n  On the one hand, the administration has called for a blanket grant of \nimmunity to these companies. On the other hand, others have proposed \npreserving the status quo. We are proposing a more sensible, practical, \nmiddle path that does less constitutional damage and still protects the \nessential equities involved.\n  The choice is to give immunity, to stop the litigation, to end the \nclaims against the companies, and take away the plaintiffs' case \nagainst them, which is not fair. Nothing yet suggests this is not \ncompletely legitimate litigation. The courts who are considering it \nhaven't thrown it out, it is in process right now, and it is not fair \nto the plaintiffs to up and take away their day in court. Moreover, \nthere is a huge separation of powers problem of a legislature intruding \ninto ongoing litigation, now before a judge, and taking away active \nclaims. We would be taking away plaintiffs' rights and claims, taking \naway their due process without even providing for the basic judicial \nfinding that the defendant companies acted reasonably and in good \nfaith. That damage suggests that blanket immunity is not a great \nsolution and, indeed, it may even be unconstitutional.\n  The other choice we have on the immunity question is to do nothing. \nBut consider this: the Government has forbidden the telephone company \ndefendants to defend themselves, claiming state secrets privilege. They \nhave tied the companies' hands behind their backs in this litigation, \nmuzzled them, forbidden them to offer any defense. In my view, that is \nalso not fair, particularly if the Government put these companies into \nthis mess in the first place. If the Government wants to forbid self-\ndefense by these companies, the decent thing for the Government to do \nwould be to step into the lawsuit, and defend on their behalf. The \nGovernment should not leave legitimate American companies in the \njudicial arena, bound and muzzled, unable to defend themselves, and not \nitself be willing to step in the ring and take over. So it strikes me \nthat doing nothing is not a great solution either.\n  The solution that fits the problem we face is this Specter-Whitehouse \namendment, and it has two very simple parts. One, a judicial \ndetermination, confidentially, in the FISA Court, whether these \ncompanies acted reasonably and in good faith. That is a very simple \ndetermination that can be made with a very small amount of testimony \nbased in many respects simply on the record of what was provided to \ncompanies. Second, if they did act reasonably and in good faith, there \nis then a well-established procedure under rule 25 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, rule 25(c) to be specific, that can substitute the \nGovernment for these companies in this litigation.\n\n  First, let me talk about the good-faith determination. I hope we can \nall agree that if the companies did not act reasonably and in good \nfaith, they shouldn't get protection. I hope we can agree on that. We \nestablish a simple procedure for the good-faith question to be answered \nby the FISA Court. We in Congress should not be the judges of that. We \nare not judges. Good faith is a judicial determination. This is ongoing \nlitigation. The companies have, of course, asserted to us that they \nacted in good faith, but that is no basis for us to conclude that, and \nwe surely should not rely on one side's assertion in making a decision \nof this importance. Most Senators have not even been read into the \nclassified materials that would allow them to reach a fair conclusion. \nThis body is literally incapable of forming a fair opinion without \naccess by most Members to the facts. So we need to provide a fair \nmechanism for a finding of good faith by a proper judicial body with \nthe proper provisions for secrecy, which the FISA Court has.\n  Second, substituting in the Government. Well, if it turns out the \nGovernment directed the companies to engage in conduct that broke the \nlaw, the Government is the proper authority. If the companies acted \nreasonably and in good faith but ended up somehow breaking the law \nbecause of what the Government directed them to do, the real actor is \nthe Government. Lawyers in this body will understand this is analogous \nto a principal-agent relationship. The Government is in effect the \nprincipal, the company acting as directed is the Government's agent, \nand under principal-agency law, the principal is liable for the acts of \nthe agent.\n  So the simple solution contained in this amendment follows the law, \nit is founded in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and it fits the \nproblem we face. Consider: No one has legitimate rights and due process \nsummarily taken away. This is, after all, the United States of America.\n  Two, if the carriers acted reasonably and in good faith, the \nGovernment steps in for them. In fact, the carriers get a judgment in \ntheir favor dismissing them from the cases.\n  Third, no one is forbidden to defend themselves in ongoing \nlitigation. No one is bound and muzzled but forced to stay in a \njudicial fight.\n  Fourth, there is no intrusion by Congress into ongoing adjudication, \nno separation of powers trespassed.\n  Finally, if the companies acted reasonably and in good faith at the \ndirection of the Government but ended up breaking the law, the \nGovernment truly is the morally proper party to the case. So this is \nnot just sensible, but it is right. I hope my colleagues will support \nthis amendment.\n  I see time is a little short, but let me continue a little bit longer \nbecause I wish to expand a little bit on this concern that intrusion by \nCongress into ongoing adjudication presents a separation of powers \nproblem. Let me go all the way back to why we set up the separation of \npowers in the first place. I quote U.S. Supreme Court Justice Scalia \nspecifically who said:\n\n       The sense of a sharp necessity to separate the legislative \n     from the judicial power triumphed among the Framers of the \n     new Constitution prompted by a crescendo of legislative \n     interference with private judgments of the courts.\n\n  So the question of a legislature interfering with ongoing litigation \nwas the live concern of the Founding Fathers when they separated the \npowers. In a case called the United States v. Klein, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt threw out a congressional statute that purported to provide the \nrule of decision in a particular case, saying of this relationship \nbetween the legislative and judicial powers:\n\n       It is of vital importance that the legislative and judicial \n     powers be kept distinct. It is the intention of the \n     Constitution that each of the great courts and departments of \n     the government--the legislative, the executive, and the \n     judicial--shall be in its sphere independent of the others.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues who are considering this to consider the \nsensible merits of this amendment, to consider this is the morally \nright way to go forward, and further, to consider that it reduces \nconsiderably the risk that if we go ahead and give these companies this \nimmunity, the companies end up with a lawsuit, they end up with a case \nand a statute that is thrown out because it is unconstitutional, and in \neffect we create a snarl rather than a solution for them.\n  So with that said, I would again like to say how very much it means \nto me to be cosponsoring this amendment with the very distinguished \nSenator and former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter \nof Pennsylvania.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am reluctant to ask, but I must, \nhow much time remains before 4:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes before 4:30.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Wonderful.\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\n  Madam President, I simply rise to say I will oppose this amendment \nand I will oppose it strongly and I think for a series of very good \nreasons. But in spite of my eloquence and the ability to talk very \nquickly, I simply cannot do the task in 1\\1/2\\ minutes. So I ask \nunanimous consent to reserve my right to speak further at the \nappropriate time before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, with the time so graciously allowed us by \nthe proponents of this measure--and I know it was not intentional--I \nwill only say a couple of quick things. No. 1, the courts are not \nprecluded. The underlying bill, the bipartisan bill, permits lawsuits \nto go forward against the Government and the Government employees. No. \n2, there was notification of the Big Eight--the ranking members and \nchairmen of the Intelligence Committees and the leaders--when this \nprogram was started. No. 3, article 2 does give the President the power \nto exercise foreign intelligence collections.\n  I would say to my colleague who has been on the Intelligence \nCommittee, if he doesn't think Congress has been effective in \noverseeing programs, he has not seen the committee that is chaired by \nSenator Rockefeller and on which I ride shotgun with him. The Judiciary \nCommittee--if it was not advised, the Judiciary Committee's primary \nresponsibility is not intelligence. That is the Intelligence Committee. \nWe get the sensitive information. We spend a great deal of time. We \nhave reviewed it. We believe it is a disaster for our intelligence \ncollection to have substitution because we would see our most sensitive \nmeans of collection exposed. The private parties that might have \nparticipated would be put through tremendous economic and commercial \nharm and subjected potentially to harassment, and perhaps even \nterrorist attacks, for having worked with us.\n  Therefore, I strongly urge that our colleagues defeat amendment No. \n3927, the Specter-Whitehouse substitution amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the amendment that I have offered with \nSenators Kerry and Menendez addresses a serious problem with the FISA \nbill that we are now considering, and I am very pleased that it has \nbeen incorporated into the bill by unanimous consent.\n  The amendment clarifies that under the new authority provided in this \nlegislation, the Government may not intentionally acquire a \ncommunication when it knows ahead of time that the sender and all of \nthe intended recipients are located in the United States. When the \nGovernment knows ahead of time that both the person making the call and \nthe person receiving the call are located inside the United States, it \nwill have to get a court order before it can listen in on that call. \nThis is the way FISA has always worked, and my amendment makes sure \nthat the law stays that way.\n  There is broad agreement that communications known ahead of time to \nbe purely domestic should continue to be governed by the standard FISA \nrules. Indeed, the Bush administration has repeatedly stated that it \ndoes not intend to use the new authority granted under the Protect \nAmerica Act or this legislation to acquire communications that are \npurely domestic, without obtaining a court order first. The \nadministration acknowledges that when the Government knows that all the \nparties to a conversation are in the United States, a specific court \norder should be needed to intercept that conversation.\n  I haven't heard a single Member of Congress disagree with this point. \nBut without this amendment, the FISA bill's new authority could be used \nto acquire purely domestic communications without a court order.\n  The bill requires the Government's ``targeting procedures'' to be \ndesigned ``to ensure that any acquisition . . . is limited to targeting \npersons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.'' \nThe problem arises because sometimes the ``target'' of the surveillance \nmay be abroad, but the communications that the Government wants to \nacquire may occur entirely inside the United States, because the \nsubject matter concerns the target who is abroad. The term ``target'' \nis not defined in FISA, but the legislative history states that the \n``target'' is the person or entity ``about whom or from whom \ninformation is sought.'' That broad definition is capable of being \ninterpreted to allow surveillance of people other than a ``target.''\n  For example, the Government might believe that two Americans in the \nUnited States--let's call them Tom and Mary--will discuss a third party \nwho is located outside the country. Under this bill, that third party \ncan be a group, not just an individual, and the Government can obtain a \nblanket warrant that allows it to spy on everything that group does in \nthe future. Although the authors of the bill have stated this should \nnot occur, the concern is that when Tom and Mary talk to each other, \nthe Government might claim the third party is the ``target'' who \nprovides the legal basis for the surveillance--with the practical \nresult being that the Government could listen in on the conversation \nwithout making any showing to any court about Tom and Mary.\n  My amendment protects innocent Americans by clarifying that \ntraditional FISA rules still govern for communications known to be \noccurring within the country. The Government could still spy on Tom and \nMary--but it would have to obtain a warrant first, with the usual \nexception for emergencies.\n  According to the administration, the law already requires this. The \nadministration has said flat out that it will not wiretap purely \ndomestic communications without first obtaining a court order.\n  But these kinds of statements are no answer when Americans' basic \nliberties are at stake. ``Trust us'' is not enough.\n  FISA experts such as David Kris, a highly respected former lawyer at \nthe Justice Department and the author of the leading treatise on FISA \nlaw, believe that the legislation is not clear right now. And if the \nlaw is unclear, there will be tremendous pressure on the intelligence \ncommunity to apply it as aggressively as possible, because it is their \nduty to do everything they can within the boundaries of law.\n  As Mr. Kris recently stated, even though the Intelligence Committee \nbill prohibits the targeting of persons known to be in the United \nStates, it ``does not, however, foreclose all surveillance of [purely] \ndomestic communications . . . because surveillance can 'target' an \ninternational terrorist group located abroad, but still be directed at \na domestic telephone number or other domestic communications \nfacility.''\n  Mr. Kris has said that his ``principal concern about [this bill] . . \n. is that it resembles the Protect America Act in allowing surveillance \nof domestic communications'' without a warrant. This is a radical \nchange to a FISA system that has protected Americans for three decades. \nIf put to a vote, I have no doubt that Americans would reject it.\n  This concern can't be waved away by the administration telling us \nthat it takes a different legal view. When one of the top FISA experts \nin the country says that the law is not clear, we should listen.\n  Promises about how the Government will interpret the law in the \nfuture are not enough. If we all agree about a specific policy goal--\nand everyone should agree that in purely domestic-to-domestic \nsituations, the traditional FISA rules should apply--then we should be \nvery clear about that goal in the legislation we write. Any FISA law \nthat Congress passes may set the rules on surveillance for years to \ncome, and different administrations may interpret ambiguous language in \ndifferent ways.\n  My amendment makes clear that the traditional FISA rules apply when \nthe Government knows ahead of time that the communication is purely \ndomestic. The amendment does not add any substantive changes to the \nlaw; it adds clarity and certainly where now there is ambiguity and \nconfusion.\n  Americans deserve to feel confident when they are talking with their \nfriends, neighbors, and loved ones inside the United States that they \nwill not be spied on without a warrant. Bringing clarity to this area \nof the law is good for Americans' liberties, and it is good for \nnational security. I congratulate my colleagues for adopting this \namendment.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S715-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S715-S725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S715]]\n RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF \n                                  2008\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 45 minutes, evenly divided, to be \nfollowed by 30 minutes, evenly divided and controlled by the two \nleaders prior to a cloture vote.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allotted \n10 minutes to discuss the fiscal stimulus package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I understand that the \nSenator's time will be charged to the Republican side.\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, we have heard a lot in the press, and we \nhave certainly heard a lot from our own Finance Committee, and we have \nseen what the House passed in terms of the stimulus package.\n  I think, once again, in our hurry to address a problem, we have not \nasked: Are we fixing the right problem, the problem in connection with \nthe House leadership passing a bill that will spend $150 billion. One \nof the first questions we ought to ask is, Where is that money coming \nfrom, the $150 billion? Nobody can dispute the fact that we are going \nto borrow that from our grandchildren; we are going to go to the \nmarkets and borrow the money to stimulate our economy. Nobody will \ndispute the fact that there is very little payback into the Treasury, \nin terms of tax collections, from this stimulus plan.\n  The facts as they are, we had an overheated housing boom. We can deny \neconomic reality, but until we mark the market--the overinflated cost \nthat has extended credit in our country--and recognize that is going to \nhave to be paid for, we are not going to walk out of this slowdown we \nappear to be facing. The reality is that the model is the Japanese \nbanking industry: When they refused to recognize the losses, what it \ndid was impact their economy for 10 years. So the realities are that \nthere has to be an economic price when we have an economic excess. Our \njob should be to make that as easy on our economy as we can, thinking \nabout the future of our economy.\n  Now, all the options that have been presented, when scored in the \nlong term, have very little beneficial effect for the economy other \nthan the psychology we are putting through. The reason it is important \nto discuss alternatives is because there is a way, which is proven in \neconomics, proven in capitalistic societies, in free market societies, \nwhere you can generate stimulus and revenue back to the Government so \nthat, in fact, you solve the right problem, the real problem, and you \ndon't bankrupt your children further, which is what we are going to do \nwhether we pass the House bill or the Senate bill. We are going to \nsteal $150 billion or $190 billion from our grandchildren. I think we \nought to think twice about that. Do we really, as senior citizens, want \nto steal $600, to $800, to $1,200 from our grandchildren for us today? \nDo we want to do that? Is there another way in which we can stimulate \nour economy without stealing from our kids and ultimately putting the \nmoney back in so that our children don't have to pay for this stimulus \npackage? There is. There are a lot of economic theories and experience \nin this country that prove that.\n  So let's talk some about what we should be doing that we are not. \nInstead, we are pandering to people, thinking they are going to get \n$600 or $800, and we don't have any idea other than to think a third of \nthat money might have a stimulus effect, but it will have a negative \neffect in terms of what our kids have to pay back.\n  One thing we can do is create certainty about economic \ndecisionmaking. We can extend the Bush tax cuts. We can extend them so \npeople will continue to make positive decisions based on a tax rate \nthey know is there rather than one they know is going to go away in 2 \nyears, which will limit their investment.\n  Second, we can lower corporate tax rates. We now have the second \nhighest corporate tax rates in the world. That hasn't been part of any \ndiscussion. We know that when we lower corporate tax rates, we see \nincreased investment, which increases the tax revenues for the country, \nand we also see economic growth. So there is a positive there, but it \nis not complete. There is a cost associated with that, but at least \nthere is some feedback. But we have not considered that.\n  We have not reduced the capital gains tax rate on corporations--the \npeople who invest great sums of money on the basis of the fact that if \nthere is a capital gain, if we were to lower that, they might invest \nmore or they might recognize the gain they have today, consequently, \neven generating taxes. We can index capital gains for inflation. That \ncreates a stable investment environment whereby business decisions will \ninvest in capital, create jobs, which create salaries, which create \nincome, which create tax revenue.\n\n  We can markedly advance--much more so than we have done in this \nbill--depreciation schedules if we want to have an impact. We could go \nto full expensing for capital equipment forever. We don't have to stop \nit now. What that would do is create investment in capital goods in \nthis country, which would create jobs, which would raise wages, which \nwould create incomes, which would create tax revenues for the country.\n  There are other things we can do besides just send money out the \ndoor. We can establish a repatriation window for corporate taxes \noverseas. The best way to not ever have to deal with this again is to \nhave a corporate tax rate equivalent to what is going on in the rest of \nthe world--have one at 25 percent instead of 35 percent so that we, in \nfact, are competitive worldwide, so that corporations don't refuse to \nbring income they have earned overseas back to this country because we \nhave an excessive tax on it, so they decide not to do that.\n  Finally, what we can do is make the Small Business Administration \nwork. Seven years ago, the impact of Government regulation on small \nbusiness was less than $4,000. It is $7,400 per employee. That is the \nimpact of the Federal Government. That is not the taxes you pay, that \nis the impact of the regulations in terms of the cost impounded onto \nsmall business by the Federal Government.\n  I will end with talking about the budget that was just submitted by \nthe administration. We are going to spend probably $150 billion or $190 \nbillion, and we are not going to pay for it. We are not going to reduce \nany of the wasteful spending, including the inappropriate payments in \nMedicare, and there is another $40 billion in fraud. Medicaid has $30 \nbillion worth of fraud and another $7 billion in improper payments. \nFood stamps has $6 billion worth of improper payments, not counting the \nfraud.\n  There is nothing associated with fixing what is wrong with the \nGovernment so that the American people get value from it. We are going \nto throw money at a problem rather than secure the future for our \nchildren and grandchildren. We can do better. We ought to do better. We \nshould not say we are just going to throw money at the problem.\n  Let's make long-term structural changes in the Tax Code that raise \nthe opportunity for our children rather than lower it by putting debt \non their shoulders. Let's make the long-term changes and tough choices \nof eliminating programs that aren't working\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\neffectively, or let's refine programs that are wasteful, not efficient, \nand loaded with fraud. Let's eliminate the wasteful programs that \naccount for $150 billion of money spent each year. Let's get rid of the \n$30 billion in waste at the Pentagon. Let's get rid of the $3 billion \nwe spend every year maintaining buildings the Pentagon doesn't want. We \ndon't have a way to get rid of them, but we don't have the courage to \nchange the law.\n  There are all kinds of ways to save a couple hundred billion dollars \na year, but it means you have to ruffle some feathers. It is time we do \nthat and do the hard work, rather than the easy work.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to speak in terms of what I think is a \nlong-term way to resolve this economic trough we appear to be facing. I \nam not confident we are going to do it the right way. I think we are \ngoing to do it the politically expedient way, which helps people get \nreelected but doesn't fix the real problem. To me, to my regret, that \nis a sad misnomer for this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the book of Leviticus teaches: ``Rise in \nthe presence of the aged, show respect for the elderly, and revere your \nGod.''\n  Today, the Senate can show respect for America's elderly. Today, the \nSenate can extend needed stimulus checks to 20 million seniors whom the \nHouse left behind.\n  America's seniors have earned the right to get stimulus checks, every \nbit as much as other Americans. They worked hard all their lives. They \npaid a lifetime of taxes. They contribute to the economy.\n  And seniors can use the money. And because they can use the money, \nseniors are excellent targets for economic stimulus checks. Because \nthey can use the money, they will spend it quickly.\n  Americans over age 65 spend 92 percent of their incomes. Households \nheaded by a person over age 75 spend 98 percent. That is higher than \nany other group over the age of 25. And that means that a check sent to \na senior will have a greater bang for the buck in terms of helping the \neconomy.\n  The Finance Committee amendment would help 20 million seniors who \nwere left out of the House bill. The Finance Committee amendment would \nprovide seniors with rebate checks of $500. The underlying House bill \nwould not help those 20 million seniors.\n  And the Finance Committee amendment would also provide rebate checks \nfor 250,000 disabled veterans who receive at least $3,000 in nontaxable \ndisability compensation. The Finance Committee amendment would make \nthem eligible to receive the same $500 rebate as wage earners and \nSocial Security recipients. The Veterans Administration would \ndistribute the rebate. The House bill would not provide rebate checks \nto disabled veterans who don't pay taxes.\n  And the Finance Committee amendment would provide an additional 13 \nweeks of unemployment insurance. And high unemployment states would \nqualify for an extra 13 weeks. The House bill does not provide an \nextension of unemployment insurance.\n  Almost a million more Americans are unemployed today than were a year \nago. And 69,000 additional unemployed workers filed claims for \nunemployment insurance just last week.\n  CBO found unemployment insurance to have a big bang-for-the-buck. It \nacts quickly to boost the economy.\n  I heard my friend from Oklahoma. Frankly, all of the big ideas and \ngreat ideas are ideas we cannot address at this point. We have to act \nnow, immediately. The President wants us to act now with the stimulus \npackage. The House wants us to act now. We in the Senate have to act \nnow; that is, we have to get some rebate checks out to the American \npeople so they can spend those checks, those dollars, and prime the \neconomy.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve System has done his part by \nlowering interest rates to help keep our economy from going into \nrecession, to help keep our economy from falling into high unemployment \nrates, because we are facing a time of slow growth, primarily due to \nthe problems in the housing markets, the subprime problems, which \ncascade into securitized loans and which, frankly, were peddled in a \nway that caused a lot of investors in our country to not know, frankly, \nwhat they were investing in.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, Mr. Bernanke, also wants \nthis package now. He knows what he is talking about because he is, \nafter all, probably the best economist in this country at the moment. \nThe Chairman of the Federal Reserve System is saying that, in addition \nto lowering rates, we should have the stimulus package passed.\n  We on the Senate Finance Committee did improve upon the House-passed \nbill. We decided not to replace it but improve upon it, so that any \nchanges we make can be easily folded into the House-passed bill, and \nget the final product on the President's desk very quickly. Nobody \nwants to hold up the stimulus checks or hold up stimulating the \neconomy. So I am quite confident we will get this resolved quickly, \nwith improvements.\n  The research organization economy.com found that each dollar spent on \nextended unemployment insurance benefits generates $1.64 in increased \neconomic activity.\n  Don't forget, we passed a bipartisan stimulus bill after 9/11, and \nthat contained an extension of unemployment insurance. The President \nsigned that bill. We should do the same now.\n  Further, we are adding a provision--it sounds technical, but it is \nsimple--that would extend the carryback period for net operating losses \nfor companies from 2 years to 5 years. Very simply, the bonus \ndepreciation and expensing provisions help companies that make a \nprofit--many companies during this low economic growth time are not \nmaking money--it seems fair they be included in the stimulus package, \nand that is why it is very important that provision be enacted.\n  This provision will help the housing industry, especially \nhomebuilders, from going belly up. There were a lot of loans made that \nshould not have been made. The more we can show to the American people \nthat we are thinking about them, that we are trying to add a stimulus \nto the Nation's economy, the better, including showing to the housing \nindustry that by making a change in the tax laws they can carry back \ncurrent losses to earlier profitable years so they can make payrolls \nand not have to go belly up.\n  I might add, we also in the Senate Finance Committee package--the \nHouse does not do this--tighten up provisions that make it extremely \ndifficult for illegal aliens to get these rebate checks. That is very \nimportant. It is not in the House bill. We have that provision in the \nSenate bill.\n  Finally, this is clearly the right thing to do. It is clearly right \nthat 20 million seniors and about 250,000 disabled veterans be included \nin the rebate check program. We do that in our bill. There are some \nother provisions, but that is the core of what we are doing here.\n  Clearly, the House will accept these changes, there is no doubt about \nthat. The President can sign it, and we can get this rebate program up \nand going. We can get it passed very quickly.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise to outline my reasons for \nsupporting the Senate Finance Committee stimulus package.\n  I have reviewed various proposals carefully. Clearly, the House-\npassed package is simply unacceptable. I predict that the House would \nnot pass that bill again now that its flaws have been revealed. By \ndenying rebates to Social Security recipients and veterans, yet giving \nit to illegal immigrants, the House has produced something most \nAmericans would reject.\n  I understand that in the rush to produce the package, the House may \nnot have completely vetted each and every provision. So when I say it \nis simply unacceptable, I believe the way I have outlined what probably \nhappened is true. They did a terrific job in a short period of time. It \nis just that the product, unfortunately, had to go somewhere else, it \nhad to come here, and in coming here the good staff and others had to \nlook at it in its entirety again, and they found what I described and \nthe chairman of the full committee described.\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\n  I say to the chairman of the full committee, I am not on this \ncommittee, but I follow it, and I know what is in the final package.\n  Yesterday, the Institute for Supply Management reported that business \nactivity in the nonmanufacturing sector of our economy contracted. That \nis the part of the economy that has been holding everything together. \nIt had not been contracting; now it has. The level of that key \nindicator is now at its lowest level since 2001. Right after the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, the stock market dropped 370 points \nand investors continued to move into ultrasafe areas, such as \nGovernment bonds.\n  Last week and earlier this week, we had more information about a \ndevastated housing industry and the announcement of bankruptcy of a \nmajor home building firm. Last Friday, the Government reported that the \nNation suffered a decline in job creation for the first time in 4 \nyears.\n  In short, we clearly face the possibility of a recession. Worse, this \nrecession may dovetail with the present near freeze in credit markets. \nAnd when that happens, none of us knows how these two things may \ninteract and what it may bring to us.\n  A prudent person would do as the House has done and has been proposed \nby the Senate and pass a stimulus package that will get money into the \neconomy as soon as possible and will target particular sectors \nespecially hard hit.\n  The question isn't whether we should have a stimulus package. The \nquestion is, which do we prefer? The first thing to look at is the \ncost. The Senate Finance Committee package, as amended, will cost $158 \nbillion. The House-passed package was $146 billion. In a $14 trillion \neconomy, a difference of $12 billion is insignificant, almost a \nrounding error in an economy clearly the size we have. Both packages \ncost about the same.\n  Second, it seems to this Senator that speed is the important \ningredient. Therefore, if we invoke cloture on the Senate Finance \nCommittee package before us, we can move quickly and move toward a \nSenate-passed package.\n  Third, I believe the Senate Finance Committee bill spreads the \nrebates, including veterans and Social Security recipients, and making \nsure no illegal immigrants receive the rebates.\n\n  Fourth, the committee recommendations will give a strong boost to \nhousing and home building through its net operating loss provisions. We \ncannot ignore the weight that the collapsing housing market and home \nbuilding sector have had on our economy and loss of jobs.\n  It used to be common knowledge that you would not have a robust \nAmerican economy without a robust home building sector accompanying it. \nThat may still be true. We have had a robust housing economy until now.\n  Finally, I believe the passing of the energy tax provisions in this \nSenate Finance Committee proposal as soon as possible is important. We \ncan pass the provisions by invoking cloture, not waiting until later in \nthe year to try to pass them on a different vehicle.\n  I have concluded that I will support cloture on the Senate Finance \nCommittee proposal, recognizing that a conference with the House is \nlikely and that both Chambers will be able to fine-tune the ultimate \npackage and get it quickly to the President. I hope that is the case. \nThe House had its turn. We will now have our turn. Then there will be a \nconference which will have to be called in any event, but they will now \nbe operating under the gun, meaning getting something done quickly or \nthey will lose all credibility.\n  I am hopeful I have chosen the right path. I know it is a difficult \none for many who think I should do otherwise. I respect all of them, \nbut I made my decision on what is best for New Mexico and what is best \nfor America as I see it.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding me time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I commend and thank the Senator from New \nMexico. He is making a courageous decision. More often than not, when \nsomebody makes a courageous decision, it clearly is the right thing to \ndo. It is easy to not make the courageous decision. Sometimes it is \nhard to make a courageous decision. He is making a courageous decision. \nI thank him and I know the people of New Mexico are proud of him for \nstanding up and doing what he is doing.\n  The Senator from Arizona seeks recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, first, let me say that one of the points \nmade by my dear friend from New Mexico is backward. We need to deal \nwith this issue in a speedy fashion. There is one point that unites \neverybody with regard to this stimulus package: If it is not done \nquickly, its stimulative effect diminishes effectively, and there is a \npoint at which it will not have the stimulative effect people would \nlike. Therefore, speed is of the essence.\n  One of the points about the Finance Committee package is, of course, \nif it were to pass, we would have to go to a conference committee \nbetween the House and the Senate which would obviously delay this \nprocess. I don't know how long it will take to get to conference or how \nlong a conference committee will take, but it could be a lengthy \nprocess taking us beyond the February recess which means that, clearly, \nwe will be talking about weeks to get this bill to the President.\n  Were we, on the other hand, to follow Leader McConnell's advice and \nreject the Senate Finance Committee package and move to a modified \nversion of the House-passed bill, we could get that to the House which \ncould pass it, send it on to the President, and be done with it. That \ncan all happen, frankly, by the end of this week.\n  In terms of the issue of speed, it would behoove us to reject what \nhas been called the Christmas tree package out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee which substantially raises costs, spends more money, is much \nmore complicated than it would be to take up the House-passed bill \nwhich can be done more quickly.\n  I don't mean to be pejorative when I talk about a Christmas tree, but \nthat is pundits talk about a bill that starts out relatively small, but \nbecause Members have favorite adds to make to it, which is another \nfavorite pundit phrase, things we like to add to the bill, we end up \nwith a bill that started out small but ends up looking like a tree with \na lot of ornaments on it.\n  Remember when Speaker Pelosi and Leader Boehner and the President \nstruck the agreement they did that passed the House with 38 negative \nvotes, there was a recognition this needed to be done quickly and \ncleanly.\n  There were just three working parts to this legislation. Members of \nthe House had a lot of other great ideas. There are a lot of other \nitems they would have wanted to put on it, but their leaders convinced \nthem to get bipartisan support. It was very important to keep the \npackage trimmed down to the point where Secretary Paulson believed it \nwould actually benefit the economy and not add extraneous spending and \nelements.\n  What happened when the bill came to the Senate Finance Committee on \nwhich I sit? I haven't added it up, but some have said there is $40 \nbillion in additional costs, in additional spending, and I will talk \nfor a moment about some of that spending. Those who are concerned about \nadding to the deficit need to be concerned about the additional cost of \nthis bill. Some of that spending has to do with some tax credits for \nvarious kinds of businesses that have no stimulative effect whatsoever \nand are being done to either please certain legislators or to find a \nvehicle for something.\n  For example, there is something like $100 million that is owed to \nsome coal companies in the United States. They have not been able to \nfind a legislative vehicle to get the money appropriated so they can be \npaid their $100 million. So this was thought to be perhaps the right \nkind of vehicle to do it on.\n  Apparently they are owed $100 million and we need to send it to the \ncoal companies, but that has nothing to do with stimulating the \neconomy. It is payment for a past debt for a court case. But one of the \nMembers wanted it in this bill and, as a result, it got put in the \nbill. That is not a stimulus package for the American people.\n  Then there was a group of tax breaks. What are some of the tax breaks \nfor businesses? One is a tax break so we can build more efficient \nhomes. One of our problems in our economy is we have a glut of housing \non the market right now. So we are going to make a tax break so folks \ncan build more\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\nhomes to put on the market to add to those that already exist, as well \nas commercial buildings.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the rich getting too much in this \npackage. One of the tax breaks is to remove the income limit for people \nwho can now, under the Finance Committee bill, take a tax break for \ninvestments they have made in marginal oil and gas wells. Maybe that is \na good idea. I don't know. But it clearly has no place on a stimulus \npackage.\n  My point is that the Finance Committee did a variety of things which \nMembers wanted done. They may or may not represent good policy, but \nthey have nothing to do with the stimulus and simply add costs to this \nbill. Remember, this is all borrowed money. So it takes us further into \na deficit situation.\n  One of our colleagues on the committee pointed out that these energy \ntax breaks actually are part of a larger bill, which I support, called \nthe extenders package and, indeed, that is true. What is the extenders \npackage? The extenders package is a package of legislation that each \nyear we pass without question to ensure that various kinds of tax \nprovisions remain in the Tax Code, such as the research and development \ntax credit and a variety of provisions such as that. I asked for \nunanimous consent to offer that in committee and it was rejected. We do \nknow, however, for a certainty, that is going to pass this Congress. So \nthese energy provisions, even to the extent people want them, are going \nto become law, but they don't have to be put in the stimulus package to \ndrag it down.\n\n  The other big expense added in the Finance Committee was the \nextension of unemployment. The Secretary of the Treasury and other \npeople in the administration will tell you, in their view, this \nstimulus package could add anywhere from a half percent to three-\nquarters of a percent of growth to the GDP, if it is done very quickly \nand very cleanly. However, adding the unemployment extension, $30 \nbillion or so to it, would eliminate the effect of a stimulus that \notherwise would be provided. So the irony is that by adding the \nunemployment compensation extension provision here, we actually remove \nwhatever stimulative effect there is in the bill, and we are right back \nto a bill that ends up, as I said, looking like a Christmas tree.\n  Right now, unemployment nationwide is 4.7 percent. We have never \nextended unemployment benefits when unemployment was at that low a \nlevel. It has always been in the neighborhood of 6 percent or above, \nmaybe a little below that, that has caused us to extend unemployment \nbenefits. So there may well come a time, if we can't get the economy \nmoving in the way we want it to, that there would continue to be stress \nin the employment sector and people might actually begin losing more \njobs, in which case we might have to extend it. But the best way to \nprevent that from happening is to do sensible policy in the meantime to \ntry to obviate that situation. And the Secretary of the Treasury and \nthe President and the House of Representatives clearly believe the best \nway to do that would be to pass the stimulus package that doesn't have \nthis additional $30 billion in unemployment extension added to it.\n  The final point I wish to make is that there is some concern that \nthere are politically popular things in the Finance Committee package \nand it is hard to vote against those politically popular things. I \nthink the Senator from Montana made a good point a moment ago in \nreference to a different matter, that when you do something as a matter \nof conscience, and it is hard to do, usually it represents good policy. \nThis is a case where the House of Representatives was willing, on a \nbipartisan basis, under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Leader \nBoehner, to put together a package, with the administration, in the \nkind of bipartisanship our constituents would like to have us engage in \nmore often, in order to pass a bill quickly, that could be sent to the \nPresident quickly, and they did that even though I am sure many of them \nwere tempted to add all kinds of other politically popular things to \nit. Now the attention turns to the Senate, and are we acquitting \nourselves as well? I daresay not, if this Christmas tree package from \nthe Finance Committee is adopted on the Senate floor. Instead, our \nconstituents will look at us as the folks who slowed it down; we added \na bunch of spending to it.\n  The American people are already skeptical that getting a $500 or $700 \nrebate check is going to help stimulate the economy. But clearly they \nare going to look at the additional spending, the increased hit to the \ndeficit, and wonder whether we were simply acting in a political way \nrather than in a way best for the country.\n  So my view is we would be far better served to do what is the best \npolicy, and that is to reject the Senate Finance Committee package as \ntoo much, more than the traffic can bear in this case, and to go back \nto the version of the House of Representatives, which would be modified \never so slightly, to send it back to the House to immediately pass it \nand on to the President and get this done.\n  My personal view is the kind of spending that is involved in the \nFinance Committee package will actually act to the detriment, not to \nthe benefit, of stimulating the economy, and that is why it should be \nrejected.\n  In a few moments, we are going to have a chance to vote on this, and \nI hope my colleagues will vote no on the motion for cloture to bring up \nthe Finance Committee-passed package of the stimulus bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have a number of Senators seeking \nrecognition.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas, Ms. Lincoln; 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown; 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan; and 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Ms. Klobuchar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, a special thanks to the chairman for \nall his hard work.\n  As we look across this great Nation, we all understand our economy \nneeds some help, and that is why the Senate Finance Committee quickly \ntook up the economic stimulus package which the House and the \nadministration had put out there. I have to give an incredible \ncompliment to our chairman and ranking member, Chairman Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, who went about this in such a thoughtful way, making \nsure there was no pride of authorship but recognizing what we had to do \nwas to improve on this bill, to improve on what the House had done in \nsuch a hurried fashion, in order to be sure we didn't leave people out. \nThis is very thoughtful with respect to the economy and the long-term \ndebt issues out there, to keep a package that was small and reasonable, \nyet was comprehensive for the task that it had.\n  The package Speaker Pelosi and President Bush put together was a good \nstart, but, unfortunately, there were some very important changes that \nneeded to be made, and most notably some very hard-working and \ndeserving Americans were disqualified from the stimulus rebate under \ntheir proposal: our seniors living on Social Security income and our \ndisabled veterans. Why in the world would we want to leave behind this \ngroup of such important Americans--fabrics of our American family, \npeople whose backs this country was built on and protected by--20 \nmillion seniors and at least a quarter of a million veterans who we \nknow should qualify? The fact that there are disabled veterans who \nmight qualify for that rebate is certainly reason enough to make sure \nwe go back and get it right. I have no idea why the other side would \nnot want to do that.\n\n  This is not the only thing we intend to do to stimulate the economy, \nbut it is the jolt we need. The Senator from Oklahoma was worried it \nwas the only thing. No. No one thinks this is the only thing we are \ngoing to do. We are going to follow with a farm bill, which will put an \nimmediate stimulus into our rural areas. We will be looking at the \nenergy tax package and a host of others--No Child Left Behind, which \nhas been underfunded a tremendous amount.\n  The Senate Finance Committee took action quickly to address the \ninequities of the Pelosi-Bush package, and I am glad they did. The \nchairman and\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nranking member did an excellent job, and I hope my colleagues will \nrecognize we have a one-time shot at making sure the Americans \nunderstand what it is we are doing: stimulating and jolting the economy \nand making it fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the Senator from \nArkansas. They are good words.\n  We have an opportunity to both jump-start our economy and solve the \nproblems staring us right in the face. It is the difference between \ninvesting in our Nation's economy and investing wisely in our Nation's \neconomy. Of course, we should invest wisely.\n  We have an opportunity to put money into the pockets of almost every \nAmerican or just some Americans. We can exclude retirees, we can \nexclude disabled veterans, or we can include them. Obviously, we should \ninclude them.\n  The Reid amendment incorporated in the Finance Committee proposal \nsends rebates to the homes of 21 million senior citizens, 250,000 \ndisabled veterans, and thousands of unemployed who don't get a dime in \nthe House bill.\n  Now, some decided they wanted to label this bill a Christmas tree. It \nis always what you do if you don't like the provisions in something. \nAnyone who thinks it is Christmas morning in these households is sadly \nmistaken.\n  The Reid amendment is inclusive and sends money to individuals who \nwill spend it. In a stimulus package, you stimulate the economy, and in \ntimes of recession you help those who have been hardest hit by the \nrecession. It is smart and it is right.\n  The Finance Committee package provides extended unemployment benefits \nfor those who are looking for jobs in a sluggish economy. Thousands of \nOhioans lost their jobs not because they wanted to, but they have lost \ntheir jobs and they are looking for some help as they try to return to \nthe workforce. Economists have confirmed that is the most potent \nstrategy for stimulating the economy. You put money into the economy to \nstimulate the economy, you particularly put money into the pockets of \nthose who will spend it--disabled veterans, senior citizens, and \nunemployed workers who need extended benefits. It makes sense and it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are required from time to time to make \ntough votes in the Senate, but this isn't one of them. This is not a \ntough vote. The question is, Shall we try to stimulate the economy? The \nanswer, clearly, is yes. I think most people feel we should do that.\n  So then, if we are going to give a rebate, some kind of rebate to \npeople who should get the rebate, perhaps we should think of it in \nterms of a family sitting around a supper table and they are talking \nabout who is going to get this rebate. So somebody says: Well, you know \nwhat, let's make sure grandpa and grandma don't get it. Let's not give \ngrandpa and grandma a rebate. They don't need to be in it. And by the \nway, Uncle Carl is unemployed. He doesn't need it. He ought not get a \nrebate. Or Cousin Ralph, he is a disabled veteran. He is not going to \nneed a rebate.\n  Do you think any family sitting around a supper table would make \nthose choices; that they are going to throw grandpa and grandma off the \ntrain and the disabled veteran who served this country and put his life \non the line?\n  So here is the deal. We are told by some: Well, you know, they \nhaven't earned income, so, therefore, they are not going to qualify for \nthis rebate. Oh, really? You haven't earned your Social Security check? \nSeems to me that is a lifetime of earning. You didn't earn your \ndisability payment? You earned it by putting your life on the line for \nthis country.\n  So let's include the 20 million people who are senior citizens, many \nof whom live near poverty trying to stretch their reasonable income--in \nmany cases a very small income--through the month to pay for both food \nand medicine. Let's include senior citizens, let's include veterans who \nare being paid veterans disability, who otherwise would not be \nincluded.\n  And let's do what we have always done during economic downturns: \nLet's extend unemployment benefits. That is the economic stabilizer we \nhave always used. Let's do the right thing and vote for the finance \nbill and move it into conference. Let's do that now.\n  This is not a tough vote. We know what the right thing is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, for 8 years, I served as the chief \nprosecutor for Minnesota's largest county, and we had something we said \nwhen we were working on white-collar cases. We said: Follow the money. \nFollow the money. Is it going where it is needed? That is what I ask \ntoday. I would say with the Senate finance package it is.\n  I hope that as Congress works on this package, we will work to \nredirect the money to new priorities for America. At the same time, the \nurgent need for America to get our economy moving forward again is deep \nand it is long. I saw it last month, when I was touring around our \nState, visiting 47 counties, visiting solar panel factories down in \nsouthern Minnesota, up at a turkey processing plant, and I can tell you \npeople want to move forward with this economy, but they feel our \nGovernment has not been supporting them. That is why we put together \nthe Senate stimulus package, which is targeted, which is temporary, and \nwhich is going to be timely.\n  I know we are all going to get this done, but I believe it is very \nimportant we not neglect the seniors, 600,000 seniors in Minnesota. I \nhave always believed this is a country where we wrap our arms around \nthe people who have been there for us--our seniors and disabled \nveterans. When these guys signed up for war, there wasn't a waiting \nline. Why would we put them at the end of the line when we are looking \nat these rebate checks?\n  So I believe it is important we move forward with the Senate finance \npackage, which does some very good things, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, for the State of Colorado, to promote energy--renewable energy, \nand wind and solar--and I wish to move forward with it. But I believe \nthat long after these rebate checks are cashed, we are going to have to \nchange it for the long term. This means rolling back those tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest people, making over $200,000 a year, investing in our \ninfrastructure, and moving this country in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, let us remember that the stimulus \npackage we are considering is a plan agreed to by the Democratic \nSpeaker of the House, the Republican leader of the House, the President \nof the United States, and about 400 Members of the House. It is one \nthat is timely, targeted, and temporary which will help people keep \nmore of their own money and help small businesses to have more money to \ncreate jobs.\n  What began as a package to stimulate the economy in the House of \nRepresentatives has become an excuse for spending money in the Senate. \nThat is why I hope we will reject the Senate Finance Committee \nproposal. It is too expensive, spends too much money, and it doesn't \nstimulate. The goal should be to move quickly, to show the American \npeople we can act in a bipartisan way and get a good result that is to \ntheir benefit. The Finance Committee proposal does not do that.\n  I spoke with Senator McConnell, who suggests we simply amend the \nHouse bill by adding the seniors and the disabled veterans and send it \nback, send it to the President, and show the American people we can \nmove promptly to give a boost to the economy.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Reid and Senator Baucus \nfor their leadership in getting stimulus legislation to the floor so \nquickly. It is not a moment too soon. In recent weeks, the many warning \nsigns of a troubled economy have turned into loud alarm bells that we \ncannot ignore.\n  Last week's worrisome GDP figures show that economic growth has \nground to a near halt. Savings are plummeting. Debt is rising. The Fed \nhas cut short-term interest rates more rapidly\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\nthan at any time in its history. For the first time in years, we are \nlosing more jobs than we are producing. It is clear that we are facing \nan economic crisis that will present enormous challenges in the months \nand years ahead.\n  This crisis will affect every man, woman, and child in our country, \nbut it will be particularly hard on the millions of families who are \nalready struggling who are having trouble finding work, heating their \nhomes, and paying the mortgage. For these families, a recession isn't \njust part of the business cycle--it's a life-altering event from which \nthey may never recover.\n  Already far too many families are on the brink. Unemployment has \nskyrocketed more than 7.6 million Americans are looking for work but \ncan't find a job. Foreclosures are rising 200,000 families each month \nare at risk of losing their homes. Bankruptcies soared by 40 percent \nlast year, and experts predict they will rise even faster in 2008.\n  Our actions today are vital for the entire economy, but they are most \ncritical for these struggling families. Our decisions will help \ndetermine whether they keep their homes, whether their teenagers stay \nin college, and whether their children go to bed hungry.\n  The current recession is a major turning point for our country. We \nhave to choose a path out of this crisis, and the path we choose will \ndetermine the kind of America we will be for years to come. Do we \nchoose to help some, or do we choose to help all? Do we choose a path \nof shared prosperity, or a path that leaves countless hardworking \nfamilies behind?\n  These are questions of basic fairness, and the American people \nunderstand fairness. They don't want to see their friends and neighbors \nwho are struggling get left behind. They want us to do what is right \nfor all.\n  Today we have the opportunity to take a few basic steps forward to \ndemonstrate our commitment to a fair economy.\n  First, we have to tackle unemployment. It is clear that no matter \nwhat we do to boost economic activity, we will continue to have a \nsignificant unemployment problem for at least the next 2 years. Goldman \nSachs predicts that the national unemployment rate will rise to 6.5 \npercent by the end of 2009. Many States around the country are already \nstruggling with high unemployment. Michigan's unemployment rate is 7.6 \npercent. South Carolina's is 6.6 percent. Ohio just hit the 6 percent \nmark as well.\n  Workers who lose their jobs are having much more trouble finding work \nnow than before the last recession. Today, 18 percent of workers have \nbeen looking for a job for more than 26 weeks, compared to only 11 \npercent in 2001. This problem is affecting workers across the economic \nspectrum even those with college educations and years of experience \ncan't find work. There are nearly two unemployed workers for every job \nopening across the country.\n  Because it is becoming much harder to find a job, many more families \nare finding that our unemployment insurance system doesn't provide \nenough support. Across the country, 37 percent of workers are running \nout of benefits before finding a job, and more will follow as the \nrecession deepens. Mr. President, 2.6 million people ran out of \nbenefits in the year ending in October of 2007 that is far more than \nbefore the last recession.\n  These shocking numbers represent real hardship for millions of \nhardworking people across the country. It is all too easy for a job \nloss to turn into a financial crisis, and many families never fully \nrecover. In the last recession we saw the real impact of unemployment \non working families parents cutting back on spending for their \nchildren, or even pulling older children out of college to cut back on \nexpenses. We saw teenagers who should be in school forced to take jobs \nto help support their families.\n  To prevent this downward spiral, we must act immediately to shore up \nthe safety net for families struggling to find work. These workers have \npaid into the system for years. It is wrong to abandon them when they \nneed our help the most.\n  The Senate bill is a major step forward. By extending unemployment \nbenefits for up to 13 weeks, and providing as much as 13 additional \nweeks of benefits in high-unemployment States, we provide an immediate \nboost for our economy. And, at the same time, we help working families \nweather the storm.\n\n  Economists agree that extending unemployment benefits is a powerful, \ncost-effective way to stimulate the economy. Every dollar invested in \nbenefits to out-of-work Americans leads to a $1.64 increase in growth. \nThat compares with only pennies on the dollar for cuts in income tax \nrates or cuts in taxes on investments.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in supporting an \nextension of unemployment insurance benefits. It's an essential \nsolution that will jumpstart our economy and help families in crisis \nget back on track.\n  Unfortunately, jobless families are not the only ones facing tough \ntimes. Millions of families today are facing a ``perfect storm'' of \nhigh costs and low wages. Every bill that comes in the mail just adds \nto the flood, until everyone ends up completely overwhelmed.\n  Working families are being swamped by the extraordinary increase in \nthe cost of living. On President Bush's watch, the price of gas is up \n73 percent. Health insurance costs are up 38 percent. College tuition \ncosts are up 43 percent. Housing costs are up 39 percent. Yet in the \nface of these skyrocketing costs, employees' wages have been virtually \nstagnant, rising only 5 percent. Family budgets can no longer make ends \nmeet, and families across the country are feeling the painful squeeze.\n  In the face of these economic pressures, workers are struggling to \nkeep their families warm. The winter has been bitterly cold in many \nparts of the country, and the cost of heating oil is rising so rapidly \nthat it is impossible to keep up. Since last year alone, the price of a \ngallon of heating oil has increased by more than 40 percent. A typical \nhousehold may have to spend $3,000 or more on heating oil this winter.\n  Our Senate HELP Committee held a field hearing on fuel assistance in \nBoston last month. One of our witnesses was Margaret Gilliam, a senior \ncitizen taking care of her grandchildren in Dorchester. She has already \nspent $4,000 on heating oil this winter, which is nearly as much as she \nspent all last year, and there are still 6 or more weeks of winter to \ngo.\n  She told us that she tries to make each Social Security check stretch \nby asking her fuel company to deliver just 50 gallons at a time, \nbecause she can't afford to pay to fill her tank. Most often, heating \noil companies will not deliver less than 100 gallons.\n  Even for those fortunate enough to have fuel assistance under LIHEAP, \nthe benefits will cover less than a third of these costs. Most \nhouseholds won't get any help at all--of the 35 million households \neligible for fuel assistance nationwide, fewer than 6 million receive \nthese benefits.\n  The high cost of basic essentials forces families to make impossible \nchoices between paying for fuel, paying for groceries, paying for \nhealth care, or paying their mortgage. If parents choose to keep their \nchildren warm and fed, they risk losing their home. The lack of even a \nsmall amount of assistance--just an extra 100 or 200 gallons of fuel \noil--can mean the difference between security and homelessness.\n  There are simple steps we can take to end this ``perfect storm.'' One \nof the most important is the provision in the Senate bill providing \nadditional home heating assistance for families struggling to stay warm \nthis winter. Mr. President, $1 billion in additional LIHEAP funding \nwill help 2.8 million families pay their heating costs and make it \nthrough the winter. Helping families meet this basic need is also one \nof the quickest ways to jumpstart the economy. An increase in LIHEAP \nbenefits takes as little as 2 weeks to get to the pockets of working \nfamilies.\n  This year, we provided a significant increase for LIHEAP. But it is \nfar from enough and we still have a long way to go to get to the \nprogram's authorized level of $5.1 billion.\n  It has been said that some people know the price of everything but \nthe value of nothing. How else can you explain the administration's \nlatest budget request which cuts the program by 22 percent?\n  LIHEAP represents a tiny fraction of 1 percent of the entire Federal \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\nYet it does so much for those most in need.\n  Programs like LIHEAP are the best economic stimulus money can buy. \nBut even if they werem not, we would still have an obligation to \nsupport them--simply because it is the right thing to do.\n  Finally, there is widespread agreement that we need to put money into \nworkers' pockets to encourage consumer spending that will boost our \ndeclining economy. The Senate bill includes a tax rebate to do just \nthat.\n  In order to create an effective stimulus, any tax cut must be \ndesigned to give the money to those who are most likely to spend it \nimmediately--middle and low income families who are strapped for cash \nbecause of these dramatically higher costs.\n  These families are the ones who need the help the most, and the \ndollars they receive from a one-time tax cut will be quickly spent. The \nmoney will be used to buy things they need but currently cannot afford. \nIn contrast, wealthier taxpayers already have the money to purchase \nwhat they need. A tax rebate for them is much more likely to be \ndeposited in their saving accounts than spent. Unless the tax cut is \nspent, there will be no increase in economic activity generated.\n  That is precisely what the rebate proposal in the Senate bill will \ndo--provide direct assistance to the millions of working families who \nare feeling the squeeze of this economic downturn the most. They work \nthe hardest, and they deserve our help. They are also the ones who will \nspend the money most quickly, for necessities they otherwise couldn't \nafford.\n  The Senate package also includes needed relief for seniors and \ndisabled veterans. Both of these populations live on fixed incomes. \nRising prices means a choice between buying food or needed medication. \nThese Americans have sacrificed so much and worked so hard to build up \nour country, and they deserve our best efforts to help them weather the \nstorm.\n  In all of these respects, the Senate bill makes major improvements \nover the measure passed in the House of Representatives. It is fairer, \nand it produces a greater stimulus effect by paying low and moderate \nincome workers the same size tax rebate that more affluent taxpayers \nwould receive. It also extends the tax rebate to include 20 million \nretirees struggling to make ends meet. The Senate bill will provide 14 \nbillion more dollars in tax cuts to households with incomes below \n$40,000. That is the best way to get the American economy moving again.\n  There is no question that every family in America is struggling in \ntoday's economy, and that they face difficult times ahead. But today we \nhave a choice about how to move forward. Do we do what it easy, or do \nwe do what is right? Do we go part way or do we do what it takes to add \ndignity to the lives of all of America's working families?\n  I hope that each and every one of my colleagues will listen to their \nconscience, do the right thing, and support the kind of stimulus that \nwill help all Americans achieve better days ahead.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first I would like to thank Senate Finance \nCommittee Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley for their prompt \naction in developing this economic stimulus package. Last week, the \nHouse passed an economic stimulus package. Although it was not perfect, \nit did provide us with a solid foundation from which to build a \ncomprehensive bill in the Senate. I believe the Finance Committee \nproposal that is before us today makes a number of crucial improvements \nto the House version. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote to \ninvoke cloture on the Finance Committee economic stimulus package.\n  The Finance Committee package was designed in a bipartisan manner to \nimprove upon the House bill, not to add ``pet projects'' or so-called \n``goodies.'' Our goal is not to delay the passage of an economic \nstimulus bill, but to provide a package that will provide a genuine \nstimulus that is targeted to Americans who need our help the most. \nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Senate \npackage would not delay, but accelerate the delivery of a stimulus.\n  The Finance Committee makes improvements in the following areas: \nstructure of the rebate; business tax incentives; housing; unemployment \ninsurance; and funding for LIHEAP. Low-income families should not \nreceive a smaller rebate just because they do not have taxable income. \nThese families need our help and economists that testified before the \nCommittee have pointed out the potential for this investment to truly \naid in kick-starting the economy. The Finance Committee will provide a \n$500 rebate to all eligible singles and $1,000 to married couples.\n  The Senate Finance rebate is structured in a manner which will allow \nsenior citizens receiving Social Security benefits without taxable \nincome to be eligible for the rebate. Senior citizens are facing the \nsame increases in food and energy prices as are other Americans and \ncannot be left out of the package. Many seniors in Massachusetts live \non fixed incomes. They struggle to pay their medical and heating bills.\n  Unfortunately, 20 million seniors were left out of the tax rebate in \nthe House-passed stimulus bill. When we are contemplating distributing \nstimulus checks broadly across most American families, it would just be \nwrong not to include 20 million seniors of the Greatest Generation.\n  Not only does the House passed economic bill exclude seniors from \nrebates, it excludes 250,000 disabled veterans who do not file a tax \nreturn. There is no valid reason to leave out those who were wounded \nwhile serving their country.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \nI am pleased this economic stimulus plan includes two tax provisions \nwhich Senator Snowe, who serves as the ranking member of the Committee, \nand I believe will help small businesses. The first provision doubles \nthe amount of business purchases that a small business can write-off \nfrom $125,000 to $250,000 for 2008. This will provide an incentive for \nsmall businesses to purchase more equipment and expand their business.\n  The second provision expands the carryback period for net operating \nlosses, NOLs, from 2 to 5 years. This targeted provision will help \nbusinesses address losses. By allowing NOLs to be carried back for a \nlonger period of time, business owners will be able to balance out net \nlosses over years when the business has a net operating gain, helping \nsmall businesses with their cash flow. Any action we take to foster \ntheir growth benefits our economy as a whole.\n\n  At the Real Estate Roundtable earlier last week, Treasury Secretary \nPaulson said, ``the U.S. economy is undergoing a significant housing \ncorrection. That, combined with high energy prices and capital market \nturmoil caused economic growth to slow rather markedly at the end of \n2007, as reflected in the gross domestic product numbers.'' The GDP \nfell from 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2007 to only 0.6 percent \nin the last quarter.\n  A strong economic stimulus package needs to address the root of the \nproblem--the housing crisis. The unexpected losses on subprime \nmortgages and the breadth of the exposure has created uncertainty in \nthe economy. Homeowners facing higher interest rates on the subprime \nadjustable-rate mortgages, ARMs, and lower housing prices are having \ntrouble refinancing. Approximately 1.7 million subprime ARMs worth $367 \nbillion are expected to reset during 2008 and 2009.\n  Owning your own home is the foundation of the American dream. Home \nownership encourages personal responsibility, provides financial \nsecurity, and gives families a stake in their neighborhoods. According \nto the Mortgage Bankers Association's National Delinquency Survey, \nthere were roughly 2.5 million mortgages in default in the third \nquarter of 2007--an increase of about 40 percent when compared to the \nsame quarter in 2005.\n  A few weeks ago, I held a roundtable discussion on the economy in \nMassachusetts. Jim Harrington, the Mayor of Brockton, MA, told me that \nhis city had 400 foreclosures last year and expects 400 more this year. \nIn the City of Boston, there were 703 foreclosures in 2007 after just \n261 in 2006. The dramatic increase in foreclosures in cities across the \nnation are lowering revenues and making it more difficult for them to \nrespond to the housing crisis.\n  The Finance Committee amendment includes a provision to provide $10 \nbillion for mortgage revenue bonds. This provision is based on a bill \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\nby Senator Smith and myself. It passed in the Finance Committee by a \n20-1 vote. It is also important to note that President Bush, during his \nState of the Union Address, asked the Congress to provide additional \nauthority for mortgage revenue bonds and included a similar provision \nin the budget for fiscal year 2009.\n  Specifically, this provision would provide $10 billion of tax-exempt \nprivate activity bonds to be used to refinance subprime loans, provide \nmortgages for first time homebuyers and for multifamily rental housing. \nThis provision will help families retain affordable housing. The \nhousing crisis also affects rental housing because many families who \nlose their homes will move into rental housing.\n  With the additional mortgage revenue bond authority, States and local \ngovernments could rapidly escalate demand for housing and stimulate the \neconomy by increasing the flow of safe, non-predatory mortgage loans. \nIn 2006, State and local governments financed 120,000 new home loans \nwith MRBs. With the additional $10 billion in funding, States and \nlocalities can match that amount and finance approximately 80,000 more \nhome loans.\n  According to the National Association of Home Builders, every \nmortgage revenue bond new home loan produces nearly two, full-time \njobs, $75,000 in additional wages and salaries and $41,000 in new \nFederal, State and local revenues. Also, each new home loan results in \nan average of $3,700 in new spending on appliances, furnishings, and \nproperty alterations.\n  Separate from mortgage revenue bonds, the Finance Committee extends \nunemployment benefits by thirteen weeks through the end of 2008. In \nDecember alone, the national unemployment rate shot up from 4.7 percent \nto 5 percent and half a million more workers joined the ranks of the \nemployed. Labor statistics released last week show the labor market is \nfaltering. In the past month, our economy lost 17,000 jobs. We need to \nextend unemployment benefits now. When it takes longer to find a job, \ncurrent unemployment benefits are not adequate.\n  Extending unemployment benefits is one of the most effective ways to \nstimulate the economy. Families struggling to make ends meet after \nlosing their paycheck will spend the benefits quickly. Every dollar \nspent on benefits leads to $1.64 in economic growth. In addition, \nunemployment benefits will reach workers about two months before rebate \nchecks start to be delivered.\n  Finally, the Finance Committee package has been modified to include \nan additional $1 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram--one of the most effective programs to help low-income \nAmericans struggling with rising energy costs. According to economist \nMark Zandi, an increase in LIHEAP funding should be part of a stimulus \nbill. Increased LIHEAP funding will eliminate the need for families to \nchoose between food and energy costs--a choice no family should ever \nface.\n  Home heating prices in Massachusetts are 44 percent higher today than \nthey were just 1 year ago, and thousands of families will have \ndifficulties paying their heating bills this winter. Massachusetts \nfamilies will be able to benefit by approximately $22 million from this \nproposed increase in LIHEAP funding.\n  Mr. President, once again, I would like to thank Chairman Baucus for \nhis efforts in developing this important stimulus package. I ask all my \ncolleagues to support this amendment so that more seniors, small \nbusinesses, homeowners, and hard working families struggling to make \nends meet can get the assistance they deserve.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have come down to the crucial vote on \nwhether we are going to greatly improve the House stimulus bill. In a \nfew minutes, all Senators will have to undergo that balancing exercise \nI referred to last week.\n  On one hand, you have the legitimate concerns on the part of the \nHouse, White House, and Senate Republican. Leadership. That concern is \nthat a wide open Senate process would slow down and complicate a \nstraightforward House bill. Those who hold this view correctly point \nout that the House bill was the product of tough negotiations.\n  The White House and House Republicans made concessions in that \nnegotiation. Likewise, House Democrats made concessions in that \nnegotiation. Supporters of the House bill emphasize the need for speedy \naction to send the signal to workers, investors, and business people \nthat the Federal Government is responding to the slowing economy.\n  On the other hand, are concerns about the substance of the House bill \nand a truncated process that limits the role of the Senate.\n  It comes down to this, Mr. President. The leaders' concern with \ntiming must be weighed against the question of the quality of the House \nbill. In other words, is a take-it or leave-it House bill, which passes \nquickly, better than a Senate bill which allows the Senate to work its \nwill.\n  I have laid out the leaders' concerns about timing. Now, we question \nof the adequacy of the House bill. That is the other side of the \nbalance we need to strike.\n  Let's examine this side of the question. Asked another way, did the \ncommittee process improve the House bill with a Senate amendment?\n  I think everyone would have to answer yes. That is, the Finance \nCommittee amendment is an improvement over the House bill. Twenty \nmillion seniors will get the checks. Over 200,000 disabled veterans \nwill get the checks. Illegal immigrants will not be entitled to checks. \nThese improvements to the rebate structure were the direct result of \ndeliberations in the Finance Committee. They were contributions by \nmembers on each side. We improved the business stimulus provisions as \nwell.\n  Our goal was a bipartisan economic stimulus package. The committee \nworked its will and improved the bill. The committee bill responded to \nthe needs of Americans and business and, if enacted, would provide a \nvery much needed boost for the economy.\n  The best proof of this point is the concession by opponents of the \nFinance Committee bill that the House bill must be changed on the \nstructure of the rebate.\n  Before you vote, I ask Members to go back to the basic question of \nbalancing quick action on the House bill versus improvements made by \nthe Finance Committee.\n  The House bill could be passed quickly without improvements. Or we \ncould finish the process here in the Senate and add the improvements \nmade by the Finance Committee.\n  If cloture is achieved on the Finance Committee amendment, then we \nwill have a different challenge.\n  We must not load up this stimulus package else further or it is \nlikely to sink. Our leaders are right that we need to act quickly.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in a few moments we are going to have \nan extremely important vote. Nineteen days ago, the President first \nproposed an economic stimulus package and implored the Congress to act. \nIt was impressive to see the Democratic Speaker of the House, the \nRepublican leader of the House, and the Secretary of the Treasury of \nthe Bush administration all together having worked out an important \nstimulus package that we believe will help our economy.\n  Then in an apparent jolt of nostalgia from last year, Senate \nDemocrats decided to co-op a bipartisan proposal produced by the House, \nto put together a carefully crafted political document coming out of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  It may be a good proposal in some respects. I am sure it contains a \nlot of what is appealing to Members. But the point here was to try to \ndo a targeted, temporary jolt to our economy, and to try to astonish \nthe American people by doing it on a bipartisan basis, rapidly.\n  This package will not achieve that result. There is an opportunity, \nhowever, to do that. First, we must defeat the Reid proposal, and then \nthere will be an opportunity to adjust the House proposal in a way that \nis acceptable to the Speaker of the House, the Republican leader of the \nHouse, and the\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\nPresident of the United States, thereby achieving an early signature.\n  So I will offer, along with Senator Stevens, after the Reid proposal \ndoes not achieve cloture, an amendment to the House-passed bill that \nwill deal with Social Security, with veterans, and with the immigration \nproblem. And with regard to the veterans piece of it, one of the \ndeficiencies of the Finance Committee or Reid proposal is that it does \nnot cover the widows of veterans. That omission will be corrected in \nthe proposal I will offer.\n  So if we want to provide this stimulative effect for the widows of \nveterans, a way to do that, and the way to do it in a proposal that \nwill be signed by the President of the United States, approved by the \nHouse of Representatives on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, is to \napprove the McConnell-Stevens amendment.\n  Now, let me say, Senator Stevens and I don't have any pride of \nauthorship. If it will help us get this job done, if it will help us \nget this job done, we can call it the Reid-Obama-Clinton proposal as \nfar as I am concerned. The goal is not so much to claim credit as it is \nto astonish the American people and do something on a bipartisan basis \nand do it quickly--do it quickly.\n  People will be astonished, and we think the markets and others around \nthe world will watch in amazement to see that, on a bipartisan basis, \nthe U.S. Government can do something effective and fast. So I would be \nmore than happy to change the name of the amendment if that would make \nit more palatable.\n  We have no particular pride of authorship. This whole path we are \ngoing down started out on a bipartisan basis; I was hoping we would end \nit on a bipartisan basis. As far as the credit part of it is concerned, \nwe can all take credit, we can go upstairs to the gallery together, \nSenator Reid and I, side by side, and say: We came together. We did \nsomething for the American people.\n  The House can simply take this up--we know; the majority leader of \nthe House said today, he implored us, the majority leader, not to load \nup this bill with too many extras that would imperil the bill.\n  He was referring, of course, to the package upon which we will be \nhaving a cloture vote shortly. So the way forward is clear. Let's \ndefeat the proposal that we know will not be accepted by the House, we \nknow will not be signed by the President. Let's modify the House bill--\nwe can call it the Reid-Clinton-Obama bill as far as I am concerned--\nand get it back over to the House. We have their assurance they will \ntake it up, pass it, and send it to the President for his signature. \nBut first we must defeat the Reid-Finance Committee package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the President of the United States returned \nfrom the Middle East 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I had a conversation with \nhim on the telephone, with the Speaker, and a number of other people.\n  At that time, the decision was made that the President would hold off \non any statement he would make on specificity on Friday following that \nThursday, and that we should sit down and see what we could work out \nwith his Secretary of the Treasury.\n  We did that. A decision was made, as I have said on this floor on a \nnumber of occasions. This decision was made because of the House rules \ncompared to the Senate rules, that this would be a bill that would come \nfrom the House. That bill has come from the House. I have never in any \nway disparaged it.\n  But it is not something that does not need fixing. That was the whole \npurpose of the House working on it and then we are working on it. So \nany intimation by my friend, the Republican leader, that whatever the \nHouse came up with we would just put a big stamp of approval on it does \nnot speak well to the history of this body.\n  We have an obligation to do what we think is best to stimulate the \neconomy. We have done that. What we have done is not a political \ndocument. It is a piece of legislation. Now, from what I have heard \nfrom my friend, it appears that they would agree, by unanimous consent, \nthe bill that is now the House bill--what I understand they would be \nwilling to add to that is language that would prevent undocumenteds \nfrom drawing the benefits of those rebates. They would also be willing \nto accept senior citizens as listed in the Senate Finance bill, 21.5 \nmillion of them; wounded veterans, 250,000 of them; and the widows of \nthose veterans.\n  It sounds good to me. I would be happy, and I ask unanimous consent \nat this stage. Are they willing to accept that, to add that to the \npackage that we now have? That is, add the widows to the package that \nis now before the body? I agree we can add widows. I ask unanimous \nconsent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader restate his unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. REID. The Senate Finance package that is now before the Senate, I \nask unanimous consent that we add to that widows of the veterans.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is \nwhat has been going on all week: adjustments to the package in order to \nplay political games.\n  Now, with all due respect to my friend, the majority leader, we are \ngoing to have an opportunity to fix this problem on the widows of \nveterans at a later date.\n  We do not have to fix it on this first vote. How many different times \ndo they want to change it? They originally told us they were going to \ngive us the paper last Thursday night. It kept evolving and evolving \nand evolving. We will have a chance to fix this problem.\n  The first opportunity would be the amendment that Senator Stevens and \nI intend to offer. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. That is somewhat unusual. It appears the changes as have \nbeen suggested by my friend--I wanted to be cooperative and say that is \na good idea.\n  You can flip open any newspaper, tune in to any news program, tune in \nto any radio show, and you are bound to hear from professors, \neconomists, analysts, and pundits debating about the state of our \neconomy. It used to be a lot of them were asking: Are we in a recession \nnow? Not too many are asking that now. They believe we are in a \nrecession. But they do ask continually how deep will it be; how long \nwill it last.\n  Those questions are valid and appropriate. But they are asked by \nthose who spend their lives thinking about the economy, not by those \nwho spend their lives working in the economy or building the economy, \nto those Americans working harder than ever who end up with less.\n  There is no doubt the state of the economy is not good. Millions of \nworking families are trying to make their paycheck stretch until the \nnext paycheck, as their gasoline, heating, and grocery bills skyrocket, \nof course, medical bills are never able to be paid.\n  They know how our economy struggles. Millions of senior citizens are \nliving on incomes that are fixed but face living costs that are \nanything but fixed. They know how our economy struggles. Small business \nowners are facing rising health care costs for their employees and \ngreater difficulty finding capital to grow. They know how our economy \nstruggles.\n  Millions of homeowners are in foreclose or face it soon; 37 million \npeople. In California, foreclosure rates have gone up more than 300 \npercent; Florida, 250 percent. We could go through a long list of \nproblems. But they are difficult. The housing market is in big trouble \nas these people watch their dreams and their security come crashing \ndown. They, too, know how our economy struggles. It affects everyone.\n\n  I did a TV show down here with the mayor of the city of Fernley, NV.\n  Mayor, how is the economy?\n  He said: It is tough.\n  They just had a levee break and a Bureau of Reclamation project has \nbeen there for a long time. You know, the water came and covered homes \nfor 2 miles. Some of it was 8 feet deep. With the state of the housing \nmarket so bad, a lot of people are saying: I don't think it is going to \ndo any good to rebuild my home. I don't think I can borrow the money to \nfix it up or I can't make the payments.\n  It is fair to say that President Bush will not be remembered as a \ngood steward of our economy. When he took office, there was a surplus \nover the next\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\n10 years of some $7 trillion. As Senator Conrad mentioned at a \npresentation earlier today, in his 7 years, he has run up the debt. \nThat is gone. The surplus is gone. He has run up the debt by more than \n$3 trillion. We have now spent about $750 billion in Iraq. Every penny \nof it has been borrowed. But even this President understands the urgent \nneed for action, and we need to do that.\n  To his credit, President Bush called on Congress to pass an economic \nstimulus plan. House leaders, Democrats and Republicans, working with \nthe White House, came together to craft a bill that serves certainly as \na good starting point. That was always what it was supposed to be. But \nnotably the House plan sends rebate checks out to the American people \nsome time in probably May or maybe even June. They can't do anything \nwith the rebate checks until the income tax returns are filed. \nAmericans will use that money to pay their bills, to buy books and \nclothing for their children, or perhaps to make a long overdue repair \nof homes or cars or pay a doctor bill. Democrats, Republicans, we all \nagree, if we give the American people the money, they will spend it.\n  Last week the House sent the bill over here. In the Finance \nCommittee, Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley put their heads \ntogether, one Democrat and one Republican, and made a good bill far \nstronger.\n  Here are some of the things they did that we are going to be voting \non in a little while. Through bipartisanship, this Finance Committee \npackage sends stimulus checks to 21.5 million senior citizens who would \nget nothing from the House bill. The bipartisan Finance Committee \npackage sends checks to 250,000 wounded, disabled veterans who were \nleft out of the House plan, veterans unable to work because of the \nsacrifice they made for our country. The bipartisan Finance Committee \npackage extends unemployment benefits for those whose jobs have fallen \nvictim to this economy which is on this down spin.\n  The Department of Labor recently told us that the economy lost \nthousands of jobs in January, on top of the millions who are already \nunemployed. The House bill doesn't extend unemployment benefits, and \neconomists tell us that is one of the most effective ways to stimulate \nthe economy.\n  The bipartisan Finance Committee plan helps both small and large \nbusinesses. Small businesses will have a greater ability to immediately \nwrite off purchases of machinery and equipment, and large business will \nreceive bonus depreciation, an extended carryback period for past \nlosses to recoup cash for future investments. The bipartisan Finance \nCommittee package addresses the housing crisis by adding $10 billion in \nmortgage revenue bonds that can be used by States to refinance \nmortgages. The reason I focus on this is the President of the United \nStates in his State of the Union Message said:\n\n        . . . and allow state housing agents to issue tax-free \n     bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. \n     (Applause.)\n\n  We stood and applauded when he said this. That was the right thing \nfor him to say. It is the right thing for us to do. That is what we \nhave in our Senate Finance package, something the President called for \nin his State of the Union Message. Why should we be criticized for \ntrying to improve the House plan because the President asked for it and \nwe agree with what the President asked for?\n  The bipartisan Finance Committee package includes an extension of \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy incentives to create jobs, lower \nenergy bills, and help begin to stem the tide of global warming.\n  The Arizona Republic Newspaper, a newspaper not known for being \nleftwing, said in an editorial recently: The economic stimulus package \nfrom Congress needs some power, renewable power. The plan should \ninclude an extension of tax credits for renewable energy sources such \nas wind, solar, geothermal. We get a 3-for-1 impact: creating jobs, \ndiversifying our energy supply, and reducing pollution. These aren't \nnew tax credits. They are existing ones that are serving us well. Last \nyear nearly 6,000 megawatts of renewable energy came on line. That \ninjected $20 billion into the economy. That is what we have in this \nlegislation. It is good legislation. It is important legislation.\n  The amendment I have submitted adds two bipartisan measures to the \ncommittee's bill. One is an amendment to increase loan limits for \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as FHA-backed mortgages which will \nhelp more homeowners refinance and reduce mortgage interest rates. The \nother provides funds for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nLIHEAP. These funds will help low-income families--and there are lots \nof them--afford their heating bills which are skyrocketing even as big \noil reports record profits. Shouldn't we do this? Last quarter Exxon \nmade more money than any company in the history of the world. They had \na net profit of over $40 billion in one quarter. This effort to get \nindividuals and companies investing in renewable energy is important. \nThat is what is in this bill. We should not be criticized for this.\n\n  What the bipartisan Finance Committee accomplished, they took a good \nplan and made one much better--better for seniors, for veterans, for \nworking families, for business, for our economy. They did it in a \nbipartisan manner. This isn't a Democratic package. It is a bipartisan \npackage. They did it quickly. They did exactly what the Senate is \nsupposed to do.\n  The stimulus plan before us tonight is smart, targeted, and it is \neffective. That is why it is supported by the AARP, Families USA, \nAlliance for Retired Americans, National Association of Manufacturers, \nAmerican Home Builders Association, National Council on Aging, union \ngroups, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Easter \nSeals, and on and on. There is lots of support from lots of different \norganizations, scores of them. I have only hit a few of them.\n  The Republican leader and members of his caucus should have come to \nthe Senate floor to congratulate Senators Baucus and Grassley, as these \ngroups did. After this was done, these groups made hundreds and \nthousands of phone calls to thank the Finance Committee for doing this. \nIt was the right thing to do. This is not a partisan measure, and that \nis why these groups--many of these groups traditionally don't support \nDemocrats--like this. It is bipartisan.\n  I am happy that a majority--and we will find out if there are 60--of \nthis Senate approves of this package, a significant majority. We hope \nwe will get 60, 61 votes. Time will tell. But the Record should reflect \nthat a majority of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, supports this \nbipartisan measure we got from the Senate. And it is interesting to \nnote that as to this perfect plan we got from the House, the Republican \nleader said he would like to change it. So the House plan obviously \nneeds to be improved. It needs to be improved because of language \ndealing with undocumented people. It needs to be improved because of \nseniors and veterans, which the Republicans admit. The House plan \ncouldn't have been that great if they accept those changes.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. That is why I am happy and \nsatisfied that a majority of the Senate approves what the Senate \nFinance Committee did. Secretary Paulson, whom I have enjoyed working \nwith, said this morning that the Senate Finance Committee bill is \n``coming to the trough.'' My friend the Republican leader said these \nare pet projects. The majority of the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, disagrees with that. They do not think that seniors and \nveterans are pet projects. And if they are pet projects, I plead \nguilty, because they are my pet projects. Seniors are my pet project. \nVeterans are my pet project.\n  I have not served in the U.S. military. But during my entire career \nas a Member of Congress, I have bent over backward because of the \nsacrifices made by people such as Dan Inouye and Chuck Hagel and many \nothers in this body and around the country. I do everything I can to \nhave veterans as my pet project. And they are. And the vast majority of \nthe Senate agrees with that.\n  So I think Secretary Paulson should retract what he said. This is not \ncoming to the trough. We are coming to help people. We are coming to \nhelp veterans, seniors, people who are unemployed. Maybe my friend, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, has never been unemployed. Maybe he thinks \nthose checks are not worth anything. We know the Secretary of the \nTreasury is a very\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\nwealthy man. People who are on unemployment benefits, without \nexception, are not wealthy. They are people who were depending on a \ncheck to come when payday came. Payday came, and they had no job. The \nunemployed are a pet project of mine. I would say that the unemployed \ndon't have the advocates, the lobbyists that a lot of other groups \nhave, but they are as important.\n  Is it a pet project to help businesses weather the storm of this \ndownturn? I don't think so. Is it a pet project to help people pay for \ntheir heating bills? And if there is something negative about that \nterm, I plead guilty. Is it a pet project to help families avoid \nforeclosure? If the answer is yes, we know that a majority of the \nSenate is in favor of these pet projects. We know that a majority of \nthe Senate supports these pet projects and will defend these projects.\n  I hope there are enough of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwho will step forward and do the right thing and support this \nbipartisan plan that will help stimulate the economy.\n  I am not naive enough not to know that when this bill leaves here, \nwhatever shape it is, it goes to a conference with the House. The \nPresident will be heavily involved in that. It will have the stamp of \napproval of the House and the Senate. But pressure is building, and \nthat is why a majority of the Senate of the United States believes that \nthis Senate stimulus package is a good piece of legislation. We have \nalready established tonight, through the words of the Republican \nleader, that the House package is far from perfect, because he has \nacknowledged that he wants to change that. If we stand together on this \nbill--and Senators Baucus and Grassley have stood together--we can \nachieve something today that will make our economy stronger and make \nthe American people proud that we have not forgotten the unemployed, \nthat we have not forgotten the military folks who have given so much, \nand the seniors.\n  I still often want to call my mother. I used to call my mother every \nday. She was a Social Security recipient. I know I can't call my \nmother, even though I want to on many occasions. But I do know that if \nshe got this check like we are trying to give her and others similarly \nsituated, she would spend that money if she were alive. She would have \nthat money spent in a matter of a few days. So this is the right thing \nto do.\n  The Senate should feel good that right now a bipartisan group of \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans, reported a bill out of the Senate \nFinance Committee and, after having done so, a bipartisan group of \nDemocratic Senators and Republican Senators have joined together to \nsay: Let's give the economy a boost. That is what this legislation will \ndo.\n  Our time has expired, or it will in a minute or so.\n  Mr. President, as usual, we have people who want to get out of here \nand people who want to stay here. So we are going to wait until the \ntime expires. So I will ask that we have a quorum call. There is just a \nminute or so left.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on amendment No. 3983 \n     to H.R. 5140, the economic stimulus bill.\n         Herb Kohl, Max Baucus, Mark L.

MOLITOR, SR.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Ed Molitor has been coaching basketball at \nPalatine High School for so long that when the local paper reported on \nhis retirement, the sports trivia question it ran included the name of \nhis predecessor.\n  When Ed Molitor was in college, he went to a playoff game between two \nChicago high school basketball teams--DuSable and DePaul Academy. He \ncredits this game with altering the course of his life.\n  At the time, Ed Molitor was a premed student at St. Procopius \nCollege. When he wasn't consumed with his studies, he helped a friend \ncoach basketball at an elementary school on the\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\ncity's south side. It wasn't until he watched the two high school teams \nbattle it out on the court, though, that he realized medicine wasn't \nhis real passion. It was basketball. Molitor transferred to Roosevelt \nUniversity and shifted his focus to education.\n  After graduation, Molitor started as assistant coach of the DePaul \nAcademy High School basketball team. As assistant coach, he worked \nunder Coach Bill Gleason, who became both a mentor and friend. Molitor \nwent on to coach basketball at Marist High School on the southwest side \nof Chicago.\n  In 1976, Molitor became head coach of Palatine High School's varsity \nbasketball team. He stayed for more than three decades. During his 32 \nyears at Palatine, Molitor coached more than 700 athletes. He left an \nindelible mark on the players, the school, and the community. No fewer \nthan 16 of his former players have gone on to coach high school \nbasketball, and 5 currently coach collegiate basketball.\n  On December 28, 2007, Coach Molitor earned his 500th career victory. \nWhen honored with the game ball at a postgame ceremony, Molitor \nadmitted that he hadn't been aware he was approaching this impressive \nmilestone until he read about the achievement in the newspaper.\n  Throughout his remarkable coaching career, Ed Molitor emphasized \nachievement off the court as much as on it. In his own words, ``you \nhave to convince a kid he's got potential, not only in athletics, but \nin other walks of life.''\n  Coach Molitor emphasizes the mental elements of the game over the \nphysical, and this approach has brought him and his players success on \nthe court and in life. He has led teams to six conference \nchampionships, seven regional titles, and two sectional championships.\n  I am happy to report that his peers have recognized Ed Molitor's \nskills. On two occasions, he has been named Coach of the Year by the \nIllinois Basketball Coaches Association. In 1997, the association \ninducted Molitor into its Hall of Fame. Over the years, Coach Molitor \nhas been selected to coach a number of regional, state, and national \nteams. He also sits on the All-State Selection Board.\n  Ed Molitor has been a tremendous asset to Illinois high school \nbasketball throughout his coaching career, but his greatest value has \nalways been to his players. Today, I join the current and former \nmembers of Palatine High School's varsity basketball team in thanking \nCoach Molitor for his commitment to coaching and his passion for \nhelping student-athletes develop character, discipline, and \nperseverance--skills that will prove valuable even after the season has \nended.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Coach Ed Molitor on his accomplishments \nthroughout his long and successful coaching career, and I wish him many \nmore years of happiness and accomplishment in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S726-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               Private First Class Christopher F.

He \nenjoyed fishing, hunting, golfing, and especially music and playing his \ndrums. His music teacher said he was one of the better drum players she \nhad ever seen. After joining the Job Corps, he earned his high school \ndiploma, and met his future wife, Karen. They married on March 22, \n2006, and 1 month later, he joined the U.S. Army, partly influenced by \nhis brother's service as a Green Beret. His father said he loved the \nArmy and, after completing his military commitment, wanted to use the \nG.I. bill to go to college.\n  Private First Class Pfeifer was serving in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom, assigned to the 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment, \n173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, in Schweinfurt, Germany. On August \n17, 2007, his unit came under enemy fire near Kamu, Afghanistan. \nPrivate First Class Pfeifer sustained wounds while bravely trying to \npull fellow soldiers to safety. He passed away on September 25, 2007, \nat Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX. \nPrivate First Class Pfeifer was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart.\n  Private First Class Pfeifer is survived by his wife Karen and their \nnewborn daughter Peyton; his parents Michael and Darlina Pfeifer of \nSpalding, NE; his brother, Aaron of Fort Bragg, NC; and his sister \nNichole, of Hauppauge, NY. I offer my most sincere condolences to the \nfamily and friends of Private First Class Pfeifer. He made the ultimate \nand most courageous sacrifice for our Nation, and his daughter will \ngrow up knowing her father is a hero. I join all Americans in grieving \nthe loss of this remarkable young man and know that Private First Class \nPfeifer's passion for serving, his leadership, and his selflessness \nwill remain a source of inspiration for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S726-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HONORING B.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring Dr. Lyn Behrens as she retires as president and CEO of \nLoma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center, drawing to a \nclose a successful career in medicine and civic leadership.\n  After completing her degree in medicine from the Sydney University \nSchool of Medicine in Australia in 1964, Dr. Behrens became the first \nand only pediatric resident at Loma Linda University Medical Center in \n1966. By 1986, Dr. Behrens was the first female Dean of the School of \nMedicine, and by 1990 she had become the first female President of Loma \nLinda University. Five years later she assumed the position of CEO of \nAdventist Health System, which soon became the Loma Linda University \nAdventist Health Science Center. In 1999, Dr. Behrens was chosen to \nserve as President of Loma Linda University Medical Center. Loma Linda \nUniversity and Medical Center has prospered under her leadership, and \nhas become a preeminent institution for patient care and medical \ntechnology. I have had the pleasure of visiting Loma Linda University \nand have found Dr. Behrens to be an exemplary model to her colleagues, \ncapable of bringing out the best in her associates.\n  During Behrens' tenure, Loma Linda University witnessed the \ndevelopment of a dedicated children's hospital with the most advanced \nequipment and methodology. The university has also witnessed the \ndevelopment of a center for behavioral medicine, as well as a \nrehabilitation, orthopaedic and neurosciences institute. The university \nhas also added new schools of pharmacy and science and technology, and \nhas worked diligently to foster its interaction with local research \ninstitutes to develop innovation in the use of global information \nsystems to assist with emergency medical response. The first hospital-\nbased center for proton therapy and research has also been developed \nunder Behrens' tenure, and has become a leading institution in the \ntreatment of cancer. The university has taken great strides to improve \ncare and support for our Nation's veterans at the Jerry L. Pettis \nMemorial VA Medical Center.\n  Dr. Behrens has also been a dynamic leader in her community, working \nto ensure positive community service to her area and throughout the \nworld. She has been instrumental in bringing to fruition a great number \nof social and community services organizations and programs. Programs \nsuch as the Social Action Community Health Services Clinic, \nPossAbilities, Community Kids Connection and Operation Jessica, have \nbrought medical and social support to a broad group of individuals. \nThese organizations have assisted special needs and at-risk children \nand teens, and developed after-school programs and ESL--English Second \nLanguage--programs. Dr. Behrens' leadership has also provided for \nincreased medical and community support internationally, providing \nsupport in 12 nations, including the only teaching hospital in Kabul, \nAfghanistan, and the most advanced hospital in mainland China.\n  As she retires from more than four decades of service and leadership \nin medicine to the communities of California and beyond, I am pleased \nto ask my colleagues to recognize her for a career of visionary \nleadership. The future of medical education, research, and service will \nbe forever changed thanks to her bold leadership.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S727-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S727]]\n                     50 YEARS OF SPACE EXPLORATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing and honoring the California Institute of Technology's Jet \nPropulsion Laboratory, JPL, in Pasadena, CA, for 50 years of space \nexploration. Since the launch of Explorer I, America's first \nspacecraft, on January 31, 1958, JPL has made momentous and historic \ncontributions to our scientific understanding of our vast universe.\n  For the past five decades, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been a \nrespected leader in furthering scientific knowledge around the world. \nExplorer 1 was built in less than 3 months, and was the first \nspacecraft ever launched into space that actually revolved around Earth \nand provided scientific findings from space. The immense success of \nExplorer I led to the passage of the Space Act in 1958, which \nestablished the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n  Since the inception of NASA, JPL has been on the forefront of science \nand technology through its research and exploration of every known \nplanet in our solar system. Subsequent to the success of Explorer I, \nJPL has continued to have a central role in accomplished space \nmissions, such as exploring our vast solar system with Voyager 1 and 2 \nand the Mars Exploration Rovers. JPL has also been instrumental in \nunderstanding our planet.\n  I congratulate the California Institute of Technology's Jet \nPropulsion Laboratory on 50 years of successful and insightful space \nexploration, and thank the original members of the Explorer I team for \ntheir contribution to American history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S727-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BEST COMMUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, each year, the America's Promise \nAlliance names the 100 Best Communities for Young People in the Nation. \nToday, I am proud to honor five Minnesota towns that have achieved this \ntremendous designation--Landfall, Mankato, Northfield, Saint Louis \nPark, and Saint Paul, MN.\n  The 100 Best Communities for Young People is an annual competition \nthat recognizes outstanding community-wide efforts that improve the \nwell-being of youth and inspire other localities to take action.\n  There is apparently much to find inspiration from, as two previous \naward winners have now become five--a strong showing from the great \nState of Minnesota.\n  Each of these five Minnesota communities demonstrated a commitment to \ncommunity support of children through resources including effective \neducation, safe gathering places, and a wide range of programming. \nTheir commitment generates real outcomes in the form of high graduation \nrates and educational achievement, healthy behaviors, and civic \nengagement by their young population.\n  Landfall, MN, is a small town with big plans for its young people. A \ntown of just 700, they place a premium on expanding the horizons of \nyoung people. They provide students with ``Extra Innings,'' a tutoring \nand mentoring program that gives elementary through high school \nstudents one-on-one help with math, reading, and English as a second \nlanguage.\n  Mankato, MN, a three-time winner of this honor, prides itself on \nembracing young people to help them reach their fullest potential. \nAmong their initiatives is the LinkCrew, which pairs high school \nfreshmen with junior and senior year mentors to help them make a \nsuccessful transition to high school. And, as the town that raised six \nBessler boys, including my husband John, I know firsthand of the high-\ncaliber young people Mankato produces.\n  Northfield, MN, used to be a farm town, centered between corn and \nwheat fields. Now, anchored by two of our Nation's preeminent colleges, \nCarleton College and Saint Olaf College, Northfield has become an \nenriching place for young people. The Mayor's Youth Council allows \nstudents ages 15 to 18 to advise the mayor and city council on issues \nrelated to the young population.\n  Saint Louis Park, MN, is also a three-time winner. They welcome youth \ninto their process of government, inviting them to participate in \ndecisionmaking on special neighborhood and community issues. Among \nother attractions, it is home to 51 parks thanks to the city's \ninitiative to reserve a percentage of all city land for public parks. \nAnd in a special nod to its young population, the city's Web site lists \nthe best sledding hills in its community.\n  Saint Paul, MN, is our State's capital city and a shining example of \nhow to engage children after school hours. Through the Second Shift and \nAfter School Initiatives, they provide positive places for children to \nspend their afternoons, develop new skills, and obtain academic \nassistance.\n  From his theatre in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota's native son, \nGarrison Keillor, refers to his fictional Minnesota town of Lake \nWobegon as a place where ``all the women are strong, all the men are \ngood-looking, and all the children are above average.'' These five \ntowns have certainly proven Keillor's words are more truth than \nfiction.\n  I am proud to represent five of America's Best Communities for Young \nPeople and to congratulate them before the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S727-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING SAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

But now it also bears the \ntitle of the Most Livable Community in the World.\n  The LivCom Awards are the world's only competition for local \ncommunities that focuses on environmental management and the creation \nof livable communities. This year, they have named Saint Cloud the \n``Most Livable Community in the World.''\n  This award is a deserved honor and recognition of the outstanding \nefforts being undertaken by the City of Saint Cloud to create a livable \nand sustainable community.\n  The awards encourage best practice, innovation, and leadership in \nproviding vibrant, environmentally sustainable communities that improve \nthe quality of life for their residents and people worldwide.\n  Among the goals of the award is to model innovative community \nplanning and living for other communities.

Mr. President, today I commend a Maine business \nthat last month unveiled a remarkably sturdy vessel for use by our \nNation's Navy SEALs, a project for which I was honored to secure \nfunding for. Hodgdon Yachts of East Boothbay, a family-owned company \nfor five generations, has been a source of pride for Maine's \nboatbuilding industry for nearly 200 years, and its recent \naccomplishment is without a doubt one of its most impressive.\n  Hodgdon Yachts began building boats in 1816, when the company \nlaunched the 42-foot schooner Superb. Since then, Hodgdon Yachts has \ndeveloped a reputation as one of New England's premier shipbuilders, \npersevering through difficult times and continually reevaluating its \ncompany's methods to be consistently on the cutting edge of the latest \ntechnologies. Of particular note for the State of Maine is Hodgdon's \n1921 schooner Bowdoin, named for the Brunswick alma mater of Arctic \nexplorer Donald MacMillan. The boat proved itself an invaluable tool in \nArctic research and sailed more than 300,000 miles over 26 icy voyages \nin its career. Prior to the Bowdoin, the company turned its attention \nto building submarine chasers for the military in World War I, and \ncontinued its defense work by gaining minesweeper and troop transport \ncontracts during both World War II and the Korean war.\n  By the late 1950s, Hodgdon Yachts returned to building more \ntraditional wooden yachts for a variety of customers. By the mid-1980s, \nthe company began to modernize its shipbuilding, providing clients with \nyachts of superb quality and strength while employing innovative \ntechnology in the creation of its boats. Hodgdon Yachts recently began \nusing carbon Kevlar deposits to construct its yachts to make the boats \nas strong and secure as possible.\n  Hodgdon's proficiency in using Kevlar proved useful when, in May \n2005, the company won a contract from the U.S. Navy's Office of Naval \nResearch to build the prototype for a new special operations craft \nusing these composites. The ship has a foam core surrounded by multiple \nlayers of carbon, and its durability its reinforced by an outer layer \nof Kevlar. On January 11, 2008, the company launched this prototype, \nthe 82-foot Mako V.1, named for a shark that frequents the Gulf of \nMaine's waters. It is the first Navy vessel constructed with carbon-\nfiber technology and was designed to protect Navy SEALs from injuries \ncaused by the harsh conditions of the seas. Hodgdon teamed up with \nMaine Marine Manufacturing and the University of Maine in completing \nthe Mako V.1, and I am so proud of the role that each played in \nsupporting our nation's armed forces. I look forward to successful \ntrials by the Navy and the continued role Hodgdon Yachts will play in \nthe production of this fine vessel.\n  Throughout its history, Hodgdon Yachts has produced over 400 yachts \nand ships, perhaps none more vital than its latest. The company's work \nto keep shipbuilding alive and well in Maine is well documented, \nincluding President Tim Hodgdon's involvement in the formation of Maine \nBuilt Boats, an alliance whose goal is to present Maine's boatbuilding \nindustry to a wider global audience. I firmly believe that, given our \nseafaring history and established work ethic, Mainers build the best \nships, and Hodgdon Yachts only further exemplifies this tradition. I \ncommend everyone at Hodgdon Yachts for their remarkable accomplishment \nin the Mako V.1, and wish them well in their future boatbuilding \nendeavors. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S728-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JOHN ROCK\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Viorel G. \n``Vi'' Stoia, a great South Dakotan who passed away on January 28, \n2008.\n  Vi Stoia was born on February 13, 1924 in Aberdeen, SD, and began his \nlifetime of service and leadership at Aberdeen Central High School \nwhere he served as senior class president. Vi continued this leadership \nand service while he served in the U.S. Navy and attended the \nUniversity of Minnesota. In 1949, Vi graduated with a degree in \nbusiness administration and married his lifelong companion, Donna Marie \nMaurseth.\n  Vi's thirst for knowledge along with his extraordinary leadership \nabilities served him well during his lifetime. His long and illustrious \nprofessional career included countless distinguished appointments, \nawards, and honors.\n  Vi will be remembered by the Aberdeen community because of his \nexuberant service and dedication to constant improvement of the city, \ncounty, and State. Vi was a member of numerous community organizations, \nincluding the Aberdeen Jaycees and the Aberdeen Area Chamber of \nCommerce. Additionally, Vi's dedication and leadership were \ninstrumental in rallying support for dozens of community projects.\n  The profound wisdom and deep commitment that Vi possessed is \nreflected through his role in the businesses, health organizations, \neducational affiliations, and political organizations for which he so \ndiligently served throughout his life. Vi also received many awards \nrecognizing his excellent work and service including: Distinguished \nAlumni Award--NSU, 1976; the George Award, 1979 and 1994; South Dakota \nCommunity Volunteer of the Year, 1991; Distinguished Service Award, \nExcellence in Economic Development, 2000; and South Dakota Medal of \nDistinguished Excellence, 2008.\n  Vi will be lovingly remembered by his wife Donna as well as his \nchildren and grandchildren as a loving husband, father, and a great \nman. He will forever remain in our hearts for his contributions to the \nAberdeen area and the entire State of South Dakota. Few men will ever \ngive as much of themselves or make as much of a difference in the lives \nof others as Vi Stoia. Today we celebrate the life and accomplishments \nof this great man. Although he does not stand among us, his legacy will \nlive on for a time without end. For all that has been accomplished and \nachieved, for all of the lives that have been touched and enhanced, \nthank you, and God bless Viorel G. Stoia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S728-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S728-5", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S728-6", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S728-S729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n  WITH RESPECT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA'S DESTRUCTION OF TWO UNARMED \n                U.S.-REGISTERED CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT--PM 36\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to create a national licensing system for residential \nmortgage loan originators, to develop minimum standards of conduct to \nbe enforced by State regulators, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Martinez to introduce legislation that takes a major step \nforward in curbing the abusive lending practices which contributed to \nthe subprime mortgage crisis. With foreclosures at record levels, the \nhousing market in steady decline, a global credit crunch, and the \neconomy nearing recession, it is imperative that we act quickly to \nrestore confidence in the American dream of home ownership.\n  Our legislation will eliminate bad actors from the mortgage business, \nand require that brokers and lenders meet minimum national standards \nwhich ensure they are professional, competent, and trustworthy.\n  First, it would create a comprehensive database of all residential \nmortgage loan originators. This includes mortgage brokers and lenders, \nas well as loan officers of national banks and their subsidiaries.\n  Second, it would establish national licensing standards to ensure \nthat mortgage brokers and lenders are trained in legal aspects of \nlending, ethics, and consumer protection.\n  Our bill is similar to H.R. 3012, introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Spencer Bachus, the Ranking Member of the House \nCommittee on Financial Services. The national licensing concept for \nloan originators has enjoyed bipartisan support and was included in the \ncomprehensive mortgage reform bill, H.R. 3915, which recently passed \nthe House.\n  A combination of low interest rates and sophisticated mortgage \nproducts, among other factors, helped increase home ownership to record \nlevels just 3 years ago.\n  Subprime and exotic mortgages allowed millions of Americans--many \nwith little or no down payment and questionable credit--to purchase \nhomes by using adjustable-rate products with low initial monthly \npayments.\n  There was explosive growth in the use of these sub-prime loans: in \njust 2 years, from 2004 to 2006, the number of subprime mortgages in \nCalifornia increased 110 percent, from 273,000 to 573,000--29.4 percent \nof total mortgages in the State.\n  While the majority of lenders and brokers offered these mortgages in \na responsible fashion, many others relied upon predatory lending \ntactics to place unsuspecting borrowers in mortgages they could not \nafford. Competitive pressures and lax oversight resulted in loans of \nincreasingly poor quality being written.\n  To make matters worse, consumers were not adequately protected from \nbad actors in the mortgage industry.\n  The FBI recently reported that complaints of mortgage fraud have \nskyrocketed over the last few years.\n  In 2003, the number of suspicious activity reports reviewed by the \nFBI economic crimes unit numbered 3,000. The number of mortgage fraud \ncomplaints increased to 48,000 last year, representing a jump of 1500 \npercent.\n  Most mortgage brokers and non-bank lenders are only lightly regulated \nby State agencies. Standards of accountability have not kept pace with \nthe increasing sophistication of the mortgage industry.\n  As adjustable-rate mortgages reset to higher rates, many American \nfamilies find themselves in homes they can no longer afford. The \npercentage of homeowners currently behind on their mortgage payments is \nat its highest level in 21 years.\n  Mr. President, 2.2 million homeowners filed for foreclosure last year \nand many lenders have gone out of business or sought bankruptcy \nprotection.\n  It is projected that as many as 2 million Americans will be forced to \nfile for foreclosure before this crisis abates, representing $160 \nbillion in lost equity. The Center for Responsible Lending has \nprojected that one out of every five subprime loans issued between 2005 \nand 2006 will fail.\n  California has been especially hard hit. Mr. President, 5 of the 10 \nmetropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rate in the Nation are \nin California. The foreclosure rate in California is roughly twice the \nnational average, with 1 foreclosure filing for every 258 households in \nthe State.\n  Lenders repossessed 84,375 California homes last year, a sixfold \nincrease from 12,672 in 2006. Default notices--the initial step in the \nforeclosure process--increased 143 percent between 2006 and 2007, \nrising from 104,977 in 2006 to 254,824 in 2007. In San Diego County \nalone, foreclosures were up 353 percent in 2007.\n  According to the FBI economic crimes unit, California has been \nidentified as one of the top 10 ``mortgage fraud hot spots'' in the \nNation.\n  American families are hurting, and Californians are at the center of \nthe storm. With close to 500,000 adjustable-rate mortgages scheduled to \nreset in California over the next 2 years, the situation is likely to \nworsen in 2008.\n  The subprime mortgage crisis has threatened both the global economy \nand the American dream of home ownership. Accountability, professional \nstandards, and oversight must be enhanced for everyone in the mortgage \nindustry.\n  This bill will make it so, and will help to ensure such a crisis \nnever happens again.\n  Specifically, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act would require that \nall residential mortgage loan originators are licensed, providing \nfingerprints, a summary of work experience, and consent for a \nbackground check to authorities.\n  Additionally, minimum criteria are established that individuals must \nmeet to obtain a license, including: no felony\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\nconvictions; no similar license revoked; a demonstrated record of \nfinancial responsibility; successful completion of education \nrequirements, 20 hours of approved courses, to include at least 3 hours \nrelated to Federal laws, 4 hours on ethics and consumer protection in \nmortgage lending, and 2 hours on the subprime mortgage marketplace; \nand, passage of a written exam, the exam must be at least 100 questions \nand a minimum score of 75 percent is required to pass.\n  The Federal Reserve, Treasury, and Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation must also register all residential mortgage loan \noriginators employed by national banks.\n  Lastly, State regulators must develop a satisfactory licensing system \nwithin 1 year following enactment of this legislation.\n  If this does not occur, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary \nis empowered to develop the national registry and license, generating \nrevenue for its implementation through fees to license applicants.\n  The subprime mortgage crisis is wreaking havoc on American homeowners \nand the national economy. The damage is truly staggering--more than 2 \nmillion foreclosure filings last year and another 2 million expected \nbefore this year is over.\n  Many Americans simply cannot keep pace with adjustable-rate mortgages \nthat are resetting, and some were steered into these obligations by \nunscrupulous actors.\n  It is essential that this body take action to address some of the \nfactors that got us here.\n  This legislation does not assign blame, but rather provides a \nworkable solution to protect homebuyers and begin to restore confidence \nin the American dream of homeownership.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join us in moving this important bill \nthrough the Senate quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

BACKUP AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH A NATIONWIDE MORTGAGE \n                   LICENSING AND REGISTRY SYSTEM.\n\n       If at any time the Secretary determines that the Nationwide \n     Mortgage Licensing System and Registry is failing to meet the \n     requirements and purposes of this Act for a comprehensive \n     licensing, supervisory, and tracking system for loan \n     originators, the Secretary shall establish and maintain such \n     a system to carry out the purposes of this Act and the \n     effective registration and regulation of loan originators.\n\n     SEC. 10.

BACKGROUND CHECKS OF LOAN ORIGINATORS.\n\n       (a) Access to Records.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, in providing identification and processing functions, \n     the Attorney General shall provide access to all criminal \n     history information to the appropriate State officials \n     responsible for regulating State-licensed loan originators to \n     the extent criminal history background checks are required \n     under the laws of the State for the licensing of such loan \n     originators.\n       (b) Agent.--For the purposes of this section and in order \n     to reduce the points of contact which the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation may have to maintain for purposes of subsection \n     (a), the Conference of State Bank Supervisors or a wholly \n     owned subsidiary may be used as a channeling agent of the \n     States for requesting and distributing information between \n     the Department of Justice and the appropriate State agencies.\n\n     SEC. 12. CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) System Confidentiality.--Except as otherwise provided \n     in this section, any requirement under Federal or State law \n     regarding the privacy or confidentiality of any information \n     or material provided to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing \n     System and Registry or a system established by the Secretary \n     under section 9, and any privilege\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\n     arising under Federal or State law (including the rules of \n     any Federal or State court) with respect to such information \n     or material, shall continue to apply to such information or \n     material after the information or material has been disclosed \n     to the system.

Such order may, in addition to requiring a person \n     to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation, \n     require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect \n     compliance, with such provision or regulation, upon such \n     terms and conditions and within such time as the Secretary \n     may specify in such order. Any such order may, as the \n     Secretary deems appropriate, require future compliance or \n     steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for \n     such period of time as the Secretary may specify, with such \n     provision or regulation with respect to any loan originator.\n       (2) Hearing.--The notice instituting proceedings pursuant \n     to paragraph (1) shall fix a hearing date not earlier than 30 \n     days nor later than 60 days after service of the notice \n     unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Secretary \n     with the consent of any respondent so served.\n       (3) Temporary order.--Whenever the Secretary determines \n     that the alleged violation or threatened violation specified \n     in the notice instituting proceedings pursuant to paragraph \n     (1), or the continuation thereof, is likely to result in \n     significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant \n     harm to consumers, or substantial harm to the public interest \n     prior to the completion of the proceedings, the Secretary may \n     enter a temporary order requiring the respondent to cease and \n     desist from the violation or threatened violation and to take \n     such action to prevent the violation or threatened violation \n     and to prevent dissipation or conversion of assets, \n     significant harm to consumers, or substantial harm to the \n     public interest as the Secretary deems appropriate pending \n     completion of such proceedings. Such an order shall be \n     entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, \n     unless the Secretary determines that notice and hearing prior \n     to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public \n     interest. A temporary order shall become effective upon \n     service upon the respondent and, unless set aside, limited, \n     or suspended by the Secretary or a court of competent \n     jurisdiction, shall remain effective and enforceable pending \n     the completion of the proceedings.\n       (4) Review of temporary orders.--\n       (A) Review by secretary.--At any time after the respondent \n     has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order \n     pursuant to paragraph (3), the respondent may apply to the \n     Secretary to have the order set aside, limited, or suspended. \n     If the respondent has been served with a temporary cease-and-\n     desist order entered without a prior hearing before the \n     Secretary, the respondent may, within 10 days after the date \n     on which the order was served, request a hearing on such \n     application and the Secretary shall hold a hearing and render \n     a decision on such application at the earliest possible time.\n       (B) Judicial review.--Within--\n       (i) 10 days after the date the respondent was served with a \n     temporary cease-and-desist order entered with a prior hearing \n     before the Secretary; or\n       (ii) 10 days after the Secretary renders a decision on an \n     application and hearing under paragraph (1), with respect to \n     any temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior \n     hearing before the Secretary,\n\n     the respondent may apply to the United States district court \n     for the district in which the respondent resides or has its \n     principal place of business, or for the District of Columbia, \n     for an order setting aside, limiting, or suspending the \n     effectiveness or enforcement of the order, and the court \n     shall have jurisdiction to enter such an order. A respondent \n     served with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered \n     without a prior hearing before the Secretary may not apply to \n     the court except after hearing and decision by the Secretary \n     on the respondent's application under subparagraph (A).\n       (C) No automatic stay of temporary order.--The commencement \n     of proceedings under subparagraph (B) shall not, unless \n     specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the \n     Secretary's order.\n       (5) Authority of the secretary to prohibit persons from \n     serving as loan originators.--In any cease-and-desist \n     proceeding under paragraph (1), the Secretary may issue an \n     order to prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, and \n     permanently or for such period of time as the Secretary shall \n     determine, any person who has violated this Act or \n     regulations thereunder, from acting as a loan originator if \n     the conduct of that person demonstrates unfitness to serve as \n     a loan originator.\n       (d) Authority of the Secretary To Assess Money Penalties.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may impose a civil penalty \n     on a loan originator operating in any State which is subject \n     to licensing system established by the Secretary under \n     section 8, if the Secretary finds, on the record after notice \n     and opportunity for hearing, that such loan originator has \n     violated or failed to comply with any requirement of\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\n     this Act or any regulation prescribed by the Secretary under \n     this Act or order issued under subsection (c).\n       (2) Maximum amount of penalty.--The maximum amount of \n     penalty for each act or omission described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be $5,000 for each day the violation continues.\n\n     SEC. 15.

STUDY AND REPORTS ON DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES.\n\n       (a) Study Required.--The Secretary shall conduct an \n     extensive study of the root causes of default and foreclosure \n     of home loans, using as much empirical data as is available.\n       (b) Preliminary Report to Congress.--Not later than 6 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress a preliminary report regarding the \n     study required by this section.\n       (c) Final Report to Congress.--Not later than 12 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     submit to Congress a final report regarding the results of \n     the study required by this section, which shall include any \n     recommended legislation relating to the study, and \n     recommendations for best practices and for a process to \n     provide targeted assistance to populations with the highest \n     risk of potential default or foreclosure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2597. A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of \nMoldova; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to extend permanent normal trade relations to Moldova. Moldova \nis still subject to the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to \nthe Trade Act of 1974, which sanctions nations for failure to comply \nwith freedom of emigration requirements. This bill would repeal \npermanently the application of Jackson-Vanik to Moldova.\n  Moldova is a small country located between Ukraine and Romania. \nThroughout the Cold War it was a part of the Soviet Union. It gained \nits independence from the Soviet Union on August 27, 1991. The U.S. has \nsupported Moldova in its journey toward democracy and sovereignty.\n  The U.S. enjoys good relations with Moldova and has encouraged \nMoldovan efforts to integrate with Euro-Atlantic institutions. Moldova \nis an active participant in Guam, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and \nMoldova, a group of countries that has recently concluded a new trade \nagreement with the EU.\n  Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1992, Moldova \nhas enacted a series of democratic and free market reforms. In 2001, \nMoldova became a member of the World Trade Organization. Until the U.S. \nterminates application of Jackson-Vanik on Moldova, the U.S. will not \nbenefit from Moldova's market access commitments nor can it resort to \nWTO dispute resolution mechanisms. While all other WTO members \ncurrently enjoy these benefits, the U.S. does not.\n  The Republic of Moldova has been evaluated every year and granted \nnormal trade relations with the U.S. through annual presidential \nwaivers from the effects of Jackson-Vanik. The Moldovan constitution \nguarantees its citizens the right to emigrate and this right is \nrespected in practice. Most emigration restrictions were eliminated in \n1991 and virtually no problems with emigration have been reported in \nthe 16 years since independence. More specifically, Moldova does not \nimpose emigration restrictions on members of the Jewish community. \nSynagogues function openly and without harassment. As a result, the \nAdministration finds that Moldova is in full compliance with Jackson-\nVanik's provisions.\n  Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1992, Moldova \nhas enacted a series of democratic and free market reforms. \nParliamentary elections in 2005 and local elections in 2007 generally \ncomplied with international standards for democratic elections. Moldova \nhas also contributed constructively towards a resolution of the long-\nstanding separatist conflict in the country's Transniestria region, \nmost recently by proposing a series of confidence-building measures and \nworking groups.\n  The U.S. and Moldova have established a strong record of achievement \nin security cooperation. In 1997 the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program responded to a Moldovan request for assistance. The \nU.S. purchased and secured 14 nuclear-capable MiG-29Cs from Moldova. \nThese fighter aircraft were built by the former Soviet Union to launch \nnuclear weapons. Moldova expressed concern that these aircraft were \nunsecure due to the lack of funds and equipment necessary to ensure \nthey were not stolen or smuggled out of the country. Specifically, \nemissaries from Iran had shown great interest and had attempted to \nacquire the aircraft. These planes were not destroyed. They were \ndisassembled and shipped to Wright Patterson Air Force Base because \nthey can be used by American experts for research purposes.\n  Moldova has made small, but important, troop contributions in Iraq. \nThese contributions include significant demining capabilities and \ncontingents of combat troops. I am pleased that the U.S. remains \nprepared to assist in weapons and ammunition disposal and force \nrelocation assistance to help deal with the costs of military \nrealignments in Moldova and to assist with military downsizing and \nreforms.\n  One of the areas where we can deepen U.S.-Moldovan relations is \nbilateral trade. In light of its adherence to freedom of emigration \nrequirements, compliance with threat reduction and cooperation in the \nglobal war on terrorism, the products of Moldova should not be subject \nto the sanctions of Jackson-Vanik. The U.S. must remain committed and \nengaged in assisting Moldova in pursuing economic and development \nreforms. The government in Chisinau still has important work to do in \nthese critical areas. The support and encouragement of the U.S. and the \ninternational community will be key to encouraging the Government of \nMoldova to take the necessary steps to initiate reform. The permanent \nwaiver of Jackson-Vanik and establishment of permanent normal trade \nrelations will be the foundation on which further progress in a \nburgeoning economic and energy partnership can be made.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation. It is essential that we act promptly to bolster \nthis important relationship and promote stability in this region.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 2598. A bill to increase the supply and lower the cost of \npetroleum by temporarily suspending the acquisition of petroleum for \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act \nof 2007. This bill directs the Secretary of Energy to suspend filling \nof the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, for 1 year. I appreciate \nthat Senators Bingaman, Levin, Kerry, Collins, Lieberman, and Wyden \nhave joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation. This bill \ndirects the Secretary to stop filling the reserve through direct \npurchase, royalty-in-kind or any other measures. The secretary may only \nresume filling if the price of a barrel of crude oil drops below $50 \nper barrel during the remainder of 2008.\n  The price of a barrel of oil is reaching record highs and global \nsupplies of oil continue to shrink. During this period of volatile \nmarkets and short supply, it makes no sense to me for the U.S. \nGovernment to continue to take highly valuable crude oil, especially \nlight sweet crude, off the market to store underground in a reserve \nthat is at least 96 percent full. Continuing to\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\n``top off'' the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with highly valuable crude \noil is putting upward pressure on oil prices and raising energy prices \nfor consumers.\n  I believe that we must take a ``time out'' from filling the reserve \nin order to send a signal to the market to reduce rising energy prices \nthat are hitting American consumers' pocketbooks. Lowering energy costs \nwill put additional money back into consumers' hands and will help \nprovide a real stimulus to our economy in my judgment.\n  Historically, the average price of oil used to fill the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve has been about $27 per barrel. The Administration is \nnow filling the Reserve with oil that averages over $90 per barrel, \nincluding highly sought after light sweet crude. This is a bad deal for \nAmerican taxpayers and consumers.\n  On January 8, 2008, the Secretary of Energy sent me a letter stating \nthat our Strategic Petroleum Reserve contains only 57 days of import \nprotection and that the 50,000 barrels per day they are filling with is \na small amount of the oil used on the global market daily. This is only \npart of the story. The fact is that the SPR, combined with our private \noil stocks and refining inventories, total more than 118 days of import \nprotection. The current levels in our strategic petroleum stocks are \nmore than adequate to meet our international treaty obligations \nrequiring 90 days of import protection for all OECD countries. I also \ndisagree that taking 50,000 barrels per day off the market, especially \nlight sweet crude, has no impact on energy prices. During the Clinton \nadministration, Congress signaled that it wanted more than $200 million \nsold from the SPR in 1996, the price of oil dropped precipitously in \nthe market. The market looks at many factors, including our filling of \nthe SPR. This is another reason we can afford to temporarily suspend \nfilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Further, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides directional guidance \nto expand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The provision in law clearly \nstates that filling the reserve must be achieved ``without incurring \nexcessive cost or appreciably affecting the price of petroleum products \nto consumers.'' I think filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in \ntoday's environment is indeed impacting the price of petroleum so that \nwe must defer filling for now to ease pressure on the market.\n  Finally, the Congress enacted and the President signed historic \nlegislation in December 2008--the Energy Independence and Security Act \nof 2007. That legislation established a strong foundation to put our \nNation on an alternative energy security pathway. This includes strong \nfuel economy standards and an expanded renewable fuels standard. \nConservative estimates provided by the Securing America's Future Energy \nCoalition show that the new legislation would reduce net oil imports by \n1.75 million barrels per day by 2020, increasing to 2.26 million \nbarrels per day in 2022 and rising thereafter. These estimates \nrepresent roughly half of the theoretical SPR drawdown capacity of 4.4 \nmillion barrels per day. They also increase the number of days of \nprotection afforded by a given quantity of oil in the SPR. Thus, our \nenactment of historic Energy legislation will, over time, increase the \ninsurance value of the SPR, even if the actual inventory level is \nfrozen or slightly decreased.\n  Let me be clear. I believe maintaining a Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nis in the economic and national security interests of this country. \nHowever, during this time of record oil prices, rising energy costs for \nconsumers, economic downturn and tight global oil supplies, the U.S. \nGovernment should suspend taking highly valuable oil off the market to \nstore underground in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SUSPENSION OF PETROLEUM ACQUISITION FOR STRATEGIC \n                   PETROLEUM RESERVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b) and \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, during calendar \n     year 2008, the Secretary of Energy shall suspend acquisition \n     of petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the \n     royalty-in-kind program or any other acquisition method.\n       (b) Resumption.--The Secretary may resume acquisition of \n     petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the \n     royalty-in-kind program or any other acquisition method under \n     subsection (a) not earlier than 30 days after the date on \n     which the Secretary notifies Congress that the Secretary has \n     determined that the weighted average price of petroleum in \n     the United States for the most recent 90-day period is $50 or \n     less per barrel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2600. A bill to provide for the designation of a single ZIP code \nfor Windsor Heights, Iowa; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague from Iowa \nto introduce a bill to provide the town of Windsor Heights, IA, its own \nZIP code. Currently, the residents of Windsor Heights share three ZIP \ncodes with surrounding communities, Des Moines, West Des Moines, and \nUrbandale. Confusion between the ZIP codes and city boundaries has \ncaused delays in mail delivery, an increased amount of undelivered \nmail, and numerous complaints from frustrated citizens. Each day \nsensitive materials, including financial statements, credit cards, \nSocial Security checks, and passports pass through the mail stream. It \nis imperative that residents are able to rely on the safe and timely \ndelivery of these documents.\n  The complications from this problem reach beyond mail delivery. \nDuring the recent Iowa Caucuses, residents living in Windsor Heights \nPrecinct 2 were directed to the wrong address when looking for their \ncaucus location. Windsor Heights residents who use the 50322 ZIP code--\none which is shared with neighboring Urbandale--were incorrectly \nadvised that the caucus location was in Urbandale, rather than Windsor \nHeights. Furthermore, because insurance rates are based on ZIP codes, \nresidents pay premiums based on neighboring Des Moines and Urbandale, \nrather than Windsor Heights, making it more difficult for providers to \nsell car insurance to residents.\n  City officials have tried in vain for almost 5 years to acquire a ZIP \ncode for Windsor Heights. It is my hope that the Senate will quickly \nact upon this legislation to enable them to do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2601. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to convey to \nKing and Kittitas Counties Fire District No. 51 a certain parcel of \nreal property for use as a site for a new Snoqualmie Pass fire and \nrescue station; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Snoqualmie \nPass Land Conveyance Act, together with Senator Murray. This bill would \ntransfer an acre and a half of Forest Service land to the King and \nKittitas Counties Fire District No. 51, also known as Snoqualmie Pass \nFire and Rescue. This land would be conveyed at no cost, but would have \nto be used by the Fire District specifically for the construction of a \nnew fire station or it would revert back to the Federal Government.\n  Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue serves a portion of two counties on \nboth sides of the Cascade Mountains along Interstate 90, a community of \n350 full-time residents that peaks to 1,500 during the ski season. \nAdditionally, the ski area estimates 20,000 patrons on a busy weekend, \nand the Department of Transportation estimates that up to 60,000 \nvehicles travel through the fire district on a busy day making it the \nbusiest mountain highway in the country.\n  This area is also the major transportation corridor for goods and \nservices between eastern and western Washington. The all-volunteer Fire \nDepartment averages over 300 calls a year with about a 10 percent \nannual increase in call volumes, which is more than triple the amount \nof calls a typical all-volunteer fire department would respond to in a \nyear. Mr. Presdient, 84\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\npercent of those incidents are for non-tax paying residents. \nConsequently, the Fire Department has the characteristics of a large \ncity with the limited resources of a small community.\n  In recent years, this area has been the scene of major winter \nsnowstorms, multi-vehicle accidents, and even avalanches. The Fire \nDistrict is often the first responder to incidents in the area, which \nis prone to rock slides and avalanches and it is not uncommon for this \ncommunity to be isolated for hours or even days at a time. Several \nthousand people can be stranded at the Pass during those periods when \nthe Pass is closed and while the Department of Transportation works \nquickly to get the roads back open, it can be very taxing on local \nresources.\n  For decades, the Fire District has been leasing its current site from \nthe Forest Service. They operate out of an aging building that was not \ndesigned to be a fire station. Through their hard work and dedication, \nthey have served their community ably despite this building's many \nshortcomings. However, with traffic on the rise and the need for \nemergency services in the area growing, the Fire District needs to move \nto a true fire station.\n  The Fire District has identified a nearby site that would better \nserve the public safety needs at the Pass. This location would provide \neasy access to the interstate in either direction, reducing emergency \nresponse times. The parcel is on Forest Service property, immediately \nadjacent to a freeway interchange, between a frontage road and the \ninterstate itself. The parcel was formerly a disposal site during \nconstruction of the freeway and is now a gravel lot.\n  I recognize that the Forest Service does not normally support \nconveyances of land free of charge. However, I believe an exception \nshould be made in this particular circumstance because of the important \npublic service provided by the Fire District, the heavy traffic and \nemergency calls created by nonresidents in the area, the distance of \nSnoqualmie Pass from other communities with emergency services, and \nbecause of the high amount of federal land ownership in the area, which \nseverely limits the local tax base. In fact, the Forest Service has \nacquired 20,000 acres in King and Kittitas counties at a cost of more \nthan $52 million over just the last 10 years.\n  Passage of this legislation would not guarantee that a new station \nwould be built. The Fire District would have to work hard to gather the \nfinancing that would be required from State and local sources, as well \nas any applicable Federal grants or loans. However, the conveyance of \nthis site at no cost would help this Fire District hold down the \noverall cost of this project.\n  I am confident this can be done with little or no impact to the \nenvironment. Over the last year, following the introduction of this \nlegislation in the House of Representatives, H.R. 1285, there were \nongoing discussions in Washington State to address some lingering \nissues related to this conveyance. I am pleased those discussions \nreached resolution. I am also pleased that discussions with my staff, \nSenator Murray's staff, and staff of Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee led to an amendment to H.R. 1285 before it passed the House \nof Representatives that would better tailor the conveyance to both the \nenvironmental and the emergency response needs at the Pass by reducing \nthe amount of land to be conveyed from 3 acres to 1.5 acres.\n  It is my understanding that there are offers of support to construct \na new fire station from state and local officials, and to mitigate any \neffects of construction, and I support those efforts. To offset any \npotential impacts from construction of a new fire station and to \nimprove wildlife connectivity at the pass, I encourage the Forest \nService to work in collaboration with state and local officials, the \nCascade Land Conservancy, Snoqualmie Fire District, Sierra Club, and \nConservation Northwest to identify opportunities for off-site habitat \nacquisition.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senator Murray and my colleagues on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee to review this issue and bring \nthis bill forward. I look forward to continuing to work with the \ncommunity at the Pass and my colleagues to improve public safety in the \narea.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2601\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Snoqualmie Pass Land \n     Conveyance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LAND CONVEYANCE, NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM LAND, \n                   KITTITAS COUNTY, WASHINGTON.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Required.--The Secretary of Agriculture \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall \n     convey, without consideration, to King and Kittitas Counties \n     Fire District No. 51 of King and Kittitas Counties, \n     Washington (referred to in this section as the ``District''), \n     all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to \n     a parcel of National Forest System land in Kittitas County, \n     Washington, consisting of approximately 1.5 acres within the \n     SW \\1/4\\ of the SE \\1/4\\ of sec. 4, T. 22 N., R. 11 E., \n     Willamette meridian, for the purpose of permitting the \n     District to use the parcel as a site for a new Snoqualmie \n     Pass fire and rescue station.\n       (b) Reversionary Interest.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines at any time \n     that the real property conveyed under subsection (a) is not \n     being used in accordance with the purpose of the conveyance \n     specified in that subsection--\n       (A) all right, title, and interest in and to the property \n     shall revert, at the option of the Secretary, to the United \n     States; and\n       (B) the United States shall have the right of immediate \n     entry onto the property.\n       (2) Determination requirements.--A determination of the \n     Secretary under this subsection shall be made on the record \n     after an opportunity for a hearing.\n       (c) Survey.--\n       (1) In general.--If necessary, the exact acreage and legal \n     description of the real property to be conveyed under \n     subsection (a) shall be determined by a survey satisfactory \n     to the Secretary.\n       (2) Cost.--The cost of a survey under paragraph (1) shall \n     be paid by the District.\n       (d) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under subsection (a) as the Secretary \n     considers to be appropriate to protect the interests of the \n     United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 2602. A bill to amend the Department of the Interior, Environment, \nand Related Agencies appropriations Act, 2008, to terminate the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Treasury to deduct amounts from \ncertain States; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--a \ncompanion bill will be introduced in the House by my colleagues \nRepresentatives Salazar and Udall--to restore Colorado's share of oil \nand gas leasing revenue.\n  The 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill includes a provision, requested \nby the Bush Administration, to reduce the share of mineral royalties \npaid to Colorado and other western states. Specifically, the \nadministration's proposal to reduce the State's share of mineral \nrevenues from 50 percent to 48 percent does not serve the taxpayers who \nfund the government nor does it serve the states that allow energy \nproduction to happen within their borders. Colorado is blessed with an \nabundance of natural resources, including its deposits of oil and \nnatural gas. Our State's economy benefits from the production of these \nresources, and we deserve to continue receiving our fair share of the \nrevenues.\n  The administration attempts to justify this reduction as necessary to \ndefray the administrative costs related to the management of onshore \nleasing activity. We believe this assertion is unfounded and oppose any \nattempt to take money that is rightfully owed to our State in order to \npay for more Federal bureaucracy. This is money that our state could \nuse to help mitigate the effects of increased oil and gas drilling \nactivity and for other important state priorities, such as education \nand health care.\n  Our legislation repeals the administration's money grab and restores \neach State's share to its full, coequal 50 percent of mineral leasing \nrevenues. We cannot allow the Federal government to take oil and gas \nleasing revenues intended to help the communities of Colorado. This \nlanguage was inserted late into last year's omnibus spending bill and \nmust be corrected. Our legislation does just that.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S742-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S742-S743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S742]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 444--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \nSTRONG ALLIANCE THAT HAS BEEN FORGED BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE \n REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND CONGRATULATING MYUNG-BAK LEE ON HIS ELECTION TO \n                THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Hagel) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I introduce a resolution expressing \nthe sense of the U.S. Senate regarding the strong alliance that has \nbeen forged between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea, ROK, and \ncongratulating Myung-Bak Lee on his election to the presidency of the \nROK.\n  The U.S.-ROK Alliance is no ordinary alliance. It was forged in \ndesperate struggle against North Korean aggressors, and it has been \nhoned by more than 50 years of joint military operations on and off the \nKorean Peninsula. On the peninsula, ROK and U.S. forces stand shoulder-\nto-shoulder, keeping the peace as they have done for 55 years. Off the \npeninsula, South Korean troops have fought alongside U.S. forces in \nVietnam, Iraq twice, and Afghanistan. Even today, South Korea has more \nthan 1,000 troops in Iraq. And Seoul voted last December to keep at \nleast 600 troops in Iraq through the end of this year.\n  The willingness of South Korea to devote blood and treasure to \nstruggles far from its shores is not only a testimony to the loyalty of \nthe Korean people to the American people, who came to their aid in a \ntime of need, but also proof of the convergent national interests of \nthe U.S. and the Republic of Korea.\n  The U.S.-ROK Alliance is rooted in common strategic interests, but it \nis also fortified by common democratic values. South Korea has \ndeveloped a vibrant democratic system, with strong protections for \ncivil liberties and human rights. It was not always thus.\n  South Korea's journey from authoritarianism and poverty to democracy \nand prosperity has been a long one--four decades of hard work by the \nKorean people. Democracy did not come without sacrifices. The South \nKorean government's bloody suppression of the Kwangju democracy \nuprising of May 1980, left thousands of unarmed civilian protestors \ndead or injured. Although the dictatorship persisted for another 7 \nyears, the democratic aspirations of the Korean people could not be \ndenied.\n  In the end, the Korean people accomplished a remarkably peaceful \ntransition from dictatorship to democracy. By also building a robust \neconomy that has lifted millions out of poverty, the Republic of Korea \nhas provided a model for other developing nations in East Asia and \nbeyond. South Korea is a world in information technology, with a much \nhigher rate of broadband internet access, 30 percent, and more \nbroadband total users, 15 million, than the United Kingdom, 24 percent, \n14 million, or France, 22 percent, 14 million.\n  Just as Korea is no ordinary ally, President-elect Lee is no ordinary \nSouth Korean politician. The son of a farm worker, Lee was born in \nOsaka, Japan, on December 19, 1941, returning to Korea with his parents \nonly after the end of World War II. As a boy, Lee worked with his \nmother, who sold ice cream, cakes, and other sundries to supplement the \nfamily's income. He worked as a garbage collector to help pay for \nschool expenses, eventually earning admission to the prestigious Korea \nUniversity to study business administration.\n  In 1965, Lee joined Hyundai Engineering and Construction company, \nwhich had only 90 employees at the time. Over the course of 30 years at \nHyundai, he advanced from junior executive to chairman, and helped \nbuild Hyundai into a global force in automotive manufacturing, \nconstruction, and real estate, with 160,000 employees.\n  Lee's entry into politics came only after he had retired from his \nHyundai career. He was elected Mayor of Seoul, Korea's capital and \nlargest city, on a platform stressing a balance between economic \ndevelopment and environmental protection. He told the city's people \nthat he would remove the elevated highway that ran through the heart of \nSeoul and restore the buried Cheonggyecheon stream--an urban waterway \nthat Lee himself had helped pave over in the 1960s. His opponents \ninsisted that the plan would cause traffic chaos and cost billions. \nThree years later, Cheonggyecheon was reborn, changing the face of \nSeoul. Lee also revamped the city's transportation system, adding clean \nrapid-transit buses.\n  President-elect Lee stressed during his campaign that the U.S.-ROK \nalliance would be the cornerstone of Korea's security policy, and that \nstrengthening and deepening the alliance would be a top priority for \nhis administration. On North-South relations, he has pledged to sustain \nSouth Korea's engagement and investment in the North. But he has also \narticulated a policy of ``tough love,'' saying that he will consider \nprogress on denuclearization as his government ponders major new \ninvestments designed to help modernize North Korea's economy.\n  Today, as the people of the U.S. and the Republic of Korea look to \nthe future, we can take comfort from the fact that we need not confront \nthe challenges of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, terrorism, energy \nsecurity, and global climate change alone.\n  Working together, we will convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear \nweapons program and build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. \nWorking together, we can help inspire good governance and promote \neconomic growth in Asia and beyond.

Res. 65\n\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United \n     States, was born of humble roots on February 12, 1809, in \n     Hardin County, Kentucky;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln rose to political prominence as an \n     attorney with a reputation for fairness, honesty, and a \n     belief that all men are created equal and that they are \n     endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln was elected and served with \n     distinction in 1832 as a captain of an Illinois militia \n     company during the Black Hawk War;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln was elected to the Illinois \n     legislature in 1834 from Sangamon County and was successively \n     reelected until 1840;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln revered the Declaration of \n     Independence, forming the motivating moral and natural law \n     principle for his opposition to the spread of slavery to new \n     States entering the Union and to his belief in slavery's \n     ultimate demise;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1846 to serve in the \n     United States House of Representatives, ably representing \n     central Illinois;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln re-entered political life as a \n     reaction to the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, \n     which he opposed;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln expounded on his views of natural \n     rights during the series of debates with Stephen A. Douglas \n     in 1858, declaring in Charleston, Illinois that natural \n     rights were ``enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, \n     the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'', \n     and these views brought Lincoln into national prominence;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln, through a legacy of courage, \n     character, and patriotism, was elected to office as the 16th \n     President of the United States on November 6, 1860;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln believed the Declaration of \n     Independence to be the anchor of American republicanism, \n     stating on February 22, 1861, during an address at \n     Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that, ``I \n     have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from \n     the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence . \n     . . I have often inquired of myself, what great principle or \n     idea it was that kept this Confederacy so long together. It \n     was not the mere matter of separation of the Colonies from \n     the motherland; but that sentiment in the Declaration of \n     Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of \n     this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time. \n     It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight \n     would be lofted from the shoulders of men'';\n       Whereas, upon taking office and being thrust into the midst \n     of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln wrote the \n     Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all slaves in southern \n     States that seceded from the Union on January 1, 1863;\n       Whereas, on November 19, 1863, Abraham Lincoln dedicated \n     the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania with the \n     Gettysburg Address, which would later be known as his \n     greatest speech, that harkened back to the promises of the \n     Declaration of Independence in the first sentence: ``Four \n     score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth, on this \n     continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated \n     to the proposition that all men are created equal'';\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln was reelected to the presidency on \n     November 8, 1864, by 55 percent of the popular vote;\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for his \n     country, dying 6 weeks into his second term on April 15, \n     1865;\n       Whereas the year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary \n     of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, and the United States will \n     observe 2 years of commemorations beginning February 12, \n     2008; and\n       Whereas all Americans could benefit from studying the life \n     of Abraham Lincoln as a model of achieving the American Dream \n     through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of \n     education: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) requests that the President issue a proclamation each \n     year recognizing the anniversary of the birth of President \n     Abraham Lincoln and calling upon the people of the United \n     States to observe such anniversary with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities; and\n       (2) encourages State and local governments and local \n     educational agencies to devote sufficient time to study and \n     appreciate the reverence and respect Abraham Lincoln had for \n     the significance and importance of the Declaration of \n     Independence in the development of American history, \n     jurisprudence, and the spread of freedom around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/06/senate-section/article/S743-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S743-S744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3989.
