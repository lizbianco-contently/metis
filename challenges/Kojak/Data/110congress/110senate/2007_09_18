The bill will be considered \nunder a very short time agreement. Members should expect a rollcall \nvote around noon or maybe even before that. Upon disposition of the DC \nCollege Access bill, the Senate will recess for the regular party \nmeetings.\n  This afternoon, when the Senate resumes at 2:15, there will be 15 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe underlying bill, the DC Voting Rights bill. Of course, if cloture \nis invoked, the Senate will remain on the motion. If cloture fails, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the Department of Defense \nauthorization measure.\n  Mr. President, I would also say with respect to the schedule we have \nthis week, we have a lot of work to do, but the most religious, the \nmost important holiday of the year for those of the Jewish faith, \nbegins this Friday at sundown. Yom Kippur is the holiest of days for \nJews all around the world, and there are a number of the Jewish faith \nwho need to be on the west coast by sundown on Friday. Therefore, we \nwill probably not have any votes after about 10:30 or quarter to 11 on \nFriday. We have a lot of work to do, but this is something that is \nimportant and necessary that we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11615-7", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, let me also say this about the remarks I am \nabout to give. This has no negative reflection on my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Kentucky. He and I disagree on a number of \nissues. We have had longstanding debates here on the Senate floor about \nhow he feels about campaign finance reform. He approaches this on an \nintellectual basis. I think I am right; he thinks he is right. But it \ndoesn't take away from my respect for his having the right to have an \nopinion here in the Senate about the issue of campaign finance. The \nsame, I think, on the issue of flag burning, for example. He will \ndisagree with me on the DC Voting Rights bill. That is his privilege. \nHe does it on an intellectual basis, a conclusion that he has reached. \nSo my remarks have nothing to do, in any way, with an intention to \ndenigrate my friend's feelings about this bill.\n\n[[Page S11616]]\n\n  Yesterday we celebrated the 220th anniversary of the signing of our \nConstitution, and I talked about it yesterday. In its preamble, our \nFounders laid out the values to which our Nation has aspired: justice, \ndomestic tranquility, common defense, general welfare, the blessings of \nliberty. The Government which has endured, our Government, and served \nus so well, recognized these goals could only be secured by equal \nrepresentation. That means the right to vote, the right to elect \nindividuals who will protect and promote our personal rights as well as \nthe national interest.\n  The universal right to vote was established a long time ago with the \n15th amendment, which barred discrimination based on race, with the \n19th amendment, which guaranteed the right for women to vote, and with \nthe Voting Rights Act, which ensured enforcement of these laws for \npeople no matter their color.\n\n  In 1873, Susan B. Anthony faced trial for voting illegally, a woman \nwho voted. In her defense she said:\n\n       In the first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence \n     is an assertion of the natural right of all to the ballot; \n     for how can ``the consent of the governed'' be given, if the \n     right to vote be denied?\n\n  Today the right to equal representation is still denied to residents \nof the District of Columbia. These nearly 600,000 Americans pay Federal \ntaxes, sit on juries, serve in our Armed Forces. Yet they are given \nonly a delegate in the Congress, not a real voting Member. This is \nnothing more than shadow representation. This injustice has stood for \nfar too long. We haven't voted on this matter for some 50 years. It is \ntime we did that again. Shadow representation is shadow citizenship.\n  This afternoon we will move to vote on a bill that honors the \nresidents of the District who responsibly meet every single expectation \nof American citizenship but are denied this basic civil right in \nreturn. I commend Senator Lieberman, who has taken the leadership on \nthis issue for no reason or agenda other than he thinks it is the right \nthing to do.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can guarantee the \nfull rights of citizenship for District residents.\n  I also urge my colleagues to support reauthorization of the DC \nCollege Access Act, which we will vote on this morning. This provides \nto District students who would otherwise be unfairly disadvantaged by \nthe lack of in-State universities. It provides scholarships to make up \nthe difference between in-State and out-of-State public universities. \nIt doesn't allow any student to get in who is not qualified. It does \nallow a differential in the method of paying. The DC College Access Act \nlevels the playing field and unlocks the doors to education and all the \nopportunity it affords to thousands of American students right here in \nthe District of Columbia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11616-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On this \nday in 1793, George Washington laid the cornerstone to the United \nStates Capitol. The building would take nearly a century to complete, \nbut the magnificence of the finished product would stand as a testament \nto the perseverance of generations of Americans, and to the enduring \nprinciples it was meant to embody and project. So we pause today to \nreflect on the many contributions of our first President, not only to \nthis Nation but also to the city that bears his name, not the least of \nwhich is this gleaming symbol at its heart.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11616-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the DC Voting Rights \nAct today. It is a tough issue. It is one with which I am familiar. I \nhave chaired the DC Subcommittee both on the authorizing and the \nappropriating side. I have worked in the District of Columbia on a \nnumber of different issues. I reside here when I am not in my home \nState of Kansas. My home is in Kansas, but I have an apartment that is \nhere, so I am living in the District. I have talked with many people \nabout the Voting Rights Act issue. I am sympathetic with the people of \nthe District of Columbia not having an elected delegate to represent \nthem, although I know very well the lady who is representing them in \nthe House, Eleanor Holmes Norton, who is an outstanding Representative \nfor the District of Columbia, although she does not have the right to \nvote on the floor. I have worked with her on many issues to rebuild the \nfamily structure in Washington, DC with things such as Marriage \nDevelopment Accounts. I worked with her on revitalizing the District of \nColumbia with an economic revitalization bill that passed when I first \ncame into the Senate in 1996. I worked with her and others on the \nschools in Washington, DC, and the deplorable state of the schools in \nWashington, DC.\n  I have worked on all these issues and I am familiar with this issue \nand the Voting Rights Act of 2007. Yet I cannot support this bill. I \ncan and would support a constitutional amendment allowing the District \nof Columbia the right to vote in the House of Representatives, but I \ncannot support this Voting Rights Act. I want to speak here on the \nfloor this morning and outline why I cannot vote for it.\n  Congress has long recognized we can only grant District residents the \nability to participate in Federal elections through constitutional \namendment. Congress has recognized that. Prior to 1961, for example, \nDistrict residents were not permitted to vote in Presidential \nelections. Article II, section 1 of the Constitution expressly provides \nthat the electoral college should be comprised of electors from each \nState, in a number equal to the State's combined congressional \ndelegation. In the face of this express constitutional language, \nCongress recognized that a change in the law would require a change in \nthe Constitution itself, looking at the plain meaning of the statute \nand the plain meaning of the Constitution. That is why, when we granted \nDC residents the right to participate in Presidential elections, we \nwent about it the right way, by passing what would become the 23rd \namendment to the Constitution, allowing DC residents the right to \nparticipate in a Presidential election.\n  We saw the plain meaning of the Constitution and we did the right \nthing; we amended the Constitution. Just as article II of the \nConstitution, which deals with the Presidency, limited the right to \nappoint Presidential electors to the States, article I, which deals \nwith the Congress, clearly and repeatedly limits representation in the \nHouse and the Senate to the States. That is what it says. Article I \nsays that the House:\n\n     shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the \n     People of the several States, and the Electors in each State \n     shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the \n     most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\n\n  It requires that each Representative:\n\n     when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he \n     [was] chosen.\n\n\n[[Page S11617]]\n\n\n  It mandated that:\n\n     each state . . . have at Least one Representative,\n\nand provides that:\n\n       When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, \n     the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election \n     to fill such Vacancies.\n\n  Rarely do we have an issue in the Senate that has so much plain \nlanguage from the Constitution involved. This one has a lot of plain \nlanguage from the Constitution. I believe in strict construction of the \nConstitution. I think it would be hard for me to call myself a strict \nconstructionist and say that we can, as a Congress, bypass the clear \nwords in the U.S. Constitution and say we are just going to grant these \nrights to the District of Columbia to have an elected representative \nvoting in the House of Representatives, even though I support that. \nThat is something we should do, but we should do it the right way by \namending the Constitution and not the wrong way by passing a law here \nthat is clearly unconstitutional--and I will go through the court cases \nthat have declared it unconstitutional--and then say: We will let the \ncourts sort it out. I am a Federal officer, sworn to uphold the \nConstitution. I need to do so in this body and not just say I will hand \nit off to the courts.\n  Congressional Democrats in 1978 recognized this fact. That year, \nCongress passed an amendment giving District residents a voting seat in \nthe House. When the House Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of \nDemocratic chairman Peter Rodino, reported out the amendment, the \naccompanying report properly recognized that ``[i]f the citizens of the \nDistrict are to have voting representation in the Congress, a \nconstitutional amendment is essential; statutory action alone will not \nsuffice.'' Sadly, the 1978 amendment failed to garner the support \nneeded from the States to secure ratification.\n  We all recognize that amending the Constitution is difficult, but it \nstill remains the right way to deal with something of this nature. I am \ncertainly not alone in concluding that this bill, although well \nintentioned, violates the plain language of the Constitution. The very \ncourt that will hear challenges to this bill under its expedited \njudicial review provision has previously ruled that District residents \ndo not have a constitutional right to congressional representation.\n  In Adams vs. Clinton in 2000, a three-judge panel of the Federal \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia concluded that the \nConstitution plainly limited congressional representation to the \nStates. The court explained that ``the overlapping and interconnected \nuse of the term `state' in the relevant provisions of Article I, the \nhistorical evidence of contemporary understandings, and the opinions of \nour judicial forebears all reinforce how deeply congressional \nrepresentation is tied to the structure of statehood. . . . There is \nsimply no evidence that the Framers intended that not only citizens of \nstates, but unspecified others as well, would share in the \ncongressional franchise.''\n  The District residents who brought suit in Adams v. Clinton appealed \ntheir case all the way to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court \naffirmed the trial court's ruling. That is the same court which would \nhear this case.\n  When Congress granted the DC and territorial delegates a broader role \nin the House by allowing them to vote in committee, several House \nMembers sued to challenge the delegates' expanded power. In Michael v. \nAnderson, the Federal court for the District of Columbia Circuit took \ncare to note that their expanded roles passed constitutional muster \nonly because they did not give the essential qualities of House \nRepresentatives to the delegates.\n  In light of the Constitution's clear limitation on House membership \nto representatives from the States, I cannot vote for cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to this bill. I don't believe we in Congress should \nact to pass legislation that we know violates the Constitution, \nessentially passing the buck to the Federal courts to strike down what \nwe never should have enacted in the first place and to strike down what \nthey have already spoken on as recently as 2000. When we neglect our \nduty to the Constitution, we fail to uphold our oath as Senators to \ndefend this great document.\n  My friends in the Senate who support this bill rely primarily on two \narguments, neither of which outweighs the clear mandate of article II.\n  First, they claim that another provision in the Constitution, the so-\ncalled District clause, allows Congress to essentially grant any sort \nof legislation related to the District of Columbia, including \nlegislation to give DC residents a voting House Member. This clause \npermits Congress to pass laws to provide for the general welfare of \nDistrict residents. This bill, however, does not propose to provide for \nthe welfare of DC residents; it seeks to alter the fundamental \ncomposition of the House.\n  Second, they correctly point out that there are certain instances in \nthe Constitution where references to ``citizens of the states'' have \nbeen interpreted to include District residents. Many of these cases, \nthough, involve individual rights, and it is obvious that DC residents \ndo not lose their rights as citizens of the United States by choosing \nto live in the District. For example, they retain the right to trial by \njury. They may bring civil suits in Federal courts against citizens of \nother States. This bill, however, is not a bill about individual rights \nsuch as the right to free speech, freedom of religion, or due process \nof law. This is a bill about the makeup of the House of Representatives \nitself. It is about the delicate balance our constitutional Framers \nstruck in affording representation to the States in the House and the \nSenate. It is about the fundamental structure of our Government. We \nsimply cannot override the clear language of the Constitution which \nlimits congressional representation to the States simply by legislative \nfiat.\n  While I sympathize with the supporters of this bill, I also take \nseriously my duty to the law, to upholding the Constitution. I will \nsupport and do support a constitutional amendment allowing DC the right \nto gain the vote. I do not support this bill as I do not believe it to \nbe constitutional under the clear reading of the Constitution and under \nrecent interpretations by the court.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11617-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11617-S11618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to again urge the entire \nSenate, and particularly the majority leader, to get the WRDA bill, the \nWater Resources Development Act, onto the floor of the Senate \nabsolutely as soon as possible for passage.\n  Of course, I represent the State of Louisiana. A little while ago, on \nAugust 29, we commemorated--certainly did not celebrate but properly \ncommemorated--the 2-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. A little \nwhile from now, on September 24, we will similarly commemorate the 2-\nyear anniversary of Hurricane Rita, which devastated southwest \nLouisiana, South Acadiana, as well as southeast Texas.\n  Of course, the Nation and this Congress, this Senate, has done an \nenormous amount with regard to hurricane recovery. But we all know that \nchallenge and that work continues. There is nothing more important with \nregard to that work, with regard to ensuring good, strong hurricane \nflood protection in the future--unlike we have had in the past, \nclearly, in light of Hurricane Katrina--than passing this water \nresources bill.\n  As you know, it has gone through every stage of the process except \npassage on the floor of the Senate. We had a Senate bill. We had a \nHouse bill. We had a conference committee. We had deliberations of the \nconference committee. I was honored to serve on that conference \ncommittee and helped finalize the final conference committee report.\n\n[[Page S11618]]\n\n  Even before the August recess, the House of Representatives passed \nthat conference committee report. So now all eyes are on the floor of \nthe Senate. That is where we must finish the job. That is why I urge \nSenator Reid and others to put the WRDA bill on the floor of the Senate \nas soon as possible.\n  Recently, on September 6, I sent Senator Reid a letter, following up \non numerous discussions we have had with other Members, urging him to \nput the bill on the floor as soon as possible, certainly during \nSeptember. Again, I come to the floor of the Senate to urge the Senate \nleadership to do that in light of the crucial nature of this bill for \ncontinued recovery, hurricane flood protection in Louisiana.\n  I am particularly disappointed this week that is not happening while \nwe go to other business, including the DC voting rights bill. Now, \nthere are folks very interested and focused and committed to that DC \nvoting rights bill. That is their right. I have no particular quarrel \nwith that. I am going to vote against it because I sincerely believe it \nis clearly contrary to the U.S. Constitution. But that is a legitimate \ndisagreement, and we can debate about that and have that legitimate \ndisagreement. I do not quarrel with their focus and their passion. I \ndo, quite frankly, quarrel with putting that on the floor of the Senate \nbefore the WRDA bill, when that WRDA bill and significant provisions in \nit are life and death to south Louisiana, to our recovery in the wake \nof Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Those events, 2 years ago last month and this month, make passage of \nthe WRDA bill a true emergency priority for this body. The same cannot \nbe said of the DC voting rights bill or other things that are being \nconsidered for Senate floor action. Again, those other measures--the DC \nvoting rights bill, in particular--have their proponents, and that is \ntheir right. I do not quarrel with their passion for that. But that is \nnot the sort of real emergency as we face in Louisiana with regard to \nthe protection we need.\n  We are in the midst of a hurricane season. We are at the peak of a \nhurricane season. Yet we continue to be years and years overdue for \nthis WRDA bill and all the very significant provisions it contains for \nour people, for our State, for our vanishing coastline.\n  So, in closing, I again urge the majority leader to put the WRDA bill \non the floor of the Senate as soon as possible, and absolutely this \nmonth, and to establish the right priorities for this body and for this \ncountry, including that very important effort which I believe should be \non the floor of the Senate, should gain action, should gain focus \nbefore other measures, including the DC voting rights bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11618-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11618-S11619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRIVATE SECURITY CONTRACTORS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there was an event that occurred yesterday \nin Iraq which is significant. A decision was made by the Iraqi \nGovernment to order a private security firm known as Blackwater USA to \nleave the country. It involved the fatal shooting of eight Iraqi \ncivilians following a car bomb attack against the State Department \nconvoy. I don't know the circumstances of that attack, nor do I know \nthe circumstances that led to the killing of these innocent civilians. \nOnly a thorough and fair investigation will bring us to any kind of \nclosure on this particular matter.\n  What happened yesterday is going to dramatize to the American people \nsomething significant that has occurred in this war in Iraq. For the \nfirst time, we are seeing massive numbers of private security \ncontractors who are at work for the U.S. Government in Iraq. They are \nin a security or quasi-military capacity. I have been to Iraq three \ntimes. They are often dispatched to provide security for visiting \nmembers of the Cabinet and Members of Congress. I will say at the \noutset that although I have serious misgivings about Blackwater as an \norganization, the individual men who have dedicated their lives to this \nservice are risking their lives in the process, and their courage and \nbravery to step up is something that should be acknowledged and never \ndiminished.\n  But what this matter will bring to light is the fact that this \nsecurity contractor, Blackwater, has enjoyed a charmed existence with \nthe Bush administration from the start. This is another example of a \nfirm which has been given millions of taxpayers' dollars to do a job in \nIraq without accountability, without the kind of disclosure--basic \ndisclosure--which American taxpayers deserve and demand. The \ncircumstances of these contracts, the particulars involved in them, and \nthe standards that are applied to them are in a shadowy world that has \nbeen kept away from the public eye by the Bush administration from the \nstart. That is not only unfortunate, it is unfair, and we need to do \nsomething about it as a government.\n  This operation, Blackwater USA, started by Mr. Erik Prince of \nMichigan, has been politically affiliated with this administration for \na long time. Now that there have been questions raised about the \nconduct of their operations, they have brought in some of the biggest \npolitical heavy-hitters in Washington to keep their operations cloaked \nin secrecy and veiled so that the American people don't know what they \nare all about. They do it in the name of security and classified \ninformation at a time when we need more transparency and more openness \nand more accountability.\n  These security contractors are often paid three times what ordinary \nsoldiers receive. The rules they operate under are much different than \nthose our military faces every single day in Iraq. They are given \nmundane tasks in many instances and paid enormous sums of money to \nperform them--to transport kitchen equipment, for example--in Iraq at \ngreat expense to our Government.\n  Several years ago in Fallujah, there was a terrible incident \ninvolving several Blackwater contractors. These contractors were \nguarding kitchen equipment that was being transported across Fallujah \nwhen they were ambushed and killed. It is hard for anyone to forget the \nimages that followed. Their bodies were dragged out of their vehicles, \nand they were beaten and burned and hanged on a local bridge. There \nwere newscasts and videotape around the world of this heinous and \nbarbaric act. As a result of it, our Government made an invasion of \nFallujah and put at risk thousands of American troops to bring some \norder to that scene.\n  What is not well known is that the families of those Blackwater \nsecurity forces--contractors--who were killed in Fallujah believe their \nloved ones were put in harm's way by this company, by Blackwater. \nBlackwater had promised to these contractors that if they would come to \nIraq, they would be given armored vehicles, adequate protection, and \nadequate equipment. In fact, that was not the case. Many of the same \ncontractors who were at risk were complaining about this. In fact, one \nwho died that day had made a formal request of the leadership of \nBlackwater to make good on their promise to protect their employees who \nworked for Blackwater. They lost their lives.\n  Their families then went to court trying to make sure Blackwater was \nheld accountable. As the mother of one of these contractors and former \nNavy SEAL said, it wasn't about the money, it was about accountability \nand to make sure Blackwater, a company that was very profitable through \nthis administration and this war, actually protected its employees. \nWell, I need not tell you that they faced an uphill struggle with their \nlawsuit, which is still pending. Blackwater refused discovery, refused \nto disclose information, made every effort they could to keep material \nwitnesses away from this trial and this proceeding, and unfortunately, \nthe facts have never come forward as they should for all of us to \nunderstand.\n  Where the Blackwater security contractors were promised armored \nvehicles, in fact, they were given SUVs with little protection. Where \nthey were promised to have groups to protect them, they were sent into \nharm's way with inadequate numbers of forces.\n\n[[Page S11619]]\n\nTime and again, this contractor, profiting from our Government, \nprofiting from this administration, didn't provide the basic protection \nit promised to its own employees.\n  I believe it is time for this Congress to open this door, to lift \nthis lid and look inside, about the security contractors who are at \nwork in Iraq today at the expense of our Government. We need to know \nhow many are working. We need to know what rules they operate by. We \nneed to know what incidents they have been involved in. America is held \naccountable for their conduct. Even though they may be private sector \nemployees, for every Iraqi, I am sure they look at them as symbolizing \nand representing the United States of America.\n  It is our responsibility to ask the hard questions about these \nsecurity contractors, what they are doing, and whether anything \nimproper has occurred. The Iraqi Government has reached this conclusion \nand asked them to leave. I will be surprised at the end of the day if \nthey do leave. They are so closely connected to the highest levels of \nthis administration, it is hard to imagine they will actually leave the \ncountry even after the Iraqi Government has called publicly for that to \nhappen.\n  So I have asked the leadership on the Democratic side to look into \nthe security contractor arrangements, as well as the Blackwater USA \ncompany in particular, to get down to the bottom line and the basic \nquestion as to whether these people who are involved in this conduct \nhave done things that really don't advance the cause of peace and \nstability in Iraq. That is a legitimate question which should be asked \nof every contractor involved in business in Iraq.\n  We know for the last 5 years on Capitol Hill hard questions were not \nasked. There was little or no oversight by this Congress asking whether \nour taxpayers' dollars were being well spent, whether the right \ndecisions were being made. Sadly, we find ourselves mired in a war that \nhas cost us almost 3,800 American lives, with more than 30,000 injured, \nwith no end in sight. It has been a colossal foreign policy mistake--\none that we will pay for for generations.\n  Despite the heroism of our men and women in uniform day-in and day-\nout, policymakers in Washington have let them down. This President made \nan appeal to the American people the other night to allow him to stay \nthe course until he can leave office. To think that 130,000 soldiers \nwill still be in Iraq next year is really unacceptable. We have pushed \nour military to the absolute limit. I have been there. I have talked to \nthem. I have met with their families. I have talked to the support \ngroups back home. I have visited the veterans hospitals. I have seen \nthese soldiers on the battlefront as well as back home, and they have \npaid a heavy price for this war. The President suggests that we just \nkeep 130,000 troops there indefinitely until he finds what he can \ndefine as success, but that isn't good enough. We have to make sure we \nare sensitive to these soldiers and the toll that is being taken on \nthem personally.\n  I am sorry to report that the divorce rates among American enlisted \npersonnel now are twice what they are normally, and among officers \nthree times. The suicide rate is the highest it has been since Vietnam \nand, unfortunately, those who are subject to multiple deployments come \nback and face many needs for health care and counseling. That is the \nreality. We are now paying the highest cash incentives ever in our \nhistory for people to enlist and to reenlist. Mr. President, $10,000 is \ncommon. If a 19-year-old soldier will agree to show up in 6 weeks or \nso, they double it to $20,000 in cash--to someone fresh out of high \nschool. We have changed a lot of rules of eligibility for service in \nour military. Unfortunately, we are pushing them to the absolute limit. \nThat is part of the reality of where we are today in Iraq. It is a \nreality which the President did not address when he spoke to the \nAmerican people last week.\n\n  This event yesterday, where Blackwater was expelled by Iraq's \nGovernment, should be a wake-up call to this administration and this \nCongress to provide the kind of meaningful oversight of these private \nsecurity operations, to ask whether these men and women who were under \nour employ, as employees of our Government through private contractors, \nhave stood up and done the right thing for our Nation. Many have, but \nthose who have not have to be held accountable.\n  Mr. President, SPC Darryl Dent died in Iraq on August 26, 2003, when \nan IED exploded under his humvee. Specialist Dent--21 years old--had \nhoped to go to medical school one day. He was the first National Guard \nmember from his hometown to die in combat since Vietnam.\n  LCpl Greg MacDonald died in Iraq on June 25, 2003, when his humvee \nrolled as he and six other marines raced to rescue American soldiers \ncaught in an ambush. Lance Corporal MacDonald--29 years old--had a \nmaster's degree and hoped to make a career in foreign affairs and help \ncreate peace in the Middle East.\n  MAJ Kevin Shea, a veteran of the first gulf war, was killed by rocket \nfire in Al Anbar province on September 14, 2004--his 38th birthday. He \nwas promoted posthumously to lieutenant colonel, making him the \nhighest-ranking marine killed in the war in Iraq at that time.\n  Army Reserve LTC Paul Kimbrough was a lawyer who once worked for a \nMember of the House of Representatives and even ran unsuccessfully for \na House seat himself. He was in Afghanistan, overseeing improvements to \nliving conditions for our soldiers at Bagram Air Base, when he suffered \na fatal heart attack on October 3, 2003. He was 44 years old.\n  CAPT Darrell Lewis grew up in a tough housing project, earned a \nscholarship to a private high school and another scholarship to \ncollege. He graduated, joined the Army and rose quickly through the \nranks. Three months ago, on June 23, he died in Vashir City, \nAfghanistan, when his unit was attacked by insurgents using RPGs, \nmortars and small arms fire. Captain Lewis was 31 years old.\n  What did these five fallen warriors all have in common, besides their \ndevotion to duty and to our Nation? A hometown. At the time of their \ndeaths, all five were residents of the District of Columbia. They died \ntrying to bring democracy to Afghanistan and Iraq, but they did not \nhave the legal right to participate fully in our American democracy. \nThat is wrong. This week, we have an opportunity to right this wrong.\n  This week, for the first time in nearly 30 years, the U.S. Senate \nwill take up a bill to grant the citizens of the District of Columbia, \nour Nation's Capital, a voting member--one voting representative--in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. I am one of the cosponsors of the \nbipartisan District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007.\n  Our aim is to not to strengthen the hand of either political party, \nbut to strengthen American democracy. For that reason, the DC House \nVoting Rights Act would also create an additional House seat for the \nState of Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11619-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11619-S11620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DC VOTING RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a little later this morning, we are going \nto face an important debate on the DC House Voting Rights Act. It is \none that I support. It is a cause that I have supported for a long \ntime. It is unimaginable that nearly 600,000 Americans have no voice \nand no vote in Congress today. But it is a fact. It reflects decisions \nmade long ago about whether the District of Columbia and its residents \nwould be represented in Congress. There is good reason why they should \nbe.\n  I was saddened to learn this morning that President Bush has \nthreatened to veto this bill. He will ask men and women in the District \nof Columbia to fight and risk their lives so the people of Iraq and \nAfghanistan have a right to vote, but he has threatened to veto the \nbill which gives those same soldiers the right to vote for \ncongressional representation of their own. That is unacceptable.\n  The President says he has constitutional concerns. He and other \nopponents of the DC House Voting Rights Act point to language in the \nConstitution that says that the House of Representatives will be \ncomposed of members chosen by ``the people of the several states.'' \nThey argue that the District of Columbia is a district, not a State.\n\n[[Page S11620]]\n\n  It is a weak argument at best. Our Federal judiciary has long treated \nthe District of Columbia as a ``State'' for many purposes. For example, \nthe 16th amendment of the Constitution grants Congress the power to tax \nour incomes, ``without apportionment among the several states.'' The \n16th amendment has been interpreted to apply to DC residents; the \nFederal Government can and does require residents of Washington, DC, to \npay Federal income taxes.\n  DC residents are also required to serve on Federal juries and \nregister for selective service. Why should the right to vote be any \ndifferent?\n  I think when we look at this basic purpose, the right to vote for \ncongressional representation, the people who live in Washington, DC, \ndeserve it.\n  Do opponents of DC voting rights believe that residents of America's \nCapital City should bear the full responsibilities of citizens but do \nnot deserve the full rights of citizens?\n  It is not just Democrats who believe the DC voting bill is \nconstitutional. Several prominent Republicans, including Kenneth Starr, \nJack Kemp, and Viet Dinh, principal author of the PATRIOT Act, have \ntestified that the bill meets constitutional muster.\n  Yesterday, September 17, marked the 220th anniversary of the signing \nof the U.S. Constitution. This is a time to celebrate the genius of the \nFramers who had the vision and insight--in the year 1789--to lay the \nfoundation for what has become the world's oldest democracy.\n  The Constitution our Framers gave us was a brilliant document--but \nnot a flawless one. It denied full participation in our democracy to \nthe people of Washington.\n  Over the past two centuries, we have refined the Constitution to \nexpand the right to vote to all Americans. We have expanded freedom. \nSome expansions of voting rights have come as a result of \nconstitutional amendment. In other cases, Congress has expanded the \nright to vote by statute.\n  Just last year, this Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act, \nwhich another, courageous Congress first passed in 1965. The Voting \nRights Act is often considered the most important civil rights law ever \npassed by Congress. It removed poll taxes and dismantled Jim Crow.\n  A few weeks ago, on September 5, the Senate Judiciary Committee--on \nwhich I serve--held a hearing to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1957. One of the witnesses at that hearing was a \nhero of mine and a giant of our civil rights movement: Representative \nJohn Lewis of Georgia.\n  Representative Lewis testified about discrimination against African \nAmericans when he was growing up in Alabama. He talked about the \ninspiration he drew from meeting Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa \nParks. He talked about how far we have come as a nation when it comes \nto the treatment of African Americans and persons of color. And he \ntalked about the progress we have made when it comes to voting rights.\n  John Lewis was nearly beaten to death on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in \nSelma, AL, marching for voting rights in 1965. He put his life on the \nline for the right to vote. So I think we should take special note of \nwhat John Lewis had to say when he was asked at the Judiciary Committee \nhearing about the bill that would create voting rights for the \nresidents right here in Washington, DC.\n  John Lewis said the following:\n\n       [W]e are going to say to the District of Columbia, where \n     people leave this district, leave this city, they go and \n     fight in our wars, and then they cannot participate in the \n     democratic process. That is wrong.\n\n  The Senate can heed those words this week. The Senate can give the \nresidents of Washington, DC, a voice in Congress.\n  For two centuries, Washington, DC, residents have fought and died in \nthis Nation's wars, often suffering among the highest casualty rates.\n  Twenty-three Washington, DC, residents have been killed or wounded in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  Haven't the residents of this city earned the right to have their \nvoices heard, and their vote count, in the House of Representatives? \nHaven't the people of Washington, DC, waited long enough?\n  Washington, DC, is the only capital city in the world whose citizens \ndo not have voting representation in their national legislature.\n  For over 200 years, Washingtonians have been mere spectators to our \ngreat democracy.\n  In the course of our Nation's history, we have many times expanded \nfreedom and expanded voting rights to people whom our Founders, in \ntheir incomplete genius, left out.\n  This week, we have an opportunity, and an obligation, to take another \nimportant and long overdue step forward in the historic struggle for \nvoting rights by giving the residents of the District of Columbia a \nvote in the U.S. House of Representatives. Let us vote for the right to \nvote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 1124, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1124) to extend the District of Columbia \n     College Access Act of 1999.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1124 and \nthe opportunity it provides for DC's college-bound students. The \nreauthorization of the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999 \nwould continue a successful and effective scholarship program.\n  The DC tuition assistance grant program, or DCTAG, provides \nscholarships to cover the difference between in-State and out-of-State \ntuition for eligible DC residents attending any public college or \nuniversity in the country. DCTAG awards those recipients up to $10,000 \nannually and $50,000 total in tuition assistance.\n  The original purpose of the bill was to address concern that college-\nbound students in the District were at a disadvantage because DC lacks \na State university system. DCTAG expanded higher education \nopportunities by allowing students to attend public universities and \ncolleges nationwide at in-State tuition rates.\n  The original bill also allows students to attend a limited number of \nnonprofit private schools to receive scholarships of up to $2500 \nannually and $12,500 total. Students who attend any historically black \ncollege or university or any private school in the District, Maryland, \nor Virginia qualify for private school grants. The 2002 reauthorization \nclarified that the grants were only for U.S. citizens residing in DC.\n  The success of the program is clear. Since the launch of DCTAG in \n2000, participation among DC residents more than doubled from 1,900 \nrecipients to 4,700 recipients. DCTAG has awarded 26,000 grants \ntotaling over $141 million to 9,769 District students. I am pleased to \nsay that a few of those grants went to students attending the \nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa in my home State.\n  Not only are more students receiving grants; more are going to \ncollege. The college enrollment rate for DC public school students has \ndoubled to 60 percent and 38 percent of students in the program are the \nfirst ones in their family to attend college. DCTAG affords many \nDistrict residents a chance to go to college when they otherwise would \nnot be able to afford it.\n  In July, my Subcommittee on the District of Columbia held a hearing \nwith the Mayor and his education leadership team on their reform \nproposal for the public school system. They offered a realistic picture \nof DC public schools and a realistic vision for accountability and \nreform.\n  The Chancellor of Education, Michelle Rhee, and the Mayor are working \nvery hard to improve the unacceptably low performance of DC students by \nrecruiting talented teachers, reforming the administrative offices, and \nrepairing crumbling schools. They deserve all the support that the \nCongress can provide in their efforts.\n\n[[Page S11621]]\n\n  As the cost of college tuition continues to rise at both public and \nprivate institutions, this scholarship program offers the District's \nstudents hope that if they perform well in high school they can have \nthe same opportunity to access affordable, public, higher education as \nstudents in Virginia, in Maryland, and across the country.\n  Students who know they have the opportunity to go to college are more \nlikely to perform well in high school. The DCTAG program supports the \nMayor's efforts to improve DC public schools by offering students the \nchance to go to college at a minimal cost to the Federal Government.\n  The DCTAG bill was reported out of committee in February, and now is \nthe time to finally get it passed. I understand my colleague and fellow \ncommittee member, Senator Coburn, has asked that two amendments to the \nlegislation be considered.\n  The first amendment would modify the eligibility standard for the \nscholarship recipients to exclude any student whose family earns an \nincome of $1 million or more. Despite the high income threshold, I am \nconcerned about starting down the road of making this a needs-based \nscholarship program. The program is designed to provide all DC \nresidents access to a range of higher education institutions. I have \nagreed to accept this amendment despite my misgivings for the sake of \nthe entire program's reauthorization.\n  The second amendment, however, I am not prepared to accept. It would \nthreaten the integrity and success of the program by increasing the \ngrant amounts for private schools. Nearly 10 times the number of \nstudents in the program attend public schools versus private schools, \nand an increase in the grant amounts for private schools would reduce \nthe overall available funding. Fewer students would be able to \nparticipate in the program, and lower income students trying to attend \nmore affordable public schools, in particular, would be significantly \nburdened, in some cases, potentially, being forced to forego college \naltogether.\n  For many students, the importance of this program in defraying out-\nof-State tuition costs means the difference between attending college \nor not. I cannot support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote against this amendment as well.\n  DCTAG has helped thousands of DC students who receive postsecondary \neducation. Its credibility and its effectiveness is evident.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill and oppose Senator Coburn's \nsecond amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today the Senate considers, as my good \nfriend, Senator Akaka, has mentioned, H.R. 1124 that will reauthorize \nthe District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant Program. Senator \nAkaka and I have been working on this legislation for quite some time \nand both believe it is one of the most significant efforts the Congress \nhas made to help students of the District of Columbia.\n  I thank both the majority leader and the minority leader for allowing \nus to move this bill forward today. This bill passed the House in May \nby a vote of 268 to 100. Earlier this year, we introduced the Senate \ncompanion bill sponsored by Senator Akaka, Senator Brownback, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Warner offering this needed \nreauthorization. I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his cosponsorship \nof this legislation.\n  I understand the special relationship between the Federal Government \nand the District. Congress shares the responsibility of making certain \nthat the Nation's Capital remains a socially, economically, and \nculturally vibrant city. As a former mayor and Governor, I also believe \nthat education is one of the most important factors in ensuring this \nNation's future. Thus, one can imagine my dismay when I came to \nWashington, the shining city on the Hill, and learned that only 43 \npercent of students entering the ninth grade graduated from high school \nand even fewer go on to college. One would have thought that our \nNation's Capital, the most powerful city in the world, would be the \nhome for a first-class education system.\n  I am very concerned about the dropout rate in our Nation. America \ncannot afford to have urban schoolchildren drop out of school and \nbecome wards of society. Unless this situation changes, we are planting \nthe seeds for social unrest. As the United Negro College Fund says, a \nmind is a terrible thing to waste.\n  Concerned with the future of the District's children, Representative \nTom Davis and I crafted the District of Columbia College Access Act \nwhich created the DCTAG Program, tuition assistance program. I consider \nthe creation of the DCTAG Program to be one of the most worthwhile \nefforts I have done since my time in the Senate.\n  The aim of the DCTAG Program is to level the playing field for high \nschool graduates in the District of Columbia who do not have access to \na comprehensive, State-supported education system by assisting them in \nattending college. Before the DCTAG Program, DC students were the only \nstudents in the United States--the only ones in the United States--with \na limited State higher education system. As a result, few District \ngraduates went on to attend college.\n  Beginning in 2000, DCTAG scholarships have been used by District \nstudents to cover the difference between instate and out-of-State \ntuition at State universities. Senator Akaka has already explained the \nlimitations on the program, but it provides up to $10,000 per year for \nout-of-State tuition, with a cap of $50,000, and $2,500 for private \nschools, with a cap of $12,500.\n  Again, the way this has worked out is the District has seen an \nunprecedented increase, a 60-percent increase in college attendance. No \nother State in the Union can make this claim. Think about that: a 60-\npercent increase in college attendance. More than 1,500 DCTAG \nrecipients have graduated from college. In my State of Ohio, there are \ncurrently 74 District students attending 11 universities, including \nOhio State, Kent State, and Bowling Green State University. I truly \nbelieve the majority of the students would not be attending colleges \nand universities in Ohio without the DCTAG Program.\n  I am particularly proud of the fact that many DCTAG recipients are \nthe first in their family to attend college. In a survey of students \nattending the District's H.D. Woodson High School, 75 percent of the \nrespondents felt DCTAG made a difference in their decision and ability \nto continue their education beyond high school.\n  I know how important this is because in my own situation, my father \nwas raised by foster parents. It didn't look as if he would have a \nchance to go on to college. His principal and social studies teacher \ncame out to see the man who was the foster parent, who wanted my dad to \nquit school at 16 and be a laborer. The principal and social studies \nteacher said: No, keep your George in school. They found him a job at \nnight. Then they also helped him obtain a scholarship from Kroger. He \nwent on to Carnegie Tech to become an architect. I don't know what \nwould have happened if it had not been for those teachers intervening \nand for that Kroger scholarship. His life would have been quite \ndifferent.\n  Sixty-five percent of the kids indicated that the existence of the \nprogram enabled them to choose a college that would best suit their \nneeds.\n  Erica, who attends Virginia State University and is supported by her \ngrandparents living on a fixed income, said:\n\n       Without the help of DCTAG, I would not be able to attend \n     college.\n\n  And Randa, a full-time single working mother, said:\n\n       The support I received is unmatched. DC-TAG made my future \n     come true. Before hearing of the grants that existed, I had \n     no intention of pursuing higher education, let alone \n     attending a private school that ranks in the top 10 across \n     the Nation. This contribution to my life has inspired me to \n     help others as I have been so richly blessed.\n\n  These stories and many other successes of the TAG Program have \nresulted--and this is really important, Mr. President--in the private \nsector taking a vested interest in improving opportunities for the kids \nin the District.\n  A public-private partnership modeled after the Cleveland Scholarship \nProgram, called the District of Columbia Access Program, or DC-CAP, was \nestablished in 1999 by Don Graham of the\n\n[[Page S11622]]\n\nWashington Post and other Washington area corporations and foundations \nto assist the District high school students with their enrollment in \nand graduation from college.\n  DC-CAP is privately funded, a nonprofit organization. It provides \nfull-time counseling and financial assistance, available throughout \ntheir college career, to students who otherwise might never have the \nopportunity to go on to college.\n  To date, DC-CAP has disbursed more than $10 million, funded 5,300 \nstudents, and provided counseling services to 71,000 people. Similar to \nthe population served by the DCTAG Program, the majority of students \nserved are from low-income, minority, single-parent households, with \nmany the first in their family to attend college.\n  It is important to understand that without the DCTAG Program, we \nwould not have the DC-CAP program. They were so impressed with the fact \nthat we were willing to step up and do something and give these kids an \nopportunity for higher education that they said the private sector \nought to step in, and they created the public-private partnership.\n  Building on the success of the DCTAG and the public-private CAP \nprogram, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced this year a \n$122 million grant program aimed at improving urban education in the \nDistrict. The program, known as the DC Achievers Program, represents \none of the foundation's largest investments to date in education, with \nthe intention of becoming a model for other communities throughout the \nUnited States. They chose the District because of the fact that we had \nDCTAG and the CAP program.\n  The scholarships are designed to jump-start the low high school and \ncollege graduation rates among students living in certain DC \nneighborhoods. They are going to concentrate their attention in two \nregions of the District where there is a 66-percent dropout rate. Think \nof that. I am hopeful that with these programs continuing, we are going \nto really make a big difference in the District.\n  In addition to the programs I have just mentioned, we have America's \nfirst federally funded scholarship program that was created as part of \nthe DC Choice Incentive Act of 2003. Under this program, each District \nscholarship student receives up to $7,500 per year for tuition, \ntransportation, and fees so they may attend a nonpublic school. Last \nyear, more than 1,800 kids participated in this program at 66 nonpublic \nschools in the District, and a number of these students have used the \nDCTAG tuition grants to help their dream of a higher education become a \nreality. And it was available to them.\n  In 1996, we created the charter schools in the District. Today, over \n13,000 students are attending 34 charter schools in the District. In \nother words, we are really starting to make some progress. Supporting \nthe Charter Schools Program is the Federal City Council, a nonprofit \norganization composed of and funded by approximately 200 local \nbusinesses and educational leaders. It is chaired by former Oklahoma \nGov. Frank Keating. Members of the President's Cabinet and a number of \nkey Federal officials serve as trustees. That council has spearheaded \nthe business community's support for reforming the District's public \nschool system. In other words, we are bringing together tremendous \nresources today where we are going to try to make a difference in an \nurban district in this country--there are about 65,000 kids today in \nthe District--make a difference in their lives so that maybe in the \nnext several years, we can start talking about an urban education \nsystem that actually works.\n  That is why this reauthorization is so very important not only to the \nDistrict, but it could be the model for the rest of the United States \nof America. We have to break this dropout rate we are having in urban \nschool districts or this country is in deep trouble.\n  So I say that it is successful because we have brought together the \npublic and private sectors to make a difference. That is what it is. In \nother words, we realized that the District's school system is just one \nthread in this community, and if it is going to be successful, it is \ngoing to take their Federal partner and it is going to take their \nprivate partner working together to make a real difference for the kids \nin this community.\n  The Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, mentioned the fact that we \nbrought on Michelle Rhee, who, by the way--I tell you, if it wasn't for \nDCTAG, if it wasn't for CAP, if it wasn't for the Gates Foundation, if \nit wasn't for some of the other efforts, I do not think we would have \nbeen able to land her. She is terrific. She sees this potential--this \nyoung woman, dynamic as all get out--she sees the potential.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. The Senator from Oklahoma has an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, my reason for offering amendments is not \nin opposition to this bill's goal. I think the Senator from Ohio and \nthe Senator from Hawaii know that. But there are two really blatant \nthings wrong with this bill.\n  There is a limited amount of money. Everybody will agree we have \nallocated--it is going to be about $38 million this year that is going \nto go for this program. That is what the spend-out is going to be. \nRight now, 20 families who make over $1 million a year are taking an \nopportunity from 20 families who are below the poverty level. Twenty \nfamilies right now with household income greater than $1 million a year \nare taking this program. Why would we have a program that says to the \nrichest in this country that we are going to pay for their college \neducation and we are going to do it on the backs of the poorest in this \ncountry? These 20 people who are in college today whose families make \nmore than $1 million a year are stealing an opportunity from 20 kids. \nNineteen percent of the District lives under the poverty level. So we \nare taking from them because we do not have an earnings test on this \nprogram.\n  I put in an amendment, which I am going to call up in a minute, \nbecause it is ridiculous to think that somebody earning $1 million a \nyear cannot afford to pay for their kid's college. But the amendment \nshould have been at $300,000 or $400,000 a year, because when you \nextrapolate that number, you get 400 or 500 kids who are now taking the \nopportunity from kids who have no income or are living below the \npoverty level.\n\n  So the idea of helping people in the District and enticing people to \ncome to the District to get an education is a great idea. There is not \na thing wrong with this program. But it is very shortsighted to say we \ndon't want to put an earnings test on something because it might change \nthe program. The fact is the program is being changed by the wealthy \ntaking advantage of it to the disadvantage of the kids who can't get \nthis grant.\n  I read in the paper this morning that the House is going to object to \na million-dollar-per-year earnings test on this program. Just do a \nlittle finger commonsense poll and talk to the American people. Do they \nthink their taxpayer dollars ought to be spent on sending somebody to \ncollege whose parents make $1 million a year? The answer to that is a \nresounding ``no.'' So why would we have any resistance at all in the \nHouse or this body to putting an earnings limit at $1 million? It makes \nno sense.\n  The second problem with this bill is we have discriminated against \nhistorically Black, private, nonprofit universities because they are \nprivate: Morehouse State, Spelman College, Stillman College, Tuskegee. \nYes, we will let you go if you are from Washington, DC, if you want to \ngo to those, but we are only going to give you $2,500. We are not going \nto give you $10,000 because it is a private nonprofit. We are going to \nlimit your ability to embrace your culture at one of the historically \nBlack colleges because it happens to be a private, nonprofit \nuniversity. We are going to say you can only have $2,500. And by the \nway, if you have a good reason that you might want to pursue a field of \nstudy that is not offered at one of the universities, the State \npublicly supported universities, but is offered at a private college, \nwe are going to discriminate against you again. We are going to say we \nwill give you $2,500.\n  What we are doing is we are putting a carrot out there and saying, \nyou can't quite get to the carrot. You can't quite get to that carrot. \nWhy would we\n\n[[Page S11623]]\n\ndiscriminate against private and nonprivate, if a child wants to seek a \ncertain level of education that is not available anywhere except that? \nIf we want opportunity for these kids, we ought to give them \nopportunity and we ought to let the choice be theirs. Let them choose \nwhere to go.\n  If they want to go into bioneurologic sciences, where can they get \nthat? A private university. They can't get it at a public university. \nIf they want to go into some other area that is not available to them \nin a public fashion, through a public university, we are going to say, \nyes, you can, but you get 75 percent less benefit than everybody else \ngets because you choose to go into a field of endeavor that may be \nhighly sought after but it is not offered at a public university.\n  So the idea behind the bill is good. The goal of increasing what the \nchairman and ranking member wanted to do in terms of DC is right, it is \nright-headed, but if we were thinking about how do we help the most \nkids, we wouldn't let the first dollar go to parents making $500,000 a \nyear or $300,000 a year. We would let it go to the kids, this 20 \npercent of the population who lives under the poverty level. That is \nwhere we would send the money.\n  What we are saying here is, in the namesake of not wanting to change \nand not allow the flexibility for more impoverished children to get \nthat college education, we don't want to change. We don't want to allow \na young African-American male to go to Morehouse College, because we \nare going to give him $7,500 less a year to go there than if he chose \nsome other university. Why would we not want to enhance that culture \nfor him?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2888\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any pending amendment be \nset aside, and I call up amendment No. 2888 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2888.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the Federal Government from favoring public \ncolleges and universities over private colleges and universities under \n          the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2. NON-DISCRIMINATION FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL STUDENTS.\n\n       Section 6 of the District of Columbia College Access Act of \n     1999 (113 Stat. 1327; Public Law 106-98) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Non-Discrimination for Private School Students.--In \n     awarding grants under this Act to eligible institutions, the \n     Mayor shall pay amounts, on behalf of eligible students, that \n     are equivalent regardless of whether the students attend a \n     public or private eligible institution.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is the amendment that says, let's \ndon't discriminate against the private schools. Let us let the kids go \nwhere they want. Let us give them an equal shot at Morehouse, at \nTuskegee, at Spelman, and Stillman. Let us let them have an equal shot \nto go there as well as everywhere else. We have decided you can't. We \nare going to make you more disadvantaged to go to someplace that is \nculturally better for you.\n  So I would ask reconsideration on the part of the chairman and the \nranking member for this amendment. It makes sense, it is equal, and it \ntreats every sought-after degree the same. We don't discriminate \nbetween private and public. It doesn't change where the restrictions \nare already. It doesn't say every private university in America can \nhave it. What it says is, if we are going to hold this apple out in \nfront of you and say here is your education, we are going to give you a \nfair shot whether you want to go to a private school or a public school \nthat is on the list. We are going to treat you the same, and we are \ngoing to hope that no matter which one you attend that you finish that \neducation and come back and become a productive citizen contributing to \nDC.\n  That is what this is about. It is not about expanding the realm of \nprivate universities. It is saying that if I choose to go to Morehouse \nState, I should get the same treatment as if I choose to go to Oklahoma \nState or Ohio State or the University of Hawaii. I get the same \ntreatment. Don't give me part of an apple, give me the whole apple. \nGive me everything.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2887\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2888 be set \naside, and I call up amendment No. 2887.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2887.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To exempt millionaires from receiving educational scholarship \n                   funds intended for needy families)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2. MEANS TESTING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 3(c)(2) of the District of \n     Columbia College Access Act of 1999 (113 Stat. 1324; Public \n     Law 106-98) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (E), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (F), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(G) is from a family with a taxable annual income of less \n     than $1,000,000.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 5(c)(2) of the District \n     of Columbia College Access Act of 1999 (113 Stat. 1328; \n     Public Law 106-98) is amended by striking ``through (F)'' and \n     inserting ``through (G)''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment says if you make $1 million \na year, we shouldn't be paying for your kids to go to college. The rest \nof the American taxpayers shouldn't.\n  I am disappointed to hear from the House that when they get this, \nwhen we get to conference, they are not going to accept it. It is \namazing to me that anybody in this country would think that the Federal \nGovernment--all of us collectively--ought to pay for their children's \neducation. If we are going to do that, then let us pay for everybody's \neducation across the country.\n  But that is not what this bill is about. This bill is about trying to \ndirect funds to those kids who won't have an opportunity for college \nwithout these funds. And by giving those funds to the well-to-do \nfamilies who do not need or require our help to send their children to \ncollege, we are stealing opportunity from those kids. There is a \nlimited amount of money. Everybody knows that. There is a limited pie \nhere. And for those 20 times 50,000, that $1 million is not going to be \nspent on somebody living below the poverty level wanting to get out and \nwanting to move up.\n  I understand it is the chairman and ranking member's opinion that \nthey will accept this amendment, so I graciously thank them for that, \nand my hope is you would hold this as we discuss this with the House. \nIt is ludicrous to take this away from people who don't have means.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 2887 \nis adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 2887) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii and I have \naccepted the amendment that limits the participation of people in this \nprogram to those who earn less than $1 million, but the fact is what we \ntried to do when we put this program together was to mimic what we were \ndoing in States today around the country. In my State, we have a very \nrobust higher education system, but we do not have an income level that \nestablishes who can participate and who can't. I suspect there are \npeople in Ohio who have kids at Ohio State University who are \nsubsidized and who may make over $1 million or make $350,000. But our \nState has chosen not to have an earnings limit as a matter of public \npolicy. I suspect if you go around the country, you will find that is \nthe case just about everywhere you go.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Let me finish, and then I will yield for a question.\n\n[[Page S11624]]\n\n  Second, in terms of the private colleges, we looked at what we do \naround the country, and if you are in the State of Ohio and you are a \nresident of Ohio, we have a special program that says if you go to a \nprivate school, you don't get the full subsidy you would get if you go \nto a public school, but we provide the private schools up to $2,500 so \nyou can attend a private school. When we put this program together, we \nhad a limitation saying, as we have in the State--and we took certain \nareas of Virginia and Maryland and brought them in as part of a State--\nand we said if you go to the University of Maryland, if you go to the \nUniversity of Virginia, then you can participate in this program. But \nwhat we realized at the time was that the number of people trying to \nget into Maryland and Virginia was so large it wouldn't give these kids \nthe chance they needed to have so they could get into school, and so we \nopened it up to public colleges all over the United States of America. \nAs Senator Akaka says, there are people in Hawaii, I am sure we have \npeople in Pennsylvania and all over America, in Oklahoma, and we are \ntrying to do what a State would do.\n  The other thing we did, which was unusual, is that because we have \nhistorical Black colleges around the country, we provided a special \nprogram that at those private colleges, even though they are outside of \nthe region of the District of Columbia, the children would be able to \nreceive up to $2,500, and that lays out why this whole program came \ntogether. What the Senator from Oklahoma is making mention of is that \nhe wants everybody to get the same amount of money. If we provide equal \nfunding for private and public colleges, as proposed by the amendment, \nwe would be limiting the reach of what is, by all accounts, a very \nsuccessful program.\n  The current level of funding of the DCTAG is about $33.2 million. If \nwe expanded that to allow District schools to receive grants of up to \n$10,000, funding would have to be increased significantly to serve the \nexisting population served by the DCTAG. As mentioned earlier in the \ndebate, the average grant amount per student is $6,500. They do not get \nthe $10,000, they get the average of $6,500, and the difference of \n$3,500 would have to be made up somewhere. Of the 6,400 students \nenrolled in the DCTAG today, 886 are attending private colleges. These \nstudents are receiving about $2 million. If this amendment were to \npass, funding would have to increase by over $5 million to cover these \nstudents, or the District would have to reduce the number of students \nattending public universities by 875 students. So it is a matter of \nmoney and dividing it. My guess is that would result in fewer students \nattending college because the pool of available money would shrink.\n  I would hope none of my colleagues is willing to ask 875 students not \nto attend college. This program has been an unprecedented success since \nthe first grants were handed out in 2000. There is an old saying, and I \nhave believed in it my entire years in Government--over 40 years--``If \nit ain't broken, don't fix it.'' This program is not broken. This \nprogram is one of the most successful programs in the United States of \nAmerica to reduce dropout rates and increase the attendance of \nyoungsters to get a college education. I hope my colleagues who are \nlistening and paying attention right now will vote against this \namendment because I don't think it is going to add one iota to this \nprogram except to take away from it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. Do the people of upper income in Ohio pay higher taxes in \nthe State of Ohio?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes, and I am sure the people in the District of \nColumbia are paying higher income taxes to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. COBURN. So the people of Ohio, who send their children to Ohio \nState, even though they pay in-State tuition, actually pay more for \nthat college because they pay a much higher percentage of the State \nbudget and the State of Ohio, similar to the State of Oklahoma, has \ndecided that with that increased income, we will grant everybody. But \nit doesn't cost the same. So the argument is, in terms of the \ndifference in incomes: Those people who make exceptional incomes in \nOhio and Oklahoma actually pay more for their kids to go to college in \ntheir States because they pay a much higher percentage of the total \nincome taxes in the State.\n  The second point is I think the Senator is right. If it ain't broke, \ndon't fix it. This is one of the rare programs that ought to be \nexpanded, but we have terrible priorities in this Senate and in this \nGovernment. So we will not take another $10 million to make sure more \nkids go and get rid of some duplicitous earmark somewhere that is a \nfavor for some politician somewhere so we can, in fact, enhance it.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment. It says why would you \ndiscriminate against somebody who wants to go to a private college over \na public college? That is what we are doing. The answer is because we \ndon't have enough money. That is the answer. The answer is we do not \nhave enough money, so therefore, if we give the same amount of \nscholarship to private schools as we give to public, we would not have \nenough money for 886 people who are getting a full boat now.\n  The answer to that is here is a program that is working, here is \nwhere we ought to have priorities, here is where we ought to be putting \nmore money rather than less. But the answer, our closed-minded answer \nin Washington is: That is all the money we have. Even though this is \nworking and a lot of other programs are not working, we are not going \nto defund those programs that are not working. We are not going to \nmeasure with a metric whether they are effective. We are going to let \nthem go. Here is a good program that is making a difference in people's \nlives, and we are not going to go fight for more money.\n  To me, that says it all about where we are in Washington today.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to say--and I am pleased \nthe junior Senator from Oklahoma is talking about a Federal program \nwhere he wants to see more money spent. I think that is terrific. The \nfact is, he does agree this is a very special program. I would like to \npoint out so do the appropriators, because year after year, they have \nprovided more money for this program.\n  Initially, it started out at about $17 million. They are up to about \n$33.3. In their consideration of the importance of this program, they \nhave, in fact, provided more money for it because it is a very \nworthwhile, successful program. The fact of the matter is we all \nbelieve that if we evened it out across-the-board, fewer of our \nyoungsters, the socially deprived kids in the District, would be able \nto take advantage of the program.\n  Again, I wish to emphasize we tried to copy what we do in States such \nas Ohio, where we say to the private schools: You are here. God bless \nyou. And we give them, not the total subsidy, $6,500--they get up to \n$2,500 for those students.\n  If you are thinking about kids who need help, I know in my State if \nyou have a youngster who has some potential--by the way, these \nyoungsters who have the potential are taking advantage of the college \nassistance program the private sector set up here, set up by Don Graham \nover at the Washington Post. So they come in with this little extra \nmoney for them. We also have the Pell Grant Programs available to these \nindividuals.\n  I can tell you this. If we had a bright kid in the District who was \nqualified to go to Georgetown--we mentioned a young lady who is at one \nof the top universities. They have special programs that reach out and \nsay here is a youngster--such as my dad--who is bright, hard-working, \nand we are going to give them some extra, such as dad got at Carnegie \nTech so he could go on to get his architectural degree.\n  I think we are talking about reality here. We are talking about a \nprogram that is making a difference. I respectfully say I think the \nproposal doesn't help the program but rather takes away from it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I wish to echo the \nremarks of my good friend and ranking member, Senator Voinovich. \nSenator Coburn's amendment threatens to reduce the number of \nparticipants in the program by nearly 1,000 students and\n\n[[Page S11625]]\n\nwould increase the costs of the program by more than $5 million.\n  Furthermore, it conflicts with the intent of the legislation. Because \nof the high number of private schools in the District, Congress allowed \nstudents who chose to stay close to home a greater range of options, \nsimilar to a State school program. However, it was never intended to \nsupplement the private education to the same degree as public \neducation.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to vote against his amendment and in \nsupport of the underlying bill.\n  At this time, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will finish up with this. I thank the Senators for \ntheir debate and points of view.\n  The reason the average is $6,500 is because you only give $2,500 to \nthe private. If you took all the private schools out, the average would \nbe $10,000. That is what you get. So to play the game with numbers is \nnot accurate because when you filter in the $2,500, you get that \naverage of $6,500.\n  I would make the point again, you, in fact, are discriminating \nagainst a young DC minority child who says I want to go to Morehouse \nState, and I want to major in X at Morehouse State. I know heroes of \nmine who went to Morehouse State.\n  Under this bill, you say you can't do that. They may be bright, but \n$2,500 compared to that education, versus $10,000 in public, doesn't \nbegin to accomplish the level of financing and scholarships--it will be \nnext to impossible. I ask you to reconsider. The intent of what you are \ntrying to do--we can, in fact, appropriate more money for this. If I \nand George Voinovich and Danny Akaka go for a spending increase on an \nappropriations bill, that will make history in the Senate. That would \nmake history. We could do that. We could find the money to do that.\n  The point is, why should we take away opportunity? Why should we be \nthe parlayers of somebody's lost opportunity? We ought to give it to \nall, it ought to be equally based and ought to be based on their \naspirations, their hopes for what they want to do. We should not \nartificially say because you want to go here, this is all the \nopportunity you get. But if you want to go somewhere that doesn't \nexcite you, doesn't stimulate you, isn't going to give you as good an \neducation, we will give you more money.\n  I think that is inherently wrong and disadvantageous to the very \npeople we are trying to help. Not only should we want them to get the \neducation, we should want them to get the best education, so they can \nbe the best that they can be.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes equally divided between the two leaders or their designees on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1257.\n  Who seeks time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe legislation before us today which was reported out of our committee \non a 9-to-1 vote, bipartisan support.\n  In some sense, it is unbelievable that we are here today in 2007 \ntrying, against some odds at this moment, to give to the residents of \nthe Capital City of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \nright to have a voting representative in the Congress of the United \nStates. To me, it is unbelievable, it is palpably unjust and, in my \nopinion, a national embarrassment.\n  This bill, comparable to a bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives--bipartisan--cosponsored by Delegate Eleanor Holmes \nNorton and Congressman Tom Davis--basically rights this grievous wrong \nby giving the District of Columbia, more than a half a million of our \nfellow Americans, a voting Member of Congress in the House of \nRepresentatives and to, frankly and directly, overcome concerns of the \npartisan impact of giving a House seat to the District because it tends \nto vote Democratic, and correcting another injustice, saying that the \nState of Utah, which came very close--less than 900 citizens--from \nhaving another seat in the Congress in the House as a result of the \n2000 census also gets a seat. So one for the District of Columbia, one \nfor Utah.\n  The situation is this: The residents of the Capital City of the \ngreatest democracy in the world do not have voting representation in \nCongress. And yet, they have to pay the taxes we adopt--this is \ntaxation without representation--their budget uniquely has to be \napproved by the Congress, and their sons and daughters today are \nserving, and I add dying in disproportionate numbers, in Iraq and \nAfghanistan in the war on terrorism, and yet they do not have a voting \nrepresentative in Congress to pass judgment on appropriations and other \nmatters related to that war.\n  It is time to end the injustice, to end the national embarrassment \nthat the citizens of this great Capital City do not have voting \nrepresentation in Congress.\n  I ask all my colleagues to vote for cloture. Do not let a filibuster \nkill a voting rights act, as used to happen too often around here.\n  I have been honored to join as a cosponsor of this measure my dear \nfriend, a great Senator, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.\n  I yield the remaining time we have to Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have had a lot of people talking about, \noh, let's not do this because it is unconstitutional. I want everybody \nto know there are conservative and liberal advocates on both sides of \nthis issue with regard to the District of Columbia and, I might add, I \nthink most people will know Utah was not treated fairly after the last \ncensus. Naturally, Senator Bennett and I are for adding a seat in Utah.\n  Let's go back to that point. There are good people on both sides of \nthis issue, Democrats and Republicans on each side. There are decent \narguments on each side of this issue, although I think our side has \nbeen given short shrift by some. And those who are so sure this is \nunconstitutional, that which the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and I have been advocating, then why do \nthey fear the expedited provision in this bill that will get us to the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America in what would be a very \nappropriate decision on who is right and who is wrong in this matter?\n  We all know the argument that we should do this as a constitutional \namendment is not a valid argument. It is a good argument, but the fact \nis it will never pass that way. There are 600,000 people in the \nDistrict of Columbia, never contemplated by the Founders of this \ncountry to be without the right to vote. They are the only people in \nthis country who do not have a right to vote for their own \nrepresentative in the House of Representatives. This bill would remedy \nthat situation.\n  Those who argue it would be a presage to getting two Senators don't \nknow the people in America or in this body. The fact is that Senators \nare elected by States with equal rights of suffrage. This \nrepresentative, should this bill pass both Houses of Congress, would \nrepresent 600,000 people as the people's representative in the House of \nRepresentatives, which is what that is supposed to be.\n  I might add, Supreme Court decision after Supreme Court decision has \nsaid the Congress has plenary power in this area, unique power in this \narea. It says Congress has authority over the District of Columbia. If \nCongress wants to give the District of Columbia a representative, \nCongress has the power to do so, and I believe the Supreme Court would \nuphold it. I do not believe the Supreme Court would uphold an attempt \nto try and get two Senators for something that is clearly not a State \nrequiring equal rights of suffrage.\n  I compliment my good friend from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, for \nthe hard battle he waged and for those in the House who worked so hard \non this issue. I hope we can at least debate this matter. All we are \ndoing today is deciding whether we are even going to allow a debate to \noccur. My gosh, when has the Senate been afraid to debate a \nconstitutional issue as important as this one? This is an important \nissue. We are prepared to debate. We are prepared to see what happens.\n  We know if it passes, it is going to have expedited review by the \nSupreme Court. We are prepared to accept whatever the Supreme Court \ndecides to do, and those who say this is unconstitutional, per se, \nshould not be afraid then. I am willing to go to the Supreme Court, and \nI will abide by whatever the Supreme Court says. I believe the Supreme \nCourt would uphold this legislation because there are 600,000 people \nwithout a right to vote for their own representative.\n  I used to be opposed to this issue. The more I studied it, the more I \nagreed with the conservative and liberal constitutional proponents and \nthe more I have become an advocate for it, and I am going to continue \nto do so. I hope we can at least debate this matter and then, \nhopefully, get it out of this body and go to the Supreme Court and have \nthem finally decide what should be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to speak in support of S. 1257, \nthe District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007. It is a \nmeasure introduced by Senator Lieberman and Senator Hatch and favorably \nreported by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  After carefully considering the constitutional issues, I have come to \nbelieve, on balance, that S. 1257 is a legitimate mechanism for \nproviding voting representation in the U.S. House of Representatives \nfor the 600,000 Americans who live in the District of Columbia--\ncitizens who serve in the Armed Forces, pay Federal taxes, participate \nin Federal programs, and support a local government overseen by \nCongress--yet who cannot choose a representative with voting rights for \nthe House that meets in their midst.\n  S. 1257 would also correct an inequity affecting the State of Utah. \nThat State fell just short of qualifying for an additional House seat \nin the last apportionment--a margin that likely would have disappeared \nhad the census counted the thousands of Mormons who were out of State \nperforming their religious duty as missionaries.\n  As the Senate considers this legislation, much hinges on our view of \nthe powers assigned, and the rights protected, by our Constitution. \nThose\n\n[[Page S11627]]\n\npowers and rights were discussed at length in the May 15 hearing that \nour committee conducted on this bill.\n  We heard vigorous debate from legal experts on whether the enclave \nclause of the Constitution enables Congress to provide voting \nrepresentation in the House for the District of Columbia--as a \ncorollary of its exclusive power of legislation in Federal enclaves, \nincluding the District. We also heard an impassioned argument that the \nbill would pass constitutional muster purely on its merits as an equal-\nrepresentation measure consistent with court rulings in civil rights \ncases.\n  I recognize that other lawmakers, and some constitutional scholars, \nhave expressed sincere doubts about this measure. For those who have \nsuch concerns, the bill now offers a powerful safeguard. During our \nJune markup, the committee adopted my amendment providing for expedited \njudicial review of this legislation in the event of a legal challenge. \nThus, the new law's legitimacy could be determined promptly by our \nFederal courts.\n  My colleagues on the committee also adopted an amendment that I \nproposed concerning the scope and implications of the bill. The text \nnow carries an explicit statement that the District of Columbia shall \nnot be considered a State for purposes of representation in the Senate. \nThis is an important distinction. Our Constitution links House \nrepresentation to population, but it links Senate representation to \nstatehood. The residents of the District of Columbia are Americans \nentitled to House representation, but they are not residents of an \nentity admitted to the Union as a State. The language added by the \ncommittee simply clarifies that the bill does not contemplate or \nprovide support for a legislative grant of Senate representation.\n  The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007 is a \ncarefully crafted measure that provides for speedy review of any legal \nchallenge. The bill's 21 sponsors and cosponsors span the liberal-to-\nconservative spectrum and includes two independent Senators, as well as \nRepublicans and Democrats--eloquent testimony to the fact that this is \nnot a partisan measure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1257, a simple matter of \nfundamental fairness for American citizens.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make a final point and say again that there \nare legitimate arguments about the constitutionality of the measure \nthat is before us, and that is why, when it was before the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I offered an amendment which is incorporated into \nthe bill to allow for expedited judicial review of its \nconstitutionality. I suggest to my colleagues that we should proceed \nwith this measure. If, in fact, it fails on constitutional grounds, \nthat is up to the courts. But today we can stand for an important \nprinciple of providing a vote to the residents of the District of \nColumbia.\n  I hope my colleagues will allow this bill to go forward, and I urge \ntheir support of this measure.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1257, the \nDistrict of Columbia House Voting Rights Act. This bill would provide \nthe 580,000 residents of our Nation's Capital the voting representation \nin the House of Representatives that is so long overdue. It would also \ngive the State of Utah a temporary at-large seat in the House through \nthe next reapportionment.\n  Today's vote presents us the opportunity to grant District of \nColumbia residents the voice in ``the people's House'' that other \nAmericans possess. It is time to remember the cry of our Founders that \n``taxation without representation is tyranny'' and end the \ndiscriminatory treatment of our Capital City's residents.\n  District of Columbia citizens pay Federal taxes, and they deserve \ntheir full say in determining the direction of our country. They should \nhave as much influence on the House and Senate floors as any other \nAmerican over the policies that shape this Nation: our Tax Code, our \ninvolvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, and our laws affecting Social \nSecurity, health care, and childcare.\n  The right to representation is a basic civil right, and this is no \nless than a moral issue. Since coming to Congress, I have supported \nfull voting representation for the citizens of the District of Columbia \nthat would comprise one voting member of the House of Representatives \nand two Senators. The authors of this bill have, after much \ndeliberation, crafted a compromise that they believe can pass both \nChambers and be sent to President Bush for his signature. I will \nsupport that compromise with the hope that one day we will be able to \nenact legislation providing full representation to the District.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today we will vote on whether or not to take \nup one of the most important pieces of civil rights and voting rights \nlegislation the Senate will consider in this Congress: the DC House \nVoting Rights Act of 2007. After months of careful consideration by the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, floor action \non this bill has been blocked by a filibuster. We will soon see if \nthere are sufficient votes to break that filibuster and enable it to \nmove forward. We are in this procedural position because some of my \nRepublican colleagues have persistently refused to even allow the \nSenate to take up and debate this measure, insisting on throwing up \nprocedural roadblocks all along the way. I urge my colleagues to vote \nto bring this bill to the floor, and if that effort succeeds, to \nsupport its adoption.\n  There is nothing more fundamental to the vitality and endurance of a \ndemocracy of the people, by the people, and for the people than the \npeople's right to vote. In the words of Thomas Paine: ``The right of \nvoting for representatives is the primary right by which other rights \nare protected.'' It is, in fact, the right on which all others in our \ndemocracy depend. The Constitution guarantees it, and the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly underscored that it is one of our most precious \nand fundamental rights as citizens.\n  Although not all Americans were entitled to vote in the early days of \nthe Republic, virtually all legal restrictions on the franchise have \nsince been eliminated, including those based on race, sex, wealth, \nproperty ownership, and marital status. Americans living in the \nNation's Capital also deserve to have voting representation in the body \nthat makes their laws, taxes them, and can call them to war.\n  Even with most explicit barriers to voting removed, we still have a \nway to go before we get to the point where all Americans are able to \nparticipate without obstacle in our elections, and with confidence in \nthe voting systems they use. In the 2000 Presidential election, 51.2 \npercent of the eligible American electorate voted. And although in the \n2004 Presidential election voting participation reached its highest \nlevel since 1968, only 60.7 percent of eligible Americans voted. That \ndropped back down, in the 2006 off-year elections, to just over 40 \npercent. We should do everything we can to strengthen voter \nregistration efforts and to move the election reform process forward in \nthis Congress, and at the same time to extend voting representation to \nthe nearly 600,000 people--hard-working, taxpaying U.S. citizens who \nfight for our country and serve on juries and fulfill their other civic \nduties--who live within the borders of the District of Columbia.\n  I know that some opponents argue that the reasons the Founders made \nthe Nation's Capital a separate district, rather than locate it within \na State, remain sound, and therefore we should not tinker with their \nwork, even at the cost of continued disenfranchisement of DC's \ncitizens. That argument ignores the fundamental commitment we all must \nhave to extending the franchise to all Americans. And it ignores the \nfact that article I of the Constitution explicitly gives Congress \nlegislative authority over the District ``in all cases whatsoever.'' \nThe courts have over time described this power as ``extraordinary and \nplenary'' and ``full and unlimited,'' and decades of legislative and \njudicial precedents make clear that the simple word ``states'' in \narticle I (which provides that the House of Representatives ``shall be \ncomposed of members chosen . . . by the people of the several \nstates''), does not trump, Congress's legislative authority to grant \nrepresentation in the House to citizens of the District.\n  I know that Senator Hatch, Lieberman, and others have already \nthoroughly covered this important legal ground, so I will not belabor \nthe history. But when even conservative legal scholars--from Judges Ken\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\nStarr and Patricia Wald to former Assistant Attorney General Viet \nDinh--have done exhaustive legal analyses which outline the positive \ncase for Congress ceding representational rights to citizens of the \nDistrict, you know there is a strong case to be made. In any event, it \nis clear to me that these important constitutional questions should \nultimately be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, and enactment of this \nbill would enable us to do just that. If opponents of the bill are so \ncertain of their constitutional arguments, they should, it seems to me, \nallow those arguments to be tested in the full light of day, in the \ncourts, and resolved once and for all. The bill provides for expedited \nconsideration of appropriate court challenges. If it were to be enacted \nand then struck down because of constitutional infirmities, it would \nthen be clear that a constitutional amendment is the only viable \nalternative left to DC citizens.\n  This is the latest in a series of proposals to extend full rights of \nrepresentation to voters in the District. In 1978, with overwhelming \nbipartisan support, both Chambers of Congress passed the DC voting \nrights constitutional amendment, which would have given District \nresidents voting representation in the House and the Senate, by two-\nthirds majority in each Chamber. The amendment required 38 States to \nratify it, but it fell short. In 1993, the House voted to give partial \nvoting representation to the DC delegate in the ``Committee of the \nWhole'' of the House, unless her vote actually determined the outcome, \nin which case it would not be counted. That is obviously no real voting \n``right'' at all, if it can be taken away when it really counts.\n  There have been many differing proposals over the years to extend the \nright to vote to DC citizens, from constitutional amendments to \nstatehood legislation to retrocession proposals. Since many Americans \nwould be shocked to learn that something as basic as voting \nrepresentation is now withheld from certain of our citizens, and it is \ncoming in a particular historical context in which Utah is poised to \ngain an additional House seat due to its growing population, let me \ndescribe briefly what this bill would actually do.\n  First, it would create two new permanent seats in the House of \nRepresentatives, one for the District of Columbia and the other for \nUtah. An election for the seat in DC would be held in 2008 and the new \nrepresentative would be sworn in for the 111th Congress. The bill \nexplicitly states that DC can only be considered one district and \nreceive only one seat in all future censuses.\n  It also repeals the District of Columbia delegate and other related \nlanguage once a full voting representative is sworn into the 111th \nCongress. Finally, it would allow the State of Utah to create a Fourth \nDistrict, not an at-large seat, using census data from 2000. The \nelection for that seat would be held in 2008. This seat would be \nguaranteed to Utah for the 111th Congress and the 112th Congress until \nanother census is done and new districts are made in 2012. It also \nexplicitly says that the District should not be considered a State for \nthe purpose of representation in the Senate; that question is left for \nanother day.\n  Mr. President, as my colleague Senator Hatch has observed, there are \nreally two fundamental questions here for the Senate to consider. The \nfirst is the constitutional question about whether Congress may enact \nlegislation to address this issue. The second is an essentially \npolitical question about whether we should enact such legislation. I \nhave briefly addressed the first. On the second, I think there really \nshould not be much of a debate. Citizens of the District, a majority of \nthem African-Americans, who fulfill all of the duties of citizenship, \nought to have the right to vote and be represented in Congress as \ndecisions are made about their taxes, about war and peace, or about any \nof the myriad other questions that Congress faces every day.\n  This is not a perfect bill. There are provisions of it that some \noppose, and that I might have drawn differently. But it is an \nexquisitely balanced compromise, and I believe it deserves our support. \nI commend Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Minority Member Collins for \ndeveloping the bill, and I congratulate the majority leader for \nbringing it to the floor today. We know it enjoys the support of a \nlarge majority of Americans--over 80 percent in national polls support \nthe proposition that DC residents should be represented in Congress. I \nhope it will garner the broad support in the Senate it deserves. I urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote aye to enable this \nmeasure to come to the floor, and to support it when it does.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today's debate involves one of the most \nimportant issues in our democracy. Dr. Martin Luther King called the \nright to vote ``civil right number one.'' Yet hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans who live in the Nation's Capital have been denied an equal \nvoice in our democracy. Citizens in the District of Columbia live in \nthe very shadow of the Capitol Building, but they have no \nrepresentative who can vote their interests within these halls. It is \nlong past time for us to finally correct this basic wrong.\n  I commend Senators Lieberman, Hatch, and Bennett for their strong \nleadership on this legislation.\n  Since the Revolutionary War, ``No taxation without representation'' \nhas been a fundamental American principle. It is a famous phrase in our \nhistory. James Otis said it first in a historic speech in Massachusetts \nin 1763, and it was so inspiring that John Adams later said, ``Then and \nthere, the child `independence' was born.''\n  Yet more than two centuries later, citizens who live in the Nation's \nCapital still bear the unfair burden of taxation without \nrepresentation. The more than half a million District of Columbia \nresidents pay significant Federal taxes each year. In fact, DC \nresidents have the second-highest per capita tax burden in the Nation. \nYet they have no say in how Federal taxes are spent, and they have no \nrole in writing the Nation's tax laws.\n  Residents of the District have fought and died in every war to defend \nAmerican interests. Two hundred thirty seven DC residents died in the \nVietnam war. Today, while we debate whether DC citizens deserve a vote \nin Congress, many brave Americans who live in the District are fighting \nfor voting rights in Iraq. Since the beginning of the current wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, 2813 DC residents--2110 members of the Active \nDuty military and 703 members of the Reserve Forces--have been deployed \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. In the course of these conflicts, 28 DC \nresidents have been wounded or killed.\n  Citizens of the District of Columbia have no voice when Congress \nconsiders whether to go to war. The brave soldiers from the Nation's \nCapital have no representation in Congress when the votes are counted \non funding levels for our troops and other issues relating to the war. \nWhen Congress debates assistance to war veterans or considers how to \nimprove conditions at Walter Reed Hospital, the patriotic veterans who \nlive in this city have no vote. It is unconscionable.\n  If we are for democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan, we should certainly \nbe for democracy in the District of Columbia as well.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of DC representation in Congress. \nIn 1978, I worked with Walter Fauntroy and many others on a \nconstitutional amendment to correct this basic injustice. We finally \npassed the constitutional amendment in Congress, but we weren't able to \nget it ratified by a sufficient number of States to take effect. \nBecause we weren't successful then, the issue remains just as urgent \ntoday.\n  Fortunately, a constitutional amendment isn't the only option. The \nConstitution's District clause provides another, legal means for \nproviding citizens of the District of Columbia a vote in Congress. As \nrespected constitutional scholars have made clear, article I, section 8 \nof the Constitution gives Congress the authority ``to exercise \nexclusive Legislation, in all Cases whatsoever, over such District'' of \nColumbia. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress's exclusive \nauthority over the District of Columbia is broad and ``national in the \nhighest sense.''\n  Some have questioned the constitutionality of this approach. Although \nI supported a constitutional amendment in the past, I disagree that a \nconstitutional amendment is the only valid option. Nothing in the \nConstitution explicitly denies residents of this city a\n\n[[Page S11629]]\n\nvoice in Congress. Judges Patricia Wald and Kenneth Starr, both of whom \nserved on the respected U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, have \nstudied this approach to giving the District a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives. Both have concluded that it is constitutional. As they \nand others have noted, the Supreme Court has recognized that Congress \nhas the power to treat District of Columbia citizens as citizens of a \nState in other contexts. For instance, the District is treated as a \nState for purposes of diversity jurisdiction in Federal courts, \nalthough article III, section 2 of the Constitution provides for \ndiversity jurisdiction in suits ``between citizens of different \nStates.''\n  It is impossible to believe that the Founding Fathers, having just \nfinished a war to ensure democratic representation in America, would \nthen insist on denying that representation to citizens living in the \ncapital of their new Nation. Granting the District a vote in Congress \nis consistent with the spirit, as well as the letter, of our \nConstitution.\n  Even if you disagree about the bill's constitutionality, we should \nnot filibuster this important measure. Surely even my colleagues who \nhave a different view of the constitutionality can agree that this \nissue is important enough to deserve an up-or-down vote. The Senate's \nfilibuster of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 was one of its \ndarkest days. We should not repeat that mistake now.\n  This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. When we passed the \nconstitutional amendment in 1978, we had strong support from \nRepublicans like Senators Goldwater, Dole, and Thurmond, in addition to \nDemocrats. Today, the bill has strong bipartisan support in both the \nHouse and Senate. That is because this issue is so obviously an issue \nof simple justice.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee recently held a hearing to celebrate \nthe 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. We heard moving \ntestimony in favor of this bill from Congressman John Lewis, our \ndistinguished colleague in the House of Representatives and a leader in \nthe continuing struggle for equal voting rights. At the age of only 23, \nCongressman Lewis headed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee \nand helped organize a march on Washington. He and others were brutally \nassaulted during the fateful voting rights march at the Edmund Pettis \nBridge, but their sacrifices helped inspire the progress that was to \ncome.\n  Congressman Lewis reminded us of the sacrifices of those who gave \ntheir lives for equal voting rights in this country, and called on us \nto pass the DC Voting Rights Act. He reminded us of our obligation to \ngive the District a vote in Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on this important bill and \nthen vote for final passage of the bill so that we can finally correct \nthis historic wrong and to do it on our watch.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, S. 1257, the District of Columbia \nHouse Voting Rights Act of 2007, is an important and consequential \nbill.\n  The bill before us would increase the 435-seat House of \nRepresentatives to 437 seats, by providing one seat for a voting member \nin DC, which is predominately Democratic, and one additional seat for \nUtah, which is predominately Republican. And it does it in a way that \ndoesn't give advantage to one political party over the other.\n  The time has come to give the District a voice and a vote in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  The legislation is sponsored by Senator Joseph Lieberman, chairman of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; Senator Orrin \nHatch; and my distinguished ranking member on the Rules Committee, \nSenator Robert Bennett. I am a cosponsor this legislation.\n  The District of Columbia occupies an interesting and unique place in \nthe United States:\n  It covers just 61.4 square miles, sandwiched between Virginia and \nMaryland: Yet with more than 580,000 residents, the population of the \nDistrict surpasses that of the entire State of Wyoming. The District of \nColumbia is the seat of American government. The U.S. Congress \ndetermines the laws for the District; the Federal Government impacts \nthe District's transportation system, health system, and police \nfunction. DC residents pay the second highest per capita Federal income \ntaxes in the country. And District residents have sacrificed their \nlives defending our Nation. During World War I, World War II, Vietnam, \nthe Korean war, and today in Iraq, they have fought for our democracy. \nDespite all this, DC residents have no vote in how the Federal \nGovernment operates.\n  ``No taxation without representation,'' the colonists told King \nGeorge in the late 1700s. We cannot allow this lack of representation \nto continue during the 21st century.\n  Today, the District of Columbia has a nonvoting representative in \nCongress--Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. She has been vocal in \nrepresenting the interests of the residents of DC, but she is unable to \ncast a vote on the House floor to ensure that voice is heard. This \nmakes little sense.\n  We now have an opportunity to change this and to strike the right \nbalance while doing it. The bill before us would add two seats to the \nHouse of Representatives, one for the District of Columbia and one for \nUtah.\n  Utah was next in line for a fourth congressional district \nrepresentation in the House, according to 2000 population census data. \nAt that time, Utah was only 856 residents away from becoming eligible \nfor an additional seat.\n  So this legislation strikes the appropriate balance by allowing \nadditional representation for both DC and Utah without disadvantaging \neither national political party.\n  In the last 200 years, Congress has not granted House representation \nto the District of Columbia by statute. Whether such a Federal law is \nconstitutional has never been before the courts. As a result, critics \nof the legislation have argued that a bill providing for a vote for the \nDistrict representative is unconstitutional. However, a bipartisan \ngroup of academics, judges, and lawyers argue that Congress has the \nauthority and historical precedents to enact Federal law, and I agree \nwith their view.\n  The Constitution vests in Congress broad power to regulate national \nelections and plenary authority over DC under the District clause, \narticle I, section 8, clause 17. This clause permits Congress wide \ndiscretion to grant rights to the District of Columbia, including for \nthe purposes of congressional representation.\n  From 1790 to 1800, Congress allowed District residents to vote in \ncongressional elections in Virginia and Maryland. This was allowed not \nbecause they were residents of those States but because Congress acted \nwithin its District clause authority.\n  Constitutional scholars from the right and the left, the most notable \nconservatives being Judge Kenneth Star and Professor Viet Dinh, believe \nthis legislation is constitutional. These scholars reference the \nsweeping authority of the District clause, which provides that ``The \nCongress shall have power . . . to exercise exclusive legislation in \nall cases whatsoever'' over the District of Columbia.\n  In addition to believing that Congress can pass this legislation, I \nbelieve there are strong reasons why it should pass this legislation.\n  DC is affected, perhaps more directly than any other U.S. \njurisdiction, by the actions of Congress.\n  Citizens of the District, rich and poor, work in this town and work \nin the industries of law, policy, business, tourism, academia and \nmedicine. They pay high taxes; they face the challenges of living in \none of the major cities in the United States.\n  This legislation would provide DC with permanent voting rights for \nthe first time in over 200 years.\n  From the Boston Tea Party and ``no taxation without representation'' \nto the suffragettes and struggles over voting rights in the 1960s, the \ngoal of American society has been to bring a voice to citizens who were \nvoiceless.\n  Voting is the voice of democracy.\n  This political limbo that Congress has placed on the District has run \nits course.\n  It is time to give the District a voice and a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  This important step can not only right this wrong but can do it \nwithout causing partisan rancor or disadvantage to any party. What is \nat stake\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\nhere is nothing less than a fundamental fairness voting issue.\n  This bill is consistent with the historical precedents of Congress's \nrole in protecting and preserving the right to vote, regardless of \ncolor or class, age or gender, disability or original language, party \nor precinct, and geography domestic or foreign.\n  It is the right thing to do, and the 21st century is the right times \nto do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in taking up and passing this bill on \na majority vote in the full Senate.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in 1978, as the majority leader of \nthe United States Senate, I strongly supported and voted for H.J. Res. \n554, a joint resolution that proposed amending the Constitution to \nprovide for representation of the District of Columbia in Congress. \nUnfortunately, over the next 7 years, that resolution, which had passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 67 to 32, failed to obtain the approval of the \n38 States it needed for ratification under Article V of the \nConstitution.\n  Today, the Senate seeks to obtain the same commendable goal of \ngranting voting rights to representatives of the District of Columbia. \nThe Senate seeks to do so by passing S. 1257. However, Art. 1, Sec. 2 \nof the Constitution states that the House of Representatives shall be \ncomposed of Members chosen by the people of the several States. The \nConstitution does not refer to the people of the District of Columbia \nin this context. While I recognize that others believe that Art.1, Sec. \n8 of the Constitution authorizes the Congress to ``exercise exclusive \nlegislation'' over the District, including legislation that would grant \nthe District's representatives voting rights, the historical intent of \nthe Founders on this point is unclear.\n  I oppose S. 1257, because I doubt that our Nation's Founding Fathers \never intended that the Congress should be able to change the text of \nthe Constitution by passing a simple bill. The ability to amend the \nConstitution in only two ways was provided with particularity in \nArticle V of the Constitution for a reason. If we wish to grant \nrepresentatives of the citizens of the District of Columbia full voting \nrights, let us do so, once again, the proper way: by passing a \nresolution to amend the Constitution consistent with its own terms.\n  Now is certainly not the time for us to make it easier, rather than \nmore difficult, to alter the text of the Constitution. We serve with a \nPresident who already believes that he can ignore the rule of law by \nissuing a simple directive, a signing statement, or an order that \nundermines the delicately balanced separation of powers, which the \nFramers so painstakingly included in the Constitution. A series of \nFederal judges is now confirming what many of us have known from the \nstart: that this Administration believes it can write 200 years of \ncivil liberties out of the Constitution with a simple stroke of a pen.\n  We all seek the same laudable goal: to provide full Congressional \nrepresentation and voting rights for the citizens of the District of \nColumbia. But let us accomplish that goal in the way the way the \nFounders intended--by amending the Constitution. Let us support a \nresolution to amend the Constitution that would enhance, rather than \nundermine, the rights of the 600,000 residents of the District of \nColumbia who seek a stronger voice in their government.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, Our Nation was born out of a struggle \nagainst taxation without representation. Yet even as we endeavor to \npromote democracy around the world, it is alarming that we deny our own \nAmerican citizens who live in the District of Columbia the right to \nrepresentation in Congress. The nearly 600,000 residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia have been denied voting representation in Congress \nfor over 200 years. But this is not just an injustice perpetrated on DC \nresidents. Their disenfranchisement tarnishes our democracy as a whole. \nThe right to be represented in the national legislature is fundamental \nto our core American values, and for that reason, I am proud to \ncosponsor the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007.\n  There is no principled basis for the disenfranchisement of the \nDistrict's residents. After the Nation's Capital was founded, citizens \nwho lived in the District were represented by congressmen from Maryland \nor Virginia. They were able to make themselves heard in Congress. It \nwas only in 1801 that Congress chose to strip the District of voting \nrights. As a result of this decision, for more than 200 years, the \nDistrict's residents have been taxed like other Americans but have been \ndenied a vote in the Nation's legislature. It is Congress that took \naway the District's representation. After two centuries, it is time for \nus to fix that mistake. The District's residents deserve a voice in how \nthe Nation is governed.\n  The people of this city are proud Americans. They pay their taxes. \nThey serve with honor and distinction in our military. But yet we deny \nthem the ability to fully participate in our democracy. The legislation \nbefore us goes a long way towards righting this wrong by giving the \nresidents of the District representation in Congress that is long \noverdue.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe legislation before us today to ensure that citizens of the District \nof Columbia and the State of Utah are properly represented in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives.\n  In the 1964 Wesberry v. Sanders case, Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. \nBlack wrote that ``no right is more precious in a free country than \nthat of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under \nwhich, as good citizens, we must live.'' The bill we are considering \ntoday--S. 1257--serves this purpose. It would, for the first time, give \nthe citizens of the District of Columbia full voting representation in \nthe House of Representatives, while adding a fourth Congressional seat \nfor the state of Utah, based on updated population statistics from the \n2000 Census.\n  I want to thank my good friends Senators Hatch and Bennett for \ngreatly increasing the possibility of success this year with their \nsupport for this effort. Earlier in the year, the three of us \nintroduced S. 1257 as a compromise that would move us beyond the \npartisan stalemates of the past that have denied the citizens of DC \ntheir most precious right.\n  I must also thank DC Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and Congressman \nTom Davis, whose persistence and bipartisan cooperation has brought us \nto where we are today. It was they who forged the original compromise \nthat passed the House in April by a vote of 241-177 and is now before \nus here in the Senate.\n  Notwithstanding the remarkable service of Congresswoman Norton, the \ncitizens of the District of Columbia deserve more than a non-voting \ndelegate in the House. They deserve a representative who can vote not \nonly in committee, as Delegate Norton now does, but also on the House \nfloor, which she is barred from doing.\n  The fact that District residents have been without voting \nrepresentation in Congress since the District was formed more than 200 \nyears ago is not only a national embarrassment, it is a grave injustice \nand at complete odds with the democratic principles on which our great \nnation was founded. America is the only democracy in the world that \ndenies the citizens of its capital city this most essential right.\n  And yet, the people of DC have been the direct target of terrorist \nattacks but they have no voting power over how the federal government \nprovides homeland security. They have given their lives to protect our \ncountry in foreign wars--including the current one--but have no say in \nour foreign policy. They pay taxes, like every other American. In fact, \nthey pay more: Per capita, District residents have the second-highest \nfederal tax obligation in the country. Yet they have no voice in how \nhigh those taxes will be or how they will be spent.\n  The District is also the only jurisdiction in the country that must \nseek congressional approval--through the appropriations process--before \nspending locally-generated tax dollars. So when Congress fails to pass \nappropriations bills before the beginning of the new fiscal year, the \nDistrict's budget is essentially frozen. And yet DC has no say in our \nfederal appropriations process.\n  Giving the residents of DC voting representation in the House is not \nonly\n\n[[Page S11631]]\n\nthe right and just thing to do; it has popular support. A poll \nconducted by the Washington Post earlier this year found that 61 \npercent of the nation believes it is time to end centuries of bias \nagainst the District by giving its citizens voting representation in \nCongress.\n  It helps to take a look back in history to locate the original source \nof this inequity. In 1800, when the nation's capital was established as \nthe District of Columbia, an apparent oversight left the area's \nresidents without Congressional representation. Maryland and Virginia \nceded land for the capital in 1788 and 1789 respectively, but it took \nanother 11 years for Congress to establish the District. In the \ninterim, residents continued to vote either in Maryland or Virginia, \nbut Congress withdrew those voting rights once the District was \nestablished. Apparently by omission, Congress neglected to establish \nnew voting rights for the citizens of the new District.\n  Whatever the reason for this oversight, it has no relevance to \nreality or national principles today. To have your voice heard by your \ngovernment is central to a functioning democracy and fundamental to a \nfree society.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a \nhearing on the bill May 15, during which we heard compelling testimony \non the need for and constitutionality of S. 1257 from legal scholars, \ncivil rights leaders, and fellow members of Congress. The bill was \nreported to the full Senate on June 13 by a bipartisan vote of 9-1.\n  The primary argument against the bill that we heard at our hearing \nwas the question of constitutionality. Opponents cite Article I, \nSection 2, of the Constitution which states that the House ``shall be \ncomposed of members chosen . . . by the people of the several states.'' \nBut those words were not written in a vacuum. Just six sections later, \nthe framers of the Constitution gave Congress authority to ``exercise \nexclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever'' regarding the District. \nNumerous legal scholars, including Judge Ken Starr and former Assistant \nAttorney General Viet Dinh, both of whom have testified before Congress \non this issue--said this broad authority is sufficient to give District \nresidents full House representation.\n  Congress has repeatedly used this authority to treat the District of \nColumbia as a state. In 1940, the Judiciary Act of 1789 was revised to \nbroaden the definition of diversity jurisdiction, which refers to the \nauthority of the federal courts to hear cases where the parties are \nfrom different states, to include the District of Columbia. This \nrevision upheld by the courts when challenged.\n  The courts have also found that Congress has the authority to impose \nfederal taxes on the District; to provide a jury trial to residents of \nthe District; and to include the District in interstate commerce \nregulation. These are rights and responsibilities granted to states in \nthe Constitution, yet the District Clause has allowed Congress to apply \nthem to DC.\n  We should also remember that Congress has granted voting rights to \nAmericans abroad in their last state of residence regardless of whether \nthey are citizens of that state, pay taxes in that state, or have any \nintent to return to that state. Clearly, the courts have supported \nbroader interpretations of Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution.\n  If, after listening to these arguments, you still doubt the \nconstitutionality of this legislation, I hope I can persuade you to \nsupport it because it is the right thing to do, and we can let the \ncourts resolve the constitutional dispute at a later date, once and for \nall. S. 1257 requires expedited judicial consideration of any \nappropriate court challenge, so any question of constitutional \ninterpretation will be answered promptly.\n  Finally, allow me to reassure skeptics that in no way does this bill \nopen the door to granting the District voting representation in the \nSenate, as some have contended. In fact, language was added in our \nCommittee markup explicitly stating that DC, and I quote here, ``shall \nnot be considered a state for purposes of representation in the United \nStates Senate.'' End of quote. It can't get any clearer than that.\n  The vote we are about to cast will decide whether the Senate should \nproceed to the bill. It is a vote on whether this legislation is worthy \nof Senate consideration. No matter where you stand on the merits of \nthis bill, surely you must agree that a bill on voting representation \nand equal rights deserves consideration by the United States Senate. \nThe Senate has not filibustered a civil rights bill since the summer of \n1964 when it spent 57 days including six Saturdays on the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964. Let us together assure the American public that the days \nof filibustering voting rights bills are over.\n  The House has acted. It is now time for the Senate to do the same. \nThe legislation introduced in both the House and the Senate is an \nexpression of fairness and bipartisanship, an example of what we can do \nwhen we work across party lines as the good people of this nation have \nso often asked us to do.\n  Members from both parties and both houses have finally come together \nto find a solution to break the stalemates of the past that have denied \nDC residents equal representation in the Congress of the United States. \nNow is the time to give the residents of the District what they so \nrichly deserve and that is the same civic entitlement that every other \nfederal tax-paying American citizen enjoys, no matter where he or she \nlives. By giving the citizens of the District of Columbia a genuine \nvote in the House, we will ensure not only that their voices will \nfinally be fully heard. We will be following the imperatives of our \nnational democratic values.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

On this vote, the yeas are 57 and the nays are \n42. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the DC voting \nrights bill that the Senate just voted on. I am disappointed that this \nmeasure failed to receive the necessary 60 votes in order for the bill \nto be considered.\n  This is a bill that seeks to protect the most fundamental right of \ncitizens in our democracy the right to vote. Different generations in \nour Nation's history have struggled to gain and safeguard this \nuniversal right--from the 15th amendment, which extended the right to \nvote to newly freed slaves, to the 19th amendment, which guaranteed the \nright to women, and finally to the Voting Rights Act, which gave real \nsubstance to voting laws that had been previously abused. Yet, as we \nspeak, this most basic right in a democracy is denied to the citizens \nof the District of Columbia.\n  Our brave civil rights leaders sacrificed too much to ensure that \nevery American has the right to vote for us to tolerate the \ndisenfranchisement of the nearly 600,000 residents of the District of \nColumbia. Those who live in our Nation's Capital pay taxes like other \nAmericans. They serve bravely in the Armed Forces to defend our country \nlike other Americans. They are called to sit on Federal juries like \nother Americans. Yet they are not afforded a vote in Congress. Instead, \nthey are granted a nonvoting Delegate who can sit in the House of \nRepresentatives and serve on committees but cannot cast a vote when \nlegislation comes to the floor.\n  As a community organizer in Chicago and as a civil rights attorney, I \nlearned that disenfranchisement can lead to disengagement from our \npolitical system. In many parts of DC, you can look down the street and \nsee the dome of the U.S. Capitol. Yet so many of these streets couldn't \nbe more disconnected from their Government.\n  If we are to take seriously our claim to a government of, by, and for \nthe people, Washington shouldn't be just the seat of our Government, \nbut it also should reflect the core values and fundamental promise of \nour democracy. Denying the right to vote to citizens who are equally \nsubject to the laws of this Nation undermines a central premise of our \nrepresentative Government. The right to vote belongs to every American, \nregardless of race, creed, gender, or geography.\n  For these reasons, I fully support this important legislation. \nAlthough today's vote is a disappointment, I will continue to work with \nMayor Fenty, Congresswoman Norton, and the sponsors of this bill until \nthe residents of the District of Columbia achieve full representation \nin Congress.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11632-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11632-S11645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will resume consideration of H.R. \n1585, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1585) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2008 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Nelson (NE) (for Levin) amendment No. 2011, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Levin (for Specter/Leahy) amendment No. 2022, to restore \n     habeas corpus for those detained by the United States.\n       Warner (for Graham/Kyl) amendment No. 2064, to strike \n     section 1023, relating to the granting of civil rights to \n     terror suspects.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 2067.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I will \nobject. I say to my friend from Oregon, I understand this is the hate \ncrimes bill. I appreciate his passion and commitment on this issue. \nThere is no one more respected in the Senate who has had the situation \nof my distinguished friend from Oregon. But we are on the Defense bill. \nWe have to move forward with the amendments. We have to get it done. We \nhave both Iraq as well as the impending 1st of October date staring us \nin the face. At this time I object to the request by the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we have had an informal discussion. I am \nsad that there is not an opportunity on this bill to bring up the hate \ncrimes bill. I do hope there is a way, following this session, to bring \nup the hate crimes bill. It has broad support and deserves to be heard \nand, I hope, passed. I discussed with Senator McCain the possibility \nthat the Senator from Delaware would now be recognized. We agreed that \nhe would at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2335.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I will not call it up at the moment. I \nwithdraw the request.\n  I do ask unanimous consent that Senators Graham, Casey, Brown, and \nSanders be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 2335.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I want to explain briefly what this amendment does. It \nadds $23.6 billion to allow the Army to replace all of its up-armored \nHMMWVs with mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, the so-called \nMRAPs. It also adds a billion dollars to increase the cost of the 8,000 \nMRAPs we are trying to purchase today. In terms of the specifics of \nthis amendment, the idea is simple. If we can prevent two-thirds or \nmore of our casualties with a vehicle that is basically a modified and \narmored truck, we have to do all in our power to do it, in my view.\n  Last, it provides $400 million for better protection against \nexplosively formed penetrators or EFPs. These are those shaped-charges \nthat hit our vehicles from the side and are increasingly deadly.\n  I want to be straight with my colleagues. This is a very expensive \namendment. Twenty-five billion dollars is a lot of money. But compared \nto saving the lives and limbs of American soldiers and marines, it is \ncheap.\n  Our commanders in the field tell us that MRAPs will reduce casualties \nby 67 to 80 percent.\n  The lead commander on the ground in Iraq, LTG Ray Odierno, told us \nmonths ago that he wanted to replace every Army up-armored HMMWV in \nIraq with an MRAP.\n  Instead of adjusting the requirement immediately, the Pentagon has \ntaken its time to study this issue and just recently they have agreed \nthat the general needs a little over half of what he asked for. 10,000 \ninstead of approximately 18,000.\n  This makes no sense. Are we only supposed to care about the tactical \nadvice of our commanders in the field when it is cheap?\n\n[[Page S11633]]\n\n  I don't think that is what the American people or our military men \nand women expect from us.\n  More importantly, while we argue about the best strategy for Iraq, we \nmust still protect those under fire. I disagree with the President's \nstrategy in Iraq. I do not believe a strong central government will \nlead to a stable, self-sufficient Iraq.\n  I think we need a new strategy that focuses on implementing the Iraqi \nconstitution's call for federalism and re-focuses the mission of \nAmerican forces on fighting al-Qaida, border protection, and continuing \nto train the Iraqi forces.\n  While we disagree on strategy, the fight continues in the alleys of \nBaghdad and the streets of Diyala Province. American soldiers and \nmarines are targets every day they are there. So every day they are \nthere, we must give them the best protection this nation has.\n  The American political process is designed to make change and \ndecisionmaking a slow and deliberative process. Those of us who want a \nchange in strategy have three options.\n  One, we must convince enough colleagues to sustain a veto from the \nPresident; or, two, we must convince the American people to elect \nenough new Senators and House Members willing to sustain a veto. Or, \nfinally, three, we must convince the American people to elect a \nPresident willing to change strategies. That is reality. I believe in \nthis system, which means I will not walk away from my duty to try to \nconvince both my colleagues and the American people that there is a \nbetter path to stability in Iraq.\n  It also means that I will not give up on my obligation to our \nmilitary men and women.\n  While we take the time necessary to move the political process for \nchange, they face improvised explosive devices, rocket propelled \ngrenades, explosively formed penetrators, sniper fire, and suicide \nbombers every day. We have an obligation to protect each and every one \nof them to the best of our ability. I agree with the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, GEN James Conway when he said, ``Anything less is \nimmoral.''\n  In terms of the specifics of this amendment, the idea is very simple. \nIf we can prevent two-thirds or more of our casualties with a vehicle \nthat is basically a modified and armored truck, we must do all in our \npower to do that.\n  Will it be a challenge to American industry to build close to 23,000 \nMRAPs in the next 12 to 15 months? Absolutely. Can they do it? Only if \nwe give them a real chance. If we provide funding up front for all that \nis needed, we give business the ability to increase capacity to \nproduce. If we give little bits here and there, they and their \nsubcontractors will be limited in their ability to produce these life-\nsaving vehicles. Less will be produced and more Americans will return \ninjured or dead.\n  I gave a statement on July 19, when I first introduced this \namendment, that laid out some of the history of the MRAP program. I \nwon't go into all of that again, but I will reiterate the key choice my \ncolleagues have to make: Do we do our best to save American lives, \nknowing that the only downside is the possible need to reprogram \nfunding at the end of the year, or do we care more about some unknown \ntopline wartime funding number than those lives?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank the managers of the bill and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have had conversations with the two \nmanagers, Senator McCain and Senator Levin. I would hope people who \nfeel strongly about the amendment that is pending; that is, the habeas \ncorpus amendment, would come and speak on this amendment. The floor is \nopen for debate on that issue. It is an extremely important amendment. \nNo matter how you feel about it, it is important--whether you are for \nit or against it. I would hope Senators would come and talk about that \namendment.\n  I have also spoken with Senator Levin and Senator McCain about how we \nproceed from this point forward. We have been somewhat tepid in moving \nforward because we did not know how the vote would turn out on the DC \nvoting rights. We know that now, so we are moving ahead as quickly as \nwe can on the Defense authorization bill because that matter is out of \nthe way procedurally.\n  What I have spoken to the two managers about is that we would have \nthe Defense authorization bill, and as a sidetrack, we would have Iraq \namendments--a finite number from the Democrats, a finite number from \nthe Republicans. We would work on time agreements for those amendments. \nOur floor staff is trying to draw something up and submit that to the \nRepublican leader. I have not today--even though I have spoken to him \nin the past about that--spoken to him about that, although we have \nspoken to Senator Kyl, Senator McCain, Senator Lott, and others. The \ndistinguished Republican leader was simply off the floor at the time. \nSo our two staffs are coming up with something in writing to see if \nthere is a way we can move forward on that; otherwise, we will offer \nthem as part of the Defense authorization bill.\n  On this matter, I have the greatest comfort level with Senator \nLevin's ability to manage this bill. He has, in years past, done such a \nremarkably good job. For many years, it has been Senator Warner working \nwith him. Now, because of the change in the ranking membership of that \ncommittee, it is Senator McCain, who also is very experienced. So we \nshould be able to move this legislation along, I hope, quickly.\n  There is a lot to do on this bill, and I would hope Members on this \nside would listen to what Senator Levin has to say and come when it is \nto their interest, and maybe even sometimes when it is not to their \ninterest, but at least in an effort to dispose of this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to about 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning business.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would like to repeat what my friend \nand distinguished chairman said: We need to get opening statements \ndone. The debate has now begun on the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2008. We are looking at the date of September 18, \nand we want to get this bill done as quickly as possible and to \nconference with the House so we can provide the much needed equipment, \ntraining, pay, and care for our veterans as well as our military \npersonnel. I urge my colleagues, if they have any statements to make on \nthis bill, that they come over and make them.\n  I also would like to point out, as my friend from Michigan has, that \nwe will be working on the large number of amendments on the bill as \nwell as the provisions on Iraq. The sooner we complete action on this \nlegislation, the sooner we can get it to conference with the other body \nand to the President's desk for signature.\n  This is not the first time we have addressed this bill, and I hope it \nis the last for the National Defense Authorization Act, at least for \nfiscal year 2008. I again express my appreciation and admiration for \nthe distinguished chairman, Senator Levin, who has not only worked \nclosely with this side of the aisle but also has worked very hard to \nforge a bipartisan bill that received a unanimous vote from the \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S11634]]\n\nupon its reporting to the floor of the Senate. Obviously, we have a \ngreat debate here again on the issue of Iraq with the consideration of \nseveral amendments, so I hope we will be able to also dispose of those \nas quickly as possible.\n  As all of my colleagues know, we have received the much anticipated \ntestimony of GEN David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, and the \nSenate now begins a debate of historic proportions. In my opinion, at \nstake is nothing less than the future of Iraq, the Middle East, and the \nsecurity of all Americans for decades to come. The Senate faces a \nseries of stark choices: whether to build on the success of the surge \nand fight for additional gains or whether to set a date for Americans \nto surrender in Iraq and thereby suffer the terrible consequences that \nwill ensue. As we consider each of the Iraq-related amendments filed on \nthis bill, let us understand the enormous consequences of decisions \nthat are taken here.\n  Henry Kissinger framed the debate in a Washington Post article this \nweekend, saying:\n\n       American decisions in the next few months will affect the \n     confidence and morale of potential targets, potential allies, \n     and radical Jihadists around the globe. Above all, they will \n     define the U.S. capacity to contribute to a safer and better \n     world.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article by Dr. Kissinger from the \nWashington Post over the weekend printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Disaster of Hasty Withdrawal\n\n                        (By Henry A. Kissinger)\n\n       Two realities define the range of a meaningful debate on \n     Iraq policy: The war cannot be ended by military means alone. \n     But neither is it possible to ``end'' the war by ceding the \n     battlefield. The radical jihadist challenge knows no \n     frontiers; American decisions in the next few months will \n     affect the confidence and morale of potential targets, \n     potential allies and radical jihadists around the globe. \n     Above all, they will define the U.S. capacity to contribute \n     to a safer and better world. The imperative is for bipartisan \n     cooperation in a coordinated political and military strategy, \n     even while the political cycle tempts a debate geared to \n     focus groups.\n       The experience of Vietnam is often cited as the example for \n     the potential debacle that awaits us in Iraq. But we will \n     never learn from history if we keep telling ourselves myths \n     about it. The passengers on American helicopters fleeing \n     Saigon were not U.S. troops but Vietnamese civilians. \n     American forces had left two years earlier. Vietnam collapsed \n     because of the congressional decision to reduce aid by two-\n     thirds to Vietnam and to cut it off altogether for Cambodia \n     in the face of a massive North Vietnamese invasion that \n     violated every provision of the Vietnam Peace Agreement.\n       Should America repeat a self-inflicted wound? An abrupt \n     withdrawal from Iraq would not end the war; it would only \n     redirect it. Within Iraq, the sectarian conflict could assume \n     genocidal proportions; terrorist base areas could reemerge. \n     Lebanon might slip into domination by Iran's ally, Hezbollah; \n     a Syria-Israel war or an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear \n     facilities might become more likely as Israel attempted to \n     break the radical encirclement; Turkey and Iran would \n     probably squeeze Kurdish autonomy. The Taliban in Afghanistan \n     would gain new impetus. Countries where the radical threat is \n     as yet incipient, such as India, would face a mounting \n     domestic challenge. Pakistan, in the process of a delicate \n     politica1 transformation, would encounter more radical \n     pressures and might even turn into a radicai challenge \n     itself. That is what is meant by ``precipitate'' withdrawal--\n     a withdrawal in which the United States loses the ability to \n     shape events, either within Iraq, on the antijihadist \n     battlefield or in the world at large.\n       The proper troop level in Iraq will not be discovered by \n     political compromise at home. To be sure, no ``dispensable'' \n     forces should be retained there. Yet the definition of \n     ``dispensable'' must be based on strategic and political \n     criteria. If reducing troop levels turns into the litmus test \n     of American politics, each withdrawal will generate demands \n     for additional ones until the political, military and \n     psychological framework collapses. An appropriate Iraq \n     strategy requires political direction. But the political \n     dimension must be the ally of military strategy, not a \n     resignation from it.\n       Symbolic withdrawals, urged by such wise elder statesmen as \n     Sens. John Warner and Richard Lugar, might indeed assuage the \n     immediate public concerns. They should be understood, \n     however, as palliatives; their utility depends on a balance \n     between their capacity to reassure the U.S. public and their \n     propensity to encourage America's adversaries to believe that \n     they are the forerunners of complete retreat.\n       The argument that the mission of U.S. forces should be \n     confined to defeating terrorism, protecting the frontiers, \n     preventing the emergence of Taliban-like structures and \n     staying out of the civil war aspects is also tempting. In \n     practice, it will be difficult to distinguish among the \n     various aspects of the conflict with any precision.\n       Some answer that the best political result is most likely \n     to be achieved by total withdrawal. The option of basing \n     policies on the most favorable assumptions about the \n     future is, of course, always available. Yet nothing in \n     Middle East history suggests that abdication confers \n     influence. Those who urge this course need to put forward \n     their recommendations for action if what occurs are the \n     dire consequences of an abrupt withdrawal foreseen by the \n     majority of experts and diplomats.\n       The missing ingredient has not been a withdrawal schedule \n     but a political and diplomatic design connected to a military \n     strategy. The issue is not whether Arab or Muslim societies \n     can ever become democratic; it is whether they can become so \n     under American military guidance in a time frame for which \n     the U.S. political process will stand.\n       American exhortations for national reconciliation are based \n     on constitutional principles drawn from the Western \n     experience. But it is impossible to achieve this in a six-\n     month period defined by the ``surge'' in an artificially \n     created state racked by the legacy of a thousand years of \n     ethnic and sectarian conflicts. Experience should teach us \n     that trying to manipulate fragile political structures--\n     particularly one resulting from American-sponsored \n     elections--is likely to play into radical hands. Nor are the \n     present frustrations with Baghdad's performance a sufficient \n     excuse to impose a strategic disaster on ourselves: However \n     much Americans may disagree about the decision to intervene \n     or about the policy afterward, the United States is in Iraq \n     in large part to serve the American commitment to global \n     order, not as a favor to the Baghdad government.\n       It is possible that the present structure in Baghdad is \n     incapable of national reconciliation because its elected \n     constituents were chosen on a sectarian basis. A wiser course \n     would be to place more emphasis on the three principal \n     regions and promote technocratic, efficient and humane \n     administration in each. The provision of services and \n     personal security coupled with emphasis on economic, \n     scientific and intellectual development may represent the \n     best hope for fostering a sense of community. More efficient \n     regional government leading to a substantial decrease in the \n     level of violence, to progress toward the rule of law and to \n     functioning markets could over time give Iraqis an \n     opportunity for national reconciliation--especially if no \n     region is strong enough to impose its will on the others by \n     force. Failing that, the country may well drift into de facto \n     partition under the label of autonomy, such as already exists \n     in the Kurdish region. That very prospect might encourage the \n     Baghdad political forces to move toward reconciliation. Much \n     depends on whether it is possible to create a genuine \n     national army rather than an agglomeration of competing \n     militias.\n       The second and ultimately decisive route to overcoming the \n     Iraqi crisis is through international diplomacy. Today the \n     United States is bearing the major burden for regional \n     security militarily, politically and economically in the face \n     of passivity of the designated potential victims. Yet many \n     other nations know that their internal security and, in some \n     cases, their survival will he affected by the outcome in \n     Iraq. That passivity cannot last. These countries must \n     participate in the construction of a civil society, and \n     the best way for us to foster those efforts is to turn \n     reconstruction into a cooperative international effort \n     under multilateral management.\n       It will not be possible to achieve these objectives in a \n     single, dramatic move: The military outcome in Iraq will \n     ultimately have to be reflected in some international \n     recognition and some international enforcement of its \n     provisions. The international conference of Iraq's neighbors \n     and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council has \n     established a possible forum for this. A U.N. role in \n     fostering such a political outcome could be helpful.\n       Such a strategy is the best path to reduce America's \n     military presence in the long run; an abrupt reduction of \n     American forces will impede diplomacy and set the stage for \n     more intense military crises down the road.\n       Pursuing diplomacy inevitably raises the question of how to \n     deal with Iran. Cooperation is possible and should be \n     encouraged with an Iran that pursues stability and \n     cooperation. Such an Iran has legitimate aspirations that \n     need to be respected. But an Iran that practices subversion \n     and seeks regional hegemony--which appears to be the current \n     trend--must be faced with lines it will not be permitted to \n     cross: The industrial nations cannot accept radical forces \n     dominating a region on which their economies depend, and the \n     acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran is incompatible with \n     international security. These truisms need to be translated \n     into effective policies, preferably common policies with \n     allies and friends.\n       None of these objectives can be realized, however, unless \n     two conditions are met: The United States needs to maintain a \n     presence in the region on which its supporters can count and \n     which its adversaries have to take seriously. The country \n     must recognize that whatever decisions are made now, multiple \n     crises in Iraq, in the Middle East and to\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\n     world order will continue after a new administration takes \n     office. Bipartisanship is a necessity, not a tactic.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, let us proceed with this debate, keeping \nin mind that the underlying bill, the National Defense Authorization \nAct, contains many non-Iraq provisions which constitute good defense \npolicy and which will strengthen the ability of our country to defend \nitself. That is why the committee voted unanimously to report the bill, \nwhich fully funds the President's $648 billion defense budget request, \nauthorizes a 3.5-percent pay raise for all military personnel, \nincreases Army and Marine end-strength, reforms the system that serves \nwounded veterans, and provides necessary measures to avoid waste, \nfraud, and abuse in defense procurement. It is a good bill. It is a \nbipartisan bill. I believe we need to send it to the President's desk.\n  While the Senate moved off the bill in July and on to other things \nand then went on to a month-long recess, America's soldiers, marines, \nsailors, and airmen continued fighting bravely and tenaciously in Iraq \nin concert with their Iraqi counterparts. Some Senators undoubtedly \nwelcomed the delay in considering the Defense bill, believing that \nGeneral Petraeus would deliver to Congress a report filled only with \ndefeat and despair. If this was their hope, they were sorely \ndisappointed. As we all now know, General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker reported what some of us argued before the bill was pulled 2 \nmonths ago: that the surge is working, that we are making progress \ntoward our goals, and that success, while long, hard, and by no means \ncertain, is possible. We are succeeding only after 4 years of failures, \nyears which have exacted an enormous cost on our country and on the \nbrave men and women who fight in Iraq on our behalf.\n  Some of us from the beginning warned against the Rumsfeld strategy of \ntoo few troops, insufficient resources, and a plan predicated on hope \nrather than on the difficult business of stabilization and \ncounterinsurgency. We lost years to that strategy, years we cannot get \nback. In the process, the American people became saddened, frustrated, \nand angry. I, too, am heartsick at the terrible price we have paid for \nnearly 4 years of mismanaged war. But I also know America cannot simply \nend this effort in frustration and accept the terrible consequences of \ndefeat in Iraq. We cannot choose to lose in Iraq. I believe we must \ngive our commanders the time and support they have asked for to win \nthis conflict.\n  Ralph Peters, the distinguished military strategist, summed it up \nbest, noting that Congress's failure to support General Petraeus:\n\n       Would be a shame, since, after nearly 4 years of getting it \n     miserably wrong in Iraq, we are finally getting it right.\n\n  In 2 days of testimony and countless interviews, General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker described how we are finally getting it right. We \nfinally have in place a counterinsurgency strategy, one we should have \nbeen following from the beginning, which makes the most effective use \nof our strength and does not advance the tactics of our enemy. This new \nstrategy, backed by a tactical surge in troops, is the only approach \nthat has resulted in real security improvements in Iraq.\n  General Petraeus reported that the overall number of ``security \nincidents'' in Iraq has declined in 8 of the last 12 weeks and that \nsectarian violence has dropped substantially since the change in \nstrategy. Civilian deaths nationwide are down by nearly half since \nDecember and have dropped by some 70 percent in Baghdad. Deaths \nresulting from sectarian violence have come down by 80 percent since \nDecember, and the number of car bombings and suicide attacks has \ndeclined in each of the past 5 months. Anyone who has traveled recently \nto Anbar or Diyala or Baghdad can see the improvements that have taken \nplace over the past months. With violence down, commerce has risen, and \nthe bottom-up efforts to forge counterterrorism alliances are bearing \ntangible fruit. This is not to argue that Baghdad or other areas have \nsuddenly become safe--they have not--but such positive developments \nillustrate General Petraeus's contention that Americans and Iraqi \nforces have achieved substantial progress.\n  There are many challenges remaining, and the road ahead is long and \ntough. The Maliki government has not taken advantage of our efforts to \nenable reconciliation and is not functioning as it must. While violence \nhas declined significantly, it remains high, and success is not \ncertain. We can be sure, however, that should the Congress choose to \nlose by legislating a date for withdrawal, and thus surrender, or by \nmandating a change in mission that would undermine our efforts in Iraq, \nthen we will fail for certain. Make no mistake, the consequences of \nAmerica's defeat in Iraq will be terrible and long lasting.\n  There is in some corners a belief that we can simply turn the page in \nIraq, come home, and move on to other things. This is dangerously \nwrong. If we surrender in Iraq, we will be back--in Iraq and \nelsewhere--in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at \nan even greater cost in American lives and treasure. Two weeks ago, \nGeneral Jim Jones testified before the Armed Services Committee and \noutlined what he believes to be the consequences of such a course: ``a \nprecipitous departure which results in a failed state in Iraq,'' he \nsaid, ``will have a significant boost in the numbers of extremists, \njihadists, in the world, who will believe that they will have toppled \nthe major power on Earth and that all else is possible. And I think it \nwill not only make us less safe; it will make our friends and allies \nless safe. And the struggle will continue. It will simply be done in \ndifferent and in other areas.''\n  Some Senators would like to withdraw our troops from Iraq so we can \nget back to fighting what they believe to be the real war on terror. \nThis, too, is inaccurate. Iraq has become the central front in the \nglobal war on terror, and failure there would turn Iraq into a \nterrorist sanctuary, in the heart of the Middle East, next door to \nIran, the world's largest state-sponsor of terrorism. If we fail in \nIraq, we will concede territory to jihadists to plan attacks against \nAmerica and our friends and allies. The region could easily descend \ninto chaos, wider war, and genocide, and we should have no doubt about \nwho will take advantage.\n  The Iranian President has stated his intentions bluntly. This is the \nsame fellow who announced his dedication and his nation's dedication to \nthe extinction of the state of Israel the same President of the country \nthat is exporting lethal explosive devices of the most lethal and \ndangerous kind into Iraq, killing American service men and women. This \nPresident said this:\n\n       Soon, we will see a huge power vacuum in the region. Of \n     course, we are prepared to fill the gap.\n\n  We cannot allow an Iranian dominated Middle East to take shape in the \ncontext of wider war and terrorist safehavens. General Jones is just \none of many distinguished national security experts who warn against \nthe consequences of a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. As Brent \nScowcroft said, ``The costs of staying are visible; the costs of \ngetting out are almost never discussed . . . If we get out before Iraq \nis stable, the entire Middle East region might start to resemble Iraq \ntoday. Getting out is not a solution.'' Natan Sharansky has, written \nthat a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces ``could lead to a \nbloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by comparison.'' And \nHenry Kissinger warns that, ``An abrupt withdrawal from Iraq would not \nend the war; it would only redirect it.''\n  The proponents of withdrawal counter that none of these terrible \nconsequences would unfold should any of their various proposals become \nlaw. On the contrary, they argue, U.S. forces could, when not engaged \nin training the Iraqi forces, engage in targeted counterterrorism \noperations. But our own military commanders say that such a narrow \napproach to the complex Iraqi security environment will not succeed, \nand that moving in with search and destroy missions to kill and capture \nterrorists, only to immediately cede the territory to the enemy, is a \nrecipe for failure. How can they be so sure? It's simple--this focus on \ntraining and counterterrorism constitutes the very strategy that so \nplainly failed for the first four years of this war. To return to such \nan unsuccessful approach is truly ``staying the course,'' and it is a \ncourse that will inevitably lead to our defeat and to catastrophic\n\n[[Page S11636]]\n\nconsequences for Iraq, the region, and the security of the United \nStates.\n  General Petraeus and his commanders have embraced a new strategy, one \nthat can, over time, lead to success in Iraq. They are fighting smarter \nand better, and in a way that can give Iraqis the security and \nopportunity to make decisions necessary to save their country from the \nabyss of genocide and a permanent and spreading war, and in a way that \nwill safeguard fundamental American interests. They ask just two things \nof us: the time to continue this strategy and the support they need to \ncarry out their mission. They must have both, and I will fight to \nensure that they do.\n  As we engage in this debate, I hope that each of us will recall our \nmost solemn allegiance, which is not to party or politics but to \ncountry. I have heard on this floor the claim that our efforts in Iraq \nsomehow constitute ``Bush's war'' or the ``Republican war.'' Nothing \ncould be farther from the truth. Presidents do not lose wars. Political \nparties do not lose wars. Nations lose wars and suffer the \nconsequences, or prevail and enjoy the blessings of their success.\n  All of us want our troops to come home, and to come home as soon as \npossible. But we should want our soldiers to return to us with honor, \nthe honor of victory that is due all of those who have paid with the \nultimate sacrifice. We have many responsibilities to the people who \nelected us, but one responsibility outweighs all the others, and that \nis to protect this great and good Nation from all enemies foreign and \ndomestic.\n  This is a serious debate and one we engage at a time of national \nperil. The Americans who make the greatest sacrifices have earned the \nright to insist that we do our duty, as best we can and remember to \nwhom and what we owe our first allegiance--to the security of the \nAmerican people and to the ideals upon which our Nation was founded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, earlier in the day, there was the \nattempt of my friend and colleague, Senator Smith, to at least try to \npropose an amendment that deals with hate crimes and try to get it into \nan order and to be able to have consideration of that amendment during \nthe Defense authorization bill. There has been objection. I can \nunderstand the importance of the underlying amendment. I certainly \nbelieve that underlying amendment has great significance and \nimportance, and we are going to have an opportunity, I believe, \ntomorrow to vote on it.\n  I wish to indicate I have every intention, with Senator Smith, of \noffering at some time the hate crimes legislation. I know the question \ncomes up: Why are we offering hate crimes legislation on a Defense \nauthorization bill? The answer is very simple: The Defense \nauthorization bill is dealing with the challenges of terrorism, and the \nhate crimes issue--to try to get a handle on the problems of hate \ncrimes, we are talking about domestic terrorism. We have our men and \nwomen who are over in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world \nfighting for American values. One of the values we have as Americans is \nthe recognition that we do not believe individuals ought to be singled \nout because of their race, religion or sexual orientation and be the \nsubject of hate attack.\n  This has been an ongoing and continuing issue for our country. At \nanother time, I will get into greater detail about the nature of the \nchallenges we are facing on this particular issue. We passed hate crime \nlegislation at the time of Dr. King, but it was somewhat restrictive in \nterms of its application. We have been reminded about this challenge \nprobably most dramatically with Mr. Shepard out in the Wyoming \ncountryside, who was selected to be a victim of a hate crime and \nsuffered a horrific death.\n  I, for one, and I think others do, understand we have voted on this \non other Defense authorization bills. It has been carried on other \nDefense authorization bills. I know my friend and colleague, Senator \nSmith, would not have taken an unreasonable period of time. We have \nvoted on this issue. We voted in 2004 and in 2000 on this issue. \nMembers are familiar with the substance of the issue. So we don't need \na great deal of time. We are glad to cooperate with the floor managers \nin terms of the time.\n  I didn't want to let the afternoon go by and leave any doubt. I have \nhad the opportunity to mention this to Senator Levin on other \noccasions. I mentioned it, as well, to our majority leader, Senator \nReid, who has been supportive. I know Senator Levin has been supportive \nof the substance of it. It seems to me we are talking about Defense \nauthorization and we are talking effectively about the national \nsecurity and about the values of our country and why our men and women \nare involved in defending our country and these values. Certainly, we \nought to be able to say, as we are dealing with the problem of hatred \nand violence around the world, that we will battle hatred and violence \nas it is applied here at home.\n  As I mentioned, at another time I will go into detail on the history \nof the legislation and, again, the reasons for it and the facts on this \nparticular issue in recent times.\n  At a time when our ideals are under attack by terrorists in other \nlands, it is more important than ever to demonstrate that we practice \nwhat we preach, and that we are doing all we can to root out the \nbigotry and prejudice in our own country that leads to violence here at \nhome.\n  Crimes motivated by hate because of the victim's race, religion, \nethnic background, sexual orientation, disability, or gender are not \nconfined to the geographical boundaries of our great Nation. The \ncurrent conflicts in the Middle East and Northern Ireland, the ethnic \ncleansing campaigns in Bosnia and Rwanda, or the Holocaust itself \ndemonstrate that violence motivated by hate is a world-wide danger, and \nwe have a special responsibility to combat it here at home.\n  This amendment will strengthen the Defense Authorization Act by \nprotecting those who volunteer to serve in the military. The vast \nmajority of our soldiers serve with honor and distinction. These men \nand women put their lives on the line to ensure our freedom and for \nthat, we are truly grateful. Sadly, our military bases are not immune \nfrom the violence that comes from hatred.\n  In 1992, Allen Schindler, a sailor in the Navy was viciously murdered \nby two fellow sailors because of his sexual orientation. Seven years \nlater, PFC Barry Winchell, an infantry soldier in the Army, was \nbrutally slain for being perceived as gay. These incidents prompted the \nmilitary to implement guidelines to prevent this type of violence, but \nthere is more that we can do. We have to send a message that these \ncrimes won't be tolerated against any member of society.\n  A disturbing trend has also been discovered in the military. Last \nyear, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that members of hate \ngroups have been entering into the military. As recruiters struggle to \nfulfill their quotas, they are being forced to accept recruits who may \nbe extremists, putting our soldiers at higher risk of hate motivated \nviolence. This can't be tolerated. We must stem the tied of hatred and \nbigotry by sending a loud and clear message that hate crimes will be \npunished to the fullest extent of the law.\n  Since the September 11 attacks, we've seen a shameful increase in the \nnumber of hate crimes committed against Muslims, Sikhs, and Americans \nof Middle Eastern descent. Congress has done much to respond to the \nvicious attacks of September 11. We have authorized the use of force \nagainst terrorists and those who harbor them in other lands. We have \nenacted legislation to provide aid to victims and their families, to \nstrengthen airport security, to improve the security of our borders, to \nstrengthen our defenses against bioterrorism, and to give law \nenforcement and intelligence officials enhanced powers to investigate \nand prevent terrorism.\n  Protecting the security of our homeland is a high priority, and there \nis more that we should do to strengthen our defenses against hate that \ncomes from abroad. There is no reason why Congress should not act to \nstrengthen our defenses against hate that occurs here at home.\n  Hate crimes are a form of domestic terrorism. They send the poisonous \nmessage that some Americans deserve to be victimized solely because of \nwho they are. Like other acts of terrorism, hate crimes have an impact \nfar greater\n\n[[Page S11637]]\n\nthan the impact on the individual victims. They are crimes against \nentire communities, against the whole nation, and against the \nfundamental ideals on which America was founded. They are a violation \nof all our country stands for.\n  Since the September 11 attacks, the Nation has been united in our \neffort to root out the cells of hatred around the world. We should not \nturn a blind eye to acts of hatred and terrorism here at home.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft put it well when he said:\n\n       Just as the United States will pursue, prosecute, and \n     punish terrorists who attack America out of hatred for what \n     we believe, we will pursue, prosecute and punish those who \n     attack law-abiding Americans out of hatred for who they are. \n     Hatred is the enemy of justice, regardless of its source.\n\n  Now more than ever, we need to act against hate crimes and send a \nstrong message here and around the world that we will not tolerate \ncrimes fueled by hate.\n  The Senate should not hesitate in condemning countries that tolerate \ncrimes motivated by the victim's race, religion, ethnic background, \nsexual orientation, disability, or gender. Hate is hate regardless of \nwhat nation it originates in. We can send a strong message about the \nneed to eradicate hate crimes throughout the world by passing this hate \ncrimes amendment to the Defense Department Authorization Bill.\n  We should not shrink now from our role as the beacon of liberty to \nthe rest of the world. The national interest in condemning bias-\nmotivated violence in the United States is great, and so is our \ninterest in condemning bias-motivated violence occurring world-wide.\n  The hate crimes amendment we are offering today condemns the \npoisonous message that some human beings deserve to be victimized \nsolely because of their race, religion, or sexual orientation and must \nnot be ignored. This action is long overdue. When the Senate approves \nthis amendment, we will send a message about freedom and equality that \nwill resonate around the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, I concur with something Senator \nMcCain said which is that the floor is open now for people to come down \nand speak, either on the bill, on the pending habeas corpus amendment, \nor on any other matter on which they wish to speak. There will be no \nmore votes today, I am authorized to say. Also, there will be a cloture \nvote tomorrow at approximately 10:30 a.m. on the Specter-Leahy-Dodd \namendment. Then we hope to take action relative to the Graham \namendment. There are some discussions going on relative to that \namendment. Then, hopefully, we would promptly move to take up the Webb \namendment. It is the intention of this manager that the Webb amendment \nthen be called up immediately after the disposition of, first, the \nSpecter-Leahy-Dodd cloture vote and then the Graham amendment, and it \nis my intention that Senator Webb then have his amendment called up. I \nbelieve Senator Webb will be ready to proceed at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, will the distinguished chairman yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is my understanding in my \nconversations with the chairman, we are moving forward in narrowing \ndown amendments so we have an additional managers' package so we have a \nmanageable number of amendments that need to be debated and voted on, \nand we will try to get time agreements on those, as well as the Iraqi \namendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. I did fail to mention that the \nleaders are meeting to see if there can't be a unanimous consent \nagreement worked out relative to the Iraq amendments. Senator Reid \ndescribed that proposed unanimous consent agreement, but that is going \non.\n  The Senator from Arizona is correct, we are going to seek to reduce \nthe number of amendments that require rollcalls. We are going to seek \ntime agreements. We have a huge number of amendments which have been \nfiled, in the two hundreds. We made some progress because we disposed \nof 50 amendments the other day.\n  We very much thank Senator McCain, by the way, and his staff, and \nSenator Warner, for the efforts they are putting into this legislation. \nSenator McCain is a very easy person with whom to work. We are used to \nhaving people on the committee who are both chairman and ranking \nmember, regardless who is in control of the committee, work on a \nbipartisan basis. Senator McCain is surely in that tradition. We are \ngrateful for that effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nhis kind remarks. All things considered, I would rather the situation \nbe reversed, but I certainly do appreciate the opportunity.\n  One of the nice things about this body is that over a 20-year period, \nthe Senator from Michigan and I have had the honor of working together \non behalf of this Nation's defense on this very important committee, \nthe Armed Services Committee. One of the previous chairman's statues \npresides in the office named after him--the office in which we both \nwork and where we spend our time on the committee. I believe given our \npast history, I say to the chairman, that it is very possible we could \ndispose of this bill by the end of the week. One of the reasons why the \nchairman and I both made the argument to our colleagues to get it done \nis because we have to go to conference with the House, the other body, \nwhich has a number of different provisions that have to be reconciled. \nThen we have to get it to the President's desk, and October 1 is the \nbeginning of a new fiscal year. So I hope our colleagues all appreciate \nthe urgency.\n  One of the provisions of this legislation is the Wounded Warriors. We \nwere all appalled at the conditions at Walter Reed. That is why we in \nthe committee, with some guidance from a distinguished commission--a \nlot of guidance from a distinguished commission, headed by Senator Dole \nand former Secretary Shalala. These are very important issues for the \nmedical care of the men and women who are serving. It will not happen \nunless we get this legislation passed. So we are kind of asking for a \nhigher calling here to understand the necessity to get this bill to the \nPresident's desk before the October 1.\n  Of course, we can have a continuing resolution. We have done that, \nnot on the DOD bill, as I recall. I don't know if the chairman recalls \nit. That, obviously, does not do what these thousands of hours of hard \nwork on our part and on the part of the military leaders and the \nmembers of staff do.\n  It is my fine hope, I say to the chairman, that we are able to finish \nthis bill this week with the cooperation of all involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, while we hope the Senator from Arizona is \nright and we can complete the bill this week, we also are aware of the \nfact that on Friday, we do have to leave here somewhat early because of \nthe Jewish holidays. That will be only part of the day. I hope we can \nmake tremendous progress this week. It may be a bit optimistic in terms \nof finishing it this week. That is going to depend on the cooperation \nof our colleagues. We have hundreds of amendments. We need colleagues \nwho can clear many of them, and we need time agreements on the rest. It \ndepends on our colleagues.\n  We are going to do everything we can to continue a great tradition \nhere. May I say, this is the 46th year in a row that the authorization \nbill has come to the floor, and we are not going to break the record of \nhaving an authorization for every one of those previous 45 years. We \nalways had it because of the provisions of the bill which are so \nimportant--the pay and benefits and the support of not only our troops \nbut also their families.\n  When the Senator from Arizona made reference to the Wounded Warriors \nlegislation, I know our Presiding Officer, Senator McCaskill, because \nof her active role and participation in that legislation, understands \nprecisely what we\n\n[[Page S11638]]\n\nare saying. That legislation is so important that it is not only in the \nbill but it is in a separate bill which was passed that is now \nawaiting, hopefully, a resolution between the Senate and the House. But \nin any event, the Senator is correct, the presence of that legislation \nin this bill may be the greatest assurance we have that legislation is \ngoing to become law. There are a lot of reasons, hundreds of reasons, \nwhy we need this authorization bill passed. That is surely one of the \nmost important ones, one that has had the support of so many of our \nMembers. So many of our Members and our Veterans' Affairs Committee \nhave been so active with that legislation as well.\n  I join in the comments of my good friend from Arizona and hope our \ncolleagues will come to the floor now. We can take up matters. We can \nget unanimous consent. We can even set aside pending matters. There are \nthings we can do this afternoon. I do hope our colleagues will come to \nthe floor and give their speeches on habeas corpus or other subjects.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today in the course of this \nDefense authorization bill to discuss an amendment which I am working \non and preparing to offer. It is an important amendment to this bill. \nIt is a critically important amendment for our Nation. It is an \namendment known as the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act is a narrowly tailored bipartisan measure that I have \nsponsored with Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Republican \nSenator Dick Lugar of Indiana, and in past years with Senator Orrin \nHatch of Utah. It would give a select group of students in America a \nchance to become permanent residents only if they came to this country \nas children, are long-term U.S. residents, have good moral character, \nand enlist in the military or attend college for at least 2 years. The \nDREAM Act is supported by a large coalition in the Senate, and also by \nmilitary leaders, religious leaders, and educators from across the \npolitical spectrum and around the country.\n  During the 109th Congress, the DREAM Act was adopted unanimously as \nan amendment to the immigration reform legislation that passed in the \nSenate. In the 108th Congress, the DREAM Act was the only immigration \nreform proposal reported to the Senate floor on a bipartisan 16-to-3 \nvote by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Now, obviously, in the midst of the Defense authorization bill, some \npeople question why one might bring up an immigration issue. The answer \nis simple: The DREAM Act would address a very serious recruitment \ncrisis facing our military. Under the DREAM Act, tens of thousands of \nwell-qualified potential recruits would become eligible for military \nservice for the first time. They are eager to serve in the armed \nservices, and under the DREAM Act, they would have a very strong \nincentive to enlist because it would give them a path to permanent \nlegal status.\n  First, let us look at the recruitment crisis we face today. Largely \ndue to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army is struggling to meet \nrecruitment quotas. Because of these recruitment difficulties, the Army \nis accepting more applicants who are high school dropouts, have low \nscores on military aptitude tests, and, unfortunately, have criminal \nbackgrounds.\n  The statistics tell the story. In 2006, almost 40 percent of Army \nrecruits had below-average scores on the military aptitude test. That \nis the highest rate of students with low scores since 1985. In 2006, \nalmost 20 percent of Army recruits did not have a high school degree. \nThis is the highest rate of high school dropouts enlisting in the Army \nsince 1981. By comparison, from 1984 to 2004, 90 percent or more of \nArmy recruits had high school diplomas. Why does this matter? The Army \nsaid itself that high school graduation is the best single predictor of \n``stick-to-itiveness'' that is required to succeed in the military and \nin life.\n  Charles Moskos, a Northwestern University sociologist, is an expert \nin military culture, and he says:\n\n       The more dropouts who enlist, the more discipline problems \n     the Army is likely to have.\n\n  Even more disturbing, the number of so-called moral waivers for Army \nrecruits who have committed crimes has increased by 65 percent in the \nlast 3 years, from 4,918 in 2003 to 8,129 in 2006. Many of these \nwaivers are for serious crimes--aggravated assault, burglary, robbery, \nand even vehicular homicide. In fact, individuals with criminal \nbackgrounds were 11.7 percent of the 2006 recruiting class. Now, in \ncontrast, under the DREAM Act, all recruits would be well-qualified \nhigh school graduates with good moral character.\n  Let me tell you how the DREAM Act would work. Currently, our \nimmigration laws prevent thousands of young people from pursuing their \ndreams and really becoming part of America's future. Their parents \nbrought these children to the United States when they were under the \nage of 16. For many, it is the only home they know. They are fully \nassimilated into American society. They really don't want much more \nthan just to be Americans and to have a chance to succeed. They have \nbeaten the odds all of their young lives. The kids who would be helped \nby the DREAM Act face a high school dropout rate among undocumented \nimmigrants of 50 percent. So it is a 50-50 chance that they would even \nqualify to be part of this act.\n  Incidentally, the dropout rate for legal immigrants is 21 percent and \nfor native-born Americans, 11 percent. So already these young people \nwould have to beat the odds and graduate from high school to even \nqualify to be considered.\n  They have also demonstrated the kind of determination and commitment \nthat makes them successful students and points the way to significant \ncontributions they will make in their lives. They are junior ROTC \nleaders, honor roll students, and valedictorians. They are tomorrow's \nsoldiers, doctors, nurses, teachers, Senators, and Congressmen.\n  Over the years, I have had a chance to meet a lot of these DREAM Act \nkids. That is what they call themselves, incidentally. Let me give you \none example. Oscar Vasquez was brought to Phoenix, AZ, by his parents \nwhen he was 12 years old. He spent his high school years in Junior ROTC \nand dreamed of one day enlisting in the U.S. military. At the end of \nhis junior year, the recruiting officer told Oscar he was ineligible \nfor military service because he was undocumented. He was devastated.\n  But he found another outlet for his talent. Oscar, because of the \nhelp of two energetic science teachers, was enrolled in a college \ndivision robot competition sponsored by the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration. With three other undocumented students, Oscar \nworked for months in a windowless storage room in his high school and \ntested their invention at a scuba training pool on the weekends. \nCompeting against students from MIT and other top universities, Oscar's \nteam won first place in this robot competition.\n  Oscar has since graduated from high school. You know what he does? He \nis not in the military. He is not using his scientific skills. He is an \nundocumented person in America. He hangs sheetrock for a living. It is \nthe best job he could get without a college education or the \nopportunity to enlist in the military. He wants to save his money in \nhopes that someday--just someday--the door will open and give him a \nchance to be part of this Nation, the only Nation he has really ever \nknown. Couldn't we use his talent? Couldn't the military use someone \nlike Oscar? The DREAM Act would help students just like him. It is \ndesigned to assist only a select group of students who would be \nrequired to earn their way to legal status.\n  Now, the fundamental premise of the DREAM Act is that we shouldn't \npunish children for the mistakes their parents made. That isn't the \nAmerican way. The DREAM Act says to these students: America is going to \ngive you a chance. It won't be easy, but you can earn your way into \nlegal status. We will give you the opportunity if you meet the \nfollowing requirements: if you came to the United States when you were \n15 years old or younger, if you\n\n[[Page S11639]]\n\nhave lived here at least 5 years, are of good moral character, and you \ngraduate from high school and then serve in the military or attend \ncollege for at least 2 years.\n  The DREAM Act doesn't mandate military service. There is a college \noption. A student who is otherwise eligible could earn legal status \nthat way. It would be inconsistent with the spirit of our volunteer \nmilitary to force young people to enlist as a condition for obtaining \nlegal status, but the DREAM Act creates strong incentives for military \nservice.\n  Many DREAM Act kids come from a demographic group that is already \npredisposed to serve the United States in the military. A 2004 survey \nby the RAND Corporation found that 45 percent of Hispanic males and 31 \npercent of Hispanic females between ages 16 and 21 were very likely to \nserve in the Armed Forces, compared to 24 percent of White males and 10 \npercent of White females.\n  It is important to note that immigrants have an outstanding tradition \nof service in the military. There are currently 35,000 noncitizens \nserving in the military and about 8,000 more will enlist each year. \nThese are not citizens; they are legal residents who are willing to \nserve our country.\n  I have met them. The second trip I made to Iraq was to a Marine Corps \nbase west of Baghdad. They lined up a group of young marines from \nIllinois to whom I could say hello. It was a hot and dusty day. They \nstood there waiting for this Senator to show up. The last one of them \nin line was a young Hispanic man from Chicago named Jesus. Jesus had \nwith him a brown envelope. He said: Senator, I would like to ask you a \nfavor. He said: I enlisted in the Marines and I am glad to be a marine, \nbut the one thing I would like to do someday is to vote. I am not a \ncitizen and, he said, I need a chance. He said: I hope you can help me \nget a chance to become a U.S. citizen.\n  I said to myself, what more could we ask of this young man? He \nvolunteered for the U.S. Marine Corps to go to a battle zone and risk \nhis life for America.\n  I listen to speeches on the floor here. My friend from Alabama, \nSenator Sessions, comes to the floor on a regular basis and criticizes \nthe DREAM Act. He criticizes this bill that would give young people who \nare undocumented and graduate from high school, of good moral \ncharacter, without a criminal background, who want to serve our Nation \nin the military on their path to becoming legal. He criticizes this \nbill. He calls it amnesty.\n  Do you know what, an amnesty is a giveaway. Amnesty is a card to pass \n``Go'' and collect $200 in America. Do you think those who would \nvolunteer for the military, who are willing to risk their lives for our \ncountry, are going to receive amnesty? Is this a gift? It is a gift to \nAmerica that they are willing to risk their lives for our country. It \nis a gift to America that once having served, they will come back as \nproud Americans, voting and living in this country. It is a gift to \nAmerica that they will use their skills and talent to make this a \ngreater nation. For my colleagues to come to the floor and call this \namnesty is to, in some ways, denigrate the fantastic sacrifice these \nyoung people would be willing to make, who serve in the military to \nbecome citizens.\n  I will concede this is not the only path to citizenship under this \nDREAM Act. Those who finish 2 years of college would also have a \nchance. I think that is only fair. To make this contingent only on \nmilitary service I think would create a situation which is not \nconsistent with a volunteer military. I hate to see us lose these young \nmen and women who want to be part of America and are willing to risk \ntheir lives for that opportunity.\n  A recent study by the Center for Naval Analysis concluded ``non-\ncitizens have high rates of success while serving in the military--they \nare far more likely, for example, to fulfill their enlistment \nobligations than their U.S.-born counterparts.''\n  The study also concluded there are additional benefits to enlisting \nnoncitizens. For example, noncitizens ``are more diverse than citizen \nrecruits--not just racially and ethnically, but also linguistically and \nculturally. This diversity is particularly valuable as the United \nStates faces the challenges of the global war on terrorism.''\n  The DREAM Act is not just the right thing to do; it would be good for \nAmerica. The DREAM Act would allow a generation of immigrants with \ngreat potential and ambitions to contribute to the military and other \nsectors of American society.\n  I am not just speaking for myself here, as the sponsor of this \nlegislation. The Department of Defense recognizes it, and we have \nworked with them. Bill Carr, the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for \nMilitary Personnel Policy, recently said the DREAM Act is ``very \nappealing'' to the military because it would apply to the ``cream of \nthe crop'' of students, in his words. Mr. Carr concluded the DREAM Act \nwould be ``good for [military] readiness.''\n  On the Defense authorization bill, I don't believe it is unusual or \nimproper for us to consider a bill that a leader in the Department of \nDefense said would be good for military readiness.\n  Last year at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the \ncontributions of immigrants to the military, David Chu, the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, said:\n\n       There are an estimated 50,000 to 65,000 undocumented alien \n     young adults who entered the United States at an early age \n     and graduate from high school each year, many of whom are \n     bright, energetic and potentially interested in military \n     service. They include many who participated in high school \n     Junior ROTC programs. Under current law, these young people \n     are not eligible to enlist in the military . . . Yet many of \n     these young people may wish to join the military, and have \n     the attributes needed--education, aptitude, fitness and moral \n     qualifications. . . .\n\n  The Under Secretary went on to say:\n\n        . . . the DREAM Act would provide these young people the \n     opportunity of serving the United States in uniform.\n\n  Military experts agree. Margaret Stock, a professor at West Point, \nsaid:\n\n       Passage of the DREAM Act would be highly beneficial to the \n     U.S. military. The DREAM Act promises to enlarge dramatically \n     the pool of highly qualified recruits for the U.S. Armed \n     Forces . . . passage of this bill could well solve the Armed \n     Forces enlistment recruiting woes.\n\n  Do you know what we are offering to young people now to enlist in our \nmilitary? For many of them, a $10,000 cash bonus, right out of high \nschool, if they will enlist in the military. And if they will show up \nwithin 6 weeks, we double it to $20,000, the largest cash incentive we \nhave ever offered. These young people aren't looking for a cash \nincentive. All they want is a chance to fight for America, to defend \nour country and to become part of our Nation's future.\n  Conservative military scholar Max Boot agrees. When asked about the \nDREAM Act, he said:\n\n       It's a substantial pool of people and I think it's crazy we \n     are not tapping into it.\n\n  These experts are right. The DREAM Act kids are ideal recruits. They \nare high school graduates, they have good moral character, and they \ndesperately want to serve America. At the time when the military has \nbeen forced to unfortunately lower many of its standards to meet \nrecruitment targets, we should not underestimate the significance of \nthese young people as a national security asset.\n  This is the choice the DREAM Act presents us. We can allow a \ngeneration of immigrant students with great potential and ambition to \ncontribute more to America, or give them the future of living in the \nshadows, uncertain about what they can do, uncertain about where life \nwill lead them.\n  I am going to urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I \nhope they will, for a moment, pause and reflect. There have been a lot \nof things said about immigration during the course of this debate. I \nlook back on this issue as one who doesn't come to it objectively. I am \nthe son of an immigrant. My mother came to this country as a young girl \nat the age of 2 from Lithuania. Her naturalization certificate sits \nbehind my desk upstairs. She became a naturalized citizen at the age of \n25. She lived long enough to see me sworn into the Senate, and I was so \nproud of that day and so proud to be a Senator from the State of \nIllinois.\n  I believe in immigration. I believe the diversity of America is our \nstrength; that Black, White, and Brown, from every corner of this Earth \nwe have come together to create something no nation on Earth can rival.\n  There are those who will always see immigration differently, those \nwho\n\n[[Page S11640]]\n\nwill question it, and those who will be critical. For those people, I \nask them to step back and take an honest look at this. Step back and \ntake an honest look at these young people, meet them, sit down with \nthem, as I have. They will bring tears to your eyes when they talk to \nyou about how hard they are working to make it in this country. They \ndon't get many of the breaks which other kids get, but they keep on \ntrying.\n  One of my friends is getting his graduate degree in microbiology at \nthe University of Chicago. He keeps going to school because, as he \nsaid: Senator, I don't know what to do when I get out of school. I am \nnot a legal American. I am undocumented. My dream is to work for a \npharmaceutical company, to do medical research one day. Can we afford \nto let him go? Can we afford to turn our back on what he will bring to \nAmerica?\n  It is interesting to me, before the end of this year we are likely to \ndebate H-1B visas. The debate behind H-1B visas is that we don't have a \nlarge talent pool in America. We need to bring the best and brightest \nfrom India, from Asia, from Africa, and from Europe. We need to bring \nthem in so our companies in America, starved for talent, that can't \nfind it here, could find it in these visa holders coming in from \nforeign countries. We will let them work for 3 years or 6 years. Some \nthem may try to stay. Some of them will go home.\n  But if we are at a point where we don't have a large enough talent \npool in America, can we honestly say that these young people, the \npeople who would be benefitted by the DREAM Act, are a talent we can \nwaste? I don't think so.\n  Just last year I was eating in a restaurant in Chicago. It is a \npretty famous breakfast place called Ann Suther's. Tom Tully is an \nalderman for the city of Chicago, and his family owns the restaurant. \nHe introduced me to a young man with an apron on. He called him Juan \nand he said: Juan, come over and meet the Senator. He explained to me \nthat Juan, who came to this country illegally, was allowed to stay and \nbecome a citizen under the amnesty that was offered by President Reagan \n20 years ago. Juan went on to get an engineering degree and went on to \nwork with an engineering firm, but because he remembers that this \nrestaurant offered him a chance to wash dishes when nobody else would \ngive him a job, he shows up every once in a while on a Saturday and \nworks for a few hours for nothing, just to be around his old friends.\n  Those are heart-warming stories and there are many of them out there. \nI know there are people who seriously question whether immigration can \nbe debated successfully on the floor of the Senate. I am hoping it can \nbe and I am hoping my colleagues on the Democratic side and the \nRepublican side will join me in this bipartisan effort for these young \npeople, to give them a chance to serve and a chance to excel. It will \nmake their lives better and make America a better nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  (The remarks fo Mr. Conrad and Mr. Gregg pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2063 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements of Inroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, let me say I applaud both \nof the Senators who are working in an exemplary way to try to achieve \nsomething that is very difficult to achieve. I applaud them for their \neffort.\n  Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is amendment No. 2022 \noffered by the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nset the pending amendment aside for the purpose of considering my \namendment No. 2271 and then to revert back to this pending amendment. \nIt is my understanding that this amendment is one of 10 amendments that \nis going to be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am constrained to object on behalf of \nthe managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion since \nlast week when MoveOn.org, with a very liberal antiwar stance--which we \nunderstand has been their position for quite some time, raising \nmillions of dollars for various Democratic Party candidates--ran an ad. \nUp until the September 10 ad in the New York Times calling General \nPetraeus ``General Betray Us,'' MoveOn.org seemed to be in line with \nthe Democrat's public statements supporting the troops but opposing the \nwar.\n  It is my understanding my good friend, the junior Senator from Texas, \nis going to be having a resolution that will be coming up shortly. I \nwant a chance to talk a little bit about that resolution.\n  I believe that MoveOn.org's ad crossed the line by attacking the \ncharacter and integrity of America's top military leader in Iraq.\n  General Petraeus is a man of honor, honesty, and integrity. He is a \nWest Point graduate. He has held leadership positions in airborne, \nmechanized, and air assault infantry units in Europe and the United \nStates, including command of a battalion in the 101st Airborne \nDivision, as well as a brigade in the 82nd Airborne Division.\n  He was the aide to the Chief of Staff of the Army; battalion, \nbrigade, and division operations officer; he has done it all. He was \nthe Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  He was the top graduate--not one of the top graduates, but the top \ngraduate--of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. He earned \nM.P.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Princeton University. We are talking \nabout a Ph.D. from Princeton University. This is not an ordinary \nofficer. This is a man with incredible credentials.\n  He has won multiple awards and decorations, including being \nrecognized by US News & World Report as one of America's 25 best \nleaders in the year 2005.\n  He is our top military commander in Iraq and commander of the Multi-\nNational Force-Iraq, confirmed by the Senate as the right man for the \njob. He was confirmed, I might add, unanimously by the Senate.\n  The very day General Petraeus sat before Congress to offer his latest \nreport, MoveOn.org ran a full-page ad in the New York Times attacking \nhis message before they even heard his message.\n  The ad accused General Petraeus of ``Cooking the Books for the White \nHouse'' and called him ``a military man constantly at war with the \nfacts.'' Their shameless attack on his character did not stop there. \nThey accused him of being a traitor, calling him ``General Betray Us.''\n  Well, anyway, MoveOn.org's attempt to discredit General Petraeus is \ndeplorable, and I join with other Members of the Senate in condemning \nits actions.\n  I have no issue with news agencies or individuals offering and \ndebating opposing views. That is what we do on this floor every day. \nHowever, MoveOn.org crossed the line when they ran the ad attacking the \nmotives and honor of our No. 1 commander on the ground in Iraq.\n  I support Senator Lieberman's condemnation of MoveOn.org's attempt at \ncharacter assassination, and I call on them to retract their scurrilous \nad with another full-page ad apologizing for their error in judgment. \nBut they would not do it. You know they would not do it. Still, we can \ntry. They don't have the character to do it.\n\n  While no American is above scrutiny, this was clearly a calculated \nmove on the part of this organization to undermine the noble efforts of \nthis patriot to execute his duties that we in Congress unanimously sent \nhim to accomplish.\n  It amazes me how far some will go to root for American failure in \nIraq. MoveOn.org clearly placed their political agenda ahead of the \nbest interests of the United States and particularly the men and women \nof the military when they chose to run that ad.\n\n[[Page S11641]]\n\n  Now, something interesting happened. A reporter from the Washington \nPost came up with this, did a little research. According to the \ndirector of public relations for the New York Times, the open rate for \nan ad of that size and type is $181,000. According to a September 14 \nWashington Post article, the New York Times dramatically slashed its \nnormal rates for the full-page ad.\n  A spokesman for MoveOn.org confirmed to the Post they paid only \n$65,000 for the ad. The Post reporter called the Times advertising \ndepartment without identifying himself and was quoted a price of \n$167,000 for a full-page black-and-white ad on a Monday. The New York \nTimes refused to offer any explanation for why the paper would give \nthem a rate one-third of their published rate.\n  Now, my first visit to Iraq was in August of 2003, and my latest \nvisit was on the August 30, 2007. The Iraq I saw last time is not the \nIraq I visited in 2003. I would like to say also that between those \nyears I have actually been to the Iraqi AOR, area of operations, some \n15 times. During that period of time I have seen these things.\n  I knew what General Petraeus was going to say when he came here last \nweek because I was with him a few days before that. I read General \nPetraeus's and Ambassador Crocker's prepared statements and listened \nintently to their testimonies. I compared their assessment with the \nassessments I have made over the past 4 years visiting Iraq. It appears \nour assessments are based on similar events that have occurred in Iraq.\n  I watched Ramadi as it changed. You might remember a year ago they \nclaimed Ramadi was going to become the terrorist capital of the world. \nRamadi is now totally secured.\n  I visited Fallujah. I have been there several times. I was there \nduring all the elections. I watched those Iraqi security forces go and \nvote. I watched the American marines go door to door World War II \nstyle. Fallujah now--which was the hotbed in Anbar Province of Iraq--is \nnow under total security, and not with U.S. forces but with Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  I visited Patrol Base Murray, south of Baghdad, and met with local \nIraqis who came forward and established provisional units of \nneighborhood security volunteers. These individuals heard the Americans \nwere coming and were there and cheering, waiting for them to arrive.\n  I watched these Neighborhood Watch and Concerned Citizens groups take \nroot in Anbar Province and slowly make their way to other cities \nspreading across Iraq--local civilians willing to stand up and take \nback their neighborhoods, their cities, and province.\n  Citizens are marking IEDs with orange paint--undetonated IEDs and \nPRGs--identifying al-Qaida in their towns and testifying against them. \nIt is something that was not happening a few months before or prior to \nthe surge. They are guarding critical infrastructure and working side \nby side with the U.S. forces.\n  I saw the anti-American messages at the mosques. Our intelligence \ngoes into the mosques for each of their weekly meetings. Up through \nDecember of this past year, they averaged that 85 percent of the \nmessages were anti-American messages. Since April of this year, there \nhave been no anti-American messages. I guess I learned something that \nno one else seems to agree with; that is, we spend entirely too much \ntime talking about the political leaders, when the religious leaders \nare the ones responsible for these major changes. These are the ones \nwho are standing in the mosques and talking about Americans and the \ncoalition forces as their allies, not as adversaries, as they were \nbefore.\n  I visited the Joint Security Stations in Baghdad. It used to be our \nkids would go out on a mission during the daytime, and they would come \nback at night to the green zone. They do not do that anymore. These \nJoint Security Stations--even as to the report that came in, our goal \nwas to have 34, and there are now 32 of those Joint Security Stations. \nThese guys go out, and instead of coming back, they sit and become \nfriends with the Iraqis and actually sleep in the homes of the Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  I watched the surge operations take effect, visited a former al-Qaida \nsanctuary, and saw a strengthening of Iraqi forces resulting in an \nincrease in burden sharing.\n  I observed a steady decrease in the number of attacks in Anbar from \n40 to less than 10 a day.\n  I visited the markets. There is a lot of talk about that. A lot of \npeople go and visit the markets with all kinds of protection. I went to \nthe markets without any protection, and I talked, through an \ninterpreter, to people. I picked out people holding babies, and they \nwere all glad to see us.\n  I met with U.S. and coalition leaders and commanders, Iraqi leaders \nand commanders, and local civilian groups on each trip.\n  I watched the political, economic, and diplomatic growth over time. \nIt has been uneven and frustrating, but it has been a movement in the \nright direction.\n  I guess the bottom line is Iraq is achieving progress. No one can \ndebate that. It is not just General Petraeus. It is what the Iraqis \nsay. It is what they are saying, the religious leaders and the \npolitical leaders. It is happening, happening since the surge. The \nsurge is clearly working.\n  The coalition forces are handing back control of Iraq to the Iraqis \nand to the Iraqi security forces. Local leaders who want better lives \nfor their people are bravely standing up and rejecting the fatalist, \ncynical, and hate-filled diet fed to them by al-Qaida and other \nextremists.\n  Iraqis are realizing that al-Qaida does not offer a long-term vision \nof hope or an opportunity for them any more than it would for the \naverage Californian or New Yorker or Oklahoman.\n  A backlash and rebellion against al-Qaida has been going on over the \nlast 6 months in places such as Anbar Province and Babil Province south \nof Baghdad. When the tribal leaders and clerics in Anbar made the \nconscious decision to reject al-Qaida, they virtually overnight \ntransformed their province into a model for the rest of the country to \nemulate. The ``concerned citizens'' of Babil Province--I was there--\nrecognized the progress made in Anbar and decided they wanted to do the \nsame thing. So it is spreading. It is spreading into areas even up \ntoward Tikrit, the hometown of Saddam Hussein.\n  So al-Qaida understands the importance of the collective American \nwill when it comes to prosecuting the war on terror. They understand \nthey have absolutely no chance of winning this war over the long run \nmilitarily. They understand their only chance of achieving victory is \nto get the American people to call for a withdrawal. If we pull out of \nthe fight, they win. There is no other way to characterize it. This is \na strategic military objective for them. Like with any military \nobjective, they have developed a tactic to achieve it. Their tactic in \nthis case is to tear away the American will to win by committing \nhorrific and brutal attacks against innocent victims. They understand \nthat Americans agonize over the pictures and the news reports of those \natrocities.\n  Let there be no doubt about it, our will as Americans to fight for \nfreedom and democracy around the world is under attack by a brutal and \nruthless enemy. That enemy would be emboldened by a victory in Iraq. \nIraq would become a safe haven for terrorists and extremists from which \nthey can launch their wicked atrocities around the world.\n  We could accept the offer of Iran's President to step in and fill the \nvacuum. He has clearly said: If the Americans pull out, we go in. \nHowever, this offer comes from a man who has vowed the extermination of \nthe Jewish State of Israel, and he has vowed to expand his nuclear \nprogram and clearly puts us in jeopardy of being held hostage.\n  It is not in the American ethic to turn our back on people who are \nstriving for a better way of life for their children. It is not in our \nnational interest to leave a failed Iraqi State.\n  The surge is working, largely due to the leadership of one great \nAmerican--GEN David Petraeus. MoveOn.Org should just once retreat from \ntheir attack on America and apologize to that great American hero, GEN \nDavid Petraeus.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11642]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I see Senator Specter on the floor. I ask \nunanimous consent that after Senator Specter is recognized, if Senator \nGraham is on the floor, he be recognized for debate only on the bill, \nand then that Senator Chambliss be recognized, if he is on the floor, \nfor debate only, and that then the Senate proceed to a period of \nmorning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe amendment to restore the constitutional right of habeas corpus--an \namendment that is pending before the Senate and will be voted on \ntomorrow morning at 10:30 on a motion to invoke cloture.\n  The issue of the availability of habeas corpus for the detainees at \nGuantanamo is a matter of enormous importance. It is a matter of a \nfundamental constitutional right that people should not be held in \ndetention unless there is an evidentiary reason to do so, or at least \nsome showing that the person ought to be in detention. It is a \nconstitutional right that has existed since the Magna Carta in 1215, \nand it has been upheld in a series of cases in the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  In the decision of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Justice O'Connor, speaking for \na plurality, said that they ``all agree that, absent suspension, the \nwrit of habeas corpus remains available to every individual detained \nwithin the United States.'' What Justice O'Connor was referring to was \nthe express constitutional provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 2, \nthat habeas corpus may not be suspended except in time of invasion or \nrebellion. Obviously, if there cannot be a suspension of the writ of \nhabeas corpus, there is a provision in that clause recognizing the \nexistence of the constitutional right of habeas corpus. You cannot \nsuspend a right that doesn't exist.\n  As amplified by Justice Stevens, in the case of Rasul v. Bush, the \nstatutory right to habeas corpus applies to those held at the United \nStates Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Although Guantanamo Bay is \nnot within the territory of the United States, it is under the complete \njurisdiction and control of the United States.\n  In that case, Justice Stevens noted that ``application of the [writ \nof] habeas corpus to persons detained at the base is consistent with \nthe historical reach of the writ of habeas corpus. At common law, \ncourts exercised habeas jurisdiction over the claims of aliens detained \nwithin sovereign territory of the realm, as well as the claims of \npersons detained in the so-called `exempt jurisdiction,' where ordinary \nwrits did not run, and all other dominions under the sovereign's \ncontrol.'' That is obviously a conclusive statement of the Supreme \nCourt that in Guantanamo, under the control of the United States, the \nwrit of habeas corpus would apply in accordance with the historic reach \nof habeas corpus under the common law. Although Justice Stevens wrote \nas to statutory habeas, his historic analysis implicates the right to \nhabeas under the common law and the Constitution\n  Justice Stevens went on to point out:\n\n       Habeas corpus is, however [citing from Williams v. Kaiser] \n     ``a writ antecedent to statute, . . . throwing its root deep \n     into the genius of our common law.''\n\n  And continuing, he said that the writ had ``received explicit \nrecognition in the Constitution, which forbids suspension of `[t]he \nPrivilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus . . . unless when in Cases of \nRebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.' ''\n  Obviously, the exceptions--Rebellion or Invasion--do not apply in the \nGuantanamo situation.\n  Justice Stevens went on to say:\n\n       [A]t its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has \n     served as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive \n     detention, and it is in that context that its protections \n     have been strongest.\n\n  Justice Stevens then went on to note this--referring to the opinion \nof Justice Jackson, concurring in the result in the case of Brown v. \nAllen:\n\n       The historic purpose of the writ has been to relieve \n     detention by executive authorities without judicial trial.\n\n  And he goes on to say:\n\n       Executive imprisonment has been considered oppressive and \n     lawless since John, at Runnymede, pledged that no free man \n     should be imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, or exiled save \n     by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land. The \n     judges of England developed the writ of habeas corpus largely \n     to preserve these immunities from executive restraint.\n\n  Going on, Justice Stevens pointed out:\n\n       Consistent with the historic purpose of the writ, this \n     Court has recognized the federal court's power to review \n     applications for habeas corpus in a wide variety of cases \n     involving Executive detention, in wartime as well as in times \n     of peace.\n\n  In a very curious decision, in Boumediene v. Bush, the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia ignored the historic common law \nanalysis of the Rasul case in concluding that the Supreme Court's \ndecision was based solely upon the statutory provision for habeas \ncorpus. The Boumediene court reasoned that Rasul could be changed by an \nact of Congress, the Military Commissions Act, which was passed in \n2006. In that case, instead of looking to Rasul, as noted in the New \nYork Times article by Adam Liptak on March 5 of this year, the \nBoumediene court looked to case law decided before Rasul. Liptak points \nout:\n\n       Instead of looking to Rasul, which was recent and concerned \n     Guantanamo, the appeals court, reverting to the Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia, justified its decision \n     by citing a 1950 Supreme Court decision, Johnson v. \n     Eisentrager. That case involved German citizens convicted of \n     war crimes in China and held at a prison in Germany. The \n     court ruled that they had no right to habeas corpus.\n\n  Liptak points out the inapplicability of the Eisentrager case, \nstating:\n\n       The Court's reliance on Eisentrager was curious. Both \n     Antonin Scalia, dissenting in Rasul, and John Yu, an \n     architect of the Bush administration's post-9/11 legal \n     strategy, have written that they understood Rasul to have \n     overruled Eisentrager.\n\n  The Boumediene decision seemed to ignore the finding in Rasul that \nthe Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay fell within the jurisdiction and \ncontrol of the United States. If detainees at Guantanamo Bay fall \nwithin United States jurisdiction, as Rasul found, the aliens held at \nGuantanamo have a greater claim to habeas corpus rights. For example, \nCourts have held that aliens within the United States cannot be denied \nhabeas corpus without violating the Suspension Clause.\n  Following its discussion of Rasul and Eisentrager, the Boumediene \ndecision relied upon the proceedings in the Combatant Status Review \nTribunals which, realistically viewed, are totally insufficient. The \nprocedures of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were taken up by \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in a case \ncaptioned: In re Guantanamo Detainees Cases, 355 F.Supp.2d 443 (2005).\n  Beginning on page 468 of the opinion, the district court noted a \nproceeding in the Combatant Status Review Tribunal where an individual \nwas accused of associating with al-Qaida personnel. The court noted:\n\n       ``. . . [T]he Recorder of the [Combatant Status Review \n     Tribunal] asserted, `While living in Bosnia, the Detainee \n     associated with a known Al Qaida operative.' ''\n\n  The detainee then said:\n\n       ``Give me his name.''\n\n  The Tribunal President said:\n\n       ``I do not know.''\n\n  The detainee then said:\n\n       ``How can I respond to this?''\n\n  The detainee went on to say:\n\n       ``. . . I asked the interrogators to tell me who \n     this person was. Then I could tell you if I might have known \n     this person, but not if this person is a terrorist. Maybe I \n     knew this person as a friend. Maybe it was a person that \n     worked with me. Maybe it was a person that was on my team. \n     But I do not know if this person is Bosnian, Indian or \n     whatever. If you tell me the name, then I can respond and \n     defend myself against this accusation.''\n\n  Later in the court's opinion, the detainee is quoted to the following \neffect:\n\n       ``That is it, but I was hoping you had evidence that you \n     can give me. If I was in your\n\n[[Page S11643]]\n\n     place--and I apologize in advance for these words--but if a \n     supervisor came to me and showed me accusations like these, I \n     would take these accusations and I would hit him in the face \n     with them.''\n\n  And at that, everyone in the tribunal room burst into laughter.\n  This is illustrative of what goes on in the Combatant Status Review \nTribunals. They charge someone with being an associate of al-Qaida, but \nthey cannot even give the person a name.\n  There was a very informative declaration filed by Stephen Abraham \nabout what goes on in a Combatant Status Review Tribunal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks this declaration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Colonel Abraham identified himself as a lieutenant \ncolonel in the U.S. Army Reserves who served as a member of a Combatant \nStatus Review Tribunal and had an opportunity to observe and \nparticipate in the CSRT process.\n  Among other things, Colonel Abraham points out:\n\n       On one occasion, I was assigned to a CSRT panel with two \n     other officers. . . .We reviewed evidence presented to us \n     regarding the recommended status of a detainee. All of us \n     found the information presented to lack substance.\n       What were purported to be specific statements of fact \n     lacked even the most fundamental earmarks of objectively \n     credible evidence. Statements allegedly made by percipient \n     witnesses lacked detail. Reports presented generalized \n     statements in indirect and passive forms without stating any \n     source of the information or providing a basis for \n     establishing the reliability or the credibility of the \n     source. Statements of interrogators presented to the panel \n     offered inferences from which we were expected to draw \n     conclusions favoring a finding of ``enemy combatant'' but \n     that, upon even limited questioning from the panel, yielded \n     the response from the Recorder, ``We'll have to get back to \n     you.'' The personal representative did not participate in any \n     meaningful way.\n       On the basis of the paucity and weakness of the information \n     provided both during and after the CSRT hearing, we \n     determined that there was no factual basis for concluding \n     that the individual should be classified as an enemy \n     combatant.\n\n  The details of Colonel Abraham's statement are very much in line with \nthe opinion of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in \nthe matter captioned: In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases. They had charges \nbut presented absolutely no information. Consequently, there can be no \ncontention that Combatant Status Review Tribunals are an adequate and \neffective alternative approach to Federal court habeas corpus. There \nmust be a type of review which presents a fair opportunity for \ndetermination as to whether there was any basis to hold a detainee. For \nsuch a purpose, Combatant Status Review Tribunals are totally \ninadequate.\n  It is for that reason that I urge my colleagues to legislate in the \npending Department of Defense authorization bill to reinstate the \nstatutory right of habeas corpus. It is my judgment that the Supreme \nCourt of the United States will act on the case now pending there to \nuphold the constitutional right, disagreeing with the decision of the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Boumediene v. Bush.\n  Initially, the U.S. Supreme Court had denied to take certiorari in \nthe case, and it was curious because Justice Stevens did not vote for \ncert. where three other Justices had. But then after the declaration by \nColonel Abraham was filed on a petition for rehearing, which required \nfive affirmative votes by Supreme Court Justices, the petition for \nrehearing was granted, and the Supreme Court of the United States now \nhas that case.\n  I have filed a brief as amicus curiae in the case, urging the Supreme \nCourt to overrule the District of Columbia case and to uphold the \ndecision in Rasul v. Bush, which holds that there is a statutory right \nto habeas corpus and that is rooted in historic common law that \npredates the Constitution, tracing its roots to the Magna Carta with \nJohn at Runnymede in 1215. But pending any action by the Supreme Court \nof the United States, which is not by any means certain, \nnotwithstanding my own view that the Supreme Court will reaffirm Rasul \nand reverse the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia's ruling \nin Boumediene, the Congress should now alter the statutory provision in \n2006 and make it clear that the statutory right to habeas corpus \napplies to Guantanamo because of the total inadequacy of the fairness \nof the procedures under the Combatant Status Review Tribunal.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Declaration of Stephen Abraham\n\n\n             Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army Reserve\n\n       I, Stephen Abraham, hereby declare as follows:\n       1. I am a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army \n     Reserve, having been commissioned in 1981 as an officer in \n     Intelligence Corps. I have served as an intelligence officer \n     from 1982 to the present during periods of both reserve and \n     active duty, including mobilization in 1990 (``Operation \n     Desert Storm'') and twice again following 9-11. In my \n     civilian occupation, I am an attorney with the law firm Fink \n     & Abraham LLP in Newport Beach, California.\n       2. This declaration responds to certain statements in the \n     Declaration of Rear Admiral (Retired) James M. McGarrah \n     (``McGarrah Dec.''), filed in Bismullah v. Gates, No. 06-1197 \n     (D.C. Cir.). This declaration is limited to unclassified \n     matters specifically related to the procedures employed by \n     Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of \n     Enemy Combatants (``OARDEC'') and the Combatant Status Review \n     Tribunals (``CSRTs'') rather than to any specific information \n     gathered or used in a particular case, except as noted \n     herein. The contents of this declaration are based solely on \n     my personal observations and experiences as a member of \n     OARDEC. Nothing in this declaration is intended to reflect or \n     represent the official opinions of the Department of Defense \n     or the Department of the Army.\n       3. From September 11, 2004 to March 9, 2005, I was on \n     active duty and assigned to OARDEC. Rear Admiral McGarrah \n     served as the Director of OARDEC during the entirety of my \n     assignment.\n       4. While assigned to OARDEC, in addition to other duties, I \n     worked as an agency liaison, responsible for coordinating \n     with government agencies, including certain Department of \n     Defense (``DoD'') and non-DoD organizations, to gather or \n     validate information relating to detainees for use in CSRTs. \n     I also served as a member of a CSRT, and had the opportunity \n     to observe and participate in the operation of the CSRT \n     process.\n       5. As stated in the McGarrah Dec., the information \n     comprising the Government Information and the Government \n     Evidence was not compiled personally by the CSRT Recorder, \n     but by other individuals in OARDEC. The vast majority of the \n     personnel assigned to OARDEC were reserve officers from the \n     different branches of service (Army, Navy, Air Force, \n     Marines) of varying grades and levels of general military \n     experience. Few had any experience or training in the legal \n     or intelligence fields.\n       6. The Recorders of the tribunals were typically relatively \n     junior officers with little training or experience in matters \n     relating to the collection, processing, analyzing, and/or \n     dissemination of intelligence material. In no instances known \n     to me did any of the Recorders have any significant personal \n     experience in the field of military intelligence. Similarly, \n     I was unaware of any Recorder having any significant or \n     relevant experience dealing with the agencies providing \n     information to be used as a part of the CSRT process.\n       7. The Recorders exercised little control over the process \n     of accumulating information to be presented to the CSRT board \n     members. Rather, the information was typically aggregated by \n     individuals identified as case writers who, in most \n     instances, had the same limited degree of knowledge and \n     experience relating to the intelligence community and \n     intelligence products. The case writers, and not the \n     Recorders, were primarily responsible for accumulating \n     documents, including assembling documents to be used in the \n     drafting of an unclassified summary of the factual basis for \n     the detainee's designation as an enemy combatant.\n       8. The information used to prepare the files to be used by \n     the Recorders frequently consisted of finished intelligence \n     products of a generalized nature--often outdated, often \n     ``generic,'' rarely specifically relating to the individual \n     subjects of the CSRTs or to the circumstances related to \n     those individuals' status.\n       9. Beyond ``generic'' information, the case writer would \n     frequently rely upon information contained within the Joint \n     Detainee Information Management System (``JDIMS''). The \n     subset of that system available to the case writers was \n     limited in terms of the scope of information, typically \n     excluding information that was characterized as highly \n     sensitive law enforcement information, highly classified \n     information, or information not voluntarily released by the \n     originating agency. In that regard, JDIMS did not constitute \n     a complete repository, although this limitation was \n     frequently not understood by individuals with access to or \n     who relied upon the system as a source of information. Other \n     databases available to the case writer were similarly \n     deficient. The case writers and Recorders did not have access \n     to numerous information sources generally available within \n     the intelligence community.\n       10. As one of only a few intelligence-trained and suitably \n     cleared officers, I served\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\n     as a liaison while assigned to OARDEC, acting as a go-between \n     for OARDEC and various intelligence organizations. In that \n     capacity, I was tasked to review and/or obtain information \n     relating to individual subjects of the CSRTs. More \n     specifically, I was asked to confirm and represent in a \n     statement to be relied upon by the CSRT board members that \n     the organizations did not possess ``exculpatory information'' \n     relating to the subject of the CSRT.\n       11. During my trips to the participating organizations, I \n     was allowed only limited access to information, typically \n     prescreened and filtered. I was not permitted to see any \n     information other than that specifically prepared in advance \n     of my visit. I was not permitted to request that further \n     searches be performed. I was given no assurances that the \n     information provided for my examination represented a \n     complete compilation of information or that any summary \n     of information constituted an accurate distillation of the \n     body of available information relating to the subject.\n       12. I was specifically told on a number of occasions that \n     the information provided to me was all that I would be shown, \n     but I was never told that the information that was provided \n     constituted all available information. On those occasions \n     when I asked that a representative of the organization \n     provide a written statement that there was no exculpatory \n     evidence, the requests were summarily denied.\n       13. At one point, following a review of information, I \n     asked the Office of General Counsel of the intelligence \n     organization that I was visiting for a statement that no \n     exculpatory information had been withheld. I explained that I \n     was tasked to review all available materials and to reach a \n     conclusion regarding the non-existence of exculpatory \n     information, and that I could not do so without knowing that \n     I had seen all information.\n       14. The request was denied, coupled with a refusal even to \n     acknowledge whether there existed additional information that \n     I was not permitted to review. In short, based upon the \n     selective review that I was permitted, I was left to \n     ``infer'' from the absence of exculpatory information in the \n     materials I was allowed to review that no such information \n     existed in materials I was not allowed to review.\n       15. Following that exchange, I communicated to Rear Admiral \n     McGarrah and the OARDEC Deputy Director the fundamental \n     limitations imposed upon my review of the organization's \n     files and my inability to state conclusively that no \n     exculpatory information existed relating to the CSRT \n     subjects. It was not possible for me to certify or validate \n     the non-existence of exculpatory evidence as related to any \n     individual undergoing the CSRT process.\n       16. The content of intelligence products, including \n     databases, made available to case writers, Recorders, or \n     liaison officers, was often left entirely to the discretion \n     of the organizations providing the information. What \n     information was not included in the bodies of intelligence \n     products was typically unknown to the case writers and \n     Recorders, as was the basis for limiting the information. In \n     other words, the person preparing materials for use by the \n     CSRT board members did not know whether they had examined all \n     available information or even why they possessed some pieces \n     of information but not others.\n       17. Although OARDEC personnel often received large amounts \n     of information, they often had no context for determining \n     whether the information was relevant or probative and no \n     basis for determining what additional information would be \n     necessary to establish a basis for determining the \n     reasonableness of any matter to be offered to the CSRT board \n     members. Often, information that was gathered was discarded \n     by the case writer or the Recorder because it was considered \n     to be ambiguous, confusing, or poorly written. Such a \n     determination was frequently the result of the case writer or \n     Recorder's lack of training or experience with the types of \n     information provided. In my observation, the case writer or \n     Recorder, without proper experience or a basis for giving \n     context to information, often rejected some information \n     arbitrarily while accepting other information without any \n     articulable rationale.\n       18. The case writer's summaries were reviewed for quality \n     assurance, a process that principally focused on format and \n     grammar. The quality assurance review would not ordinarily \n     check the accuracy of the information underlying the case \n     writer's unclassified summary for the reason that the quality \n     assurance reviewer typically had little more experience than \n     the case writer and, again, no relevant or meaningful \n     intelligence or legal experience, and therefore had no skills \n     by which to critically assess the substantive portions of the \n     summaries.\n       19. Following the quality assurance process, the \n     unclassified summary and the information assembled by the \n     case writer in support of the summary would then be forwarded \n     to the Recorder. It was very rare that a Recorder or a \n     personal representative would seek additional information \n     beyond that information provided by the case writer.\n       20. It was not apparent to me how assignments to CSRT \n     panels were made, nor was I personally involved in that \n     process. Nevertheless, I discerned the determinations of who \n     would be assigned to any particular position, whether as a \n     member of a CSRT or to some other position, to be largely the \n     product of ad hoc decisions by a relatively small group of \n     individuals. All CSRT panel members were assigned to OARDEC \n     and reported ultimately to Rear Admiral McGarrah. It was well \n     known by the officers in OARDEC that any time a CSRT panel \n     determined that a detainee was not properly classified as an \n     enemy combatant, the panel members would have to explain \n     their finding to the OARDEC Deputy Director. There would be \n     intensive scrutiny of the finding by Rear Admiral McGarrah \n     who would, in turn, have to explain the finding to his \n     superiors, including the Under Secretary of the Navy.\n       21. On one occasion, I was assigned to a CSRT panel with \n     two other officers, an Air Force colonel and an Air Force \n     major, the latter understood by me to be a judge advocate. We \n     reviewed evidence presented to us regarding the recommended \n     status of a detainee. All of us found the information \n     presented to lack substance.\n       22. What were purported to be specific statements of fact \n     lacked even the most fundamental earmarks of objectively \n     credible evidence. Statements allegedly made by percipient \n     witnesses lacked detail. Reports presented generalized \n     statements in indirect and passive forms without stating the \n     source of the information or providing a basis for \n     establishing the reliability or the credibility of the \n     source. Statements of interrogators presented to the panel \n     offered inferences from which we were expected to draw \n     conclusions favoring a finding of ``enemy combatant'' but \n     that, upon even limited questioning from the panel, yielded \n     the response from the Recorder, ``We'll have to get back to \n     you.'' The personal representative did not participate in any \n     meaningful way.\n       23. On the basis of the paucity and weakness of the \n     information provided both during and after the CSRT hearing, \n     we determined that there was no factual basis for concluding \n     that the individual should be classified as an enemy \n     combatant. Rear Admiral McGarrah and the Deputy Director \n     immediately questioned the validity of our findings. They \n     directed us to write out the specific questions that we had \n     raised concerning the evidence to allow the Recorder an \n     opportunity to provide further responses. We were then \n     ordered to reopen the hearing to allow the Recorder to \n     present further argument as to why the detainee should be \n     classified as an enemy combatant. Ultimately, in the absence \n     of any substantive response to the questions and no basis for \n     concluding that additional information would be forthcoming, \n     we did not change our determination that the detainee was not \n     properly classified as an enemy combatant. OARDEC's response \n     to the outcome was consistent with the few other instances in \n     which a finding of ``Not an Enemy Combatant'' (NEC) had been \n     reached by CSRT boards. In each of the meetings that I \n     attended with OARDEC leadership following a finding of NEC, \n     the focus of inquiry on the part of the leadership was ``what \n     went wrong.''\n       24. I was not assigned to another CSRT panel.\n       I hereby declare under the penalties of perjury based on my \n     personal knowledge that the foregoing is true and accurate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in opposition to \nthe Leahy-Specter amendment on the Defense authorization bill. The \nLeahy-Specter amendment will strike an important change made by the \nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006 that strips courts of jurisdiction to \nhear habeas corpus petitions from alien unlawful enemy combatants \ndetained by the United States.\n  This amendment would restore jurisdiction to the Federal courts to \nhear habeas petitions from detainees who are currently pending trial \nbefore a military commission. Essentially, this amendment would grant \nhabeas corpus rights to all non-U.S. citizens, regardless of location, \nwho are detained by the United States.\n  The amendment would have the effect during the current global war on \nterrorism or during a large-scale protracted war on the scale of World \nWar II of giving any noncitizen detained by U.S. forces, regardless of \nwhere they are detained and regardless of the reason for their \ndetention, the right to challenge that detention in the U.S. court \nsystem.\n  I can think of few better ways to ensure that the United States is \ndefeated in any conflict in which we engage and few better ways to \nundermine the national security of the United States than to adopt this \namendment.\n  In 2004, the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld held that \nthe President is authorized to detain enemy combatants for the duration \nof hostilities based on longstanding law-of-war principles. It also \nheld that Congress could authorize the President to detain persons, \nincluding U.S. citizens, designated as enemy combatants without trial \nfor a criminal offense so long as the enemy combatant has a process to \nchallenge that designation.\n  As a result of the Hamdi decision, the Department of Defense created \nthe\n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\nCombatant Status Review Tribunal, a process where detainees may \nchallenge their status designations.\n  Congress passed and the President signed the Detainee Treatment Act \non December 30, 2005, which included the Graham-Levin amendment to \neliminate the Federal court statutory jurisdiction over habeas corpus \nclaims by aliens detained at Guantanamo Bay.\n  After a full and open debate, a bipartisan majority of Congress \npassed the Military Commissions Act just last fall. The MCA amended the \nDetainee Treatment Act provisions regarding appellate review and habeas \ncorpus jurisdictions by making the provisions of the DTA the exclusive \nremedy for all aliens detained as enemy combatants anywhere in the \nworld, including those detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The MCA's \nrestrictions on habeas corpus codified important and constitutional \nlimits on captured enemies' access to our courts.\n\n  The District of Columbia Circuit upheld the MCA's habeas restrictions \nin Boumediene v. Bush earlier this year. The Supreme Court, in a rare \nmove, reconsidered their denial of certiorari and will make a decision \non this case in the near future. In the meantime, Congress should not \nact hastily.\n  Before the Supreme Court decision in Rasul v. Bush in June 2004, the \ncontrolling case law for over 50 years was set out in the Supreme Court \ncase of Johnson v. Eisentrager, a 1950 case which held that aliens in \nmilitary detention outside the United States were not entitled to \njudicial review through habeas corpus petitions in Federal courts. The \nCourt recognized that extension of habeas corpus to alien combatants \ncaptured abroad ``would hamper the war effort and bring aid and comfort \nto the enemy,'' and the Constitution requires no such thing.\n  The Rasul case changed the state of the law for detainees held at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, due to the unique nature of the long-term U.S. \nlease of that property. The Supreme Court reasoned that the habeas \ncorpus statute and the exercise of complete jurisdiction and control \nover the Navy base in Cuba were sufficient to establish the \njurisdiction of U.S. Federal courts over habeas petitions brought by \ndetainees.\n  The Supreme Court ruled that the status of a detainee as an enemy \ncombatant must be determined in a way that provides the fundamentals of \ndue process--namely, notice and opportunity to be heard. The executive \nbranch established Combatant Status Review Tribunals, or CSRTs, to \ncomply with this mandate. Judicial review of CSRT determinations of \nenemy combatant status by article III courts is provided by the \nDetainee Treatment Act. Under the DTA, appeals of CSRT decisions may be \nmade to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n  In his dissent in the Rasul case, Justice Scalia wisely pointed out \nthat at the end of World War II, the United States held approximately 2 \nmillion enemy soldiers, many of whom no doubt had some complaint about \ntheir capture or conditions of confinement. Today, approximately 25,000 \npersons are detained by the United States in Iraq, Afghanistan, and at \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  Restoring jurisdiction over alien enemy combatants could result in \nproviding the right of habeas corpus to all those detainees held \noutside the United States so long as their place of detention is under \nthe jurisdiction and control of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  In fact, habeas challenges on behalf of detainees held in Afghanistan \nhave already been filed.\n  The Supreme Court recognized in Johnson v. Eisentrager that allowing \nhabeas petitions from enemy combatants forces the judiciary into direct \noversight of the conduct of war in which they will be asked to hear \npetitions from all around the world, challenging actions and events on \nthe battlefield. This would simply be unworkable as a practical matter \nand could greatly interfere with the Executive's authority to wage war. \nAs the Supreme Court revisits these issues, Congress should not undue \nwhat it has done.\n  Federal courts have ruled twice--in December 2006 at the district \ncourt level on the remand of the Hamdan case from the Supreme Court and \nagain in February 2007 at the DC Circuit Court level in the \nconsolidated cases of Boumediene and Al Odah--that the Military \nCommissions Act is constitutional and that alien enemy unlawful \ncombatants have no constitutional rights to habeas corpus.\n  The Supreme Court, at the end of June, decided it would hear these \ncases on expedited appeal this fall. It is appropriate for Congress to \nallow the Supreme Court to review the decision made by the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, applying the standards of review enacted in the DTA \nand the MCA before granting habeas rights to and opening the Federal \ncourts to thousands of detainees held outside the United States.\n  For these reasons, and simply because it represents extremely bad \npolicy, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Leahy-Specter amendment.\n  Mr. President, I had also intended to talk a little while today about \nSenator Graham's amendment seeking to strike section 1023 of the \nunderlying bill. It is my understanding now that there are discussions \nongoing relative to the possibility of trying to work that amendment \nout. So if that amendment does come to the floor for consideration, I \nwill be back to talk about the support of that amendment at that time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11645-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I would just say that we have a limited \namount of time in this body--and we all know that--before the end of \nthe fiscal year will be coming up on September 30. We have to pass some \nsort of appropriation to fund our defense and our military by that \ndate. We need to pass the Defense authorization bill, which has been \nvoted out of the Armed Services Committee. Senator Levin, our \nDemocratic chairman, has moved that bill forward, and it had strong \nbipartisan support. It is on the floor today, and it provides quite a \nnumber of valuable and critically important benefits for our defense on \nwhich we need to vote. For example, it increases the number of persons \nin the Army, the end-strength of the Army, by 13,000, and 9,000 for the \nMarine Corps. We have a lot of people talking about the stress on the \nmilitary, so we need to authorize the growth of the military. It is \nsomething we know we need to do, and I think we have a general \nagreement on that. It is in this bill. We need to move this bill. It \nauthorizes numerous pay bonuses and benefits for our warfighters and \ntheir family members. It allows a reservist to draw retirement before \nage 60 if they volunteer under certain circumstances for active \nmobilizations. It directs studies on mental health and well-being for \nsoldiers and marines. It establishes a Family Readiness Council. It \nauthorizes funding for the MRAPs, which are those vehicles which are so \nmuch more effective against even the most powerful bombs and IED-type \nattacks.\n  So this bill, this authorization bill, is not an unimportant matter. \nOur soldiers are out there now in harm's way, where we sent them, \nexecuting the policies we asked them to execute, and we need to support \nthem by doing our job. We complain that Iraq can't pass this bill or \nthat bill; we need to pass our own bill.\n  Not only do we need to get this authorization bill passed, but we \nhave to get on next week to the appropriations bill to actually fund \nthe military because if we do not do so, the funding stops. Under \nAmerican law, if Congress does not appropriate funds, nobody can spend \nfunds. It is just that simple.\n\n[[Page S11646]]\n\n  We have to do our job, and I hope we will. I am troubled to see a lot \nof things beginning to occur that indicate there is an agenda afoot \nhere, at least by some, that would make it difficult, if not \nimpossible, for us to get this work done.\n  For example, the first amendment brought up on the Defense bill--not \na part of the committee bill but on the floor here--is to provide to \nenemy terrorists habeas corpus rights they have never been provided by \nany nation in history during a time of war and certainly not our own \nNation. It is frustrating for me to hear people say we want to restore \nhabeas rights to captive enemy combatants. If we did it, we should at \nleast perhaps give priority to lawful enemy combatants. Most of these \nare unlawful enemy combatants who have not in any way followed the \nrules of war and therefore are not provided, in normal circumstances, \nthe full protections of the Geneva Convention. So I am worried about \nthat.\n  The President has said if that amendment passes, he will veto the \nbill. So what will we have done then? Are people in here going to have \na good feeling about that--they made the President veto the bill--that \nwe provide unprecedented rights to captives who are setting about to \nattack and kill Americans? We are releasing people from Guantanamo and \nhave released quite a number of them. Quite a number of them have been \nrecaptured on the battlefield trying to kill our sons and our daughters \nwho are out there because this Congress sent them out there. So I think \nwe need to get our heads straight.\n  Now, in addition to that, we have Senator Durbin offering the DREAM \nAct amendment, an immigration bill, to this bill.\n  Senator Kennedy says he intends to offer hate crimes legislation. \nThese are controversial pieces of legislation, unrelated, really, to \nthe Defense Department. They ought not be passed. They have been \nrejected before. Certainly the DREAM Act was.\n  Let me talk about this DREAM Act. It is something Senator Durbin \npoints out that I have objected to before. I have objected to it before \nwhen it came up in the Judiciary Committee, not in the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The Durbin amendment, as filed as of the end of July, would do a \nnumber of things. It will, indeed, provide amnesty, the full panoply of \nrights we give to any citizen who comes here lawfully. It provides a \nfull citizenship track and full rights for quite a number of illegal \naliens, putting them on a direct path to citizenship. A conservative \nestimate done by the Migration Policy Institute suggests that at least \n1.3 million will be eligible for amnesty. It will also allow current \nillegal aliens, those who would be provided amnesty under this bill, \nand future illegal aliens who come here after this day, illegally--\nhopefully, I thought we decided when the comprehensive bill was voted \ndown, the American people were saying let's end illegal immigration--it \nwould provide for them to be eligible for in-State tuition at public \nuniversities, even when the university denies in-State tuition to U.S. \ncitizens and legally present aliens.\n  It would reverse 1996 law that quite rationally said let's not reward \npeople who are here illegally by giving them a discounted rate of \ntuition. How much more simple is it than that?\n  It would provide Federal financial aid in the form of student loans \nand work/study programs, subsidized by Federal money. It is unclear, it \nappears, whether Pell grants, direct Federal grants, are going to be \nprovided to people in our country illegally, with which to go to \ncollege, whereas hard-working Americans, many of them, don't qualify \nfor Pell grants--and we need to expand Pell grants. Why would we then \nbe providing them to persons who would come into our country illegally?\n  They say they may have come when they were younger. Maybe they did. \nBut if you have a limited number of persons to whom you can provide \nPell grants or subsidized loans, I suggest they should be given to \nthose who are lawfully here, not those who are unlawfully here.\n  There is an old slogan: If you are in a hole, the first thing you \nshould do is stop digging. I suggest if you have a problem with people \ncoming into the country illegally, the first thing you should do is \nstop subsidizing that illegal behavior by giving them discounted \ntuition.\n  The DREAM Act establishes a seamless process to take illegal aliens \ndirectly from illegal status to conditional permanent resident status, \nthen to legal permanent resident status, and then the next step, of \ncourse, is citizenship. First, illegal aliens who came here before age \n16 and have been here illegally for the past 5 years will be given \n``conditional'' permanent residence, or green cards, if they have been \nadmitted to an institution of higher education or have a GED, or have a \nhigh school diploma. The ``conditional'' green card, which is good for \n6 years, will be converted to a full green card. A green card means you \nhave a legal permanent residence status in America. In this case it \nwould be a direct result of an illegal entry into the United States, or \nan illegal overstay. It will be converted to a full green card if the \nalien completes 2 years of a bachelor's degree or serves 2 years in the \nuniformed services. This is broader than the term ``military service,'' \nas people have said. ``Uniformed services,'' as defined by title 10, \nincludes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nCommissioned Corps and the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned \nCorps, in addition to the military. Or they would qualify if they can't \ndo those because of hardship.\n  After 5 years of ``conditional,'' or full green card permanent \nstatus, the aliens amnestied under the DREAM Act will be eligible for \ncitizenship.\n  We are also expanding, through this amendment, if it is to be \nadopted, immigration into the country based on an illegal action in a \nnumber of ways. There is nothing in the DREAM Act that limits the \nability of the illegal aliens who are being provided permanent status \nand citizenship here to bring in their family members. Once an illegal \nalien becomes a legal resident under the act, they can immigrate their \nspouses and their children. As soon as the illegal alien becomes a \ncitizen, he or she will be able to bring in, to immigrate their parents \nto the country as a matter of right. So there is no numerical limit to \nthe number of parents a citizen can immigrate into the United States. I \nthink that is one of the flaws in our current law.\n  The reason that is important is because we are generous in \nimmigration. We allow a million or more a year to come legally into our \ncountry. We do provide quite a number of generous provisions that allow \npeople to come. But if you are allowing those limited number of slots--\nin effect, we have only so many that the country does allow and would \ndesire to allow to come--we are providing parents of those who have \nbeen illegal to be able to come as a guaranteed right, whereas another \nwho may have a master's degree, may have a high skill, may have learned \nEnglish in Honduras and is valedictorian of their school or college--\nthey can't get in. But they have an automatic right for a parent, who \nmay have done far less in the scheme of things to justify taking one of \nthose limited slots the country has to offer. That is why I am \nconcerned about that.\n  We don't think about it in correct terms. We have to understand we \ncannot accept everybody in the world. We should create a generous \nsystem of immigration that allows people to come to America, but we \nought to set up a legal system that we are proud of and that sets good \nstandards, that allows a person to have the greatest opportunity to be \nsuccessful here, to have more precedence in entry--which is exactly \nwhat Canada does, and Canada is quite proud of it.\n  In 1996, Congress passed this law:\n\n       Not withstanding any other provision of law, an alien who \n     is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be \n     eligible on the basis of residence within a State . . . for \n     any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or \n     national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit \n     (in no less an amount, duration and scope) without regard to \n     whether the citizen or national is such a resident.\n\n  The DREAM Act eliminates this provision that has been offered on the \nDefense bill. It would reverse this current Federal law. The result is \nthat States will be able to offer in-State tuition to illegal aliens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Alabama he \nhas consumed his 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will conclude by saying there are a \nhost of reasons why we need not, ought not pass the DREAM Act itself. \nBut that is a matter of debate that we have had several different times \nnow. What we need to be doing now is providing support for the \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardsmen we sent in harm's way \nby passing the Defense authorization bill and the Defense \nappropriations bill. We don't need to be talking about the DREAM Act. \nWe don't need to be talking about hate crimes. We don't need to be \noffering the first amendment out of the chute, an amendment that \nprovides habeas benefits to unlawful combatants, legal rights that have \nnever been given by the United States in the history of the Republic, \nnor any other nation in the history of the world.\n  We need to get serious and get some work done here that is important \nand not be distracted with amendments that are going to be politically \ncontroversial and can only make it more difficult for us to do our duty \nas a Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11647-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11647-S11648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FIGHT TO END HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, only 2 weeks ago this Nation marked the \n50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. That landmark \nlegislation, signed into law on September 9, 1957, was Congress' first \ncivil rights bill since the end of Reconstruction.\n  It established the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department \nand empowered Federal prosecutors to obtain court injunctions against \ninterference with the right to vote. It also established a Federal \nCommission on Civil Rights with authority to investigate discriminatory \nconditions and recommend corrective measures.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Vermont, we held a hearing to \ncommemorate this milestone, to talk about our Nation's progress over \nthe past half century and how we must move forward if we are to live up \nto the ideals enumerated in the Constitution. My former colleague from \nthe House and an American hero, John Lewis, shared his recollections \nand his hopes for the future with us.\n  Today, however, it is with great sadness that I come to the Senate \nfloor to talk about a rash of incidents that have occurred over the \npast month in this region of the country. These incidents are a painful \nreminder of just how far we have to go.\n  At the College Park Campus of the University of Maryland, fewer than \n10 miles from here, students found a noose hanging in a tree near the \nUniversity's African-American Cultural Center. It is believed that the \nnoose had been hanging there for almost 2 weeks before the assistant \neditor of the school's African-American newspaper noticed it and \nnotified the police.\n  University President C.D. Mote has denounced the incident, as have \nstudent leaders and faculty. It is under investigation as a possible \nhate crime and may be connected to the trial of six African-American \nteenagers in Jena, Louisiana. In that case, three nooses were placed in \nthe so called ``white-only'' tree on campus after black students sat \nunder it. The ensuing altercations led to charges of attempted murder \nagainst only the black teenagers, charges that have since been \ndismissed.\n  In Montgomery County, Maryland, three separate acts of vandalism were \nreported at Jewish centers in Rockville, Gaithersburg, and Silver \nSpring.\n  In two of those cases, vandals defaced banners declaring the \nsynagogues' support for the State of Israel, scrawling anti-Semitic \nslurs on them. Police are investigating all three acts as possible hate \ncrimes.\n  Then, in the hills of Big Creek, West Virginia, a 20-year-old \nAfrican-American woman was held captive in a shed for more than a week. \nDuring her ordeal, she was beaten, choked, stabbed, sexually assaulted, \nand forced to perform inhumane acts. Throughout, she was called racist \nslurs and was told she was being victimized because of her skin color. \nShe was rescued by police responding to an anonymous tip. A local \nSheriff described this as ``something that would have come out of a \nhorror movie.'' Six people, all white, have been arrested in connection \nwith the assault and kidnapping, and police are still searching for two \nmore. The young woman is recovering in a hospital from her ordeal.\n  In Gaithersburg, Maryland, a Muslim family was again the victim of \nvandalism. Over the years, the family had been victimized multiple \ntimes, beginning in 1994 when they moved to the area. Their house and \nautomobiles were broken into, garbage and dead animals were strewn in \ntheir yard, and racist notes were taped to their door.\n  This time, on September 11, tires on both of the family's vehicles \nwere slashed. The mother has worked hard to counteract anti-Muslim and \nanti-Arab sentiment in America, speaking at schools and libraries about \nIslam and Arab-American culture and teaching a cultural sensitivity \nclass. Police are continuing to investigate this incident as a possible \nhate crime.\n  In Manassas, Virginia, the Ku Klux Klan recently began distributing \nleaflets urging ``white Christian America'' to stand up for its rights. \nThe neighborhood has recently begun a demographic shift as older \nresidents moved out and younger Latino families moved in.\n  Finally, Mr. President, last Friday, it was reported that the \nMetropolitan Police Department here in Washington is investigating a \nseries of hate crimes targeting gay and transgender people. The latest \nattack happened seven blocks from here near the Verizon Center, where \nreportedly a group of young men threw a 16-year-old male-to-female \ntransgender person through a plate glass window. Police reports \nindicate that the suspect had been arrested twice before for similar \nattacks against gay men.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported that in 2005 there \nwere approximately 7,100 incidents classified as hate crimes. The FBI \nuses voluntary reports from local law enforcement agencies across the \ncountry to determine the totals, but the actual number could be far \nhigher.\n  The Southern Poverty Law Center has analyzed data compiled and \nreported by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. That November \n2005 report, based on data from the biannual National Crime \nVictimization Survey (NCVS), found that fewer than half of hate crimes \nare reported to the police and others are not counted by the FBI. This \nis because they are not recorded as hate crimes, or because some police \ndepartments do not report statistics to their State offices. The NCVS \nestimates that the United States averages about 191,000 hate crimes \neach year.\n  The report also found that hate crimes involve violence far more than \nother crimes. The data showed that four out of five hate crimes were \nviolent--involving a sexual attack, robbery, assault or murder, as \ncompared to 23 percent of non-hate crimes.\n  Mr. President, the situation is even more dire than most Americans \nimagine. The Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project counted \n844 active hate groups in the United States in 2006.\n  Hate crimes' tentacles reach far beyond the intended targets. They \nbring a chill to entire neighborhoods and create a sense of fear, \nvulnerability, and insecurity in our communities. They poison the well \nof our democracy and strike at the very heart of the American spirit.\n  Our local law enforcement agencies need help in investigating and \nprosecuting these crimes, and this help must come from the United \nStates Attorney General and the Department of Justice.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Mathew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act, S. 1105, to strengthen existing Federal hate \ncrime laws. I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  While the responsibility for prosecuting hate crimes primarily rests \nwith the individual States, this new measure will give local law \nenforcement additional tools to combat violent hate crimes. It also \nwill provide Federal support through training and assistance to ensure \nthat hate crimes\n\n[[Page S11648]]\n\nare effectively investigated and prosecuted. In addition, it will \nensure that Federal investigations and prosecutions are carried out \nwhen local authorities request assistance or are unwilling or unable to \neffectively prosecute cases.\n  It is important that the Federal Government have the ability to take \naggressive action against hate crimes in States where current laws are \ninadequate. For example, only 31 States and the District of Columbia \ninclude sexual orientation-based or disability-based crimes in their \nhate crimes statutes. This law will help ensure that all hate crimes \nare fully investigated and prosecuted.\n  This measure, which has strong bipartisan support, would strengthen \nexisting law in two ways. First, it would eliminate a serious \nlimitation on Federal involvement under existing law--namely, the \nrequirement that a victim of a hate crime was attacked because he or \nshe was engaged in federally-protected activity such as voting or \nattending school. It also would authorize the Department of Justice to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes based on sexual orientation, \ngender, gender identity, or disability. Current law does not provide \nauthority for involvement in these four categories.\n  Hate crimes are un-American. They cannot be tolerated. When \nindividuals are targeted and attacked because of who they are, entire \ncommunities suffer and we are all diminished by it.\n  S. 1105 would give us the tools we need to be more effective in \ncombating crimes of hate. The House passed its version of hate crimes \nlegislation on May 3 and now the Senate must do our part. I call on my \ncolleagues to support S. 1105 and I urge its passage without further \ndelay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11648-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MILITARY COMMISSIONS ACT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first of all, thank you for taking some \ntime and presiding in the chair so I can make this statement.\n  Last year, I made a very difficult decision. I voted for the Military \nCommissions Act because I believed it would make our Nation safer and \nhelp us fight the war on terrorism. I did not support the bill, \nhowever, without reservations.\n  I said at the time it was not the law I would have written. To the \ncontrary, I supported the bill with the understanding we would go back \nand fix some of the problems that remained unsolved. Tomorrow, the \nSenate has an opportunity to fix one of the most glaring of those \nproblems, the failure to provide detainees with the right to habeas \ncorpus.\n  A right to habeas corpus was a fundamental right in the eyes of our \nFounding Fathers. It was seen as a mechanism for accountability within \nour Government, giving prisoners a way to challenge detentions that \nwere unlawful or unconstitutional.\n  A right to habeas corpus has remained a cornerstone of our criminal \njustice system since our very beginning as a Nation. It continues to be \nreaffirmed time and time again by every court in the land. Granting all \nprisoners the right to petition for habeas corpus is something that \nmakes our Nation special and sets us apart.\n  Now, I am sure many Americans may wonder: Well, what is habeas \ncorpus? What is the big fuss about this habeas corpus thing? Well, let \nme try to explain.\n  Habeas corpus gives a person, a citizen, people, the right to ensure \nthey are being held by the Government lawfully, that they were not the \nvictim of malfeasance or misfeasance on the part of the Government. It \nis not an easy standard to meet, and it is not taken lightly by the \ncourt system.\n  To make a case for habeas corpus requires a significant amount of \nproof that a detention of that individual violates the laws of the \nUnited States. Let me say that one more time. Proving that you are \nentitled to relief, proving that you are entitled to a writ of habeas \ncorpus by the court, is not an easy task.\n  The claim is usually denied. Only those who truly deserve the writ \nare able to obtain it. I say this to reassure those who may feel that \ngranting detainees the right to habeas corpus, as the amendment would \ndo, would quickly let loose those who would then attack our country and \nour citizens. That simply will not happen.\n  What will happen is those detainees who are being held unlawfully, if \nthere are any who are being held unlawfully, who are being denied their \nbasic human rights, will have a chance to make their case in court. \nThey will, for the first time, be able to argue they are being held \nwithout any evidence of wrongdoing. They will be able to argue, \npossibly, they were tortured for a confession that is simply not true.\n  In short, they will be allowed to hold our great Nation to the \nstandard of fairness, lawfulness, and decency that our Founding Fathers \nestablished when they penned the U.S. Constitution.\n  Some people may not believe detainees are entitled to such a basic \nright. They argue these people may not be U.S. citizens; that they do \nnot believe the Constitution provides them with any protection or any \nguarantees.\n  I disagree. I would ask those people one thing: If the terrorists \nconvince us to throw away the very rights that make us free, the very \nrights that make our Nation what we uniquely are, does that not mean \nthe terrorists have won?\n  If we believe in the rule of law, and if we believe in a system of \njustice, we must give all people detained by our Government the right \nto challenge that detention. Our Government must play by the rules. It \nmust detain people who are supposed to be detained, and it must be \nprepared to make that case in a court of law.\n  The United States can do better than depending on indefinite, \nunchallengeable detentions to imprison an individual suspected to be a \nterrorist. We do not need shortcuts to keep our Nation safe.\n  We can fight the war on terror and respect human rights at the same \ntime. What makes America worthy of fighting for and dying for is the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights.

Mr. President, a very close, personal friend and a great \nAmerican died the day before yesterday, Howard Gittis, a very \ndistinguished Philadelphia lawyer in the great tradition of Andrew \nHamilton who defended Peter Zenger. Those of us who are Philadelphia \nlawyers take great pride in that tradition from Andrew Hamilton and the \nhistoric defense of Peter Zenger, and Howard Gittis was in that mold.\n  I have been a personal friend of Howard Gittis for some 50 years. I \nwas told he went to sleep on Sunday night and didn't awaken, died in \nhis sleep apparently of a heart attack.\n  Howard Gittis was a partner in the very prestigious firm of Wolf, \nBlock, Schorr & Solis-Cohen for some 23 years. He then joined a noted \nentrepreneur, Ronald Perelman of New York, and was the executive vice \npresident of McAndrews & Forbes in New York City.\n  Howard was noted for his charitable contributions both as an alumnus \nof the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he contributed \nsubstantially to Penn's law school which named Gittis Hall and the \nGittis Center for Clinical Legal Studies at Penn in honor of Howard \nGittis's contribution to the law school and his charitable support of \nthe university.\n  Not only did he support the University of Pennsylvania, but he also \nserved on the board of Temple University for 31 years, including 5 as \nchairman of the board, and the Temple Student Center is named for him.\n  Always affable, always cheerful, always ready to lend assistance to \nfriends or even to those who were not close friends. He left an \nindelible mark in the Philadelphia legal community and in the New York \nbusiness community.\n  His funeral services occurred earlier today in New York and burial \noccurred this afternoon in Philadelphia.\n\n[[Page S11649]]\n\n  I think it appropriate to pay tribute to an outstanding American who \ndid so much for the legal profession and so much for charitable \ncontributions with both the University of Pennsylvania and Temple \nUniversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11649-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AUGIE HIEBERT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today to \nhonor one of Alaska's most admired pioneers and a dear friend of mine \nand my whole family.\n  Alaskans will remember Augie Hiebert for his many achievements in the \nfield of broadcasting and for opening the doors to modern \ncommunications for all Alaskans. In a State with few roads, where \nhundreds of miles of wilderness often separate towns and villages, \nAlaskans rely upon airwaves to connect them with people and events \nacross our State, across the country, and around the globe. Augie was \none of the first to bring the benefits of broadcast technology to our \nlast frontier.\n  At an early age, Augie developed a fascination for electronics and \nradio which would lead him to a career in broadcasting. While growing \nup on an orchard in Washington State during the Great Depression, Augie \nbuilt his own first radio. He earned his ham radio license at the age \nof 15. He was just 22 years old when he came to Fairbanks in 1939 to \nhelp a friend build KFAR Radio.\n  On the morning of December 7, 1941, Augie was listening to ham radio \nbroadcasts at KFAR's transmitter when he heard of the attack on Pearl \nHarbor. He was one of the first in Alaska to hear the shocking news and \nimmediately alerted the commander of Ladd Field right there in \nFairbanks.\n  Having witnessed firsthand the impact broadcasting had on the lives \nof those who were living in Alaskan territory, Augie set out to bring \nthe technology of television to what we call our great land. In 1953, \nAugie built Alaska's first television station, KTVA, bringing news, \nweather, sports, and entertainment to the people of Anchorage. Two \nyears later, he broadcast the first television shows to Fairbanks when \nhe built KTVF. Augie's TV stations brought history's defining events \nfrom around the globe into Alaska's living rooms. In 1969, Augie gave \nus the first live satellite broadcasts, and Alaskans from Fairbanks to \nAnchorage watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.\n  As Alaska's broadcast industry grew, so did Augie's family. He and \nhis wife Pat raised four daughters.\n  During his long career in broadcasting, Augie served Alaska in many \nways. He was the founder and president of the Alaska Broadcasters \nAssociation. When I was practicing law, I helped him form that \nassociation. Every year, Augie brought a group of Alaskan broadcasters \nto Washington for Alaska Day at the Federal Communications Commission, \nwhere he gave them a rare opportunity to speak on a one-to-one basis \nwith commissioners about the unique challenges facing broadcasters in \nAlaska. But Augie's efforts to educate the FCC about Alaskan \nbroadcasting didn't end there. He invited them, and the entire FCC at \none time traveled to Alaska at his request.\n  In the early 1980s, Augie led the fight to preserve AM broadcast \ncoverage in Alaska, which resulted in the creation of the class of the \n1-N FCC category, a category just for our State of Alaska. Over the \nyears, Augie introduced countless Alaskans to broadcasting and gave \nmany their start in the industry. Though he officially retired in 1997, \nAugie remained committed to the future of broadcasting in Alaska, and \nuntil the day of his death, he was talking to me about the problem of \nwhite spaces in the current debate over new digital broadcasting.\n  He became a mentor to the students at Mirror Lake Middle School in \nChugiak, AK, where he shared his enthusiasm for broadcasting and he \nhelped students produce news programs for the school's closed-circuit \ntelevision system, and they did that every morning before school \nstarted. He showed them how to prepare a morning show for their school. \nAugie brought leading professionals in the field of broadcasting to \nMirror Lake to share their experiences and knowledge with these \nstudents. Today, the school operates a low-powered FM radio station \nwhich Augie helped build and license. It is the only class D low-\npowered radio license in the country issued to a school.\n  Rather than all of the firsts he achieved during his long career, \nAlaskans will remember Augie most as the man who made the Nation's \nlargest State a little bit smaller. His efforts brought us closer to \none another and closer to the rest of the world. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with Augie's daughters, their families, and all who loved \nhim.\n  This man was a great American, a great Alaskan, and my great friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11649-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11649-S11650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to the \nU.S. Air Force as it commemorates its 60th anniversary, known as \n``Heritage to Horizons . . . Commemorating 60 Years of Air and Space \nPower.'' New Mexico has maintained a long and close relationship with \nthe U.S. Air Force, and I am proud to congratulate the Air Force on its \n60th anniversary.\n  New Mexico is home to Cannon, Holloman, and Kirtland Air Force Bases \nas well as the former Walker Air Force Base. We in New Mexico are \nhonored and proud that so many Air Force officers and airmen, whose \nprofessionalism and dedication are unsurpassed, have called New Mexico \nhome.\n  The fact that the Air Force is celebrating Air and Space Power is not \nlost on New Mexico, where work is done in both areas. Holloman will be \na premier site of air power when the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing becomes \nhome to the F-22A Raptor, the most advanced fighter in the world. \nCannon is also undergoing changes and growth in the air power arena, as \nAir Force Special Operations Command stands up a new wing at Cannon on \nOctober 1. Kirtland continues to grow as home to much space work, \nincluding the Air Force Research Laboratory's Space Vehicle Directorate \nand the Operationally Responsive Space Office.\n  For the last 60 years, America has been protected by the greatest Air \nForce in the world. I salute the men and women of the Air Force and \nhope that on the Air Force's 60th anniversary, New Mexicans will take \ntime to thank the officers and airmen who have served and honor the \nmemory of those who have given their lives in our defense.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, GEN H.H. ``Hap'' Arnold, USAF, once said, \n``A modern, autonomous, and thoroughly trained Air Force in being at \nall times will not alone be sufficient, but without it there can be no \nnational security.'' It is in the name of our national security that \ntoday I recognize the U.S. Air Force's 60th anniversary.\n  One hundred years ago, Henry H. ``Hap'' Arnold graduated from the \nU.S. Military Academy. That same year, in August 1907, the U.S. Army \nSignal Corps established an aeronautical division to oversee ``military \nballooning, air machines and all kindred subjects.'' Arnold went on to \nbecome the Chief of the Army Air Corps, and, upon the creation of the \nU.S. Air Force as a separate branch of the military in 1947, a year \nafter General Arnold's retirement, Congress appointed him to the rank \nof five star general--the first and only in the history of the Air \nForce.\n  The U.S. Air Force was created by Congress to ``be organized, \ntrained, and equipped primarily for prompt and sustained offensive and \ndefensive air operations.'' ``[It] shall be responsible for the \npreparation of the air forces necessary for the effective prosecution \nof war except as otherwise assigned and, in accordance with integrated \njoint mobilization plans, for the expansion of the peacetime components \nof the Air Force to meet the needs of war.'' Today, on the anniversary \nof the National Security Act of 1947, we celebrate 60 years of an \nindependent Air Force. This independence was necessary and critical and \nremains so in order that, in the recent words of MG Charles J. Dunlap, \nJr., the United States has ``one service that focuses on maximizing \noptions for decision-makers by optimizing airpower.''\n  The U.S. Air Force, comprised of close to 700,000 Active Duty, \ncivilian, Air National Guard, and Air Force reservists, plays a vital \nand instrumental role in the ongoing fight against terrorism and other \nemerging threats on\n\n[[Page S11650]]\n\nmultiple fronts, from flying combat missions and conducting manned and \nunmanned surveillance to logistical ground support. Thirty-five \nthousand Air Force personnel are currently deployed to 120 duty \nstations worldwide, keeping freedom alive and the forces of tyranny at \nbay. Whether it is monitoring satellites in orbit or the space shuttle, \ndelivering precision-guided munitions to air and ground targets or \npatrolling the far reaches of cyberspace, the USAF maintains strategic \nand operational dominance in theater and around the globe. Fighters, \nbombers, missiles, and unmanned aircraft are the unparalleled tools of \ntoday's airmen, tools they use with unmatched skill and lethal \nprecision in defense of our freedom and liberties.\n  On a daily basis for over 4 years now, dozens of close air support \nmissions--troop support, infrastructure protection, reconstruction \nactivities and operations to deter and disrupt terrorist activities--\nare conducted by coalition forces in Iraq. The U.S. Air Force is \nresponsible for the majority of these.\n  Sixty years of Air Force excellence and superiority has been possible \nonly because of those who have voluntarily dedicated their lives to the \nsuccess of U.S. air power. With the esteemed heritage of ``Hap'' Arnold \nand other distinguished and outstanding leaders in their hearts, the \nmen and women of the USAF and their families serve our Nation with \ndistinction, integrity, and patriotism. They approach their mission in \nthe same spirit with which they swore their oath of allegiance: with a \ngrave sense of duty, honor and bravery.\n  Idaho has been home to Mountain Home Air Force Base for over 60 years \nnow. Over the past half century, Mountain Home AFB has hosted many \ndiverse missions of the Air Force including special and covert \noperations, combat and reconnaissance operations, ballistic missile \ndefense, electronic combat, and fighter operations. It is one of the \nlargest employers in the State of Idaho.\n  The Gunfighters, as Mountain Home AFB personnel are known, deploy to \nfight terror in an integrated fashion, from the maintenance and \npiloting of F-15 Eagles, F-15E Strike Eagles, and F-16 Fighting Falcons \nto complementary support missions such as intelligence and \ncommunications. In the air campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, \nthe Gunfighters flew almost 1,000 individual sorties.\n  In addition to executing its military mission, the Air Force \nrecognizes its environmental responsibility to the communities in which \nit operates and has worked diligently over the years to be a good \nsteward of Federal land in southern Idaho. I have worked with \nleadership at the base on many land management issues during my service \nin Congress. Further, the Air Force continues to respect Native-\nAmerican cultural sensitivities and practices and works hard to do its \npart in maintaining a respectful relationship for the betterment of \nShoshone-Paiute tribal interests as well as maintaining state of the \nart training for our airmen.\n  As a Nation, we are blessed to have such an outstanding, committed, \nand respectable military. The Air Force works intricately and \neffectively with the other military branches to skillfully execute the \nwar on terror, specifically, but not limited to, military operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Always innovative, the Air Force continues to \nlook ahead, establishing itself as the dominant space defense force \nempowered and capable of facing new strategic global realities in an \never-changing global threat environment, ensuring its ability to \nrespond to threats immediately and wherever they arise. Americans can \nbe incredibly proud of and thankful for the sacrifice of their Air \nForce women and men worldwide. In the words of another famous former \nChief of the Air Force, GEN Curtis LeMay, ``If we maintain our faith in \nGod, love of freedom, and superior global air power, the future looks \ngood.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11650-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11650-S11651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NEPAL'S FUTURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are times in virtually every \ncountry's history when years of underdevelopment and conflict give rise \nto opportunities to change course. Such times are rare, and such \nopportunities are too often missed.\n  I think of our Civil War, which caused so much loss of life and \ndevastation. It preserved the Union, and it led to the emancipation of \nsome 3 million African slaves. Nothing can diminish those achievements \nor the sacrifice of those who gave their lives. But instead of \nproviding the former slaves with the equal rights to which they were \nentitled, until passage of the Civil Rights Act a century later African \nAmericans suffered from racially discriminatory laws that kept them in \nan inferior status. The country remained bitterly divided because of \nit.\n  Nepal today faces its own historic choice.\n  For more than a decade, Nepal has been plagued by an internal armed \nconflict in which savage brutality was inflicted on impoverished \ncivilians by Maoist insurgents and the Royal Nepal Army. Over 13,000 \npeople died, mostly noncombatants, and virtually no one has been held \naccountable for those crimes.\n  For more than two centuries, Nepal has been a monarchy whose Kings, \nwith rare exception, denied the rights and ignored the needs of their \npeople who remain among the world's poorest. In February 2005, King \nGyanendra, a narcissistic, arrogant autocrat, seized absolute power, \njailed his opponents, and muzzled the press, only to relent in April \n2006 in the face of mounting international pressure and the protests of \nthousands of courageous Nepali citizens.\n  Nepal's previous experiment with multiparty democracy during the \n1990s had been disappointing. The leaders of the country's political \nparties distinguished themselves by amassing personal fortunes and \ndoing little for the people.\n  But since the restoration of civilian government in April last year \nthere has been impressive progress. A Comprehensive Peace Agreement was \nsigned, Maoist combatants have gone into cantonments, the army has been \nconfined to barracks, and the Maoists, until today, were part of the \ninterim Government. The King has been stripped of all political power, \nalthough the ultimate fate of the monarchy has yet to be decided. The \nword ``royal'' has been eliminated from Government institutions, \nincluding the army. Elections for a Constituent Assembly to be held in \nJune were postponed, but they have been rescheduled for November 22. \nThe assembly is to draft a new constitution.\n  Also during this period, Nepal's ethnic minorities, women, and other \ngroups who have long been persecuted and denied a voice have demanded \nequal rights and representation. This poses both challenges and \nopportunities for the Government.\n  The international community, including the United States, has \nsupported the peace process directly and through our financial \ncontributions to the United Nations which has performed key monitoring \nfunctions. Recently, the United States provided $3 million to purchase \nthe ballots for the elections.\n  Much has transpired since April 2006, when I last spoke in this \nChamber about political developments in Nepal. Today, just 65 days \nbefore Nepal's elections, I would like to address my brief remarks to \nthe people of Nepal and to Nepal's political parties, including the \nMaoists.\n  On November 22, the people of Nepal will be presented with one of two \noptions: They will either have a historic opportunity to create a \nlegitimate, representative government which can only be achieved \nthrough a popular vote or they will be denied that opportunity. If the \nelections are held, Nepal will continue on a path that can bring its \ngovernmental institutions and its society into the modern age and begin \nto finally address the poverty and injustices that gave rise to the \nconflict. If they are denied, the Nepali people will likely see their \ncountry become more fragmented and ungovernable and more vulnerable to \nexternal influences over which they have little control.\n  Recent developments have been both encouraging and troubling. Perhaps \nthat is to be expected in a country of multiple ethnic groups speaking \nsome 93 languages that is struggling to transform itself.\n  The bombings in Kathmandu 3 weeks ago, other violent acts perpetrated \nby newly formed armed groups in the Terai and members of the Maoist \nyoung wing, the Young Communist League, and the Maoists decision to\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\nwithdraw from the Government illustrate the fragility of the process.\n  Moreover, the leaders of the Congress parties and the Maoists have \ndone little to prepare for the elections. At times, party members have \nseemed more interested in furthering their own personal ambitions and \nin derailing the electoral process altogether. The leading party of the \nleft, the UML, has done more to prepare. But all parties will need to \npromptly step up their election activities if voters are to have the \ninformed choice they deserve.\n  On the positive side, the Election Commission deserves credit for a \nvoter registration process that has reached Nepal's remotest villages. \nThere is no doubt that the people are eager to go to the polls, just as \nthey were determined to put an end to the King's abuse of power.\n  Over the past 3 years, I have observed the fortitude of the Nepali \npeople's desire for peace, for justice, and for a meaningful voice in \ngovernment. Their desire is shared and admired by the American people.\n  To the Maoists, I would say that it was you who called for a \nConstituent Assembly. Saying you are committed to the democratic \nprocess at the same time that you withdraw from the Government, make \nnew demands that contradict previous commitments, support disruptive \neconomic strikes, and threaten to return to confrontation is not the \nway to earn the people's trust and support that are necessary to become \nan effective force for change. Nor is it the way to earn the trust of \nthe United States.\n  I have campaigned for elective office five times over more than 30 \nyears, and I know something about earning the people's trust and \nsupport. It does not come from dogmatic speeches or lofty party \nplatforms or manifestos. It does not come from saying one thing and \nthen doing the opposite. It certainly does not come through the use of \nviolence, threats, and extortion. It comes by showing that you deserve \nthe people's trust and support. There is no better way to begin that \nprocess than to seize this opportunity and show the people that you can \nmake the government work for them.\n  History is replete with examples of armed groups that achieved \npopular legitimacy through the democratic process. If the Maoists win \nseats through free and fair elections, uphold the commitments they have \nmade in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and other agreements, and \ndevote themselves to working for change peacefully, I am confident the \nUnited States will treat them as rightful members of the elected \nConstituent Assembly or of the Government. We may disagree with their \npositions on some issues but not about their right to serve in \nGovernment and to advocate for those positions.\n  I know the Maoists are looking to the United States to lift our \nrestrictions on their party and its leaders and to remove them from our \nlist of terrorist organizations. In order for that to happen, the \nMaoists need to take unequivocal, positive steps. The cases of the \nmurdered Nepali security guards need to be satisfactorily resolved. The \nparty's resumption of land seizures and the reopening of so-called \npeople's courts are steps in the wrong direction.\n  To the other political parties in Government, I would say that it is \ntime to make good on your commitments. Not only the Maoists but \ntraditionally marginalized groups as well are increasingly skeptical \nthat the Government is serious about delivering on its key commitments \nto the peace process, whether downsizing and reforming the army, \nsupporting land reform, or creating jobs and opportunities for minority \ngroups that have long been disadvantaged and ignored. While those \ngroups should pursue their grievances through a vigorous election \ncampaign, not through obstruction of the democratic process, the \nfailure of the parties to govern and match rhetoric with action \nthreatens the elections, as does the Maoists' saber rattling.\n  The leaders of Nepal's political parties know that the power of \nholding office comes with responsibilities, and the spotlight is on \nthem. Lasting legitimacy comes not only through the ballot box but in \nthe day-to-day ability to honor commitments and improve the lives of \nall citizens. This is their chance to put the Nepali people and their \ncountry first, by showing that they believe in effective, accountable \ngovernment. If they do not, the United States, and I suspect many other \ncountries, will no longer afford them the legitimacy they will need for \nour continued support.\n  Mr. President, Nepal's path to the future may be decided in the \nwaning months of this year. Although a small country wedged between two \nemerging giants, Nepal is unique in more ways, more beautiful ways, \nthan most other countries its size. Today, the United States--Congress \nand the Executive--are united in our desire to help Nepal become a \ndemocracy whose Government is representative of Nepal's remarkably \ndiverse population and where the fundamental rights of all people are \nrespected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11651-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11651-S11652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REPRESENTATIVE PIGNATELLI TAKES ON KATRINA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend my \nfriend and colleague in Massachusetts, State representative William \nPignatelli, who represents the fourth Berkshire district. In addition \nto his tireless dedication to the people of western Massachusetts, \nSmitty, as we all call him, has also shown his extraordinary commitment \nto public service by going far above and beyond the call of duty to \nhelp people in New Orleans devastated by Hurricane Katrina.\n  During a trip to New Orleans last December, Smitty met Stanley \nStewart and his family of 12, who had just moved into a FEMA trailer \nafter 16 horrific months of suffering. The family had been rescued from \nthe second-floor balcony of their home in the city after spending 2 \ndays without food, water, and plumbing.\n  Distressed by the plight of Stanley and his family, Smitty decided to \nhelp them rebuild their home and has already made a number of trips to \nNew Orleans to do what he can. Now he has decided to spend his fall \nvacation in New Orleans to finish the job. On September 30, he will be \ntaking a group of volunteer builders from the Berkshires to New Orleans \nto do so. With these generous acts of kindness, Smitty has shown us \nextraordinary dedication to those less fortunate.\n  As my brother Robert F. Kennedy said, ``Each time a man stands up for \nan ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against \ninjustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each \nother from a million different centers of energy and daring, those \nripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest of \noppression and resistance.''\n  I commend Smitty for the remarkable ripple of hope he is sending \nforth. A recent article in the Berkshire Eagle describes this amazing \nchapter in Smitty's life. I believe the article will be of interest to \nall my colleagues in the Senate, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nthe article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Berkshire Eagle, Sept. 3, 2007]\n\n                 Pignatelli Will Take on Katrina Again\n\n                           (By Derek Gentile)\n\n       Lenox.--State Rep. William ``Smitty'' Pignatelli admitted \n     yesterday that he understands that he cannot repair all the \n     problems that beset many of the folks in New Orleans affected \n     by Hurricane Katrina.\n       But he and a group of contractor friends and constituents \n     are going to try to fix a very small corner of that world.\n       Pignatelli and a small army of local builders will be \n     heading down to New Orleans on Sept. 30 to repair and rebuild \n     the home of New Orleans native Stanley Stewart, whose house \n     was one of the tens of thousands of homes devastated by the \n     2005 hurricane.\n       ``This is going to be the Berkshire County version of (the \n     television show) `Extreme Home Makeover,' '' Pignatelli said.\n       This will be Pignatelli's fourth trip to New Orleans. He \n     said he has been appalled by the damage he has seen.\n       ``When you go down there, and see the damage that is still \n     in evidence, you feel ashamed of the government responsible \n     for this,'' he said.\n       But he is also heartened constantly by the way people from \n     other parts of the country have come to try to help the \n     survivors.\n       Pignatelli met Stewart, who lives in the lower ninth ward \n     of New Orleans, last December, while on one of his first \n     trips to the beleaguered city. Eventually, he learned that \n     Stewart and his family lost their home in the hurricane and \n     were living in a FEMA trailer ``maybe a little bit bigger \n     than my SUV,'' Pignatelli said.\n       Resolving to help the family, he has made several trips to \n     New Orleans since with other\n\n[[Page S11652]]\n\n     builders, basically gutting the two-story home and preparing \n     it for renovation. A few months ago, they put a roof on the \n     house.\n       Now, he said, the volunteer force he assembled is ready to \n     rebuild the rest of the structure.\n       ``We're going to try to do it in seven days,'' he said.\n       The companies that are sending workers are Pignatelli \n     Electric (run by brother Scott) and Don Fitzgerald Carpentry \n     of Lenox; Comalli Electric, Cardillo Plumbing electrician Jim \n     Sorrentino and Fabino Drywall of Pittsfield; Doug Trombley \n     Windows and Moran Mechanical of Lee; and carpenter Dan \n     Sartori of West Stockbridge.\n       In addition, Granite City Electric of Pittsfield donated \n     much of the electrical equipment, Scott's Carpet One of \n     Pittsfield donated the kitchen cabinets and bathroom \n     vanities, and Pam Sandler Architects of Stockbridge donated \n     the blueprint.\n       All are volunteers, Pignatelli said.\n       Pignatelli himself sent a letter to many of his supporters \n     asking that, instead of giving to his annual Aug. 31 \n     fundraiser, they donate to the project. To date, he has \n     raised $25,000 for materials, lodging and transportation for \n     the volunteer crew, he said.\n       ``It's not often a politician puts aside political ambition \n     like this,'' said one of his supporters, Rachel Fletcher of \n     Great Barrington. ``It's commendable.''\n       Don Fitzgerald was one of the carpenters who went down the \n     last time to help with the roof.\n       ``I was on top of the roof, looking around at all the other \n     houses in the neighborhood, and I thought, `Man, these guys \n     got whacked,' '' he said.\n       He said he met Stewart, ``and I want to help the guy. He's \n     a good son of a gun.''\n       As to whether or not the crew can finish the house in one \n     week, Fitzgerald was confident.\n       ``In a week? We're gonna kick the hell out of it,'' he \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11652-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INCAN ARTIFACTS AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the life of \nDr. Martin Abeloff, a leader in Maryland's health care community who \npassed away last Thursday, September 14, 2007. Our State and our Nation \nhave lost a phenomenally gifted doctor who was also a pioneer in the \nfight against cancer. Tragically, his life was taken by the disease he \ndedicated his career to fighting.\n  Dr. Martin Abeloff was an internationally recognized oncologist who \nfor 15 years led the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, one of \nAmerica's premier cancer research and treatment centers.\n  During his tenure as cancer center director, Dr. Abeloff doubled the \nsize of the center's facility, helped increase research funding \nsixfold, and expanded facilities to nearly 1 million square feet of \ntreatment and research space. Under his leadership, some of the most \nsalient findings in cancer genetics and cancer cell biology were \nrealized and have begun to be translated into patient care.\n  Foremost a humanitarian, Dr. Abeloff was an activist who worked \ndiligently to get clinical trials legislation passed in Maryland to \nensure that cancer patients have access to state-of-the-art therapies. \nA staunch advocate for tobacco control, he led the Maryland Cigarette \nRestitution Fund initiatives at Johns Hopkins supporting research and \ncancer prevention outreach to benefit poor and underserved communities \nburdened by disproportionately high cancer death rates.\n  A trusted authority and adviser, Abeloff had served as president of \nthe American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO, chairman of the FDA \nOncology Drug Advisory Committee, and he had been a member of the \nNational Cancer Institute Executive Committee.\n  He is remembered by his colleagues and friends across the globe for \nhis characteristic humility, wry sense of humor, extraordinary devotion \nto his patients and students, and the collaborative spirit he nurtured \nin his long tenure at Johns Hopkins, where he spent most of his career.\n  Dr. Edward Miller, the CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine, described \nAbeloff as an ``iconic Hopkins physician, scientist, educator, leader, \nand good citizen rolled into one.''\n  I wish to express my condolences to Dr. Abeloff's family and to the \nJohns Hopkins community, which will also miss him greatly. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in remembering him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11652-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11652-S11653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO UNIVERSITY-ROSWELL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, the State of Vermont has lost one \nof its greatest scholars, Raul Hilberg. I wish to honor this remarkable \nman, the central figure in the founding and establishment of Holocaust \nstudies, not just in the United States, but in the world. It is fitting \nthat he was also a central contributor to the establishment and \ndevelopment of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.\n  So horrific were the events of the Holocaust that for many years \nscholars avoided the subject. Not Raul Hilberg. Born in Vienna, \nAustria, he and his family fled the Anschluss of Hitler and the Nazis \nto emigrate, first to Cuba, and ultimately to the United States. While \nin Cuba, he saw the fate of the S.S. St. Louis, a ship full of Jews who \nhad fled Germany seeking asylum. The ship was denied permission to land \nin Havana, and only after a long voyage from port to port were its 936 \nJewish passengers finally allowed to disembark in several European \ncountries.\n  In the United States, Hilberg served in the Infantry of the U.S. \nArmy. Upon his return to this country he did graduate work at Columbia \nUniversity, where he received a Ph.D. under the tutelage of Franz \nNeumann. His doctoral thesis was on the Holocaust: he took careful and \ncopious notes on Nazi documents seized by the U.S. Army, transcribing \nthe information he uncovered on index cards. Then he sat at a small \ntable in his parents' apartment and wrote his thesis on the basis of \nthose cards. That thesis was the kernel of the greatest scholarly work \never written on the Holocaust.\n  In 1956, Raul Hilberg became an assistant professor of political \nscience at the University of Vermont. He later became professor and \nchairman of that department. He remained at U.V.M. for the rest of his \ncareer until his retirement in 1991, despite many enticements to go to \nmajor research universities, sustained in his academic life by his \nfriends Jay Gould, Stan Staron, and Sam Bogorad. He was a great \nteacher. One of his colleagues remembers attending his course on the \nHolocaust: ``His words came out in perfectly structured paragraphs, \neloquent with a quiet gravity, so compelling that every student in the \nclass was transfixed from the moment Raul began speaking until the bell \nrang for the end of class.''\n  In 1961, Raul Hilberg's magisterial ``The Destruction of the European \nJews'' was published, but only after rejections from many publishers. \nEven Yad Vashem rejected the manuscript because some scholars disagreed \nwith Hilberg's perspective. Thereafter revised and updated in \nsucceeding editions, the book was then, and has remained, the most \nimportant, the most seminal, work on the Holocaust. It, more than any \nother scholarly work, was responsible for the creation of what we know \ntoday as the field of Holocaust Studies.\n  The great documentary filmmaker, Claude Lanzmann, spoke recently of \nhis discovery of Hilberg's book, which occurred as he was considering \nmaking the film that was to become ``Shoah.'' ``It took me months to \nget through this formidable, magnificent, monstrous book. Hilberg was a \nman of details, and that is what I especially liked. The first time he \nappears in ``Shoah'' he says, `All along, during my work, I never began \nwith the big questions because I feared inadequate answers.''' Lanzmann \ncontinues, ``He laid bare the implacable mechanism of what he held to \nbe a bureaucratic process of destruction. From the moment the German \nbureaucracy made its object, it could only go all the way, as through \ncarried by its own logic.''\n  Hilberg published other important books, among them ``Perpetrators, \nVictims, Bystanders'' and a memoir, ``The Politics of Memory.'' He \nedited ``The Warsaw Diaries of Adam Czerniakov,'' which was translated \nby his colleague, Stanislaw Staron.\n  But he was not just a scholar in an archive. As one of the Senate's \nrepresentatives on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, I am very aware \nof his work in the public sphere, work which richly supplemented his \ngreat contributions as an academic scholar. An original member of the \nPresident's Commission on the Holocaust, Raul Hilberg, played a central \nrole in the founding of the U.S. Holocaust Museum. He then served on \nthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council from 1980 through 1988, and further \nserved on the Museum's Academic Committee from its inception through \n2005.\n  His friend, Michael Berenbaum recently wrote this about his \ninvolvement with our Nation's great memorial to the ``Shoah'': ``For \nhis work with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Hilberg never once \naccepted remuneration, even when others were paid for their work. He \nwas a consistent, gracious and insisting presence demanding the highest \nof standards of others and measuring up to them himself.'' In his \nhonor, the museum has established the Raul Hilberg Scholarship.\n  For his great scholarly and public accomplishments, Raul Hilberg was \nnamed a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005.\n  An enthralling and inspiring teacher, Raul Hilberg will be missed by \nmany generations of students at the University of Vermont. The absence \nof his deep knowledge and unsparing honesty leaves the world of \nHolocaust studies bereft of its presiding genius. And his passing \nleaves a great loss in the lives of his wife, Gwendolyn and his \nchildren, David and Deborah.\n  Raul Hilberg's work, however, which so carefully details the \nbureaucracy of annihilation, will live on to serve as a constant \nreminder of the responsibilities that we have, as citizens and as \nindividuals, for the sufferings of others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11653-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMEMORATING THE RETIREMENT OF HANCEL PORTERFIELD\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Hank, as he is known, along with a handful of staff, \nhas been instrumental in giving new direction and cohesion to the \nMarine Corps' efforts to combat corrosion. Since being hired as the \nfirst Program Manager for USMC CPAC, Mr. Porterfield has been \ninstrumental in completely changing the direction of CPAC from a study \nprogram administered by the Naval Surface Warfare Command, NSWC, to a \nprogram serving the warfighter at the Marine Expeditionary Force, MEF, \nlevel.\n  Not only has Mr. Porterfield created a full service program with a \nworkforce of 95 people from Camp Lejeune to Okinawa in just 3\\1/2\\ \nyears, Mr. Porterfield also established a research and development arm \nto examine new products, procedures, and methods for reducing \ncorrosion. Recently, I had occasion to participate in a ribbon-cutting \nceremony for a U.S. Marines Corps corrosion prevention and control \ncomplex in Kaneohe Bay, HI, and had the privilege of meeting Mr. \nPorterfield in person. I was impressed by his dedication to duty and \nhis service and leadership in launching the USMC CPAC Program.\n  I would like to express my deepest appreciation and warmest aloha to \nMr. Porterfield. In government we all hope one person can make a \ndifference. I think Mr. Porterfield is one person who has made a \ndifference and leaves behind a legacy of success.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to establish a Volunteer Teacher Advisory Committee; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Teachers at \nthe Table Act of 2007. This bill is the Senate companion to legislation \nintroduced in the House of Representatives earlier this year by \nRepresentative Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Representative Lee \nTerry of Nebraska. I am pleased this legislation is cosponsored by my \ncolleagues, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator Blanche \nLincoln of Arkansas, and Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut.\n  This legislation would create a Volunteer Teacher Advisory Committee \nto advise Congress and the Department of Education on the impact of No \nChild Left Behind, NCLB, on students, their families, and the classroom \nlearning environment. The teachers serving on this Committee would be \nchosen from past or present state or national Teachers of the Year and \nwould be competitively selected by the Secretary of Education and the \nmajority and minority leaders of both the U.S. Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Every year I travel to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties to hold a \nlistening session to listen to Wisconsinites concerns and answer their \nquestions. Since NCLB was enacted in early 2002, education has rated as \none of the top issues brought up at my listening sessions. I have \nreceived feedback from constituents about the noble intentions of NCLB, \nbut I have also heard\n\n[[Page S11657]]\n\nabout the multitude of implementation problems with the law's \nprovisions. The feedback from teachers, parents, school administrators, \nand school board members has been invaluable over the past 5 years and \nyesterday, I introduced the Improving Student Testing Act of 2007 in \nresponse to some of that feedback.\n  The Teachers at the Table bill I am introducing today seeks to help \nensure that Congress and the Department of Education receive high-\nquality yearly feedback on how NCLB is impacting classroom learning \naround the country. The teachers who will serve on the committee will \nbe competitively chosen from past and present Teachers of the Year, who \nrepresent some of the best that teaching has to offer. The bill would \ncreate a committee of twenty teachers, with four selected by the \nSecretary of Education and four selected by each of the majority and \nminority leaders in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. These \nteachers would serve 2-year terms on the advisory committee and would \nwork to prepare annual reports to Congress as well as quarterly updates \non the law's implementation.\n  Every State and every school district is different and this \nlegislation ensures that the teacher advisory committee will represent \na wide range of viewpoints. The bill specifies that the volunteer \nteacher advisory committee should include teachers from diverse \ngeographic areas, teachers who teach different grade levels, and \nteachers from a variety of specialty areas. Creating a diverse \ncommittee will help ensure that the committee presents a broad range of \nviewpoints on NCLB to Congress and the Department of Education.\n  Much work needs to be done this fall to reform many of the mandates \nof NCLB and I look forward to working with my colleagues during the \nreauthorization to make those necessary changes. One thing is certain--\nwhatever form the reauthorized NCLB takes, there will be a need for \nconsistent feedback from a diverse range of viewpoints.\n  We need to ensure that the voices of students, educators, parents, \nand administrators, who are on the front-lines of education reform in \nour country, are heard during the reauthorization of NCLB this fall and \ngoing forward during the reauthorized law's implementation in years to \ncome. This bill seeks to help address that need by enlisting the \nservice of some of America's best teachers in providing information to \nFederal education policymakers. The advisory committee created by this \nlegislation will provide nationwide feedback and will allow Congress to \nhear about NCLB directly from those who deal with the law and its \nconsequences on a daily basis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Cantwell, \n        and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 2061. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nexempt certain home health workers from the provisions of such Act; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor, today, to \nintroduce the Fair Home Health Care Act of 2007 to recognize the \nextraordinary value of the services that home health care workers \nperform. This legislation is in response to a Supreme Court decision in \nJune that ruled that home care workers are not entitled to the \nprotections provided by the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  At the center of that case was a 73-year-old retiree named Evelyn \nCoke, who spent some two decades of her life cooking, bathing, feeding, \nand caring for the everyday medical needs of people who cannot take \ncare of themselves. Today, Evelyn Coke suffers from kidney failure. But \ndespite 20 years of working more than 40 hours a week, she can't afford \na home health care worker to take care of her. She sued her employer \nfor not paying time-and-a-half pay for all those hours that she worked \novertime but was denied premium pay by way of compensation. \nUnfortunately, Evelyn Coke lost her case before the Court because of an \noutdated exemption to the Federal minimum wage and overtime laws.\n  In 1974, Congress expanded the Fair Labor Standards Act, FLSA, \ninclude protections for most domestic workers, such as chauffeurs and \nhousekeepers. However, a narrow exemption was created for employees \nproviding ``companionship services'' to seniors and people with \ndisabilities. At that time, home care, like babysitting, was largely \nprovided by neighbors and friends.\n  In the three decades since the exemption was created, the numbers of \nhome care workers and their responsibilities have expanded dramatically \nas the population has aged and more and more people are choosing long-\nterm health care services in their homes rather than in institutions. \nThere are more than 1 million home care workers in the U.S. They \nprovide physically and emotionally demanding and often life-sustaining \ncare for the elderly and disabled still living in their own homes.\n  This bill brings together two issues that are very close to my \nheart--on the one hand, independent living and quality of life for \nseniors and people with disabilities, and, on the other hand, the basic \nrights of American workers to premium pay for overtime work. Service \nproviders and the people they serve agree on this: no one is served \nwell when home care workers are not paid a living wage. Home care \nworkers deserve fair pay. Seniors and people with disabilities deserve \ncontinuous relationships with home care aides that they can trust to \ndeliver the care that they need.\n  Last week, several constituents who provide these kinds of services \ncame to my office. One man, Pete Faust, has worked in home care \nsettings for 30 years. Pete makes $12 an hour and admits he has trouble \nmaking ends meet; the overtime pay he receives makes it possible to pay \nthe bills. He knows that he could go work somewhere else and make twice \nas much, but he worries that it is hard on his clients not to see the \nsame friendly familiar face on a regular basis.\n  Casey Cole is another of my constituents, and he is in a similar \nposition. He works 12 days in a row, and then gets two days off. Often, \nhowever, there isn't anyone else to cover the shifts when he is off, so \nhe will work 26 days in a row. Even his days off aren't really days \noff, because he's answering calls or checking in to make sure that all \nthe people under his care are getting their needs met.\n  Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a Pete Faust or a Casey Cole \nto help them out. There is a shortage of qualified home care workers, \nand of there is high turnover in the field. Some 86 percent of direct \ncare workers turn over every year. Almost 90 percent of homecare \nworkers are women, and they are predominantly minority women, making an \naverage of just $9 an hour.\n  The reason for the shortage of people to do this work is certainly \nnot a shortage of compassion. The problem is that people need to be \nable to make a living wage when they have their own families to take \ncare of. It is high time to grant these hard-working people the minimum \nwage and overtime protection. That is why I am introducing this \nlegislation, today.\n  The Fair Home Health Care Act will include home care workers under \nthe same rules that currently cover babysitters. That is to say, they \nwill be entitled to Fair Labor Standards Act protections if they are \nnot employed on a ``casual basis.'' Casual basis is defined as \nemployment on an irregular or intermittent basis, when the employee's \nprimary vocation is not the provision of homecare, the employee is not \nemployed by an agency other than the family or household using his or \nher services, and the employee does not work more than 20 hours per \nweek.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation. The \nbill will improve pay for hardworking caregivers, and it will increase \naccess to care for our Nation's seniors and people with disabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Reid, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Johnson, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Tester, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n        Domenici):\n  S. 2062. A bill to amend the Native American Housing Assistance and \nSelf-Determination Act of 1996 to reauthorize that Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n[[Page S11658]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am here today with my colleagues \nSenators Reid, Murkowski, Inouye, Johnson, Tester, Domenici and \nBingaman to introduce legislation to reauthorize and amend the Native \nAmerican Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, NAHASDA. This \nbill, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination \nReauthorization Act of 2007 will not only reauthorize the primary \nhousing programs for Indian Country but it will enhance the crucial \nservices provided under these programs.\n  The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act \nprovides formula-based block grant assistance to Indian tribes which \nallows them the flexibility to design housing programs to address the \nneeds of their communities. Since its adoption in 1996, the Native \nAmerican Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act has transformed \nthe way in which Indian housing is provided in the tribal communities. \nIt is clear that the programs have been very successful. For example, \nin 2006, Tribes have been able to build, acquire, or substantially \nrehabilitate more than 1,600 rental units and more than 6,000 \nhomeownership units. Each of these units became a home to an American \nIndian or Alaska Native family.\n  Even with these improvements, we are still facing a housing crisis in \nIndian Country. At the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs March and \nJuly hearings on Indian housing, we heard alarming statistics: 90,000 \nIndian families are homeless or under-housed. Approximately 40 percent \nof on-reservation housing is considered inadequate. Over one-third of \nIndian homes are overcrowded. More than 230,000 housing units are \nimmediately needed to provide adequate housing in Indian Country.\n  Tribal elders in the Northern Plains are living in homes without \nroofs, with only tarps to shield them from the harsh elements \nincluding below-zero temperatures. Indian children across the country \nare forced to live in overcrowded conditions in homes with 23 other \npeople or in trailers in the Northern Plains with wood stoves and no \nfresh drinking water. This is a national disgrace. How are children \nsupposed to grow and learn in these conditions and how are communities \nsupposed to thrive? This is particularly distressing given the fact \nthat funding for Indian housing has decreased over the last several \nyears, because it has not kept up with inflation and the rising cost of \nbuilding materials.\n\n  The U.S. has a trust responsibility to provide housing for our First \nAmericans. The bill my colleagues and I are introducing today will \nstrengthen NAHASDA by providing tribes with increased flexibility, with \nthe goal of producing more homes in Indian country. The amendments are \nincremental changes to current law. We realize that ``one size does not \nfit all'' in Indian housing. Housing needs in the Great Plains differ \ngreatly from those in the southwest. This is why we retained the basic \nstructure of the Indian Housing Block Grant Program, because through \nthis block grant program, tribes and tribal housing entities are able \nto use the funds to serve their unique needs.\n  NAHASDA works and with the amendments we are proposing, it will \ncontinue to improve housing conditions for American Indians and Alaska \nNatives. Please allow me to highlight some of the major amendments we \nare proposing.\n  Title I of the bill would reauthorize the Indian housing block grant \nand amend the program to streamline reporting requirements. Title I \nwill also allow Indian tribes to have increased flexibility in running \ntheir housing programs by allowing funds to be utilized for community \nbuildings such as day-care centers, Laundromats, and multi-purpose \ncommunity centers. Through housing we are not only building homes, but \nthe hope is to also build communities.\n  Title II of the bill creates a new Self-Determined Housing Activities \nprogram under which grant recipients may use a portion of their funding \nto meet their distinct needs in a self-determined manner. This title \nalso expands the list of activities that grant funds may be used for to \ninclude operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of rental and \nhomeownership units, mold remediation and necessary infrastructure.\n  Title III of the bill authorizes a study to assess the existing data \nsources for determining the need for housing for funding purposes, \nwhile Title VI creates a new demonstration project to allow grant \nrecipients to access vital economic development and infrastructure \nprograms.\n  I am committed to finding ways to provide more homes in Indian \nCountry. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination \nReauthorization Act of 2007 is an important and crucial step towards \nfulfilling this commitment. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2062\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible \nFiscal Action, to assure the economic security of the United States, \nand to expand future prosperity and growth for all Americans; to the \nCommittee on the Budget.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Judd Gregg, the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, \nlegislation we have called the\n\n[[Page S11663]]\n\nBipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action. We are introducing \nthis legislation because, as the chairman and ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, we understand that we are on an unsustainable fiscal \ncourse; that we confront a budgetary crisis of unprecedented \nproportions if we fail to act. That crisis will be caused by a \ncombination of our current budget deficits and enormous Federal debt, \ncombined with the explosion created by the baby boom generation.\n  Here is the outlook we confront with respect to the demographic tidal \nwave coming at us. We see, in 2007, we are at about 40 million people \nwho are of retirement age, and that will grow to 80 million by 2050, \ndramatically changing the budget circumstance for this country.\n  We know we face enormous challenges with Medicare and Social \nSecurity. You can see the long-term cost of Medicare. The shortfall \nover 75 years is now estimated at $33.9 trillion. The shortfall in \nSocial Security over that same period is $4.7 trillion. These are \nstaggering amounts, a shortfall in Medicare of almost $34 trillion, a \nshortfall in Social Security of over $4.7 trillion.\n  Looked at another way, Medicare and Medicaid spending, according to \nexperts, if it stays on the current course, will consume as much of our \nnational economy as the entire Federal budget does today.\n  Let me repeat that. If the trend lines continue, by 2050 we will be \nspending as much, just on Medicare and Medicaid, of our national income \nas we spend for the entire Federal Government today. This fundamentally \nthreatens the economic security of the country.\n\n  At the same time, we have tax cuts in place. they are extended, \naccording to the President's proposal, it will drive us right over the \ncliff.\n  This chart shows the Medicare deficits in purple, the Social Security \ndeficits in green, and the cost of extending the President's tax cuts \nin red. We can see the combined effect is to take us right over the \nfiscal cliff, deep into debt and deficit in a way that is \nunprecedented.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve said this about our budget \noutlook in January:\n\n       [O]ne might look at these projections and say, ``Well, \n     these are about 2030 and 2040 and so . . . we don't really \n     have to start worrying about it yet.'' But, in fact, the \n     longer we wait, the more severe, the more draconian, the more \n     difficult . . . the adjustments are going to be. I think the \n     right time to start is about 10 years ago.\n\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has it right.\n  Senator Gregg and I are coming to our colleagues today and calling \nfor this bipartisan task force for responsible fiscal action.\n  What would it do? Simply, it would be given the responsibility to \naddress our unsustainable long-term imbalances between spending and \nrevenue. Everything is on the table. The task force would consist of 16 \nmembers, 8 Democrats, 8 Republicans, all of them Members of Congress, \nexcept for 2 representing the administration. The Secretary of the \nTreasury would chair the task force. The obligation of this group would \nbe to submit a report on December 9, 2008. It would take 12 of the 16 \nmembers to report a blueprint for our fiscal future. They would be \ngiven the responsibility to find ways to address the shortfall in \nMedicare and Social Security and the ongoing and endemic budget \ndeficits. These 16 members, 8 Democrats, 8 Republicans, would have the \nopportunity and the responsibility to develop a plan for our fiscal \nfuture, but it would take 12 of the 16 to report a plan, and the plan \nwould only come at the beginning of the next administration. This would \nnot be part of election year politics. This would be part of a serious \nplan to address our long-term fiscal imbalances.\n\n  If 12 of the 16 agreed to a plan, it would then receive fast-track \ntreatment in the Senate. It would come to a vote without amendment \nafter 100 hours of debate. Final passage would require a supermajority, \n60 votes in the Senate, 60 percent of the House of Representatives.\n  Senator Gregg and I have worked on this all year. We have discussed \nthis with many Members in both the House and the Senate. This is our \nbest judgment of how best to proceed. We believe this would give the \nCongress and the country an opportunity to write a better fiscal \nfuture, one that would strengthen America, reduce our dependence on \nforeign capital and put us in a position to keep the promise that has \nbeen made to the American people of a country that is strong and fair, \nthat respects those in retirement and, at the same time, gives maximum \nopportunity to those working to strengthen their families and this \ncountry.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Gregg, the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, for the extraordinary time and effort he has put into \ndeveloping this proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed comments in the Record about \nthis proposal: Support for it from David Walker, the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States; support from the Concord Coalition, the \nbipartisan Concord Coalition that is well known for its support of a \nfiscally responsible future; and from the Committee for a Responsible \nFederal Budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Conrad/Gregg Task Force\n\n       I would like to thank and commend Chairman Conrad and \n     Senator Gregg for their leadership in connection with the \n     issue of fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity. \n     As I have noted on numerous occasions, our nation is on an \n     imprudent and unsustainable fiscal path. Tough choices are \n     required in order to help ensue that our future is better \n     than our past The sooner we make these choices the better \n     because time is working against us.\n       During the past two years, I have traveled to 23 states as \n     part of the Fiscal Wake-up Tour. During the Tour, it has \n     become clear that the American people are starved for two \n     things from their elected officials--truth and leadership. I \n     am here today because Senators Conrad and Gregg are trying to \n     address this need. I'm pleased to say that several other \n     members on both side of the political aisle and on both ends \n     of Capitol Hill are taking steps to answer this call by \n     proposing bills to accomplish similar objectives and by also \n     putting ``everything on the table.''\n       I was especially pleased to see that the ``Task Force'' \n     that would be created by Senator Conrad's and Gregg's \n     legislation was informed by GAO's work on the key elements \n     necessary for any task force or commission to be successful. \n     For example, the commission would have a statutory basis, be \n     bipartisan, involve leaders from both the executive and \n     legislative branch, and would require a super-majority vote \n     for any recommendations to be sent to the President and the \n     Congress. As a result, the Conrad-Gregg proposal provides one \n     potential means to achieve an objective we all should share--\n     taking steps to make the tough choices necessary to Keep \n     America Great, and to help make sure that our country's, \n     children's and grandchildren's future is better than our \n     past. Hopefully, this and other related bills will be given \n     serious and timely consideration by the Congress and the \n     President.\n       Thank you Senators Conrad and Gregg for your leadership and \n     thank you for the opportunity to join the both of you today.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Concord Coalition, Sept. 18, 2007]\n\n  Concord Coalition Praises Senators Conrad and Gregg for Bipartisan \n            Initiative To Address Long-Term Fiscal Imbalance\n\n       Washington.--The Concord Coalition today praised Senate \n     Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Ranking \n     Member Judd Gregg (R-NH) for introducing legislation that \n     would create a bipartisan commission charged with developing \n     specific solutions to the nation's long-term fiscal \n     imbalance.\n       ``There is very little dispute that current fiscal policies \n     are unsustainable. Yet, too few of our elected leaders in \n     Washington are willing to acknowledge the seriousness of the \n     long-term fiscal problem and even fewer are willing to put it \n     on the political agenda. By focusing attention on this \n     critical issue and insisting that it must be dealt with in a \n     bipartisan manner, Senators Conrad and Gregg are setting a \n     very positive example,'' said Concord Coalition Executive \n     Director Robert L. Bixby.\n       Changing course to a more sustainable path will require \n     hard choices, the active involvement of the American people \n     and suspension of partisan trench warfare. Since the regular \n     legislative process has been incapable of dealing with the \n     impending fiscal crisis, a new bipartisan commission makes \n     sense as a means of jump-starting serious action,'' Bixby \n     said.\n       In Concord's view, several aspects of this proposal are \n     promising:\n       First, the commission would have equal representation from \n     Democrats and Republicans. It would thus be truly \n     bipartisan--an essential element for success.\n       Second, the commission would have a broad mandate to \n     address the overall fiscal imbalance, not just the actuarial \n     imbalance of individual programs.\n       Third, there are no preconditions. If either side sets \n     preconditions, the other side will not participate.\n\n[[Page S11664]]\n\n       Fourth, the commission's recommendations would be given an \n     up or down vote in Congress. Absent that, the report would \n     likely join many others on a shelf.\n       ``This proposal, and others like it that are now being put \n     forward, are very welcome. Our experience with the Fiscal \n     Wake-Up Tour is that the public is hungry for a nonpartisan \n     dialogue on the long-term fiscal challenge. When presented \n     with the facts, they appreciate that each of the realistic \n     options comes with economic and political consequences that \n     must be carefully weighed, and that there must be tradeoffs. \n     This commission would help to clarify those trade-offs and \n     establish a process for resolving them,'' Bixby said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n [From the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Sept. 18, 2007]\n\n               CRFB Praises Bipartisan Task Force Effort\n\n       Washington, DC.--Today, the Committee for a Responsible \n     Federal Budget applauded the effort by Senators Conrad and \n     Gregg to form a Bipartisan Task Force on Responsible Fiscal \n     Action.\n       ``This is precisely the type of bipartisan collaboration we \n     need to jumpstart the discussion of how to confront the \n     nation's fiscal challenges,'' said Maya MacGuineas, President \n     of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ``Bringing \n     together sitting Members of Congress and representatives from \n     the Administration to discuss these daunting challenges and \n     evaluate the options for reform is a critical first step. We \n     applaud the effort to get this discussion underway and very \n     much hope that it leads to the hard choices that are needed \n     to rebalance the federal government's budget.''\n       The task force would be made up of sixteen members. Seven \n     would come from the House of Representatives (four appointed \n     by the Speaker of the House and three appointed by the \n     Minority Leader of the House); seven would come from the \n     Senate (four appointed by the Majority Leader of the Senate \n     and three appointed by the Minority Leader of the Senate); \n     and two would come from the Administration (one of whom would \n     be the Secretary of the Treasury, who would serve as the \n     Chairman of the task force). The task force would review all \n     areas of the budget including Social Security, Medicare, and \n     taxes. The task force would be responsible for submitting a \n     set of policy recommendations to improve the federal \n     government's fiscal imbalances, which would then be \n     considered by Congress on an expedited basis.\n       While the specific mission of the task force--to \n     significantly improve the long-term fiscal balance of the \n     federal government--is somewhat vague, it nonetheless \n     represents an important effort to begin discussing these \n     issues on a bipartisan basis with no preconditions regarding \n     the policy options which can be considered. The Committee for \n     a Responsible Budget supports the creation of a Bipartisan \n     Task Force as an important first step to addressing the \n     country's fiscal policy challenges.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, I recognize my colleague, the very able Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Let me begin by thanking the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad, for moving forward with this important \neffort to try to reach a conclusion and progress on the most \nsignificant issue this Nation faces beyond our fight with Islamic \nterrorism. In the post-Katrina world, if the country knew that a \ncategory 5 hurricane was headed at us, we knew where it was going to \nhit, we knew the size of the hurricane, and we knew the damage it would \ndo, the Government would be absolutely irresponsible not to respond to \nthat.\n  What we have coming at us is a category 5 fiscal hurricane. We know \nwhen it is going to hit, and that is when the baby boom generation \nretires and begins to retire next year and reaches its peak in its \nretirement size by about the year 2025. We know the impact of the \nproblem, the size of the problem, that there is $62 trillion of \nunfunded liability which will be generated by the retirement of the \nbaby boom generation to pay for the benefits under Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security.\n  To try to put that in context, that is more than the entire net worth \nof all of America--all our homes, cars, stocks, all our assets. That is \nhow big this liability is. We know the effect of this category 5 fiscal \nhurricane because we know it is going to basically wipe out the ability \nof our children and our children's children to have as high a quality \nof life as we have had because the cost of paying for this fiscal \ntsunami will be so high.\n  We need to get on to the issue of trying to address this looming \nthreat. As the Comptroller General said today, we have a category 5 \nhurricane headed at us and people are still playing on the beach as if \nthe wave is not going to arrive. Well, the wave is going to arrive. So \nwhat the chairman of the Budget Committee has put forward today--and I \nam honored to have the opportunity to participate in this effort--is a \nproposal to move forward with substantive and definitive legislation \nwhich will result in action. That is what we need--action. It is \nsimilar to the old Fram oil filter ad: You can pay me now or you can \npay me later. If we act now, the cost is going to be less than if we \nact later.\n  So this proposal, which has been put together after a lot of thought \nand effort on behalf of myself and Senator Conrad, is basically built \naround three concepts. First, that there must be absolute \nbipartisanship. So as Senator Conrad has outlined, the task force, when \nit meets, must have a three-fourths vote in favor of whatever proposal \nthey bring forward. Secondly, everything has to be on the table. \nNothing can be off. After all the discussion, in order for this to \nwork, all these parts interplay with each other, you have to be willing \nto address not only reform and how you deliver better benefits at a \nlower cost under Medicare and Medicaid and better benefits at a \nreasonable cost under Social Security, but you also have to address the \ntax side of the ledger. So everything needs to be on the table. Third, \nthat for this to work, there has to be an action-forcing mechanism. We \nhave seen report after report, commission after commission. A lot of \nthem have done excellent work. But on these issues, which are such hot \nbuttons, what happens is, a commission will make a report, and all the \ninterest groups will attack it from this side and that side and the \nnext side. So this proposal is structured so there is an action-forcing \nevent; specifically, fast-track approval which, again, has to be by a \nsupermajority of the final report of the task force.\n  This truly is an opportunity to move forward to address this issue. \nOur failure to do so would be truly ironic because the problem which we \nconfront as a nation, which I say is probably the single biggest issue \nafter the war on Islamic terrorism, fighting the war against Islamic \nterrorism, is that this fiscal category 5 hurricane is headed toward \nus, which is essentially going to wipe out our children's opportunity \nto have a quality of lifestyle equal to ours, is totally the \nresponsibility of the present generation who is governing, the baby \nboom generation. We are the generation of governance today. So before \nwe pass our problem on to the next generation, we have a responsibility \nto address it and to try to improve the effort.\n  I know, as I look around this Chamber and at this administration, \nthere are people of goodwill who, given the right structure, which this \ntask force is, would be willing to come together, make the difficult \ndecisions, and have the expertise to know how to make those decisions \nto move maybe not a complete resolution of these issues but a \nsignificant resolution of the issues down the road so the next \ngeneration does not have to bear the whole burden of resolving the \nproblems. It is time to act.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Budget Committee for being the \nforce behind getting this effort going. It is a very positive \ninitiative. I think it will be received very well on our side of the \naisle. I believe strongly that the administration will receive it well. \nTherefore, I believe we have a great opportunity to move forward in a \nway which will make sure our children and their children have as good a \ncountry and as strong a country from the standpoint of fiscal policy as \nwe have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I again thank my colleague, Senator \nGregg, who has been incredibly engaged in this effort. He is very \nfairminded in the structure of this proposal and I think visionary in \nterms of understanding the need for action.\n  I say to my colleagues or staffs who may be listening, all those who \nrecognize we are headed for a fiscal cliff and that we need to take \naction, this is our opportunity. This is it. Those who say we have to \ndo something, here is our chance. This is completely bipartisan, eight \nDemocrats, eight Republicans. It takes 12 of the 16 to make a report, a \nsupermajority; that is, to assure it is bipartisan in result. This is a \ntask\n\n[[Page S11665]]\n\nforce of Members of Congress and representatives of the administration, \n14 Members of Congress, 2 representatives of the administration. It is \nnot outside experts, people who would not be responsible or be held \naccountable for the outcome. These will be people who are accountable, \nwho are responsible for the outcome. This is a measure that will lead \nto a vote.\n  I say to my colleagues, this will assure that the work of this group \nwill come before the Congress if 12 of the 16 agree. Because if they \ndo, there will then be 100 hours of debate but no amendment permitted, \nand there will be a vote up or down. Those who recognize it takes us \nworking together to face up to these difficult problems, I ask them to \njoin with us, Republicans and Democrats. Absent this, I suspect what \nwill happen is further delay, further divisiveness, and no real result. \nThat will mean even tougher choices in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to think carefully of this moment. This will not \nbe considered until after the election. We have done everything we can \nto take election politics out of this, understanding it is highly \nunlikely that a matter of this import would be considered in an \nelection year and that perhaps the best opportunity is at the beginning \nof a new administration. None of us know whether the new administration \nwill be a Republican or a Democratic administration. None of us can \nknow the makeup of the next Congress. What we do know is we face a \nticking timebomb. The faster we act, the better for our Nation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator made an excellent point that we are \nnow in a Presidential election. This Commission is a gift to those \ncandidates because they can come forward and point to this Commission \nas taking on some of the most complicated issues they are going to \nface. Because this timebomb--which is an appropriate description, using \nthe Senator's words--is going to start to explode, and the explosion \nwill be rather large during the term of the next Presidency.\n  So this is an opportunity to give those candidates for President a \nforum and a procedure where these issues, which are so critical to the \nsuccess of the next Presidency, can actually be moved down the road \ntoward resolution. Is that not true?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. I had a number of my colleagues, as \nthe Senator knows, come to me with great concern. Their concern was: \nGee, you are putting the Presidential candidates in an awkward \nposition. How are they going to react to this? My reaction was: This is \na gift to all the Presidential candidates, this is a gift to the next \nadministration because this will provide them a bipartisan blueprint on \nhow to proceed with some of the most vexing issues facing this country.\n  So I see absolutely no downside for either side, Republican or \nDemocratic--for Presidential candidates on either side or candidates \nfor Congress on either side--because this is a process leading to a \nproposal that would have bipartisan support if it is to proceed.\n  If I were an incoming administration, I would welcome a bipartisan \nplan to deal with Social Security, with Medicare, with the growth of \ndeficits and the debt, and not to have it come in the middle of an \nelection but to only be presented after the election but before the \nnext Congress meets and the next administration takes on its \nresponsibilities.\n  I see it as not only a gift to the candidates but, more importantly, \nas a gift to the American people to take on some of the greatest \nchallenges facing our country and to do it in a bipartisan way and to \ndo it in a way that actually leads to a result and action.\n  Mr. GREGG. I once again congratulate the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for his exceptional leadership in this area. This is the \nfirst step in a bipartisan effort which, hopefully, will lead to a \nbipartisan solution that America will see as fair and which will pass \non to our children a stronger and more vital Nation.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I again thank my colleague. This is the beginning of an \neffort. I ask colleagues on both sides, please, join us in this effort. \nLet's do what we all know must happen--that we must take on these \nissues, that we must come up with solutions, and we must do it sooner \nrather than later.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2064. A bill to fund comprehensive programs to ensure an adequate \nsupply of nurses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Americans depend on nurses to deliver \nquality patient care, yet our Nation faces a critical shortage of \nnurses. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that more than 1.2 \nmillion new and replacement nurses will be needed by 2014 to keep up \nwith the aging Baby Boomer population and the increased demand for \nhealth care.\n  To avoid this dramatic shortage, we need to reach a significant and \nsustained increase in the number of nurses entering the workforce each \nyear. We can do this by building on the current health care workforce. \nNurses who advance from other health care positions are better prepared \nto meet the demands of the bedside because they are more aware of the \nwork environment and ready to meet its unique challenges. They also \nrequire less time in orientation than new workers and represent a \ndiverse population more representative of the patients being served.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce legislation that will foster career \nladders for current health care workers who are ready to upgrade their \nskills. Our health care system is an untapped resource in the effort to \nincrease the supply of nurses. Many people in the health care workforce \nare in entry level jobs that don't always offer opportunities for \nadvancement. For much of this population, advanced education is \nunaffordable and unattainable.\n  The Nurse Training and Retention Act offers incumbent health care \nworkers realistic options to enhance their skills, advance their \ncareers, and meet the growing demand for nurses. The legislation \nauthorizes the Department of Labor to award grants to support training \nprograms for health care workers. Health aides can use these programs \nto earn a certificate or degree in nursing. Nurses can upgrade their \nskills and qualifications so that they can serve as nurse faculty, \nwhich would help relieve the backlog of qualified applicants who aren't \nin nursing school because of the lack of faculty.\n  Programs administered by joint labor/management training partnerships \nhave made great progress in the effort to educate and retain nurses. \nThe proposed grant program builds on the good work these partnerships \nhave done, and encourages further collaboration with colleges and \nuniversities. The combination of support at the workplace and \ncollaboration with nursing schools to meet the needs of the non \ntraditional student has led to strong performance by these students in \nnursing school. These new nurses have higher retention rates than \nother, more traditional students who do not have work experience in the \nfield. Another benefit of the career ladder is that these \ncollaborations are building a more diverse nursing workforce.\n  Another important player in this process is the employer. That is why \nmy bill asks employers of incumbent health care workers to invest in \nthe training programs. This completes the partnership, so that labor, \nemployer, and the participating school are all working together to \nretain and grow the health care workforce we have today.\n  Nurses play an invaluable role in patient care in this country. \nUnless we do something today to improve the way we train and retain \nnurses, we face a severe shortage within the next decade. The Nurse \nTraining and Retention Act can help us tap an overlooked resource by \nensuring those who are in the health care industry have a chance to \nmove up in their field, while expanding the supply of nurses and nurse \nfaculty. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2064\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse Training and Retention \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n[[Page S11666]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) America's healthcare system depends on an adequate \n     supply of trained nurses to deliver quality patient care.\n       (2) Over the next 15 years, this shortage is expected to \n     grow significantly. The Health Resources and Services \n     Administration has projected that by 2020, there will be a \n     shortage of nurses in every State and that overall only 64 \n     percent of the demand for nurses will be satisfied, with a \n     shortage of 1,016,900 nurses nationally.\n       (3) To avert such a shortage, today's network of healthcare \n     workers should have access to education and support from \n     their employers to participate in educational and training \n     opportunities.\n       (4) With the appropriate education and support, incumbent \n     healthcare workers and incumbent bedside nurses are untapped \n     sources which can meet these needs and address the nursing \n     shortage and provide quality care as the American population \n     ages.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     authorize grants to--\n       (1) address the projected shortage of nurses by funding \n     comprehensive programs to create a career ladder to nursing \n     (including Certified Nurse Assistants, Licensed Practical \n     Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Registered Nurses) \n     for incumbent ancillary healthcare workers;\n       (2) increase the capacity for educating nurses by \n     increasing both nurse faculty and clinical opportunities \n     through collaborative programs between staff nurse \n     organizations, healthcare providers, and accredited schools \n     of nursing; and\n       (3) provide training programs through education and \n     training organizations jointly administered by healthcare \n     providers and healthcare labor organizations or other \n     organizations representing staff nurses and frontline \n     healthcare workers, working in collaboration with accredited \n     schools of nursing and academic institutions.\n       (b) Grants.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor (referred to in \n     this section as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a \n     partnership grant program to award grants to eligible \n     entities to carry out comprehensive programs to provide \n     education to nurses and create a pipeline to nursing for \n     incumbent ancillary healthcare workers who wish to advance \n     their careers, and to otherwise carry out the purposes of \n     this section.\n       (c) Eligible Entities.--To be eligible to receive a grant \n     under this section an entity shall--\n       (1) be--\n       (A) a healthcare entity that is jointly administered by a \n     healthcare employer and a labor union representing the \n     healthcare employees of the employer and that carries out \n     activities using labor management training funds as provided \n     for under section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, \n     1947 (18 U.S.C. 186(c)(6));\n       (B) an entity that operates a training program that is \n     jointly administered by--\n       (i) one or more healthcare providers or facilities, or a \n     trade association of healthcare providers; and\n       (ii) one or more organizations which represent the \n     interests of direct care healthcare workers or staff nurses \n     and in which the direct care healthcare workers or staff \n     nurses have direct input as to the leadership of the \n     organization; or\n       (C) a State training partnership program that consist of \n     non-profit organizations that include equal participation \n     from industry, including public or private employers, and \n     labor organizations including joint labor-management training \n     programs, and which may include representatives from local \n     governments, worker investment agency one-stop career \n     centers, community based organizations, community colleges, \n     and accredited schools of nursing; and\n       (2) submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in \n     such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary \n     may require.\n       (d) Additional Requirements for Healthcare Employer \n     Described in Subsection (c).--To be eligible for a grant \n     under this section, a healthcare employer described in \n     subsection (c) shall demonstrate--\n       (1) an established program within their facility to \n     encourage the retention of existing nurses;\n       (2) it provides wages and benefits to its nurses that are \n     competitive for its market or that have been collectively \n     bargained with a labor organization; and\n       (3) support for programs funded under this section through \n     1 or more of the following:\n       (A) The provision of paid leave time and continued health \n     coverage to incumbent healthcare workers to allow their \n     participation in nursing career ladder programs, including \n     Certified Nurse Assistants, Licensed Practical Nurses, \n     Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Registered Nurses.\n       (B) Contributions to a joint labor-management training fund \n     which administers the program involved.\n       (C) The provision of paid release time, incentive \n     compensation, or continued health coverage to staff nurses \n     who desire to work full- or part-time in a faculty position.\n       (D) The provision of paid release time for staff nurses to \n     enable them to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Nursing \n     degree, other advanced nursing degrees, specialty training, \n     or certification program.\n       (E) The payment of tuition assistance which is managed by a \n     joint labor-management training fund or other jointly \n     administered program.\n       (e) Other Requirements.--\n       (1) Matching requirement.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary may not make a grant under \n     this section unless the applicant involved agrees, with \n     respect to the costs to be incurred by the applicant in \n     carrying out the program under the grant, to make available \n     non-Federal contributions (in cash or in kind under \n     subparagraph (B)) toward such costs in an amount equal to not \n     less than $1 for each $1 of Federal funds provided in the \n     grant.

Con. Res. 47\n\n       Whereas President Harry S.

Patrick, William ``Billy'' Mitchell, Benjamin D. \n     Foulois, Frank M. Andrews, Henry ``Hap'' Arnold, James \n     ``Jimmy'' H. Doolittle, and Edward ``Eddie'' Rickenbacker, \n     were among the first to recognize the military potential of \n     air power and courageously forged the foundations for the \n     creation of an independent arm for air forces in the United \n     States in the decades following World War I;\n       Whereas on June 20, 1941, the Department of War created the \n     Army Air Forces (AAF) as its aviation element and shortly \n     thereafter the Department of War made the AAF co-equal to the \n     Army Ground Forces;\n       Whereas General Henry H. ``Hap'' Arnold drew upon the \n     industrial prowess and human resources of the United States \n     to transform the Army Air Corps from a force of 22,400 men \n     and 2,402 aircraft in 1939 to a peak wartime strength of 2.4 \n     million personnel and 79,908 aircraft;\n       Whereas the standard for courage, flexibility, and \n     intrepidity in combat was established for all Airmen during \n     the first aerial raid in the Pacific Theater on April 18, \n     1942, when Lieutenant Colonel James ``Jimmy'' H.

Truman supported organizing air \n     power as an equal arm of the military forces of the United \n     States, writing on December 19, 1945, that air power had \n     developed so that the responsibilities and contributions to \n     military strategic planning of air power equaled those of \n     land and sea power;\n       Whereas on September 18, 1947, W. Stuart Symington became \n     the first Secretary of the newly formed and independent \n     United States Air Force (USAF), and on September 26, 1947, \n     General Carl A. Spaatz became the first Chief of Staff of the \n     USAF;\n       Whereas the Air National Guard was also created by the \n     National Security Act of 1947 and has played a vital role in \n     guarding the United States and defending freedom in nearly \n     every major conflict and contingency since its inception;\n       Whereas on October 14, 1947, the USAF demonstrated its \n     historic and ongoing commitment to technological innovation \n     when Captain Charles ``Chuck'' Yeager piloted the X-1 \n     developmental rocket plane to a speed of Mach 1.07, becoming \n     the first flyer to break the sound barrier in a powered \n     aircraft in level flight;\n       Whereas the USAF Reserve, created April 14, 1948, is \n     comprised of Citizen Airmen who steadfastly sacrifice \n     personal fortune and family comfort in order to serve as \n     unrivaled wingmen of the active duty USAF in every \n     deployment, mission, and battlefield around the globe;\n       Whereas the USAF operated the Berlin Airlift in 1948 and \n     1949 to provide humanitarian relief to post-war Germany and \n     has established a tradition of humanitarian assistance in \n     responding to natural disasters and needs across the world;\n       Whereas the USAF announced a policy of racial integration \n     in the ranks of the USAF on April 26, 1948, 3 months prior to \n     a Presidential mandate to integrate all military services;\n       Whereas in the early years of the Cold War, the USAF's \n     arsenal of bombers, such as the long-range Convair B-58 \n     Hustler and B-36 Peacemaker, and the Boeing B-47 Stratojet \n     and B-52 Stratofortress, under the command of General Curtis \n     LeMay served as the United States' preeminent deterrent \n     against Soviet Union forces and were later augmented by the \n     development and deployment of medium range and \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as the Titan and \n     Minuteman developed by General Bernard A. Schriever;\n       Whereas the USAF, employing the first large-scale combat \n     use of jet aircraft, helped to establish air superiority over \n     the Korean peninsula, protected ground forces of the United \n     Nations with close air support, and interdicted enemy \n     reinforcements and supplies during the conflict in Korea;\n       Whereas after the development of launch vehicles and \n     orbital satellites, the mission of the USAF expanded into \n     space and today provides exceptional real-time global \n     communications, environmental monitoring, navigation, \n     precision timing, missile warning, nuclear deterrence, and \n     space surveillance;\n       Whereas USAF Airmen have contributed to the manned space \n     program of the United States since the program's inception \n     and throughout the program's development at the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration by dedicating themselves \n     wholly to space exploration despite the risks of exploration;\n       Whereas the USAF engaged in a limited campaign of air power \n     to assist the South Vietnamese government in countering the \n     communist Viet Cong guerillas during the Vietnam War and \n     fought to disrupt supply lines, halt enemy ground offensives, \n     and protect United States and Allied forces;\n       Whereas Airmen were imprisoned and tortured during the \n     Vietnam War and, in the valiant tradition of Airmen held \n     captive in previous conflicts, continued serving the United \n     States with honor and dignity under the most inhumane \n     circumstances;\n       Whereas, in recent decades, the USAF and coalition partners \n     of the United States have supported successful actions in \n     Panama, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     many other locations around the globe;\n       Whereas Pacific Air Forces, along with Asia-Pacific \n     partners of the United States, ensure peace and advance \n     freedom from the west coast of the United States to the east \n     coast of Africa and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, \n     covering more than 100 million square miles and the homes of \n     2 billion people in 44 countries;\n       Whereas the United States Air Forces in Europe, along with \n     European partners of the United States, have shaped the \n     history of Europe from World War II, the Cold War, Operation \n     Deliberate Force, and Operation Allied Force to today's \n     operations, and secured stability and ensured freedom's \n     future in the Europe, Africa, and Southwest Asia;\n       Whereas, for 17 consecutive years beginning with 1990, \n     Airmen have been engaged in full-time combat operations \n     ranging from Desert Shield to Iraqi Freedom, and have shown \n     themselves to be an expeditionary air and space force of \n     outstanding capability ready to fight and win wars of the \n     United States when and where Airmen are called upon to do so;\n       Whereas the USAF is steadfast in its commitment to field a \n     world-class, expeditionary air force by recruiting, training, \n     and educating its Total Force of active duty, Air National \n     Guard, Air Force Reserve, and civilian personnel;\n       Whereas the USAF is a trustworthy steward of resources, \n     developing and applying technology, managing professional \n     acquisition programs, and maintaining exacting test, \n     evaluation, and sustainment criteria for all USAF weapon \n     systems throughout such weapon systems' life cycles;\n       Whereas, when terrorists attacked the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, USAF fighter and air refueling aircraft \n     took to the skies to fly combat air patrols over major United \n     States cities and protect families, friends, and neighbors of \n     people of the United States from further attack;\n       Whereas, on December 7, 2005, the USAF modified its mission \n     statement to include flying and fighting in cyberspace and \n     prioritized the development, maintenance, and sustainment of \n     war fighting capabilities to deliver unrestricted access to \n     cyberspace and defend the United States and its global \n     interests;\n       Whereas Airmen around the world are committed to fighting \n     and winning the Global War on Terror and have flown more than \n     430,000 sorties to precisely target and engage insurgents who \n     attempt to violently disrupt rebuilding in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan;\n       Whereas talented and dedicated Airmen will meet the future \n     challenges of an ever-changing world with strength and \n     resolve;\n       Whereas the USAF, together with its joint partners, will \n     continue to be the United States' leading edge in the ongoing \n     fight to ensure the safety and security of the United States;

Mr. President, today is a landmark day in our nation's \nstruggle to achieve access to mental health services for all Americans. \nThe Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 reflects a major agreement by the \nmental health community, business leaders, and the insurance industry \nto guarantee that persons with mental health needs receive fair and \nequitable health insurance. Its passage will mean dramatic new help for \n113 million Americans who today are without mental health care and \ntreatment.\n  Access to such care and treatment is one of the most important and \nneglected civil rights issues facing the nation. For too long, persons \nliving with mental disorders have suffered discriminatory treatment at \nall levels of society. They have been forced to pay more for the \nservices they need and to worry about their job security if their \nemployer learns of their condition. Sadly, in America today, patients \nwith biochemical problems in their livers receive better care and \ngreater compassion than patients with biochemical problems in their \nbrains.\n  This bill will help end such unacceptable discrimination. As we have \nseen in the recent bipartisan CHIP legislation, no one questions the \nneed for affordable treatment of physical illnesses, but those who \nsuffer from mental illnesses face serious barriers in obtaining the \ncare they need at a cost they can afford.\n  Like those suffering from physical illnesses, persons with mental \ndisorders deserve the opportunity for quality care. The failure to \nobtain treatment can mean years of shattered dreams, unfulfilled \npotential and broken lives.\n  The need is clear. One in five Americans will suffer some form of \nmental illness this year, but only a third of them will receive \ntreatment. Millions of our fellow citizens are unnecessarily enduring \nthe pain and sadness of seeing a family member, friend, or loved one \nsuffer illnesses that seize the mind and break the spirit.\n  Battling mental illness is a difficult process, but discrimination \nagainst persons with such illnesses is especially cruel, since the \nsuccess rates for treatment often equal or surpass those for physical \nconditions. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, \nclinical depression treatment can be 70 percent successful, and \ntreatment for schizophrenia can be 60 percent successful.\n  Eleven years ago, a bipartisan majority in Congress approved the \noriginal Mental Health Parity Act. That legislation was an important \nfirst step in bringing attention to discriminatory practices against \nthe mentally ill, but it did little to correct the injustices that so \nmany Americans continue to face. This bill takes the actions needed to \nend the long-standing discrimination against persons with mental \nillness.\n  Over the years we have heard compelling testimony from experts, \nactivists, and patients about the need to equalize coverage of physical \nand mental illnesses. Some of the most forceful testimony came several \nyears ago from Lisa Cohen, a hardworking American from New Jersey, who \nsuffers from both physical and mental illnesses, and is forced to pay \nexorbitant costs for treating her mental disorder, while paying very \nlittle for her physical disorder. Lisa is typical of millions of \nAmericans for whom the burden of mental illness is compounded by the \nburden of unfair discrimination.\n  No Americans should be denied equal treatment for an illness because \nit involves the brain instead of the heart, the lungs, or other parts \nof their body. Mental health parity is a good investment for the \nNation. The costs from lost worker productivity and extra physical care \noutweigh the costs of implementing parity for mental health treatment.\n  Study after study has shown that parity makes good financial sense. \nMental illness imposes a huge financial burden on the Nation. It costs \nus $300 billion each year in treatment expenses, lost worker \nproductivity, and crime. This country can afford mental health parity. \nWhat we can't afford is to continue denying persons with mental \ndisorders the care they need.\n  But equal treatment of those affected by mental illness is not just \nan insurance issue. It is a civil rights issue. At its heart, mental \nhealth parity is a question of simple justice.\n  Today is a turning point. We are finally moving toward ending this \nshameful form of discrimination in our society--discrimination against \npersons with mental illness. This bill is a true commitment by the \ninsurance industry, business industry and the mental health community \nto bring fairness and dignity to the millions of Americans who have \nbeen second class patients for too long.\n  The 1996 act was an important step towards ending health insurance \ndiscrimination against mental illness. This bill takes another large \nstep to close the loopholes that remain.\n  We would not be here without the strong commitment and skillful \ndetermination of the late Senator Paul Wellstone and Senator Pete \nDomenici. They deserve immense credit for their bipartisan leadership \non mental health parity.\n  I also commend the staff, both Democrat and Republican, who worked so \nlong and hard on this legislation. I particularly thank Carolyn Gluck \nof Senator Reid's office and all the Democratic staff who worked in \nrecent weeks to help us produce the bill we have today.\n  I also commend Ed Hild of Senator Domenici's staff and Andrew Patzman \nof Senator Enzi's staff for the many hours they spent with my staff to \nnegotiate the bill.\n  On my staff, I especially commend several who worked so long and hard \nand well on this legislation--Michael Myers, Carmel Martin, Kelsey \nPhipps, Daniel Dawes, Jennie Fay, Ches Garrison, and above all Connie \nGarner, whose passion, counsel and commitment I value so highly on this \nand many other issues. Without her dedicated guidance, we would not be \nat this important threshold today.\n  My hope is that as we improve access to mental health services for \nall Americans, we will also help end the stigma and discrimination \nagainst those with mental illness. Mental illnesses are treatable and \ncurable, and it is high time to bring relief to those who suffer from \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues and sponsors of \nthis legislation, Senators Domenici and Kennedy, for their long and \ntireless work bringing us to passage of this bill tonight.\n  This legislation is literally years, if not decades in the making, \nand reflects countless hours of sweat and negotiation.\n  With much effort and indispensable help, we managed to bring together \nlong-opposed advocates from the mental health advocacy, provider, \nemployer, and insurance communities around a solid, responsible, \nbipartisan, and long-overdue bill.\n  Passage of this bill is a beacon example of what can be accomplished \nwhen people roll up their sleeves and work together in a bipartisan \nway.\n  This legislation will bring fairness and relief to millions of \nAmericans suffering from mental illness. The road is not yet over, but \ntonight is a tremendous step forward.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Passage of the Mental Health Parity Act of \n2007 is an important victory for individuals who are affected by mental \nillnesses. Over a decade has passed since we enacted the landmark 1996 \nmental health parity law that was championed by my good friend, the \nlate Senator Paul Wellstone, and Senator Domenici. Before his untimely \ndeath, Paul Wellstone was a tireless and eloquent advocate for \nlegislation that would strengthen the 1996 law and achieve full parity \nin coverage between mental and physical illnesses.\n  The Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 is the culmination of many years \nof work to build on and strengthen the 1996 Mental Health Parity Act. \nIt is a good compromise that will ensure that plans covering mental \nhealth services cannot provide different financial requirements or \ntreatment limitations than they would for medical or surgical benefits. \nThis legislation is long overdue and I will continue to work to ensure \nit is enacted as soon as possible.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 558, the Mental \nHealth Parity Act of 2007. After many months of negotiations, I am \npleased to call myself a strong supporter of this legislation. I thank \nthe Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and pensions Committee and \nthe senior Senator\n\n[[Page S11682]]\n\nfrom New Mexico for working with me and congratulate them on passage of \nS. 558. They and their staff have worked long hours to craft this \ncompromise bill. Supporters of mental health parity, old and new, \nshould commend the leadership of Senators Kennedy and Domenici for \ntheir years of commitment and struggle to pass expanded Federal mental \nhealth parity legislation.\n  Millions of Americans are affected by mental illness. Each year, more \nthan 50 million American adults will suffer from a mental disorder. All \nof us know a friend, a relative, a neighbor, a colleague whose life has \nbeen touched by mental illness, either their own or the illness of a \nloved one. Yet despite the compelling need, under many health plans, \nmental health benefits are much more limited than benefits for medical \nor surgical care. Even though a range of effective treatments exist for \nalmost all mental disorders, those suffering from mental illness often \nface increased barriers to care and the stigma that underlies \ndiscriminatory practices in how we treat mental illness. These are the \nindividuals that have insurance. It can only be worse for those without \ninsurance. Mental health must not take a backseat to other health \nconditions.\n  My own State of Connecticut recognized the disparity between \ninsurance coverage for physical and mental illness and made significant \nsteps to address it by enacting strong mental health parity and \nconsumer protection laws. These laws far exceed what exists currently \nat the Federal level and I believe the bill being passed by the Senate \ntoday will allow my State to maintain those strong laws in the future.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the original mental health parity bill \nin 1996 along with Senator Domenici and the late Senator Wellstone and \nhave been a strong supporter of efforts to strengthen that bill since \nit was signed into law. But the legislation the HELP Committee marked \nup last February was different from what our late colleague Paul \nchampioned for so many years. The legislation our committee marked up \ncontained preemption language which was broader in scope than what was \nin Federal mental health parity bills in the past.\n  For that reason, I offered amendments during that markup to address \npreemption in a way I believed would have taken a major step toward \nprotecting State insurance laws and ensuring that we do no harm to \nState-based consumer protections through passage of Federal mental \nhealth parity. At that markup, I voiced concerns about the impact the \nbill would have on States like Connecticut who have strong mental \nhealth parity laws, strong consumer protection laws, and strong benefit \nmandate laws.\n  As a result of my continued concerns about the impact this bill would \nhave on the residents of my State, I withheld cosponsorship of the \nlegislation until the issues surrounding preemption could be resolved. \nDue to the hard work and dedication of members on both sides of the \naisle, my concerns have been addressed and I can now support the \nlegislation.\n  Specifically, the bill being passed today removed the broad \npreemption language entirely. The bill now relies on the existing \npreemption of State law standard currently in the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act and the Public Health Service Act, preserving \nStates' laws relating to health insurance issuers. In many States, such \nissuers contract out the key insurance function of reviewing medical \nclaims by their insureds to utilization review or medical management \ncompanies, which are licensed and regulated by the states. In fact, the \nlegislation written by Chairman Kennedy, called the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, was an innovative approach \nto Federal health care reform that has worked well in setting a minimum \nstandard of protections while allowing stronger State-based consumer \nprotections. It is my understanding that the bill passed today will \noperate in a very similar manner.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy and Domenici for entering into a colloquy \nwith me to further clarify the intent of this legislation. They have \nbeen open and willing to working with me since the HELP Committee \nmarkup occurred to address the concerns I had with this legislation. I \nwould also like to acknowledge and thank the tremendous work and \nexpertise of Mila Kofman, Associate Research Professor, Health Policy \nInstitute, Georgetown University. She worked tirelessly to assist the \nmembers and staff through the complex issues of ERISA and preemption. \nFrom my own State of Connecticut, I would like to thank Kevin Lembo, \nVictoria Veltri, and Richard Kehoe who worked closely with my staff to \nensure that Connecticut's strong mental health parity laws would be \nprotected under this legislation.\n  The bill we are passing today will not only mean new Federal \nprotections for people in self-insured ERISA plans, but it will also \nprotect workers and families in States with insurance laws that are \nstronger than the Federal ones by allowing those State laws to remain \nin effect. It reflects months and years of hard work and compromise. It \nis a victory for patients who need coverage for mental health services \nand I am pleased to stand in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my \ncolleagues, Senators Kennedy and Enzi, for all of their work and \ndedication on the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007. We would not be \nhere this evening without them and a whole host of others both in and \nout of the Senate.\n  Simply put, our legislation will ensure individuals with a mental \nillness have parity between mental health coverage and medical and \nsurgical coverage. No longer will people with a mental illness have \ntheir mental health coverage treated differently than their coverage \nfor other illnesses. That means parity between the coverage of mental \nillnesses and other medical conditions like cancer, heart disease, and \ndiabetes.\n  No longer will people be treated differently only because they suffer \nfrom a mental illness, and that means 113 million people in group \nhealth plans will benefit from our bill. We are here after years of \nhard work. We have worked with the mental health community and the \nbusiness and insurance groups to carefully craft a compromise bill.\n  No longer will a more restrictive standard be applied to mental \nhealth coverage and another more lenient standard be applied to medical \nand surgical coverage. What we are doing is a matter of simple \nfairness. I believe that becomes even more important when you consider \nthe following: 26 percent of American adults, or nearly 58 million \npeople, suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder each year, and 6 \npercent of those adults suffer from a serious mental illness. More than \n30,000 people commit suicide each year in the United States, and 16 \npercent of all inmates in State and local jails suffer from a mental \nillness.\n  I would like to take a minute to talk about what we are doing with \nthe passage of the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007. The bill provides \nmental health parity for about 113 million Americans who work for \nemployers with 50 or more employees, ensures that 98 percent of \nbusinesses which provide a mental health benefit do so in a manner that \nis no more restrictive than the coverage of medical and surgical \nbenefits, and ensures health plans do not place more restrictive \nconditions on mental health coverage than on medical and surgical \ncoverage. The bill accomplishes this by providing parity for financial \nrequirements like deductibles, copayments, and annual and lifetime \nlimits and parity for treatment limitations, the number of covered \nhospital days and visits.\n  Again, I want to thank everyone for their extraordinary efforts that \nhave allowed us to achieve Senate passage of the Mental Health Parity \nAct of 2007.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate takes a long overdue step \nin the right direction for the health of all Americans. The passage of \nthe Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 recognizes the millions of people \nliving with a mental illness and the millions of friends, family \nmembers, and communities who support them.\n  Mental health parity legislation simply calls for health plans to \nprovide comparable levels of coverage for mental health services as are \nprovided for traditional medical services. It doesn't sound like a \nradical proposal, yet it has taken years to move this legislation \nthrough the Senate.\n\n[[Page S11683]]\n\n  We have made progress, though, and much of the leadership on this \nissue has been provided by Senator Kennedy and Senator Domenici in \nrecent years. We started in 1992, when my good friend, the late Senator \nPaul Wellstone, and Senator Pete Domenici introduced the Mental Health \nParity Act to correct the unfair burden placed on American families \nliving with mental illness without access to mental health services.\n  It took a while, but in 1996, the first mental health parity \nlegislation was enacted into law. It wasn't a perfect bill. It fell far \nshort of its goal in many respects, but it was a significant piece of \nlegislation that acknowledged the longstanding bias against covering \nmental health services.\n  Based on what we did in 1996, current law requires insurers that \noffer mental health care to offer comparable benefit caps for mental \nhealth and physical health. Unfortunately, that left a loophole that \nhas allowed the common practice in which insurers set higher \ndeductibles, charge higher copays, and cover fewer services for mental \nhealth care. As a result, millions of Americans are left without \naffordable mental health treatment. What they are left with is the \noften crushing aftermath--loss of employment, poor school performance, \npoverty, and even suicide.\n  Every year since that 1996 law was enacted, the Senate has had a \nmental health parity bill to fix this problem, but to no avail. This \nyear, for the first time in a decade, the Senate has passed a bill to \naddress the loopholes in the mental health parity law. I commend \nSenators Kennedy and Domenici for their dedication to seeing this \nthrough. I only wish that Paul Wellstone could have lived to see this \nday.\n  Paul Wellstone was a good friend of mine and an inspiration to me and \nto many others who served with him in the Chamber. Throughout his \ncongressional career, Paul fought tirelessly for equal rights for all, \nregardless of their race, religion, socioeconomic status, or health \nstatus. He was a champion of many causes, but no cause was more dear, \nor more personal, to him than making sure that people with mental \nillness were treated fairly and with dignity.\n  Paul Wellstone was touched personally by mental illness. His older \nbrother lived and struggle with mental illness most of his life. Paul \nbelieved that for his brother, and for all Americans, mental health was \nas important as physical health. Senator Pete Domenici, \ntoo, understands the importance of having access to mental health \nservices. His daughter also has struggled with mental illness.\n\n  Fifteen years ago, Senators Wellstone and Domenici brought home a \nfact that is as true today as it was then--nearly everyone knows \nsomeone living with a mental illness. According to the National \nInstitute of Mental Health, more than one in four adults in the United \nStates--more than 57 million adults--suffer from a diagnosable mental \ndisorder in a given year. One in seventeen Americans suffers from a \nserious mental illness.\n  These two Senators were fiercely determined to end discrimination \nagainst people with mental illness. We all lost a spirited champion for \nmental health on October 25, 2002, when Paul Wellstone was in a fatal \nplane crash. But the fight for mental health parity has lived on. \nSenator Kennedy quickly took up the fight, and he and Senator Domenici \nhave resolutely worked to strengthen common ground and supporters who \nwould bring us to this day, the day of Senate passage of the mental \nhealth parity bill.\n  Last year, the Senate passed a resolution I submitted that marked the \nfourth anniversary of Paul Wellstone's death. The resolution expresses \nthe sense of the Senate that Congress should act ``to provide for equal \ncoverage of mental health benefits with respect to health insurance \ncoverage''--in other words, pass mental health parity.\n  I am proud to note the Senate's action today. With the passage of the \nMental Health Parity Act of 2007, we are assuring millions of Americans \nthat mental illness deserves equal treatment as physical illness. We \nare telling millions of families that help is available and that they \nno longer have to feel excluded. And most importantly, we are opening \ndoors to hope and closing doors to desperation.\n  We may not live in a perfect world but we are closer to a more \nperfect union. It is in the spirit of Paul Wellstone and--thanks to \nSenators Kennedy and Domenici--the spirit of bipartisanship that we \npass this historic piece of legislation. Senator Wellstone was quoted \nas saying:\n\n       I don't think politics has anything to do with left, right, \n     or center. It has to do with trying to do right by the \n     people.\n\n  Today, I think Paul would agree that the Senate has done right.\n\n\n                  PREEMPTION AND PROTECTING STATE LAWS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as someone who has worked to bring a \ngreater understanding of mental illness and to end all forms of \ndiscrimination against people who suffer from a mental illness, I am \npleased to report that the Senate has passed a monumental mental health \nparity bill that could bring hope and greater measure of fairness in \nmental health insurance care coverage to as many as 113 million \nAmericans and nearly 500,000 New Mexicans. This legislation, the Mental \nHealth Parity Act of 2007, builds on the 1996 Mental Health Parity law \nthat I authored with the late Senator Paul Wellstone. It is supported \nby more than 230 organizations and has been a bipartisan effort from \nthe beginning. I thank Senator Kennedy, the chairman of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, for his vision, his leadership \nand his support for this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his tremendous \nleadership on this bill. He has fought for this legislation for many \nyears, and I am grateful for his commitment to getting this bill \npassed. This legislation represents the culmination of more than a \nyear's negotiations involving lawmakers, mental health, insurance and \nbusiness organizations to craft compromise legislation. During the \nmarkup of the bill last February, my colleague Senator Dodd raised very \nimportant issues regarding the effects of the preemption language in \nthe legislation. Since then, he was joined by several other Senators, \nattorneys general, and State insurance commissioners who have voiced \nconcerns about unintended consequences of the bill. It was never the \nintent of the bill to harm or weaken State insurance laws but in \nresponse to concerns raised by several of my colleagues and insurance \nexperts, the language pertaining to preemption was stricken from the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the chairman of the HELP Committee and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New Mexico and congratulate them on \npassage of S. 558, the Mental Health Parity Act. They and their staff \nhave worked long hours to craft this compromise bill, and I \ncongratulate them on this victory for individuals with mental illness \nthroughout the country. Supporters of mental health parity, old and \nnew, should commend the leadership of Senators Domenici and Kennedy for \ntheir years of commitment and struggle to pass Federal mental health \nparity legislation.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the original mental health parity bill \nin 1996, along with Senator Domenici and the late Senator Wellstone, \nand have been a strong supporter of efforts to strengthen that bill \nsince it was signed into law. But, as my colleagues may know, the \nlegislation the HELP Committee marked up last February which is now \nbefore the Senate is different from what our late colleague Paul \nchampioned for so many years. The legislation our committee marked up \ncontained preemption language which was broader in scope than what was \nin Federal mental health parity bills in the past. For that reason, I \nfiled amendments during that markup to address preemption in a way I \nbelieved would have taken a major step toward protecting State \ninsurance laws and ensuring that we do no harm to State-based consumer \nprotections through Federal mental health parity. At that markup, I \nvoiced concerns about the impact the bill would have on States like \nConnecticut who have strong mental health parity laws, strong consumer \nprotection laws, and strong benefit mandate laws.\n\n  As a result of my continued concerns about the impact this bill would \nhave on the residents of my State, I withheld cosponsorship of the \nlegislation until the issues surrounding preemption could be resolved. \nI am pleased to say that because of the hard work and\n\n[[Page S11684]]\n\ndedication of Members on both sides of the aisle, my concerns have been \naddressed and I can now support the legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the senior Senator from Connecticut and \nappreciate his leadership on this issue. He raised a number of \nimportant issues during the consideration of this bill. I believe we \nhave addressed those concerns in the legislation and I am pleased that \nhe is now a strong supporter of the legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. The bill passing the Senate today relies on the existing \npreemption of State law standard currently in ERISA and the Public \nHealth Service Act, preserving States laws relating to health insurance \nissuers. In many States, such issuers contract out the key insurance \nfunction of reviewing medical claims by their insurers to utilization \nreview or medical management companies, which are licensed and \nregulated by the States. In fact, the legislation written by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, called HIPAA, was an innovative approach to \nFederal health care reform that has worked so well in setting a minimum \nstandard of protections while allowing stronger State-based consumer \nprotections. Is it the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts' \nbelief that S. 558 preserves the States' ability to regulate such \ncompanies?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, nothing in this bill affects any State law or State \nregulation of any company or issuer who performs utilization review or \nother medical management services. The changes made to the preemption \nsection of S. 558 mean that the current HIPAA standard would apply to \nthis legislation, just like it applies to existing law passed in 1996. \nBy using existing preemption language, we mean only the narrowest \npreemption of State laws. A minimum standard of Federal protection \nallows States to provide additional protection for their citizens. \nState laws designed to regulate medical management or utilization \nreview to protect plan participants are not preempted under the bill \nbecause they do not ``prevent the application'' of the substantive \nprovisions of this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Is it also the understanding of the senior Senator from New \nMexico that this legislation will not only mean new Federal protections \nfor people in self-insured ERISA plans, but it will also protect \nworkers and families in States with insurance laws that are stronger \nthan the Federal ones by allowing those State laws to remain in effect?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, the senior Senator from Connecticut is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator and want to thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for allowing my concerns about preemption and protecting \nState laws to be heard in the committee and for working tirelessly with \nme to address those concerns. The bill we are passing reflects months \nand years of hard work and compromise, and I am pleased to voice my \nstrong support for S. 558. It is a victory for patients who need \ncoverage for mental health services.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be \nconsidered and agreed to; the committee-reported amendment, as amended, \nbe agreed to; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en \nbloc; the bill, as amended, be read three times and passed; the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2908) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 558), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I congratulate Senators Kennedy, Enzi, and \nothers who worked on this legislation for such a long time. They are to \nbe commended. Senator Wellstone, I am sure, is smiling on us today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/18/senate-section/article/S11684-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
