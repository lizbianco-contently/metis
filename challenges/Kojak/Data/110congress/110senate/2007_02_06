Mr. President, at this time there is no more important \nissue facing our country than the mission and the fate of the American \nservice men and women in Iraq. This means, of course, that the men and \nwomen of this body have no higher duty than to express ourselves openly \nand honestly on this issue--to take a stand on where we stand.\n  The only truly meaningful tool the Framers gave us to do this was our \nability to fund or to not fund a war. That is it. And this is what \nRepublicans are insisting upon: that the Members of this body express \nthemselves on the question of whether to fund or not fund the war in \nIraq.\n  By blocking a vote on the Gregg funding resolution, our good friends \non the other side are blocking a vote on this most essential question--\nthe only question that ultimately matters. Do we oppose this war to the \npoint of action or do we simply want to make a point?\n  Our colleagues say they want progress in Iraq, but by blocking a vote\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\non the McCain benchmarks resolution, they are blocking a vote that \nwould actually set concrete goals.\n  So let's be very clear about what happened last night. Our colleagues \non the other side do not want to vote on whether troops should be \nfunded--period. There is no more critical question at this moment. We \nhave the duty to take it up, and we will continue to fight for that \nright.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1584-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The issue before the American people that relates to Iraq \nis the surge--the escalation of the war in Iraq. That is the debate \nthat should be before this body, and last night that was prevented. An \nup-or-down vote on McCain, who is supporting the surge, or a vote in \nopposition to the surge, the escalation sponsored by Warner and Levin--\nthat is the issue before this body today.\n  This is a diversion. This is a diversion. We finished the Super Bowl. \nThis is a trick play by the Republicans. The real issue before this \nbody is surge or no surge, escalation or no escalation. That is the \ndebate the American people deserve.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  I heard what the distinguished majority leader said. I agree with \nhim. The Senate, as I have often said, should be the conscience of the \nNation. There are only 100 of us to represent 300 million people. \nAmericans expect us to speak up on the war. Americans expect us to vote \non the war. Americans expect us to vote on the issue of the surge.\n  Now, I understand some Senators will support the surge, some will \noppose it, but allow us to have those votes. Allow us to express the \nconscience of this Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a column by E.J. Dionne entitled ``The \nWar To Save The Surge'' from today's Washington Post be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washingtonpost.com, Feb. 6, 2007]\n\n                       The War To Save the Surge\n\n                         (By E. J. Dionne, Jr.)\n\n       When political opponents tell you that to prove your \n     seriousness you need to pursue a strategy they know is doomed \n     to failure, shouldn't you be skeptical of their advice?\n       As the Senate considers a resolution to put itself on \n     record opposing President Bush's escalation of the Iraq war \n     through a ``surge'' of troops, Bush's backers are saying one \n     thing and doing another.\n       They are saying that the resolution is meaningless and that \n     true opponents of the war should prove their sincerity by \n     cutting off funding altogether. But they are doing all they \n     can to keep the Senate from even voting on a bipartisan anti-\n     surge resolution that would send a powerful message to Bush \n     that most Americans have lost faith in his bungled war \n     policy.\n       If you doubt that the war's supporters would love its \n     opponents to put all their eggs in the fund-cutoff basket, \n     consider what it means for them to sound as if the \n     administration's only serious foes were the likes of Dennis \n     Kucinich and Cindy Sheehan.\n       ``I don't think these resolutions, nonbinding resolutions, \n     are going to accomplish anything,'' Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas \n     Republican and a Bush loyalist, told Gwen Ifill on PBS's \n     ``NewsHour'' last week. ``If we really had the courage of our \n     convictions,'' Cornyn said, the ``we'' referring to the war's \n     opponents, ``if people said, `You know what? This is an \n     immoral task we've asked our troops to do because we don't \n     believe in the mission, we think they're going to fail.' They \n     ought to cut off funds. But to have this sort of--this debate \n     without any real consequence, I just don't think is the best \n     use of our time.''\n       So Cornyn wants to block a vote on a supposedly unimportant \n     anti-surge resolution, but he would be happy to entertain a \n     debate on a funding cutoff. Does that not send a message to \n     the war's critics?\n       And it's not just Cornyn. It is now a standard talking \n     point for supporters of this war, from the editorial pages of \n     the Wall Street Journal and the Weekly Standard to Vice \n     President Cheney himself, to try to block any statement by \n     Congress of its views, except through a vote to block funds \n     for Iraq.\n       ``The Congress has control over the purse strings,'' said \n     Cheney, who on most other occasions insists upon the \n     executive's supremacy over Congress. In an interview with \n     CNN's Wolf Blitzer last month, Cheney added: ``They have the \n     right, obviously, if they want to cut off funding, but in \n     terms of this effort the president has made his decision. . . \n     . We'll continue to consult with the Congress. But the fact \n     of the matter is, we need to get the job done.''\n       In other words: Even if a substantial majority of Congress \n     that includes many Republicans demonstrates a lack of \n     confidence in the Bush-Cheney surge, the administration will \n     feel free to ignore the other elected branch of our \n     government--and the more recently elected branch (remember \n     November, anyone?) at that.\n       Oh, and if an anti-surge resolution were trivial, why would \n     William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and one of the \n     war's most passionate advocates, devote a long and angry \n     editorial in the latest issue of his magazine to attacking \n     Sen. John Warner (Va.) and other Republicans as \n     ``ignominious'' for their support of an anti-surge measure? \n     Kristol knows that every Republican vote against escalation \n     carries special weight in speeding this war to an end. So \n     does the Senate's Republican leadership, which used a \n     procedural vote yesterday evening to impede the majority's \n     will on the surge.\n       Supporters of Bush's war policy would love a vote on a full \n     funding cutoff right now because they know that, at this \n     moment, they could win it. They would love responsibility for \n     the failures in Iraq to fall not on an administration that \n     planned its policy so badly and carried it out so \n     incompetently. Far better for them to heap blame on the war's \n     opponents for ``losing faith.''\n       And they know, as the war's opponents should, that in a \n     democracy whose constitution accords so much power to the \n     president, turning around even a failed war policy takes \n     time, persuasion, organizing, legislative strategizing and \n     pressure.\n       The impatience of the administration's critics is entirely \n     understandable. But it would be a shame if impatience got in \n     the way of a sensible long-term strategy to bring America's \n     engagement in this war to as decent an end as possible as \n     quickly as possible--even if not as quickly as they'd like. \n     The anti-surge resolution is a necessary first step, which is \n     why those who are against a genuine change in our Iraq policy \n     are fighting so hard to stop it.\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 495 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1584-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1584-S1585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, to my colleagues, my constituents, and \nthe American people, I rise today to absolutely say without any \nequivocation that I do support the Warner-Biden-Levin resolution on \nIraq opposing the escalation of our troops. I also stand in the Senate \nto say: We were robbed! We were robbed of our ability to be able to \nvote on this resolution!\n  The American people, on November 7, sent a message to Congress and to \nthe President of the United States: Change the tone in Washington, \nchange the direction in Iraq, and change the priorities of this Nation. \nWe, on this side of the aisle, got the message. The other side does not \nseem to have. This parliamentary maneuver to block a vote on the \nWarner-Biden-Levin resolution, to allow us to vote up or down on \napproving the escalation, shows that it is the same old tone. Please, \nlet's give the process a chance.\n  Second, it also robs us of the ability to begin to express our vocal \nsupport for changing the direction.\n  This bipartisan resolution is a first step. It is not going to be the \nlast word in bringing our troops home safely and swiftly. The Warner-\nBiden-Levin resolution affirms clearly and unequivocally a commitment \nto our men and women in uniform: Congress will not abandon you while \nyou are in Iraq and when you come home. We stand by our troops. \nHowever, this resolution says ``no'' to the President's reckless plan \nto escalate troop presence in Iraq. The bipartisan resolution insists \nthat the Iraqi Government stand up for its own people to provide \nsecurity, services, and an agreement on oil revenue sharing.\n  I am not new to this position. I never wanted to go to war in the \nfirst place. I was 1 of the 23 who voted against this war on October \n11, 2002--4 years ago. I will never forget it. I didn't believe the \nadministration's arguments then, and I\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\ndon't believe them now. I opposed giving the President unilateral \nauthority to launch a preemptive attack. I said the United States had \nto exhaust its diplomatic options. I encouraged the administration to \nstick with the U.N., to let the U.N. meet its responsibility to deal \nwith the Saddam threat. I said we should not go on our own.\n  The day of the vote, I was so filled with apprehension about the \ncourse of the war, about the course we were embarking on, I said in \nthis Senate that we don't know whether our troops will be greeted with \nflowers or landmines. Well, now we know. That mission did not get \naccomplished. I called the 72 families in Maryland who gave their lives \nand made the ultimate sacrifice. I know what is going on out there with \nthe families. I also know when we got to Iraq there were no weapons of \nmass destruction, but the destruction happened, and it happened fast.\n  No one can ask more of our troops. They are brave. They are \ncourageous. They have fought valiantly. But after 4 years of fighting, \nwhere are we in Iraq? Well, the United States, went to war with Iraq, \nbut right now we are at war within Iraq. Saddam is gone, but we are \nstill there. And we are mired in a civil war between different ethnic \nand sectarian groups.\n  I have stated what I am against, but let me state what I am for. I am \nfor the Warner-Levin-Biden resolution. I salute the leadership who \nproduced it: John Warner, a decorated war hero, former Secretary of the \nNavy, chairman of the Committee on Armed Services when the Republicans \nwere in control, a distinguished person, and a man of great comity and \ncivility--no one more compassionate about America's security than John \nWarner; Joe Biden, chair of our Foreign Relations Committee; Carl \nLevin, an expert on the Committee on Armed Services and now the \nchairman. They put their heads together and they came up with this \nresolution, and to a man--and this woman supports them--the Senate \nopposes the President's plan because we think it is reckless.\n  The bipartisan resolution says the objective of overall U.S. strategy \nin Iraq should be to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political \ncompromises, to foster reconciliation, and strengthen the unity \ngovernment. This is what I consider essential.\n  The resolution says the primary objective of our military strategy \nshould be to maintain Iraq's territorial integrity--fancy words for \nprotecting the border; deny the terrorists a safe haven--yes, but they \nweren't there in the first place; promote regional stability; promote \ncounterterrorism; train and equip the Iraqi forces. We have been doing \nit for 3 years. Guess what? They have not been showing up! And the \nother day when they were supposed to show up for a battle, 55 percent \nof them showed up in Baghdad. Gates, our new Secretary of Defense, \nsaid: Isn't this improvement? Last year, they didn't show up at all. It \nis their war and they are not showing up. Why should we show up for \ntheir war when they have a 50-percent attendance rate? What is wrong \nwith this thinking?\n  As much as possible, the current U.S. military operations should be \nconfined to these goals. We show up, they don't. Something is really \nwrong with this picture.\n  The bipartisan resolution calls for the United States to engage the \nnations in the Middle East to develop a regionally and internationally \nsponsored peace and reconciliation process. That is what we should be \ndoing. The resolution says it should not be an open-ended commitment or \nunconditional. Sure, there should be benchmarks, but benchmarks with \nenforcement capability.\n\n  I do support this resolution because it makes clear to our men and \nwomen in uniform that Congress will not abandon them. It explicitly \nsays that Congress should not take any action that will endanger U.S. \nmilitary forces in the field. Whether on the battlefield or on the \nhomefront, our troops deserve the best.\n  Also, the latest intelligence shows that Iraqi leadership has to make \ndifficult changes. The solution in Iraq requires a political solution \nfrom the Iraqis--not military muscle--from the Americans.\n  There are parts of this resolution with which I don't agree. They \ncall it an augmentation; I call it escalation. I oppose the calls for \nthe vigorous operations at Anbar until there is greater clarification. \nThere is no doubt that al-Qaida is operating in Iraq. But when I voted \n4 years ago, al-Qaida was not there; they were in Afghanistan. Why \ndidn't we stick with Afghanistan and really clean their clock? Now the \nPresident wants to send more Marines to Anbar to fight al-Qaida when we \nshould have been in Afghanistan, catching Osama bin Laden.\n  We do need a way forward in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group gave us 79 \nrecommendations as a way to go forward. Surely the President of the \nUnited States could have found 50 for us to sit down at a table, talk, \nand work together for the good of our country, the good of our troops, \nand the good of peace in the Middle East. Seventy-nine recommendations \nand they have all been cast aside. The Iraq Study Group calls for \ndiplomatic and political efforts, a change in their primary mission to \nmove our troops out of Iraq responsibly. They gave us a way forward \nthat they believe could have gotten our troops out by the first quarter \nof 2008. Let's give those 79 recommendations at least a forum to be \ndebated and discussed and acted on.\n  Where do we go from here? I will tell you where I think we ought to \ngo. First of all, we ought to have a vote on the Warner-Biden-Levin \nresolution. If they do not want to give us that, give us a vote on the \nMcCain resolution to vote to approve this escalation. One way or the \nother, that is our constitutional duty.\n  The President says he does not need congressional consent to be able \nto do this reckless escalation. But he sure does need congressional \nadvice. And my advice is, let's send in the diplomats before we send in \nmore troops. We need a robust diplomatic strategy to match our robust \nmilitary strategy. We need to make it clear that the Congress will not \nabandon our troops in the field, and we will not abandon them when they \ncome home. Look at this President's budget; we are abandoning our \ntroops. This whole escalation--sure, they talk about money for the \n21,000, but it takes another 20,000 to support them. They don't walk \ntheir talk. They don't put the money in the budget.\n  Then we have our troops coming home. You look at the President's \nbudget on Veterans Affairs--not only have they lost the records, they \nhave lost their way at VA. We are not equipped to deal with Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans coming home. They have horrific, permanent wounds \nof war, and we have a weak, unreliable funding system. You can't just \nsupport the troops with yellow ribbons. You have to put the money \nbehind it. How about putting the money behind it when they come home? \nThey need us. And they need us not only with words; they need us with \ndeeds in the budget process. And I don't see it.\n  Now, we also need to make it clear to Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki \nthat he has to start to act. Speaking of showing up, I saw they could \nnot get a quorum in the Iraqi Parliament. Only 50 percent of the troops \nshow up, their own Parliament doesn't show up, but we show up with \n21,000 more troops? The Prime Minister must meet benchmarks.\n  Let me conclude by saying that a great American military should not \nbe a substitute for a weak Iraqi Government. Neither Congress nor the \nAmerican people will abandon our troops, but the best way to support \nour troops is not to send more in harm's way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time for \nSenator Kennedy be reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1585-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1585-S1588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I noted with some interest the headline in \ntoday's Washington Post. It says ``GOP Stalls Debate on Troop \nIncrease.'' I must say, in light of the remarks of the Senator from \nMaryland, obviously nobody has stalled the debate on troop increase or \nanything else to do with the conflict in Iraq. In fact, I think that is \na positive thing because there isn't\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\nanything more important, in my view, than debating this important issue \nand, as the Senator from Maryland said, supporting our troops.\n  I do have profound disagreement, though, that these nonbinding \nresolutions which have been offered do anything other than encourage \nour enemy and undermine our troop morale.\n  I wonder why it is that so many are insistent that we proceed forward \non nonbinding resolutions when, in fact, we know what power the \nCongress has when it comes to war. It is not to supplant the Commander \nin Chief, it is not to have 535 micromanagers, but it is the power of \nthe purse. Yet it is the very amendment that Senator Gregg, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, has offered that the majority leader has denied an \nopportunity to debate and on which to have have an up-or-down vote. \nThat is what the vote yesterday was about. It is not to cut off debate; \nit is to make sure the debate continues and that the varied positions \nespoused by Members of the Senate are not only fully debated but that \nthere is an opportunity to vote on those positions.\n  At least two Members of the majority--Senator Dodd and Senator \nFeingold--have made it clear that they believe the power of the purse \nshould be exercised to cut off funding to support this new plan \nforward. While I disagree with them, I do respect the fact that they \nactually intend to vote for something that would make a difference in \nthe outcome as opposed to the nonbinding resolutions which have been \noffered by Senator Levin and others.\n  I do not understand why it is the critics--the President's critics \nand the critics of what is happening in Iraq--why they will not take \nyes for an answer. Yes, as the Senator from Maryland said, on November \n7, obviously, Iraq was on the minds of the American people. It is one \nof the reasons why, frankly, the then majority is no longer the \nmajority.\n  There were critics on the other side of the aisle who said the \nSecretary of Defense needed to be replaced. Now we have confirmed a new \nSecretary of Defense, Secretary Robert Gates.\n  There are those who said: What we are doing in Iraq is not working, \nso we need a new commander. And, indeed, we have confirmed, \nunanimously, a new commander of Coalition Forces in Iraq.\n  There are those who said: We need a new plan in Iraq. And lo and \nbehold, the President announced a new plan after lengthy consultation.\n  I think there is a fair amount of revisionist history or selective \nmemory going on. For example, there are some who said the President did \nnot consider, in coming up with this new plan, the provisions of the \nIraq Study Group. Of course, this is a bipartisan group that made 79 \ndifferent recommendations. But I would challenge the critics who say \nthe President ignored the Iraq Study Group report to look at page 73 of \nthat report, where they say, unanimously--a bipartisan group--they \ncould support a temporary surge of troops to secure Baghdad if it was \nnecessary.\n  Indeed, if you look at this new way forward, that is precisely what \nit is, a temporary surge, supporting Iraqi troops to provide an \nopportunity not only to clear but to hold Baghdad and then to build and \nbegin the political reconciliation process that is necessary for \nstabilization.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying we do not \nwant to debate, when the truth is they are denying us a right to vote \non some of the key resolutions that define the nature of the debate in \nthis Congress.\n  We want a debate. We want a debate, but we want it to be a fair \ndebate. And we want it to be representative. We want to expand and \nextend the debate so we can fully examine and discuss what is at stake \nin this central front in the global war on terror. We want a full and \ncomprehensive debate and an opportunity to vote. Do they?\n  If our friends on the other side of the aisle are serious when they \nsay they do not want to block funding for our troops, then why are they \ndodging an amendment offered by Senator Gregg that would allow them a \nvote on that important issue?\n  Now, I disagree that we should ever cut off funds to support our \ntroops while they are in a time of war. But I think if you feel what is \nhappening in Iraq cannot be justified, if you feel we have already lost \nand we are merely sending more troops into harm's way, with no chance \nof accomplishing the mission, then I would say the only real vote that \nmatters would be one that would cut off the funds to allow that to \nhappen. That would be the moral decision to make. I simply disagree \nwith the judgment. I do not believe all is lost. I do believe this new \nplan, this new commander, this new Secretary of Defense have a \nreasonable chance of success.\n  Now, we all agree the consequences of failure in Iraq are not simply \nsomething we can walk away from. The Iraq Study Group said that failure \nin Iraq could result in a regional conflict, most likely ethnic \ncleansing, where the sectarian violence would spiral out of control, \nperhaps bringing in other countries to defend the various sectarian \nparties to that conflict.\n  We know from sad experience what happened in Afghanistan after the \nSoviet Union was defeated by the Afghan rebels, where the Taliban and \nal-Qaida set up business in Afghanistan and used that as a place to \ntrain and recruit and then to launch terrorist attacks against the \nUnited States, such as what occurred on September 11, 2001.\n  Where is the plan of the critics of this new way forward in Iraq? \nWhat is their plan to avoid a failed state in Iraq? Where is their plan \nto avoid the kind of regional conflict and the humanitarian crisis that \nwill most likely occur if, in fact, we do not try to support this new \nplan forward and bring stability to Iraq long enough to where the \nIraqis--which is their responsibility--can engage in the reconciliation \nprocess and the political process necessary to stabilize that country, \nwhich is in their best interest, which is in our best interest? Because \nwe know if things spiral out of control in Iraq, if we decide to \nprecipitously leave Iraq and it becomes a failed state or becomes a \nkilling field for ethnic cleansing, we will most likely have to return \nat even greater loss of blood and treasure.\n  So I would ask the new majority, since the Senator from Maryland \nmentioned the election of November 7, what is your plan? To criticize \nmay be OK if you are in the minority. But if you are the majority, \nsurely you have a responsibility to offer a constructive alternative. \nIt is not constructive to merely criticize the new plan that is going \nto be executed by the new commander, unanimously confirmed by this \nCongress, and a new Secretary of Defense.\n  I must say, with all due respect, it is not supporting our troops to \nsend them into harm's way if, in fact, our colleagues believe all is \nlost and they cannot succeed. I do not believe that. But if, in fact, \nthey truly do believe that, then they should stand up and be willing to \nvote on the only resolution that would have an outcome on that \ndetermination. That is the Gregg amendment.\n  It is because we have been denied an opportunity to vote on that only \namendment that counts that this debate continues. It was not cut off \nyesterday; merely a fair process was secured for those of us who think \nthat all views ought to be represented and we ought to have more than \none vote rather than be railroaded in this process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday, by a vote of 49 to 47, a cloture \nmotion failed that would have essentially cut off a broader debate on \nthe big issue of the day; that is, how are we going to deal with the \nsituation in Iraq? I think the vote failed not because, as was reported \nin some newspapers, Republicans did not want to debate the issue but, \nrather, because we want a full debate on the issue.\n  The importance of this issue and the stakes associated with its \noutcome warrant a full debate, not one restricted by one party in the \nSenate. The full range of views on this issue deserves to be heard. \nThey deserve a voice in the Senate. The American people deserve that \ndebate. And surely, the Americans in uniform who are fighting and dying \ndeserve that debate in the Senate.\n  Saturday, I attended two welcome home ceremonies for National Guard \nunits. Both performed superbly in fighting the global war on terror. \nThe 114th Air Wing, a National Guard unit\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\nin Sioux Falls, SD, has been deployed all over the planet. They have \nbeen in Afghanistan. They have been in Iraq--16 different places since \n2001, after the terrorist attacks, in each case performing with \ndistinction. They support an F-16 mission and have been utilized \nextensively. In fact, 72 percent, I believe, of all the members of that \nunit have been deployed someplace in the last 5 years, as we have been \nfighting this war on terror.\n  They and their families deserve a debate in the Senate about the \nfuture of that mission they have been undertaking. There has been a lot \nof debate around the country, a lot of debate in Washington about what \nto do next. We have now before us a plan which is a change of strategy. \nIt incorporates more involvement by the Iraqi security forces in terms \nof their military. Also, their political structures, their Government \nhas certain benchmarks it has to meet and economic requirements they \nhave to comply with regarding the division, distribution of oil \nrevenues--a whole range of things that have given us a new opportunity, \na new opening to get this right with the situation in Iraq.\n  I believe the families of those who have served and sacrificed \ncertainly deserve to have a full debate, not a restricted debate, in \nthe Senate, a full debate where the full range of views, the full range \nof options that are held by the American people can be adequately \nvoiced.\n  I also attended a welcoming home ceremony for the 147th Field \nArtillery, 1st Battalion, Charlie Battery, in Yankton, SD. This is a \nunit which has contributed mightily to the war on terror and suffered \ngreatly. They have had four members of their unit who never came back, \nkilled by IEDs: SGT Richard Schild, SGT Daniel Cuka, SGT Allen Kokesh, \nand SGT Greg Wagner--young Americans who will never be with their \nfamilies again.\n  Also, they had a young sergeant in their unit who has suffered \ndebilitating injuries, brain injuries that he continues to receive \nintensive medical treatment for and perhaps will never be the same. \nThey had a young specialist, Brian Knigge from Plankinton, SD, who \nsuffered injuries from which he is still recovering.\n  They are a unit that has suffered greatly in this war on terror. Yet \nthere is a tremendous resilience and commitment and dedication to the \nmission. The area in which they were involved was the training of Iraqi \nsecurity forces, specifically the Iraqi police, in the area of Baghdad, \nwhich is why it was so very dangerous for them. And the IEDs that have \nkilled and seriously injured so many of our young American soldiers who \nare serving in that region did four of their comrades in. And as I \nsaid, a couple are very seriously injured.\n  They and their families who have sacrificed so greatly--and when I go \nto these events, I, obviously, have opportunities to interact with the \nfamilies, with those whom these soldiers left behind. It is \nheartbreaking to see the separation, the consequence, and the cost of \nwar. Yet at the same time, we have to realize when we get into a \nconflict like this, it is not just about what we are doing today, it is \nabout securing a better, safer, more secure future for the next \ngeneration of Americans.\n  That is why this debate is so important. Many have argued what is \nhappening today in the Middle East, in Iraq, is simply a regional \nconflict or a conflict between different sects within Iraq. But, \nfrankly, we all know this--you do not have to be a rocket scientist to \nsee what happens when these terrorist organizations are left free to \nprey in areas such as that, where there is not a lot of control and \nsecurity. They begin to use these places as sanctuaries and safe havens \nto launch attacks against other places across the world, including the \nUnited States.\n  It is important, in this global war on terror, that we understand \nwhat the consequences and stakes of our failure are. I believe that is \nwhy, when we have a debate, we need to have a debate that reflects the \nfull range of options and the full range of views that are available to \nthe Senate when it comes to the future of Iraq--again, the discussion \nabout consequences of failure, the discussion about plans going \nforward.\n  Right now we have a plan in front of us. We have a strategy that has \nbeen put forward by the President and his commanders in the region. We \nhave a new commander on the ground, General Petraeus. We have some new \ntroops heading into the area. There are changes in the rules of \nengagement. This may be our last best shot, our last best hope of being \nable to get this right.\n  We have engaged in this debate in the Senate which, again, in my \nview, sends entirely the wrong signal, the wrong message to our troops \nand to our enemies who interpret these messages that we send as a lack \nof resolve, a lack of will to finish what we started. More importantly, \nultimately, the reason this has such great weight and gravity is that \nthe people who are the primary receivers of the messages we send are \nthe troops in the field. It is very difficult to say to those troops \nwho are day in and day out putting on the uniform of the United States, \nperforming a mission that we have asked them to do, which we have \npointed out has grave consequences not only for that immediate region \nbut for the entire free world--if you look at the arc of extremism that \nbranches from areas such as Afghanistan and al-Qaida to areas such as \nsome of the terrorist organizations in Lebanon, in the Palestinian \nterritories, all these terrorist organizations and attacks are \norchestrated by organizations that want to kill and destroy Americans.\n  We have a responsibility in the debate to make sure that when we are \nputting young Americans in harm's way, we are allowing a debate to go \nforward that examines the full range of views, the full range of \noptions that are available to the Senate. Frankly, the one that matters \nthe most, in terms of the options we have as a nation and as the \nSenate, comes down to the issue of funding. Frankly, we don't have an \nopportunity in this debate to talk about the real tool the Senate has \nwhen it comes to this issue; that is, the issue of funding. We have \nnonbinding resolutions. Everybody wants to debate nonbinding \nresolutions. They are nonbinding, but they are not meaningless. They \nsend a message that we are not supportive of the mission our troops are \nundertaking.\n  But if the Senate is serious about doing its work, and if there are \nwell-meaning and thoughtful people on the other side of the aisle who \nwant to have this debate, then we ought to get down to what real \noptions, what the real tools are at the disposal of the Senate when it \ncomes to having any kind of a role in what happens in the future of \nIraq. That is the issue of funding.\n  The leadership on the other side has said: We are not going to allow \nyou to have a debate that includes that option, that includes the other \noptions proposed, some from the other side that have talked about troop \ncaps, withdrawal timelines.\n  Ultimately, fundamentally, if the other side is serious, let's have a \ndebate about funding because that is the tool the Congress has at its \ndisposal. If that is not a part of the debate, we are not serious about \nthis debate or the range of options that ought to be heard and voiced \nin the Senate.\n  I see I have other colleagues who want to speak on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have 10 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Chair remind me when there is a minute \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, last evening the Republicans said no to an honest \ndebate about what is best for our troops in Iraq, our national \nsecurity, and for the American people. Our men and women in uniform \nhave done everything that we have asked them to do. They have served \nwith dignity, honor, and valor. They have served in Iraq longer than \nAmerican forces fought in World War II. It has been said by Republicans \nand Democrats: This doesn't cry for a military solution, it cries for a \npolitical solution and resolution. Still we have a President who is \nrelying on sending an additional 20,000 to 38,000 troops more to what \nis effectively a civil war.\n  The cost in blood and treasure has been staggering. More than 3,000 \nAmericans have been killed so far, including\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\n64 from Massachusetts; more than 23,000 have been wounded. In my home \ncommunity, SGT Alexander Fuller of Centerville, MA, was buried last \nweek; Keith Callahan of Woburn, MA--Woburn, MA, that had a higher \npercentage of soldiers killed in Vietnam than any other community in \nour State. High school class after high school class after high school \nclass joined the U.S. Marines. They were in the thick of the fighting \nwith devastating losses. Keith Callahan, in his fourth trip to Iraq, \nwas killed just 10 days ago. The services in that community took place \nlast week.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed, and millions have \nfled their homes. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on the \nwar already. Today the President is asking for hundreds of billions of \ndollars more. President Bush insists on his policy of escalation, while \nmost of us in Congress are increasingly convinced that deescalation is \nthe only realistic strategy. The American people do not support further \nescalation of this war. The legislation on which we seek an honest \ndebate is intended to make a record of who is on the side of the \nAmerican people and opposes sending tens of thousands more American \ntroops into this civil war.\n  Despite the clear result of the November election, our Republican \ncolleagues are not prepared to face the truth on Iraq. They are \ndetermined to avoid a debate on the most important national security \nissue of our time. They are willing to allow tens of thousands of more \nyoung men and women to be dropped in the cauldron of a civil war.\n  The cost in precious American lives is reason enough to end this \nmistaken and misguided war, but the cost at home came into full view \nyesterday as we received the President's budget. This President's \nbudget devotes more than $200 billion to the war in Iraq. Where does \nthe money come from? It comes from the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, as the President's budget underfunds the CHIP program by $8 \nbillion. That program provides health care to low-income children. It \nhas had bipartisan support in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. It has made an extraordinary difference to the quality \nof health of millions of children. There are millions of children who \nare qualified for this program. But because the Federal Government \ndoesn't provide the help to the States, those children are not going to \nget covered.\n\n  Make no mistake about it. We are taking those resources that ought to \nbe devoted to the CHIP program and sending them to Iraq. It comes from \nour children's education, the No Child Left Behind Act, because this \nbudget underfunds the No Child Left Behind reforms by almost $15 \nbillion. What are we saying? We are not going to get the well-trained \nteachers that this legislation requires. We are not going to have the \nadequacy of supplementary services to help those children in high \nschool. We are not going to move toward smaller class sizes. We are not \ngoing to have an effective program to bring in parents. We are not \ngoing to have the examination of these children to find out what they \nneed in terms of help in their classes. No, because we are shipping \nbillions of dollars to Iraq.\n  Twenty-three thousand children are in the streets of Philadelphia \ntoday, having dropped out of school; 22,000 children have dropped out \nof school in Cleveland, OH. It is happening all over the country. And \nwhat are we doing? Sending away billions and billions of dollars that \nought to be there for prevention programs to stop those children from \ndropping out of school, to help those children get back into school so \nthey will have useful and productive lives. They are the ones who are \npaying for these wars.\n  As to seniors, our disabled citizens, the President cut $66 billion \nfrom the Medicaid Program which is a lifeline to millions of retirees \nand disabled children. I was there when President Johnson said: You \nwork hard, you pay into the Medicare Program, pay into those programs, \nand we guarantee you that you are going to have the health care you \nneed for the rest of your life. That is a commitment that we made. Now \nwe are skimping on it. We didn't provide at that time a prescription \ndrug program. We provided one eventually that served more for the drug \nindustry and the HMOs than it did for the senior citizens. We are \ncutting back on health care for our seniors and the disabled.\n  It comes from our workers who are looking for good jobs to support \ntheir families because the President's budget slashes $1 billion from \nprograms that train Americans for jobs for the future. How many \nspeeches will we hear about competitiveness and the problems we are \nfacing in terms of the world economy, how we are going to have to \nredouble our efforts in order to be competitive, to have the new \nindustries that will provide new jobs and new benefits and new \nopportunities for our citizens. Every Member of this body will be \nmaking that speech someplace in their State next week. We know that. \nWhat are we doing?\n  In my State of Massachusetts, we have 275,000 people who are \nunemployed, and we have 78,000 job vacancies. The only thing that is \nlacking is training. We have 24 applications for every opening for \ntraining. People want the training to get the skills to participate and \ntake care of their families. What does this President do? He cuts that \nprogram. That is part of the cost.\n  People are asking back home--down in New Bedford and Fall River and \nLowell and Lawrence and Holyoke and Springfield--who is going to stand \nup for us? It is not only the loss of their sons and daughters from \nthose communities, but they see that it is gutting the lifelines to \ntheir communities, the children and the elderly, those who are the most \nvulnerable in our society. They are paying the price. Read the \nPresident's budget. Make no mistake about it. Who is paying the price? \nThey are paying the price, the neediest people in our society.\n  Then it comes from the poor who are struggling against the bitter \ncold. It cuts 17 percent of the funding for the Low Income Energy \nAssistance Program that helps low-income families heat their homes. \nMaybe it is warm in certain parts of this country, but it is cold as \ncan be in many others. There are a lot of needy people in those cold \nareas where there is a completely inadequate fuel assistance program \nnow. This administration has cut back on that program year after year \nafter year, and this year is no different, a 17-percent reduction.\n  Most of the elderly people, the needy people in my State, need to \nhave their oil tanks, if they are using home heating oil, filled three \ntimes a year. This won't even let them get one tank of fuel assistance \nin their homes over the year. The poor are paying a fearsome price. \nThey are seeing their funding diverted to these conflicts and the surge \nin Iraq.\n  This is a war that never should have happened. It is a war that \nshould be brought to an end. Yet the administration is allowing it to \ngo on and on, mistake after mistake after mistake. This terrible war is \nhaving an effect not only on our troops, who are paying the highest \nprice, but on our children, our elderly, our schools, our workers, and \nthe poorest of the poor here at home. Make no mistake about it. While \nthe President forges ahead with a surge in Iraq, the American people \nneed a surge at home. Americans see the cost of their health care and \nthe cost of college going up. What about a surge in our health and \neducation policy to help meet their needs? What about a surge in those \nareas?\n  I have introduced legislation which would require the President to \nget the authority he needs from Congress before moving forward with \nfurther escalation in Iraq. I intend to seek a vote on it, unless the \nPresident changes course. The debate is about what is best for our \ntroops and our national security. Our forces have served with great \nvalor. They have done everything they have been asked to do. Sending \nmore of them into a civil war will not make success any more likely. We \nhave a responsibility to vote on this issue before it is too late. The \nAmerican people deserve to know where the Republicans stand and where \nthe representatives in the Congress stand.\n  I look forward to that debate and a vote at the earliest possible \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1588-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1588-S1589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about one of the most \nimportant issues of our time: the worldwide war on terror.\n  I have to say I was disappointed to read in this morning's Roll Call \nthat many of my Democratic colleagues are using this debate for the \n2008 elections rather than focusing on the real damage that the \nresolution we have been discussing will do to our national security.\n  One of our greatest Presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, once said, ``It \nis not the critic who counts. The credit,'' he said, ``belongs to the \nman who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and \nsweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again \nand again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming.\n  ``The credit,'' Roosevelt said, belongs to the man ``who spends \nhimself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph \nof high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails \nwhile daring greatly.''\n  At this very moment, our Commander in Chief and those he commands are \ndaring greatly.\n  Our men and women in uniform are paying with blood, sweat, and tears. \nYet many in this body prefer to sit in the stands and offer criticism \nrather than support.\n  For the past 50 years, the Middle East has been a cauldron of \nbrutality, war, and despair. The region's instability has threatened \nthe entire globe and reached our shores on 9/11 with a stark awakening.\n  This is why we are involved in the Middle East. The future security \nof our homeland is tied directly to a successful outcome not only in \nIraq but in Afghanistan, Lebanon, the Palestinian territory, and a \nnumber of Middle East countries that harbor evil men who foment hate \nthrough a perverted version of Islam.\n  Yet as our efforts in Iraq encounter fierce resistance from a \ndetermined and evil enemy, support for our efforts has waned here in \nCongress. Instead, many of my colleagues prefer to support a nonbinding \nresolution that would express disapproval of the President's plan to \nreinforce our troops in Iraq.\n  Voting for this resolution is not leadership, it is criticism--\ncriticism without the courage of offering real solutions. While this \nresolution may be toothless by force of law, its symbolism is \ndangerous. Voting to condemn the President's plan is a vote of no \nconfidence in the mission we have told our troops to fight and die for. \nBut it is also a slap in the face to General Petraeus just days after \nwe voted unanimously to support his leadership of our troops in Iraq.\n  ``Godspeed, General,'' was what one of my colleagues said before \nintroducing the very resolution that would undermine the general's \nauthority and his plan for victory.\n  This is not leadership. We were elected to make tough decisions and \nthat requires understanding our choices, selecting the best choice, and \nthen following through. But I am afraid the critics in this body do not \nacknowledge the real choices before us. There are only three:\n  First, to continue the unworkable status quo; second, to admit defeat \nand withdraw; third, to renew our strength until we win.\n  I respect my colleagues who disagree with the President's strategy in \nIraq, but only if they exercise leadership and support an alternative \nsolution, one that proposes a serious path to victory, or announces \ndefeat and ends our involvement immediately, not only in Iraq but \nthroughout the Middle East, because America will no longer have any \ncredibility to carry out our work in any part of the world.\n  If my colleagues do not support sending reinforcements to Iraq, they \nshould introduce legislation blocking that action. While I believe this \nis shortsighted and wrong, it would at least be genuine leadership.\n  My hope is we will stop trying to second guess past decisions in \norder to lay blame and instead remember we are locked in a struggle \nmuch larger than Iraq. It is a struggle of security, hope, and freedom \nversus hate, despair, and fear. The battlefield is the entire world.\n  We must understand the stakes and demonstrate real leadership. This \nis not the President's war, it is freedom's war, and we all share the \nresponsibility for the outcome.\n  A century later, Teddy Roosevelt is still correct. The critic ``who \npoints out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds \ncould have done them better'' is destined to be relegated to that \nterrible place ``with those cold and timid souls who neither know \nvictory nor defeat.''\n  There is only one policy worthy of the blood and sweat of our troops: \na policy that completes our mission with dignity, honor, and victory.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have not come to the floor, except once, \nin the 2 years I have been here to discuss the war in Iraq. I have been \nto Iraq and had experience in Iraq as a medical missionary during the \nfirst gulf war.\n  I am very much concerned as to how the world will read us. What we \nknow is that enemies try to defeat us not by trying to defeat us on the \nbattlefield or in Iraq; they try to defeat our will, try to defeat the \nwill of the American public.\n  Senator DeMint talked about leadership. Leadership is laying out the \nreal consequences of our action. What are those consequences? What \nnext? What is going to happen next? What is going to happen? We heard \nthis morning that we are trying to delay this resolution. We are not \ntrying to delay it. As a matter of fact, they are saying we would not \ndebate it. We are debating it right now. The fact is, we believe you \nought to have a resolution that says we support our troops in this \ngroup of resolutions. Unless we get some semblance of saying we want to \nsend a signal to our troops that we support them, we should not have a \nrule that precludes that.\n  So politics aside, and the next election aside, and the Presidential \nelection aside, what does it mean to the American people about what we \nend up doing in Iraq? That is the question we should be asking. We \nshould be making sure that the mistake we do not make is to have an \nill-informed American public about what the consequences will be.\n  Regardless of whether we should be in Iraq, we are there. We cannot \nchange that. The question comes, what does the Iraq Study Group say? \nThey said we needed to secure Baghdad; they said we needed \nreinforcements to be able to do that; they said we needed more funds to \nmake a difference in people's lives. These are the funds that go to the \ngenerals to actually approve things.\n  Can we accomplish something in Iraq or do we walk away? Here is what \nhappens when we walk away. No. 1, there will be a genocide in Iraq. The \nminority Sunni population will scatter out of Iraq, and those who don't \nwill be killed.\n  The northern Iraqis, the Kurds--what will happen to them? If we are \ngone and full-blown civil war breaks out, what will happen to the \nKurds? This is a group of 36 million people who have not had a homeland \nsince the Ottoman Empire. Genocide was committed against them by \nSaddam. What will happen to them? They will be seen as a risk to \nTurkey. Turkey already has problems with its Kurdish population.\n  What will happen in Lebanon? Probably civil war.\n  What will happen in Jordan?\n  What will happen to the Sunni gulf states, as they now fear Iran and \nits dominance?\n  This is a war Iran wants us to leave. Why? Because they want to \nempower themselves to be the dominant force in the Middle East. We can \ntalk about all of the resolutions and how we disagree; that is \nbasically political posturing, and you can disagree. But as the Senator \nfrom South Carolina said, unless\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\nyou put something into force of action, it is criticism, not \nleadership. We need to calculate whatever we do in this body, based on \nwhat the outcome of that calculation is going to be, not by giving \nbellicose speeches that set up false choices that are not there. The \nfact is we have an obligation to the very people--the innocent people--\nin Iraq today.\n  We can walk away from that, but history will judge us harshly. The \nestimates are there will be 5 million people displaced out of Iraq. \nThere will be between 700,000 and 1 million additional Iraqis who will \ndie. Do we not have an obligation to make that not happen? Do we not \nhave an obligation to do what is in the best long-term interests of \nthis country? Is it in our best interest for this country to get out of \nIraq? Is it? How does that fit with the war on terror and our ability \nto conduct that war when we create in Iraq, by withdrawing, a new state \nthat is run by al-Qaida and by the Shia, which will in fact have the \nfunding to dominate in the international arena with terrorism and \nhatefulness and murder and pillaging of innocent people?\n  It is not as simple as everybody here wants to make it seem. It \ncertainly should not be political. But that is where we are going. The \nvery comment that we cannot have a debate on supporting the policy, \nthat we will not allow a resolution that says we are going to support \nour troops--why don't they want that? It is because that will get the \nhighest number of votes. That will become the story--not the story that \nsomebody postured in a position that is well-intended and well-meaning, \nthat they don't think a surge or a reinforcement in Iraq is correct.\n  America is at a crossroads. The crossroads is whether we will fulfill \nand carry out the responsibilities, some of which we added to ourselves \nby our very position, but whether we will fulfill that. We will be \njudged by history.\n  To undermine many of the steps that the Iraq Study Group said, which \nis in the President's plan, nobody knows if this will work, but I \nguarantee it will not work if we send a signal to those who oppose us \nthat this is it. All they do is sit and wait. More of Iran's influence \nand more dollars from Iran coming into Iraq--more to defeat us. If you \ndefeat the will of the American people--and, by doing that, that is our \nproblem--if we allow that to happen as leaders in this country, then we \nwill be responsible for that 5 million displacement, for those million \ndeaths, and the millions that will follow when you have a Middle East \ndominated by Iran with a nuclear weapon.\n  We should think long and hard. The American people should not respond \njust to the urge to get out of Iraq but respond to the well-thought-out \nconsequences of what happens next. And what happens next is a disaster, \nnot only for the people of Iraq, for the people of the Middle East, but \nalso for the national security of this country and our ability to carry \nout our foreign policy in the future.\n  I earnestly pray that we will consider the actions here and the words \nhere in light of what comes next, not in terms of politics but what \nhappens to our country.\n  Denying the heritage we have of sacrifice for freedom and liberty and \ndenying that it costs something and walking away from that, we will \nreap that which we sow as we walk away from it. Caution to us as we do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:30 p.m. shall be divided between the majority and the \nminority.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, this is a disappointing day for the \nSenate and for the United States of America because the debate we \nshould be having on this floor, which is taking place around procedural \nissues, should really be a debate about what is happening in Iraq and \nthe new direction we should be heading in Iraq.\n  It is disappointing as well that it has been postured somehow as a \npolitical debate from the other side. The fact is that what happens in \nIraq today and what happens in Iraq in the months and years ahead is, \nin fact, perhaps the most important issue we can face in the United \nStates of America and in the world, and it is important that this body, \nelected by 300 million Americans in each of our respective States, \ngrapple with the fundamental defining issue of our time.\n  It is also important, as we grapple with this issue of the future of \nIraq and the involvement of the United States, that we try to move \nforward in a manner that is bipartisan. At the end of the day, the only \nway in which we are going to achieve stability in the Middle East and \nwe are going to bring our troops home--which I believe is a goal that \nis shared by the 100 Members of this body--is if we develop a \nbipartisan approach to getting it done. Yet, at the end of the day, we \ncan't even seem to get beyond a procedural obstacle to get to a debate \non the central issue that was presented by a bipartisan resolution, led \nby some of the most distinguished Members of this Senate, including \nSenator Warner, Senator Levin, and others. We cannot even get past the \nprocedural problem for us to end up having a discussion and a vote on \nthat very simple issue.\n  I ask our brethren on the other side that they join us in getting \nthrough this procedural roadblock so that we can have an effective \ndebate and a vote on a question that is before us concerning the future \nof Iraq and the President's plan on how we move forward.\n  I am disappointed as one Senator that today we are not on this floor \ndebating the alternative resolutions that were submitted in the last \nweek, which are bipartisan in nature, and then deciding how to move \nforward as a Senate. I am very disappointed that we have not been able \nto get there.\n  Let me also say that for those who have said the political posturing \nis taking place on this side, I don't believe that is at all the case. \nThe fact is, what we have been trying to do on this side is to have an \nopen and honest debate, and again underscoring the reality that if we \nare going to find our way out of the quagmire in which we find \nourselves in Iraq, it is going to take a true bipartisan effort to get \nus to a place where we can say we have peace and stability in the \nMiddle East and we have brought our troops home. I hope as we move \nforward in this discussion that we will be able to find some of that \nbipartisan consensus.\n  At the end of the day, when we look at what is happening in Iraq, we \nneed to recognize the realities. We need to know and remember the 3,100 \nmen and women who have given their lives on behalf of the mission the \nPresident assigned to them in that country. We need to remember the \n23,000 men and women in uniform who today are wounded and who are \ncarrying the scars of the war with them day by day and for many of them \nfor the rest of their lives. We need to remember the 137,000 men and \nwomen who are on the ground in Iraq today. The bipartisan resolution we \nput forward with Senator Warner, Senator Nelson, Senator Collins, and \nothers recognizes that. We recognize the bravery of the men and women \nwho have given so much of their time and their life in Iraq, and we \nrecognize the need for us to support our men and women on the ground in \nIraq.\n  But we also recognize that what the American people are asking us to \ndo is to chart a new direction for Iraq. I have heard some of my \ncolleagues on the other side--as there is criticism on this side--that \nall we are doing is being critical and not offering alternatives. The \nfact is that we are attempting to come up with a new direction in Iraq, \nand that is what is embodied in the Warner-Levin resolution. It is, in \nfact, a new direction and new strategy in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Members of this body and I ask the people of \nthe United States of America to consider what are the options before \nus. In my view, there are three options. There is plan A. Plan A is a \nplan--which was put forth by the President after several months of \ndeliberation in which he concluded what we had to do in order to be \nsuccessful in Iraq--to send 21,500 additional troops. In real terms, \nthat is about 48,000 additional troops assigned, mostly in Baghdad. \nSome people have called it an escalation. Some people have called it a \nsurge. That is the heart of the plan. It is a plan he announced in \nearly January, a plan he reiterated at the State of the Union, that we \nassign 21,500 troops to Baghdad.\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\n  The question we all ought to be asking ourselves is whether that will \nwork. Will plan A work? I believe those who have studied the issue in \ngreat depth would answer the question no--no, it will not work; no, it \nwill not work because Operation Going Forward in June of 2006, just 7 \nmonths ago, showed that it does not work. And when that didn't work, we \nwent in with a surge of some 7,000 troops in August in Operation Going \nForward Together No. 2, and again that did not work. If today we go in \nwith 21,500 additional troops, plus all the support for the troops that \nis going to be necessary, what is going to be the result of that \nendeavor? In my view, we have been there, we have done that, and it \nhasn't worked. So we have to look forward to a new direction. So I \nbelieve plan A, the President's plan, is not a plan that is going to \nwork.\n\n  Then there is plan B. Plan B is being advocated by many, including \nsome who have demonstrated in Washington and have called our offices \nevery day, and that is to just bring our troops home today; it is over; \nit is a precipitous withdrawal; let's get out of there and get out of \nthere right now. The mistakes of the past have compounded the problems \nin the Middle East and Iraq to the point that we can't put Humpty \nDumpty together. Not all the king's men or all the king's horses could \never put Humpty Dumpty together again, some people would say, because \nthe problems in Iraq today are so severe.\n  I, as one Senator, reject plan B as well. I don't believe we can \nafford to move forward with that kind of precipitous withdrawal.\n  There is plan C, and plan C is really the plan of trying to move \nforward in a bipartisan way so that we can achieve success in Iraq--\nsuccess, again, being defined by stability in Iraq and in the region \nand by bringing our troops home.\n  I know there are lots of people in this body who have much more \nexperience than I, and I know there are lots of people who have studied \nthis issue extensively over a very long period of time, and yet it is \namazing to me that when we have a group of people in a bipartisan way \ncoming forward with a new direction, we have the President and others \nof the minority party essentially rejecting that plan of going forward \ntogether in a new direction.\n  When I look at the Iraq study report and I look at names such as \nformer Secretary of State James Baker, former Attorney General Ed \nMeese, former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, former U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, former U.S. Senator Alan \nSimpson, I see all of these Republicans who are saying we need a new \ndirection going forward together. I believe that is what we ought to be \ndoing, and I believe that new direction going forward together is what \nis embodied in the bipartisan resolution which was put together by \nSenator Warner, Senator Levin, and others. It is that kind of new \ndirection which we ought to be debating and discussing on the floor of \nthe Senate today.\n  When one looks at this group of elder statesmen, which includes not \nonly the Republicans whose names I mentioned, but they include esteemed \nelder statesmen who are also Democrats, such as Lee Hamilton, Vernon \nJordan, Leon Panetta, William Perry, and Charles Robb, when we see \nthose kinds of elder statesmen who have taken a year to try to figure \nout how we deal with this quagmire in Iraq, we have to say those \nrecommendations should be paid very serious attention. The \nrecommendations are many, but they are important because they show the \ndepth of thinking that commission went through in coming up with those \nrecommendations.\n  In essence, what that bipartisan group of elder statesmen said to the \npeople of America is that the way forward requires a new approach. The \nway forward requires a new approach. They talk about the external \napproach, which is to build an international consensus on how we move \nforward in Iraq. They talk about a new diplomatic offensive which is \nimportant if we are to succeed because there are too many nations in \nthat part of the world and around the world who have been sitting on \ntheir hands letting America do it alone. They have to stop sitting on \ntheir hands if ultimately we are going to achieve stability in the \nMiddle East.\n  They talk about the Iraq International Support Group, and that kind \nof a group would be a group that would make sure the efforts on \nreconstruction and building the peace and security in Iraq are, in \nfact, successful. Where is that group? It hasn't been there. It has \nbeen the United States alone moving forward on this effort. We need to \nhave the international community involved.\n  It talks about dealing with Iran and dealing with Syria. They are \npart of that region, like it or not. This group of elder statesmen has \nsaid we need to deal with those countries. We know the limitations. We \nknow the threats they also embody and present to the United States of \nAmerica, but we need to bring them into the dialog if ultimately we are \ngoing to bring stability to that region.\n  The study group goes on with a whole host of other recommendations on \nthe internal approach, helping the Iraqis help themselves. It says that \nwe must require the Iraqis to have performance on milestones, that we \nneed to push them hard on national reconciliation, that we need to make \nsure the Iraqi Government takes responsibility for security and for \ntheir military forces, that they establish a functioning police force, \nand that they establish a criminal justice system that does, in fact, \nwork. And the list goes on with 79 recommendations on the way forward, \na new approach.\n\n  That is what we ought to be talking about, Mr. President, on the \nfloor of the Senate today--how we move forward.\n  I look at this resolution which was put together by some of my \nesteemed colleagues, of which I am a proud original cosponsor, and I \nsay at least we have tried on a bipartisan basis to figure out a \nroadmap for how we ought to move forward together as Democrats and \nRepublicans, as Americans, on this issue, which is the defining issue \nof our times. I see the names of people such as Senator Warner, I see \nSenator Collins, I see Senator Levin, I see Senator Nelson of Nebraska, \nand others who have been involved in this effort. What we are trying to \ndo as a group is to say we ought to figure out a way of charting a new \ndirection forward together, much like the elder statesmen did in coming \nup with the Iraq Study Group recommendations. Yet we are being refused \nthe opportunity to even engage in a debate on a resolution that \nessentially says this is a direction we propose to the President in how \nwe move forward together.\n  I hope that at the end of the day, with the discussions that are \ngoing on between the leadership, we are able to come to some agreement. \nI believe there is too much at stake. I believe there is too much at \nstake not only in the Middle East, but there is too much at stake for \nthe United States of America and for the free world. At the end of the \nday, it is going to take Republicans and Democrats working together to \ntry to chart this new and successful direction for how we move forward \nin Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that I will be \nrecognized for 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nconsumed in any quorum call today be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia, this weekend made a point that I think is very important. \nShe, on a television program, said that Iraq is being debated virtually \neverywhere in our country: debated at kitchen tables, business places, \nworkplaces, and schools. The only place in America that Iraq is not \nbeing debated is in the Senate. Here we are debating whether we should \ndebate.\n  That was what went on yesterday, and it is what is going on today, a \ndebate about whether the debate on Iraq should occur in the Senate. It \nis unbelievable. We have a cloture vote on a motion to proceed to the \ndebate, and the minority party in the Senate voted nearly unanimously \nto say, no, we shouldn't be debating. I don't understand that at all, \nMr. President.\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\n  Why would we not want to engage in this national discussion about \nwhat is happening in Iraq; what are our obligations, and what are our \nnational interests with respect to these issues? This is not a war \nagainst terrorists in the main. It is sectarian violence that is \noccurring in Iraq. Yes, there are some terrorists in Iraq, I understand \nthat, but it is largely sectarian violence, Shia on Sunni, Sunni on \nShia.\n  Let me make a point about Iraq that I think is important. The \ndictator who used to exist in Iraq no longer exists. Yes, he was a \nmadman and a dictator. We have unearthed mass graves in Iraq to show \nthat nearly a half million people were murdered by the man who ran that \ncountry. But he has been executed, and the people of Iraq have had the \nopportunity to vote for a new constitution.\n  The people of Iraq have had the opportunity to vote for a new \ngovernment. Things have changed in Iraq. We now have in Iraq what is \nlargely a civil war, sectarian violence. Things have changed.\n  What is the role, then--given that Saddam Hussein has been executed, \ngiven that there is a new constitution, given that there is a new \ngovernment--what is the role for the United States and its soldiers? Is \nthe role to continue to be in the middle of a civil war in Iraq, to \nsurge additional troops, as the President suggests? That is what was to \nbe debated this week in the Senate. But at this point we still cannot \ndebate that because we are debating whether we will be able to debate \nit. It is unbelievable to me. Only here on this small piece of real \nestate, one of the wonderful places on this Earth, the United States \nSenate, do we have a serious debate about whether we should debate.\n  We should have moved very quickly past this issue of a motion to \nproceed and been to the substance of this issue on behalf of this great \ncountry of ours. There is a majority in this Congress for a bipartisan \nresolution. And I emphasize bipartisan resolution. Senator Warner, a \nvery distinguished American, a Republican, and former chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, and Senator Levin, a Democrat, the same. \nWarner-Levin. When we get to a vote on the Warner-Levin resolution, \nwhich disapproves of surging additional American troops to Iraq and \ndeepening our involvement in Iraq, a majority of the Senate will \nsupport that resolution. There is a clear majority for that resolution. \nThe question is, Can we get to that point?\n  I hope in the coming hours that the minority will relent and give us \nthe opportunity, the opportunity the American people would expect to \nexist in the United States to debate one of the most important \nquestions of our time. This is about obstruction and it is about \npolitical maneuvering and about protecting the White House. It is about \na lot of things, unfortunately. It ought to be about this country's \nnational interest, this country's best interest. It ought to be about \nthe soldiers we have asked to don America's uniforms and go fight for \nthis country and what is best for them as well.\n  Two months ago, General Abizaid said this in open testimony in the \nSenate:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander. I said, in your \n     professional opinion, if we were to bring in more American \n     troops now--he is talking about Iraq--does it add \n     considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq? And \n     they all said no.\n\n  That is what the commanding general said 2 months ago in testimony \nbefore the Senate. Why did they all say no? Here is what General \nAbizaid said the reason is:\n\n       We want the Iraqis to do more. It is easy for the Iraqis to \n     rely upon us to do more. I believe more forces prevents the \n     Iraqis from doing more and taking responsibility for their \n     own future.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, a week ago, the head of our intelligence \nservices came to the Senate and testified in open public hearings. Here \nis what he said:\n\n       Al-Qaeda is a terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including the homeland.\n\n  That is from the top intelligence chief of our country. Here is what \nhe said:\n\n       Al-Qaeda continues to plot attacks against our homeland and \n     other targets with the objective of inflicting mass \n     casualties. They continue to maintain active connections and \n     relationships radiating outward from their leaders' secure \n     hideout in Pakistan.\n\n  Let me say that again. Our top intelligence person says that al-Qaida \nis the greatest terrorist threat to our country; that they direct their \noperations from a secure hideout in Pakistan.\n  Mr. President, a question: If al-Qaida is the greatest terrorist \nthreat to America, and our intelligence chief says it is directed from \ntheir secure hideout in Pakistan, and we know that Osama bin Laden \ncontinues to talk to us in his missives that they send out; if we have \n21,000 additional soldiers to surge anywhere, why on Earth would we not \nuse those 21,000 soldiers to eliminate the greatest terrorist threat to \nour country, which would be to eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida?\n  No, that is not what the President recommends. He recommends we send \n21,000 additional soldiers into the neighborhoods of Baghdad where \nsectarian violence is occurring in massive quantities and a civil war \nexists. With all due respect, and I do respect the President, he is \nwrong, and I believe the majority of this Senate would say he is wrong \nby voting for the Warner-Levin resolution.\n  In a Byzantine twist, however, on this Tuesday morning, we find \nourselves debating the question of whether we should debate one of the \ncentral questions of our time.\n\n  That is unworthy of the Senate. What is worthy of this Senate, and I \nam proud to be a part of it what is worthy of us is to have on the \nfloor of the United States Senate the great questions before this \ncountry, the questions the American people ask this morning and discuss \nthis morning all across this country: What is our role here? What is \nhappening here? How have things changed in Iraq? What is the greatest \nthreat to our country? How do we deal with that threat? What about Mr. \nNegroponte pointing out that the greatest terrorist threat is al-Qaida? \nWhat about the fact he says they are in a secure hideaway in Pakistan? \nWhat about the fact that no one has done anything about it? What about \nthe fact that if 21,000 soldiers are available to be surged, that the \nPresident says let's send them to Baghdad, in the middle of a civil war \nin Iraq, rather than going to Pakistan after the leadership of the \ngreatest terrorist threat to this country, according to our \nintelligence chief?\n  I simply do not understand this logic. There is a lot to be said \nabout these issues. All of us in this Chamber want the same thing for \nour country. All of us love this country. All of us respect our \nsoldiers and will do everything to make sure we support them. All of us \nwant this country to do well and to make the right decisions. In the \nlast 5 years, however, we have been involved in a war that has lasted \nlonger than the Second World War. We have been in a war that has cost \nus far too many lives and too much of America's treasure. We have been \nput in a situation in which there has been dramatic change. Yet the \npolicy has not changed. This is not the circumstance for which we went \nto war in Iraq. All of that intelligence, it turns out, was wrong.\n  Colonel Wilkerson, who served as Secretary of State Colin Powell's \naide for 17 years and was present when the information was compiled \nthat led to the presentation at the United Nations, testified before \nthe Senate, and he said publicly that it was the perpetration of a hoax \non the American people. That is not me speaking. That is someone who \nhad a distinguished record and who served 17 years with Colin Powell. \nHe was a Republican and proud of his service to this country, but he \nsaid all of the intelligence that was basketed together and presented \nwas the perpetration of a hoax on the American people.\n  Whatever happened, happened. We went to Iraq. Saddam Hussein has now \nbeen executed. Iraq has a new constitution and a government. It is \ntime, long past time for this country to say this to the country of \nIraq: Saddam Hussein is gone. You have a new constitution. You have a \nnew government. The question is this: Do you have the will to provide \nfor your own security? Because if you don't, no one in the world can do \nit for you. Do you have the will to take your country back? This is \nyour country, not ours. This country belongs to you, not us. Do you \nhave the will to provide the security for a free Iraq? Because if you \ndo not, I say to the people of Iraq, American soldiers cannot, for any \nindefinite period, provide order and\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\nsecurity in Iraq for you. You have to make that judgment, and you have \nto understand that it is your responsibility to provide security in \nIraq.\n  This is not a circumstance where we are trying to embarrass anybody. \nWe are not trying to say to the President: You have an awful situation \nyou have created, shame on you. That is not what this debate is about. \nAll of us understand that things have changed. This debate is about \nwhat do we do at this point. Do we agree with the President that we \nshould send 21,000 more American troops into Baghdad and surge and \ndeepen America's involvement in this war?\n  Quite clearly, if we are allowed to get to this debate and have a \nvote on Warner-Levin, a bipartisan resolution, this Senate will say, \nno, we believe it is the wrong thing, and that will be the first step \nin beginning to change policy. It will say to the President, we believe \nyou must change the policy, and then use our energies and our efforts \nto go after the leadership of al-Qaida. They are the ones who murdered \nAmericans on 9/11, and they still exist in secure hideaways, according \nto our intelligence chief. Let's deal with the greatest terrorist \nthreat to this country, according to Mr. Negroponte, the head of \nAmerican intelligence. The greatest threat to our country. They exist. \nThey live today, he says, in Pakistan. Let's deal with those issues.\n  As I indicated earlier, all of us want the same thing for our \ncountry. This is not about politics. It cannot be about politics. It is \nabout policy and what works for America's future, what strengthens our \ncountry, what keeps our promise to our soldiers, and what keeps our \ncommitment to ourselves as one of the great symbols of freedom in the \nworld. That is why I hope we will get past this issue that has now \nimpaled this Senate, a debate about whether we should debate. The \nanswer clearly ought to be, yes, we ought to get to the debate that is \nsignificant and important to the future of this great country of ours.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The absence of a quorum has been \nsuggested.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, for the last few weeks, a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators has worked to bring to the floor a resolution \nexpressing opposition to the President's proposal to increase American \ntroops in Iraq. In an effort to have an honest, thoughtful, and \nproductive debate, they put aside their differences, only to be run \nover by partisan politics. I support the bipartisan resolution opposing \nthe escalation. I support an honest and open debate on a policy that \nclearly needs to change. But I do not support what I saw take place in \nthis Chamber yesterday.\n  Our soldiers and their families have sacrificed too much to accept \nthe political obstructionism that is keeping this body from having a \ndebate on a most critical issue. Our troops have given so much, and \nthey deserve much more than what they got from the U.S. Senate \nyesterday. The least we can do is to have this debate, and the best we \ncan do is to get this policy right for our troops.\n  I would like to thank those who worked on this resolution: Senators \nLevin and Warner and Senators Biden and Hagel and others. Throughout \ntheir careers, they have shown how much they care for the men and women \nin uniform. In crafting these resolutions, they showed us that when \nprincipled individuals from opposing parties care strongly about an \nissue, politics doesn't always have to win out.\n  Unfortunately, some in this body still don't want to have a debate \nabout Iraq. It is long past time to have this debate. The American \npeople have called for it, our troops have earned it, and we should be \nbig enough to have it.\n  Over 3,000 American soldiers are dead, more than 20,000 have been \nwounded in combat, over 2,000 have lost their limbs, and more than $350 \nbillion of taxpayer money has gone to Iraq. Scores of Iraqis are killed \nevery day in what has essentially devolved into a civil war.\n  All across my State, I have heard a strong and clear message from \nMinnesotans: Change the course in Iraq and push for the strategy and \nsolutions that will bring our troops home. We need a surge in \ndiplomacy, Mr. President, not a surge in troops. It is a message that \nwas echoed all across this country from Montana to Minnesota, from \nPennsylvania to Virginia. Unfortunately, there were those in this \nChamber yesterday who did not listen to that message, who would prefer \nno debate. This bipartisan resolution expresses the strong opposition \nof this body to the President's decision to stay the course and send an \nadditional 21,000 American troops to Iraq. I strongly support this \nbipartisan resolution and implore my colleagues to allow this \nresolution its due course.\n  The people of Minnesota, like their fellow citizens around the \ncountry, recognize what is at stake in Iraq. Of the 22,000 troops \ninvolved in the surge, nearly 3,000 are from Minnesota. As I have \ntraveled throughout our State, I have spoken with many families who \nhave paid a personal price in this war, and I think of them often.\n  I think of Claremont Anderson from Hoffman, MN, who would drive \nhundreds of miles to attend public events in the last 2 years. I just \nsaw him and his wife Nancy this weekend; they braved 7-degree below-\nzero wind chills to come to an event in Glenwood, MN. When I see \nClaremont, any time anyone even talks about the war, he starts to cry. \nThat is because his son Stuart, an Army Reserve major, was killed in a \nhelicopter crash in Iraq.\n  I think of Kathleen Wosika from St. Paul, MN. Just last month, her \nson, James Wosika, Jr., was killed while he was patrolling on foot in \nan area near Fallujah. He was a sergeant with the Army National Guard \n1st Brigade, whose current duty will be extended under the President's \nescalation. Sergeant Wosika was the third member of his unit to die \nwithin a 6-month period. He was the seventh member of the brigade to be \nkilled since their deployment last spring.\n  I also think of Becky Lourey of Kerrick, MN. That is near Duluth. She \nis a mother of 12 and a former State senator. Her son Matt was killed \nwhen the Army helicopter he was piloting went down north of Baghdad. I \nwatched this Gold Star mother, a woman who has adopted eight children, \ncomfort her grandchildren, hold her shaking husband, and stand tall for \nhours in a high school gym in Finlayson, MN, where hundreds of people \ncame to gather for her son's memorial service.\n  Claremont Anderson, Kathleen Wosika, and Becky Lourey are parents \nwhose children made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country, \nand they are among the many Minnesotans who told me without apology \nthey want to see a change of course in Iraq. They pray others will not \nhave to experience their pain.\n  Although I opposed this war from the beginning, I recognized that \nmany did support it. But 4 years later, we are now dealing with a \ndramatically different situation. What we know now about the events and \nfacts leading up to this war has changed dramatically. The conditions \ninside Iraq have changed dramatically. Our role there has changed \ndramatically.\n  Last November, citizens in Minnesota and across the country voted for \na new direction in Washington. Americans made clear at the ballot box \nthey were tired of the politics-as-usual partisan bickering and that \nthey wanted a meaningful and bipartisan change of course in Iraq. To \nthe country's bewilderment, the President responded with a plan to \nescalate the number of American troops in Iraq. That is not the change \nin course the American people voted for. It is not the change in course \nthe Iraq Study Group recommended. It is not the change in course Iraq \nneeds to halt its civil war. It is not the change in course our \nmilitary forces deserve.\n  Distinguished Senators from both sides of the aisle are seeking ways \nfor this body to bring about the right kind of change. The bipartisan \nresolution proposes a strategy that recognizes the facts on the ground \nin Iraq. It incorporates many of the recommendations of the Iraq Study \nGroup.\n  For years, we have heard from administration officials, from military\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\nofficials, and from the Iraqis themselves that there can be no military \nsolution in Iraq. Stability can only be achieved through diplomatic and \npolitical solutions. This resolution calls on the administration to \nengage other nations in the region to create conditions for the \ncompromises between Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds that will be \nnecessary for peace. Furthermore, the resolution calls on the \nadministration to apply pressures on the Iraqis themselves to stand up \nand take responsibility for their country. By following the \nrecommendations of this resolution, the President would send a much \nstronger signal to the Iraqis that we are not going to be staying \nthere indefinitely.\n\n  As of last Thanksgiving, this war has now lasted longer than World \nWar II, and after nearly 4 years of intensive military involvement in \nIraq, including more than 3,000 American deaths, we have to be focused \non reducing our troop presence in Iraq instead of putting even more \nAmerican service men and women in harm's way. Haven't we asked our men \nand women to sacrifice enough?\n  Recently, at the funeral for a fallen soldier, I heard a local priest \nsay that our leaders have an obligation to do right by our children \nwhen we send them to war. He said that our children may be over 6 feet \ntall when we send them to war, but they are still our children. ``If \nthe kids we are sending to Iraq are 6 feet tall,'' he said, ``then our \nleaders must be 8 feet tall.'' I would add that if these soldiers are \nwilling to stand up and risk their lives for our country, then those of \nus in the Congress must be brave enough to stand up and ask the tough \nquestions and push for the tough solutions.\n  Claremont Anderson, Kathleen Wosika, and Becky Lourey are standing \ntall. The parents I met with this weekend whose kids are supposed to be \ncoming home this month but are now staying much longer, they are now \ndoing everything to be brave and stand tall. The 400 members of the Air \nMinnesota National Guard whose deployment ceremony I attended Sunday, \nin Duluth, MN, they are standing tall. The teenage brother and sister \nwho will see not only their dad but also their mom be deployed in the \nnext 2 weeks, those two kids are standing tall. My friend Senator Webb, \nwho will speak with us momentarily and whose son is serving bravely, he \nis over there and he is not afraid. He is standing tall. The injured \nsoldiers in the VA hospital in Minnesota recovering from traumatic \nbrain injuries and in their wheelchairs with their strength and their \nspirit, they too are standing tall.\n  I would say to my friends across the aisle, by having an honest and \nopen debate on this war and on this resolution, we in Congress can also \nand finally stand tall.\n  Our Constitution says that Congress should be a responsible check and \nbalance on Presidential power. Congressional oversight for Iraq policy \nis long overdue. We have seen this bipartisan resolution and bipartisan \nwork challenging the President's proposal for an escalation of American \ntroop levels in Iraq. Even as Commander In Chief, our President does \nnot enjoy unlimited power. On behalf of the public, Members of this \nbody have a responsibility to exercise our own constitutional power in \na fairminded, bipartisan way, to insist on accountability, and to \ndemand a change of course. Ultimately, the best way to help our \nsoldiers and their families is not only to give them the respect they \ndeserve but also to get this policy right.\n  I hope that my friends across the aisle will see the merits of this \nresolution and the urgency of having an open and honest debate on this \nissue; our troops and their families deserve nothing less.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the Senator from \nMinnesota, for her kind remarks about the people who have served.\n  I emphasize my support for the resolution--actually, the \nresolutions--that were so painstakingly put together by a number of \nsenior Senators from both sides of the aisle, only to be denied a full \ndebate and an open vote through the procedural motions yesterday \nevening.\n  Winston Churchill once wrote about watching good ideas getting \nnibbled to death by ducks. Last night, we saw this phenomenon in \naction. We had before the Senate a measure that would allow this \nCongress to speak clearly of concerns regarding the woeful lack of \nleadership by the President on an issue that affects our Nation and our \nmilitary people such as no other. And the other side--including some \nSenators who had helped to draft the resolutions and had their names on \nit--punted the ball down field rather than giving the people of this \ncountry the debate they not only need but are calling for in every \nopinion poll.\n  Quite simply, there is no way, other than through a strong resolution \nor restrictive language in an appropriations bill, for this Senate to \ncommunicate to this administration that its so-called new strategy is \nlacking in the most crucial elements that might actually lead to a \nsolution in Iraq. This is not a strategy. It is a one-dimensional \ntactical adjustment that avoids the elements of a true overarching \nnational strategy. It relies too heavily on our military, while \nignoring the overwhelming advice of those with long experience in this \nregion that we must pursue robust diplomacy in order to bring this \nmisguided effort to a conclusion.\n  There have been allegations by those on the other side that we who \ntake this position are not supporting the troops. I submit that the \nbest way to support the troops would be for this administration to \noutline and pursue a comprehensive strategy that includes the \ndiplomatic measures that will be essential to ending our involvement.\n  Mr. President, a reminder: During the Vietnam war our military killed \nmore than a million enemy soldiers--enemy soldiers--by official count \nof the present Hanoi Government. Actually, that count is 1.4 million \nenemy soldiers. But without a clear strategy and without adept \ndiplomacy, that simply was not enough. From the very beginning in Iraq, \nthis administration has consciously neglected its proper diplomatic \nduties. It has attempted to frame the debate over Iraq's future as one \nof military action on the one hand and a set of vague guidelines to the \nIraqi Government on the other, as if the rest of the region were \nsomehow not crucial to the eventual outcome. This, in and of itself, is \na recipe for continued violence and for American failure in Iraq.\n  It is widely known that the Iraqi Government lacks the power to \ncontrol the myriad of factions that are causing chaos. The latest \nNational Intelligence Estimate not only confirms this, it indicates \nthat these factions have been broken into so many different components \nthat it is not even fair to call this problem one of sectarian violence \nany longer. The administration knows this. Most of the administration's \nstrongest supporters know this. Their reaction has been to increase the \npressure on an impotent government and to go to the well, again and \nagain, asking for even greater sacrifices from the military, while \nignoring their most basic responsibility, which is to put together a \nclear diplomatic effort that will bring full context to the issues that \nface us and, in short order, end our involvement. This is not \nsupporting the troops. This is misusing the troops.\n  With respect to the troops, I would caution any political leader who \nclaims to speak on behalf of the political views of our men and women \nin uniform. Our military people are largely a mirror of our society, \nparticularly in the enlisted ranks, and their political views are as \ndiverse as our own.\n  As one example, last year, a survey of those in Iraq indicated that \nmore than 70 percent believed that the United States should exit Iraq \nwithin a year. That was a year ago. As I have said before, it is \ninverted logic to claim we should continue to fight this war on behalf \nof the troops. The fact is, they are fighting this war on behalf of the \npolitical process. They deserve political leadership that is \nknowledgeable and that proceeds from an assumption that our national \ngoals are equal to the sacrifices we are asking them to make.\n  For the last 5 years, from before this invasion, this administration \nand its supporters have refused to admit the most fundamental truth of \nthe entire war. It is a truth that was echoed over and over again last \nmonth by expert\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nwitnesses during more than a dozen hearings before the Foreign \nRelations Committee and the Committee on Armed Services, both of which \nI am privileged to serve upon. It is a truth that this administration \nand the architects of this war too often refuse to recognize, perhaps \nbecause they fear it might potentially embarrass them in the eyes of \nhistory.\n  The unavoidable truth is that this war will never be brought to a \nproper conclusion without the active participation of the other \ncountries in the region--all of them.\n  We hear stories of the Saudis helping the Sunni insurgency. We are \ntold by this administration Iran is equipping and training portions of \nthe Shia militias. We hear Turkey and Iran are quietly cooperating to \nlimit the influence of Kurds. We hear Syria is the favorite starting \npoint for many al-Qaida guerillas who infiltrate into Al Anbar \nProvince. We know the entire region is being flooded with refugees from \nthe violence in Iraq, including, especially, Jordan and Syria.\n  None of this is surprising. Indeed, all of it was predictable and \npredicted, even before the invasion of Iraq. I recall many of the \nspeeches by the Presiding Officer on those points. What is truly \nsurprising and unsettling is that this administration has not developed \nan overt diplomatic effort to bring order out of this chaos in a way \nthat might allow us to dramatically decrease our presence in Iraq and, \nat the same time, increase the stability of the region, increase our \nability to fight terrorism, and allow us to address strategic \nchallenges elsewhere in the world.\n  These countries have historic, political, and cultural ties to Iraq. \nThey are going to be involved in Iraq's affairs in the future, long \nafter the United States departs the region. It is in our national \ninterests and, as a great nation, it is our obligation to take the lead \nin causing each of these countries to deal responsibly with Iraq's \nchaos and with its future. We did exactly this in 2001, after the \ninvasion of Afghanistan, bringing the major players to the table, \nincluding India, Pakistan, and Iran, and we should do so now.\n\n  This approach would have additional benefits beyond Iraq. It would \nbegin to loosen the unnatural alliance between Iran and Syria which \ncould, in turn, increase the potential for greater stability in \nLebanon, Israel, and the surrounding territories. It would begin to \nbring countries such as Iran to a proper role of responsibility inside \nthe international community.\n  On this point, I cite an important historical reference. In 1971, \nChina, similar to Iran today, was considered a rogue Nation. China, in \nthose days, was already a nuclear power. It had an American war on its \nborders in Vietnam, a war it was actively assisting. We, the United \nStates, took the initiative, aggressively opening China through \ndiplomatic energy and, over time, helped to bring China into the \ninternational community. We should not be afraid of taking similar \nactions with Iran and also, by the way, with Syria.\n  The bottom line of all this is this administration and its supporters \nmust understand the realities that are causing us as a Congress to \nfinally say ``enough is enough;'' that the time has come for a new \napproach; that the answer in Iraq and to our fight against \ninternational terrorism and to our diminished posture around the world \nis for us to show not only our prowess on the battlefield but also our \nleadership in the diplomatic arena; that, indeed, we have an obligation \nto the men and women who have served so selflessly on our behalf, to \nmatch their proficiency and their loyalties with the kind of thoughtful \nleadership that will bring this effort to a proper conclusion.\n  If there were other ways to convince this administration to change \nits ineffective one-dimensional approach to the situation in Iraq, I \nwould welcome them, but after 5 years of political disarray, I do not \nbelieve it is so. I support this resolution as a first step in \nreclaiming America's strategic purpose and international reputation. I \nurge my fellow Senators to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I came to the Senate to talk about the loss \nof a great soldier and dear friend of mine, but before I do that, I \nwill comment on a few things we have heard discussed this morning.\n  First, our efforts on this side are to get an opportunity to debate \nand vote on the Gregg amendment. The Gregg amendment, very simply \nstated--I don't have the full text in front of me--supports our troops. \nIt says we should support our troops and not cut off funding. That is a \nvalid viewpoint. We are at war. Traditionally, this Senate has \nsupported our troops. That used to be the absolute baseline which \neveryone accepted. The main resolution that has been referred to, I \nfear, goes in the wrong direction.\n  We, in time of war, ought to debate, and we will debate fully, and \neveryone will have an opportunity to express their views--but I think \nit is very important we not only have an opportunity to vote on the two \nresolutions which have been discussed but also to vote on the Gregg \namendment. As soon as we can get agreement to do that, I am confident \nthe leaders can move forward.\n  I have also heard in the Senate a number of comments from Members who \ndo not support a cut-and-run policy. I have addressed previously the \ndisaster of an immediate withdrawal from Iraq. In open testimony, the \nintelligence community--the Director of National Intelligence--the \nDirector of CIA, the Director of Military Intelligence, said chaos \nwould reign in Iraq if we withdrew precipitously. It would fall into \nchaos. The primary beneficiary of that chaos would be al-Qaida. Osama \nbin Laden and Al-Jazeera have said how important it was for them to \nestablish Iraq as their main base of operations.\n  Second, there would be chaos and slaughter of innocent civilians, \nboth Shia and Sunni. There would be a tremendous increase in the deaths \nof civilians. But even more frightening, the neighboring states would \nlikely be brought in. The Sunni states would likely come to the aid of \ntheir Sunni brethren, and if that had not already triggered the \nentrance of Iran into it on behalf of the Shia, it surely would, and we \ncould potentially be facing a major Middle East conflict with many \nstates involved.\n  I have heard it said that the Levin-Warner resolution asks we chart a \nnew direction. We have charted a new direction. And the way forward is \na new direction. The President has the agreement of Prime Minister al-\nMaliki and the Shia, Sunni, and Kurdish government of Iraq that they \nwill take control and they will assume responsibility. They need help \nin training particularly their police, but they will take control. That \nis where we need to be.\n  We can help pick off the al-Qaida and the other committed \ninternational terrorists, the radical Islamists. But we need them to \nresolve this civil strife between Shia and Sunni, and do so in a fair \nway, including the Kurds and the Sunnis.\n  This happens to be the military plan the Baker-Hamilton group \nsupported. They said to enable the Iraqi security, military, and police \nto take over, we should send in some troops temporarily. That is what \nthe President is doing, adding another 21,000 to support them.\n  Is this going to work? Well, again, with the release of the National \nIntelligence Estimate on Iraq and the open testimony of the leaders of \nthe intelligence community, they said it is an open question. It is a \ntough decision. But it is the best option we have.\n  Yes, they think there is a chance it will work. And the Iraqi \nGovernment knows this is their last best chance. They had best make it \nwork. And they best get their police trained and their military \ntrained.\n  Many people have called for bringing in other nations in the Middle \nEast. That is what the President and Secretary Rice have done, to bring \nin other nations that will help rebuild the Sunni areas and help \nprovide support to the Iraqis.\n  There are some people who say we should not have an unlimited \ncommitment. Well, the President has told not only this Nation but Prime \nMinister al-Maliki there is a time deadline. We are committed to them \nbut not indefinitely. And if they do not take advantage of this \nopportunity, it will be their country which will fall into chaos\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\nand be the battleground, perhaps embroiling the entire region, but \ncertainly wiping out and causing great death and destruction in their \nown country. So we do have a new direction.\n  Now, some are pushing a resolution that challenges the President's \nimplementation of the plan. We are trying to be generals and say \nGeneral Petraeus--whom we just confirmed unanimously because he is such \na great general, who said we should have those 21,000 troops--they are \nchallenging his military judgment in the implementation of the plan.\n  I know many of my colleagues have followed military policy for many \nyears, but I do not think we in this body can determine for the \ngenerals what the proper level of troop commitments is. They are the \nones who take responsibility for the lives of their men and women. To \nsend a message by adopting a resolution that says we oppose the \nPresident's plan, implementation of his plan, is not going to change \nsending more American troops there.\n  But it will tell al-Qaida: Good news, boys, the Congress is opposing \nthe President. Our chances look better to take over the country.\n  And it will send a message to friendly countries that are trying to \nhelp the Iraqis telling them: Sorry guys, we are not interested in \nwinning this, so you probably would not want to waste your effort \nhelping us.\n  Finally, what does it send as a message to our troops: We do not \nsupport the military plan they are being asked to carry out, the men \nand women who are risking their lives? Does that make any sense? I fear \nnot.\n  I hope we can reject very soundly the Levin-Warner amendment and \nadopt the Gregg amendment and also the McCain amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1596-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1596-S1597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT GENERAL CHARLES M. KIEFNER\n\n  Mr. BOND. Now, Mr. President, let me turn to another matter, a matter \nof sorrow. I tell this body that at a wonderful military ceremony last \nSaturday, we laid to rest LTG Charles M. Kiefner, formerly Adjutant \nGeneral of the Missouri National Guard--a man who I considered a friend \nfor almost 40 years, a man whose career was an amazing one.\n  I called on him to serve as my Adjutant General for the 8 years I \nserved as Governor. Having come from the Guard, he was the youngest \nAdjutant General at the time, still by far the youngest Adjutant \nGeneral in Missouri. But he knew the citizen soldiers who made up the \nGuard. He knew those citizen soldiers and respected them, and they \nrespected him.\n  When I left office and Governor Ashcroft took over, he made him his \nAdjutant General for the next 8 years. He served 16 years. In that \ntime, he not only built the Missouri National Guard to be one of the \nfinest units--Air and Army National Guard--in America, but he was very \nstrong in establishing a Guard presence on Capitol Hill.\n  It was at his urging that I went to my colleague, Wendell Ford of \nKentucky, and we set up the National Guard Caucus, on which today \nSenator Pat Leahy and I proudly serve as cochairmen. That caucus has \nbrought together 75 to 80 Members of this body to stand up for the \nnecessary resources, the necessary personnel, and the necessary support \nof the Guard when active forces in the Pentagon tend to overlook them.\n  The Guard is a better place today because of the leadership that \nGeneral Kiefner showed as he headed the National Guard, the Adjutants \nGeneral Association, as he worked with his colleagues throughout the \ncountry, and as he and those generals worked to make sure the Guard was \nstrengthened.\n  The Guard remembers him with great fondness. Lieutenant General \nVaughn of Missouri, who had served in the Guard under General Kiefner, \npresented the flag to his wonderful wife Marilyn, his sons John and \nKeith.\n  Charles M. Kiefner was born June 28, 1930, in Cape Girardeau, MO. He \ngraduated from high school in 1948 and attended Westminster College in \nFulton. He earned his bachelor of arts degree from Columbia College in \n1975.\n  General M. Keifner, or Charlie to his friends--and I am lucky to have \ncounted myself as one of his many--was a great man and a great American \npatriot. Under his strong leadership, including as the youngest \nAdjutant General, the men and women in the Missouri National Guard came \nto exemplify the best this country has to offer.\n  Having begun his military career by enlisting as a private in Company \nF, 140th Infantry Regiment of the Missouri Army National Guard on \nSeptember 24, 1947, General Keifner entered active duty on September \n11, 1950, with the 175th Military Police Battalion of Missouri Army \nNational Guard and served in Germany with that unit. He was \ncommissioned a second lieutenant, Infantry on December 21, 1951. He \nserved as platoon leader, company commander, battalion motor officer, \nBattalion S-2, brigade adjutant and S-3, executive officer and \nlogistics officer on the staff of the Adjutant General. As a member of \nthe U.S. Army Reserve, from September 11, 1978, to November 5, 1980, he \nserved as liaison officer to the U.S. Military Academy, West Point.\n  General Kiefner was first appointed Adjutant General by me on May 8, \n1973, when I served as Missouri's Governor, and held the Adjutant \nGeneral's position until March 1977, when I left the Governor's office. \nUpon my reelection in 1981, I once again called on this great leader \nand appointed General Kiefner to lead the Missouri National Guard. \nGeneral Kiefner served as Adjutant General throughout my two terms as \nMissouri Governor. As a testament to his skill and great leadership, he \nwas later called upon by Governor John Ashcroft to serve 8 more years \nin the Ashcroft administration.\n  General Kiefner not only served Missouri admirably, he also served \nhis nation with honor. A friend who knew him for 35 years during his \nservice in the Guard recalls:\n\n       He was a professional soldier who made a point to know what \n     was going on at every level of the Guard, from the enlisted \n     soldiers to the three star Generals. He knew precisely what \n     the threat to our homeland was and made great efforts to \n     ensure the Guard was prepared to protect us from those \n     threats.\n\n  Members of the Army National Guard knew and respected General Kiefner \nand called upon him to serve as president of the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, a position he held proudly and worked \ndiligently to enhance our Nation's modern-day minutemen's and women's \nability to meet their dual-mission at home and abroad.\n  Upon his retirement from the National Guard in 1993, Major General \nKiefner was promoted to the grade of lieutenant general, Missouri \nNational Guard Retired List by Governor Mel Carnahan. ``At his own \nretirement he could not speak because he knew the overwhelming emotion \nhe would feel at leaving the service he loved so dearly would overcome \nhim,'' said one friend and colleague. ``He was an emotional man that \nwas totally committed to his country, Missourians, and the men under \nhis command.''\n  His many decorations and awards include: the Distinguished Service \nMedal, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, Meritorious Service \nMedal, Army Commendation Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, Good \nConduct Medal, Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal, Humanitarian \nService Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, Department of Defense \nIdentification Badge, Ranger Tab, NGB Distinguished Service Medal, \nNGAUS Distinguished Service Medal, Missouri Meritorious Service Medal, \nMissouri Conspicuous Service Medal, Indiana Distinguished Service \nMedal, Minnesota Distinguished Service Medal, Tennessee Distinguished \nService Medal, Minnesota Medal for Merit, 1992 Distinguished Alumni \nAward--Westminster College, Field Artillery Association Order of Saint \nBarbara, Army Engineers Association Silver Order of the de Fleury \nMedal, and the Sons of the American Revolution Silver Good Citizenship \nAward.\n  Charlie understood the great citizen soldiers who signed up for the \nGuard. When he gave them an order they knew he understood them and they \nwere willing to follow.\n  I have lost a great friend, not just a former Adjutant General. There \nhave been many fine individuals who have worn the uniform of our \nNation's Army National Guard, but none more proudly than LTG Charles M. \nKiefner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

He was from \nPhelan, CA.\n\n\n                            iraq escalation\n\n  When General William Sherman said ``war is hell,'' he certainly knew \nwhat he was talking about. After nearly 4 years in Iraq, I know of no \none today who would argue with that statement. As Members of Congress, \nwe have an awesome responsibility to decide whether to send America's \nsons and daughters into war. I voted against the resolution authorizing \nthe President to go to war in Iraq because I didn't believe we should \nhave been rushing to say to the President: Go it alone, you have a \nblank check.\n  This is what I said at the time, October 10, 2002, which is just \nbefore this Senate voted to give the President authority to go to war:\n\n       I never have seen a situation where the President of the \n     United States asked for the ability to go to war alone and \n     yet has not told the American people what that would mean. \n     How many troops would be involved? How many casualties would \n     there be? Would the U.S. have to foot the entire cost of \n     using force against Iraq? If not, which nations are ready to \n     provide financial support? Troop support? What will the cost \n     be to rebuild Iraq? How long would our troops have to stay \n     there? What if our troops become a target for terrorists?\n\n  Obviously, I didn't know the answers to those questions that weighed \non my heart that day, but today I know that there are more than 138,000 \ntroops serving in Iraq, with a big escalation to come, an escalation \nthat the Republicans would not allow us to vote on. I know that 3,098 \nsoldiers have been killed and more than 23,000 have been wounded. I \nknow we have spent $379 billion and that doesn't include the \nPresident's latest request. And I know, as we all do, that our troops \nare targets for terrorism and that 61 percent of Iraqis think it is OK \nto shoot an American soldier. How can this President send more of our \ntroops into a country he says he is trying to help when 61 percent of \nthe Iraqi people say it is OK to shoot and kill an American soldier, \nand 71 percent of Iraqis want us out of Iraq within a year? We now have \nanswers to the questions I raised that bleak day--terrible answers. Yet \nmy Republican colleagues wouldn't allow us to vote on a resolution \nopposing an escalation of this war, an escalation of over 40,000 \ntroops, when you consider the support troops.\n  We know that a majority of Senators oppose this escalation. We know \nthe majority of the American people oppose this escalation. Yet we \ncan't vote on it. Many of us have gone further. We have proposed \nresolutions and bills to start redeploying our troops out of Iraq. We \nhave called on the Iraqis--a majority of us last year--to shoulder the \nburden of defending their own country.\n  It seems like yesterday when we passed the 1,000 dead mark and then \n1,500 dead mark and then the 2,000 dead mark and then the 2,500 dead \nmark. Now it is more than 3,000 dead. I remember when we hit the 2,500 \ndead mark last June. A reporter at the White House press briefing asked \nMr. Bush's press secretary, Tony Snow, if the President had any \nreaction. Mr.\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\nSnow said: ``It's a number, and every time there's one of those 500 \nbenchmarks, people want something.''\n  What does that even mean? He calls 500 American dead benchmarks? That \nwas a low point even for this administration that keeps on saying, if \nyou don't support the war, you don't support the troops. That is \nhogwash. How do you support the troops when you send them into the \nmiddle of a civil war where they don't even know who is shooting at \nthem? How do you support the troops? Three thousand ninety-eight \nsoldiers dead is not just a number; those are people. That is 3,098 \nfamilies who are forever changed. To put more of them in harm's way, to \nescalate our involvement does not say to me we love them. It says to me \nwe have not thought this through. We are not listening or this \nadministration is not listening to the Iraq Study Group. It is not \nlistening to the military generals who came before us to say this is \nwrong. It is not listening to the American people.\n  Again and again this White House closes its eyes on the reality of \nthis war. I know they don't want to see the tragic truth. But if you \nare going to make a decision to send our soldiers to war, you better be \nable to look at the consequences of that decision. They would not even \nlet us vote on this escalation. The White House doesn't want that vote. \nThey don't want to be second-guessed. They don't want to be \nembarrassed. They don't want to hear what this Democratic Congress has \nto say. And guess what. Elections have consequences--how many times has \nthe President told us that--and this election had consequences. It \nmeans we have to take off the rose-colored glasses.\n  Let's look at the events of Sunday, January 28, in Iraq, as told by \ntwo Los Angeles Times reporters, Louise Rough and Borzou Daragahi. That \nSunday in America happened to be my wedding anniversary, a day of rest \nfor many, a day of relaxation, a day for religion, a day for football, \na day for basketball, a day for movies, a day for fun, a day for \nfamily; in Iraq, a day of hell.\n  The headline of the LA Times, the following Monday, reads: ``Hundreds \nDie in Clash near Iraq Holy City.'' Here is the article. I don't know \nif this can be seen on the television, but it is a beautiful young \ngirl, an Iraqi teenage girl. It could be your daughter; it could be \nmine. She is leaving school. She is stepping down steps that are \nbloodied by the blood of her schoolmates. She is barely looking around, \nand no one is helping her. This is a sight that is too often the \nreality in Iraq. The child has seen what no child should ever see, what \nwe would do anything in the world to stop our children from seeing. And \nshe appears numb.\n  The reporters write about fighting erupting near holy city of Najaf \non the Shiite holiday of Ashura. There were conflicting reports as to \nwhether the fighters causing the trouble were Shiite or Sunni militia, \nbut we know that our soldiers, working with Iraqis, killed several \nhundred gunmen in a fierce fight and a helicopter went down, our \nhelicopter, and we lost our people.\n\n  The reporters point out that our forces are fighting ``a complex \npatchwork of elusive enemies,'' and the deaths outside of Najaf would \nconstitute the highest daily casualty toll inflicted by U.S. and Iraqi \nforces since U.S. troops arrived in Baghdad shortly after the March \n2003 invasion.\n  This group we wound up fighting, because the Iraqi soldiers couldn't \nhandle it and they called us in, call themselves Heaven's Army, a \nmessianic cult who believes in the imminent return of Imam Mahdi, the \nlast in the line of Shiite saints who disappeared more than 1,000 years \nago.\n  Nomas, who is a spokesperson for the Iraqis, went on to lament to the \nreporters that many Shiites believe the end days are coming, due to all \nof the violence. This is what he said:\n\n       There's nothing bizarre in Iraq anymore. We've seen the \n     most incredible things.\n\n  People think the end is near, and that is what this President is \nsending more troops into.\n  Our troops have seen things we can hardly imagine, things that may \nhaunt them throughout their lives. I have worked hard with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to try and fashion some \nlegislation so we have a commission that is set up to look at the \nmental health problems of our soldiers. They are deep, the signature \nwounds of this war, brain damage and posttraumatic stress.\n  In other parts of Iraq that Sunday, in addition to that school I \nshowed and in addition to the fight with Heaven's Army, the messianic \ncult, we lost two U.S. soldiers and a marine. In Kirkuk, violence \nraged. In Babil Province, mortar rounds killed 10, and 5 bodies were \nfound in the Tigris River. There was an assassination in Kut, a deadly \ncar bombing in Fallujah. In western Baghdad, explosives hidden in a \nwooden cart killed 4 and injured 18, and an Industry Ministry advisor \nand his daughter were shot to death.\n  On the east side of the Tigris, a bomb exploded on a bus, killing \none. Two other bombs exploded, killing seven. A bank clerk was killed \nby gunmen in a car near her home. This was all in this one article. \nThis is one day, January 28, one day. Fifty-four bodies were found, \nincluding a woman kidnapped 2 days prior.\n  And finally, in Diyala Province northeast of Baghdad, 1,500 \npolicemen, Iraqis, were charged with absenteeism and fleeing fighting. \nAnd this is what the President is sending more of our American soldiers \ninto, and they wouldn't let us vote on it here. It is absolutely \noutrageous. It is immoral that we cannot vote on whether we agree with \nthis escalation. Our soldiers gave the Iraqis their freedom, their \nGovernment, a sovereign nation, and now it is the Iraqis' turn to \ndecide their future.\n  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the man who knew a thing or two \nabout being at war said:\n\n       In the truest sense, freedom cannot be bestowed; it must be \n     achieved.\n\n  The Iraqis must achieve it. We cannot want it for them more than they \nare willing to fight for it themselves. All we are doing by sending \nmore troops to Iraq is feeding an already out-of-control dependence. So \nI believe we must not only speak out against the escalation, but we \nshould do everything in our power to stop it. We need to convene an \ninternational conference, as the Iraq Study Group called for. We need \nto call for a cease-fire. I haven't heard the word out of the Malaki's \nlips, ``cease-fire.'' It is his country. His people are killing each \nother. ``Cease-fire'' would be a term of art to give people hope that \nthere can be peace. At this international conference, we can look at \nthe long-term solutions. Right now our troops have mission impossible, \nacting as a police force in the middle of what is, by most accounts, a \ncivil war.\n  Nowhere in the resolution this Senate voted on authorizing force is \nit stated our soldiers' mission is being in the middle of a shooting \ncivil war. We ought to ask this President to come back with a new \nauthorization, if that is what he wants to do.\n  Senator Warner has said that in the past. He said:\n\n       I think we have to examine very carefully what Congress \n     authorized the president to do in the context of a situation, \n     if we're faced with all-out civil war.\n\n  Well, that time has come. This President should, A, send a signal \nthat he wants to see us vote on this escalation of his and, B, be \nwilling to come back with a new authorization that says clearly that it \nis fine for our troops to be in the middle of a civil war. Enough is \nenough.\n  Enough is enough. We have to end the paralysis of ``stay the \ncourse.'' This is a time of great challenge for the U.S. Congress. I \nhave been very proud these past few weeks to see my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle begin to speak out forcefully against this. For me, \nit is easy to oppose the President on this war because, as I said, I \nvoted against it, as did the occupant of the chair at that time. We \ndidn't have our questions answered. I understand it is harder for \nothers. But I believe everybody--at least a majority of the Senate--\nwants to vote on this escalation. They want to be heard on behalf of \ntheir constituents.\n  So it is times like these that I recall the words of one of my \nheroes, the great Martin Luther King, who said:\n\n       The ultimate measure of a man [and I suspect he meant \n     woman, also] is not where they stand in the moments of \n     comfort, but where they stand at times of challenge and \n     controversy.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about \n     things that matter.\n\n  Well, this escalation matters. We ought to be heard on it.\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\n  I commend my leader, Senator Reid, for holding firm on this issue. \nThere ought to be an up-or-down vote on this escalation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1600-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1600-S1607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, my good friend, the majority leader, \nand I have been in a discussion over the last few days, going back to \nlast week, over how to go forward on the Iraq debate. As I have \nindicated to him both privately and publicly, we on this side of the \naisle were certainly looking forward to having an Iraq debate this week \nand are prepared to do so and are ready to go forward.\n  I think we all agree at this moment that there is no more important \nissue facing the Nation than the mission and the fate of the American \nservice men and women in Iraq. This means, of course, that the men and \nwomen of this body have no higher duty than to express ourselves openly \nand honestly on this issue, to take a stand on where we stand. The only \ntruly meaningful tool the Framers gave us to do this was our ability to \nfund or not fund a war. That is it. This is what Republicans are \ninsisting upon--that the Members of this body express themselves on the \nquestion of whether to fund or not to fund the war in Iraq.\n  I had indicated to my good friend, the majority leader, that I would \nbe propounding another unanimous-consent request at this point, and I \nwill do that now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, at a time determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed en bloc to the following concurrent resolutions under the \nfollowing agreement: S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner resolution, which is to \nbe discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee; McCain-Lieberman-\nGraham, regarding benchmarks; Gregg, relating to funding.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 10 hours of \ndebate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nprovided further that no amendments be in order to any of these \nmeasures; further, that at the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to three consecutive votes on the adoption of the concurrent \nresolutions in the following order, with no further action or \nintervening action or debate: McCain-Lieberman-Graham, on benchmarks; \nGregg, on funding and supporting our troops; S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner \nresolution.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that any resolution that does not \nreceive 60 votes in the affirmative, the vote on adoption be vitiated \nand the concurrent resolution be returned to its previous status.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, this is \nbasically the same thing that has been asked before. The issue before \nthe American people is whether the President of the United States, on \nhis own, should be able to send 48,000 American soldiers to Iraq, \ncosting approximately $30 billion extra.\n  The Republicans can run, as I said yesterday, but they cannot hide. \nThat is the issue before the American people. We all support the \ntroops, and we have fought very hard, in spite of our misgivings about \nthis war, to make sure they have everything they have needed.\n  It is interesting that there is a lot of talk about the Gregg \namendment. But if you look at the Gregg amendment and at page 2--the \nlast paragraph on page 2 of his amendment--and you look in the Warner \namendment on page 3, paragraph 4, it is identical language. Warner has \nencapsulated within his amendment what Gregg wanted, which is the so-\ncalled ``resolve clause.''\n  This is all a game to divert attention from the fact that we have \nbefore us now an issue that the American people want us to address: \nwhether there should be a surge, an escalation, an augmentation of the \nalready disastrous war taking place in Iraq, causing 3,100 American \ndeaths, approximately; 24,000 wounded American soldiers, a third of \nwhom are hurt very badly; 2,000 are missing multiple limbs--brain \ninjuries, blindness, paralysis. That is what 8,000 American soldiers \nnow are going through--men and women.\n  So I ask my friend to amend his request in the following manner:\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. Con. Res. 7, by Senator \nWarner, and S. Res. 70, by Senator McCain, and the Senate proceed to \ntheir consideration en bloc; that there be 6 hours for debate equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees on both resolutions, \nto be debated concurrently; that no amendments or motions be in order \nto either resolution; that at the conclusion or yielding back of the \ntime, the Senate vote on Senator McCain's resolution, followed by a \nvote on Senator Warner's resolution; that if either resolution fails to \ngarner 60 votes, the vote be vitiated and the resolution be returned to \nits prior status; that immediately following the votes on the \nresolutions I have just mentioned, the Senate turn to the consideration \nof H.J. Res. 20, the infamous continuing resolution, funding the \nGovernment after February 15 for the rest of the fiscal year; that \nthere be 4 hours for debate on the joint resolution; that no amendments \nor motions be in order in relation to it; that at the conclusion or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate vote on final passage of the \njoint resolution; that if the joint resolution fails to get 60 votes, \nthe vote be vitiated and the joint resolution be returned to the \ncalendar.\n\n  I announce that if we are able to do that--dispose of these three \nitems I have mentioned--this week, or whenever we finish them, then we \nwould begin the Presidents Day recess at the conclusion of this week. \nOne of the things we found is that because of the accelerated work \nschedule, people are having a lot of work to do at home. So that is why \nwe would do this.\n  Madam President, there would be no amendments to the CR from either \nside. I mention that because, in getting to the point where we are, \nthere has been total consultation by the majority and minority, each \nsubcommittee, and the majority and ranking members. The chair and \nranking members work very closely. One of the people heavily involved \nin this, for example, is Senator Domenici, my long-term partner on the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee on Appropriations. He fought for more, \nand he got more. That happened with many Republicans who spoke out, and \nmost of them did.\n  I further say that if there were ever a bipartisan measure, it is the \ncontinuing resolution. But we have to finish before February 15.\n  So I ask my friend, the Republican leader, to accept my alteration to \nhis unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, let me remind our colleagues that 4 years ago last month, \nwe were at exactly the same situation. My party came back to the \nmajority. The Democratic majority of the previous Congress had not \npassed 11 out of the 13 appropriations bills. And what did the new \nRepublican majority do? We took up an omnibus collection of \nappropriations bills. We had over 100 amendments offered. We gave \neverybody in the Senate an opportunity to offer amendments, and we \ndisposed of all of those appropriations bills over a couple-week \nperiod.\n  What my good friend, the majority leader, is suggesting is that we \ntake up a continuing resolution of 11 appropriations bills, with no \namendments whatsoever, and he offers as an enticement an extra week \noff. This is completely unacceptable to the minority. First, he is \nsaying that we cannot get adequate consideration to our Iraq proposals. \nSecond, he is saying we cannot have any amendments to an over $400 \nbillion continuing appropriation. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will continue reserving the right to \nobject to my friend's unanimous consent request. Prior to making a \ndecision on that, I want to read to everybody here from page 3, \nparagraph 4, of the Warner resolution:\n\n       The Congress should not take any action that will endanger \n     United States military forces in the field, including the \n     elimination or reduction of funds for troops in the field, as \n     such an action with respect to funding would undermine their \n     safety or harm their\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\n     effectiveness in pursuing their assigned missions.\n\n  Madam President, I object.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is clear now to the minority that \nfive proposals on our side were too many, three proposals were too \nmany, and two proposals were too many, but the majority leader offered \nus one last week. He said: I will take one and you take one. So I am \ngoing to modify my request of a few moments ago which, as the leader \nindicated, was exactly the same as my request of late last week. I am \ngoing to modify my request.\n  As I have said repeatedly, the Members on this side of the aisle are \nready and willing to proceed with this debate. At the outset, I \nindicated we were prepared to enter into, as I said a moment ago, an \nagreement for debate and votes on various resolutions. We had hoped for \na number--and it was pretty challenging, frankly, to pare down the \nnumber on our side. As I indicated, we started with five. That was \nrejected from the other side. We pared our proposals down to two. That \nmeant three proposals in total--the Warner proposal and two additional \nones--to be debated for a reasonable amount of time and then three \nvotes--the unanimous consent request I just propounded.\n  I think what we just offered was a reasonable approach and would \nallow the Senate to have those votes this week. Evidently, as I \nindicated, three proposals are too many. So, therefore, in order to \nallow us to move forward with this important debate, I am prepared to \nhave votes on just two resolutions.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that at a time determined by the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the \nSenate proceed en bloc to two concurrent resolutions under the \nfollowing agreement: S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner resolution, which is to \nbe discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee; and Senator Gregg's \namendment related to the funding and supporting our troops.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 10 hours of \ndebate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nprovided further that no amendments be in order to any of the measures; \nfurther, that at the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed \nto two consecutive votes on the adoption of the concurrent resolutions \nin the following order, with no further action or intervening debate: \nthe Gregg resolution supporting the troops and S. Con. Res. 7, \nsponsored by Senator Warner.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that any resolution that does not \nreceive 60 votes in the affirmative, the vote on adoption be vitiated \nand the concurrent resolution be returned to its previous status.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have gone from this \nmorning and trying to copy one of the trick plays from the Super Bowl \nto now going to the science bill, and I guess it is modern math. We \ndon't accept that, Madam President. What we demand for the American \npeople is an up-or-down vote on the escalation of the war in Iraq. \nMcCain has been filed. Let's vote on it. Let's vote on Warner. That is \nour proposal. We haven't wavered from that. We will not waiver from \nthat. That is what the American people demand and ultimately they will \nget. I object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as my good friend on the other side \nof the aisle frequently reminded us last year, the Senate is not the \nHouse. It is not possible in this body for the majority to dictate to \nthe minority the contents of this debate. What we are asking for, by \nany standard, is reasonable: One alternative--just one--to the proposal \non which my good friend, the majority leader, is seeking to get a vote. \nWe don't object to having this debate. We are ready and willing to have \nthis debate, anxious to have this debate, but we insist on fundamental \nfairness.\n  The Gregg amendment is about the troops. How can we have a debate on \nIraq and have no debate about the troops? Do we support them or don't \nwe? That is what the Gregg amendment is about, and Senate Republicans \ninsist that we consider those who are being sent to Iraq, over and \nabove the current troops deployed there, in our debate, which is \nentirely about the additional troops going to Iraq.\n  I assume the whole genesis of this debate this week is the question \nof additional troops going to Baghdad under the direction of General \nPetraeus to try to quiet the capital city and allow this fledgling \ndemocracy to begin to take hold. And the Gregg amendment--Senator Gregg \nis right here on the floor of the Senate and is fully capable of \nexplaining what the Gregg amendment is about. I ask the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, what is the essence of the Gregg amendment which we seek \nto have voted on in the context of this Iraq war?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I will attempt to read it. I first have \nto find my glasses. My wife told me I had to use my glasses.\n  The resolution which I proposed and which I understand the Republican \nleader has suggested be the Republican alternative or the alternative \npresented--in fact, it will have Democratic support, I suspect, enough \nso that maybe the majority leader doesn't want it voted on because it \nmight have so much Democratic support.\n  In any event, it is a proposal that simply states that it is the \nsense of the Congress that Congress should not take any action that \nwill endanger U.S. military forces in the field, including the \nelimination or reduction of funds for troops in the field, as such \naction with respect to funding would undermine their safety or harm \ntheir effectiveness in pursuing their assigned missions.\n  I don't think it requires a great deal of explanation. It is simply a \nstatement of commitment to our troops which seems reasonable. It is \nhard for me to understand how we can send troops on a mission, walking \nthe streets of Baghdad--American troops, American men and women--and \nnot say to those men and women: Listen, we are going to support you \nwith the financing, with the logistics, with the equipment you need to \nbe as safe as you possibly can be in this very dangerous mission you \nare undertaking for our Nation.\n  That is all it says. I can't understand why the other side isn't \nwilling to allow a vote on that resolution. If they want to vote on the \nWarner amendment, it doesn't make any sense.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reclaiming my time, the other side \njust proposed an agreement that mandates 60 votes on two resolutions. \nThose are their words on paper. We agree to those terms, but at least \nwe are suggesting that we be allowed to pick the proposal on our side, \nas Senator Gregg has just outlined what the proposal on our side would \nbe.\n  The majority leader apparently seeks to dictate to us what the \nproposal on our side would be. That is simply unheard of in the Senate, \nthat he is telling us that on the continuing resolution, we will get no \namendments at all, and on the Iraq resolution, he will pick for us what \nour proposal is to be. I think that doesn't pass the fairness test.\n  I see the Senator from New Hampshire on the Senate floor. I wonder if \nhe has any further observations he would like to make.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I would simply like to inquire of the \nRepublican leader, have you ever in your experience seen a time when--\neither the Republican leadership or the Democratic leadership--the \nmajority party says to the minority party: We will set forth the \namendments on which we are going to vote, and we will also set forth \nand write the amendment on which you are going to vote?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to my friend from New \nHampshire, I have been here now--it is hard to believe--a couple of \ndecades, and I cannot recall a time in which one side has dictated to \nthe other side what their proposal will be in a legislative debate.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand, I ask the Republican leader further, \nespecially since it seems ironic in the context of putting forward a \ncommitment to say to the men and women who are fighting for us: We \nshall give you the support you need when you are sent on a mission; \nthey are not choosing to go on this mission; they are members of the \nmilitary who, under their responsibility as members of the military, \nare being sent on a mission; is it not reasonable that we should say to \nthem: We\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\nwill give you the logistical support, financial support, the equipment \nyou need in order to fulfill that mission correctly?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to my friend from New \nHampshire, I can't think of anything more relevant to an Iraq debate \nabout the appropriateness of this new mission, which General Petraeus \nwill lead, than the amendment which Senator Gregg has authored and \nwhich we request be our proposal as this debate goes forward.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if the Senator will yield just for one \nfurther point, would it not be truly unusual in a democratic forum, \nwhich is supposed to be the most deliberative body in the world, to not \nallow the minority to bring forward a resolution--which is probably \ngoing to get more than a majority vote should it ever be voted on--\nwhich is not contestable as to its purpose--its purpose being well \nmeaning; it is certainly not a purpose that is anything other than to \nexpress a sense of support for those who are defending us--would it not \nbe a new form of democracy, maybe closer to the Cuban model, to not \nallow an amendment presented by the minority as their option but, \nrather, have the majority write the minority's amendment which would \nthen be voted on? That way the majority gets to write both amendments, \nI guess is my bottom line.\n\n  You have one-party rule, sort of a Cuban model of democracy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my friend from New Hampshire \nfor his observations about not only the process but the merits of his \nproposal.\n  Let me conclude by reiterating once again that I think the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire and I and others, including those who have been \nspeaking on the Senate floor on this side this morning, welcome the \ndebate about Iraq policy. We had anticipated having the debate this \nweek. It is not too late to have the debate this week.\n  We are now down to two proposals, just two proposals. It took a lot \nof time on our side to get down to one for us and, of course, the \nmajority has a preference of its own. This debate could be wrapped up \nin relatively short order, and then we could move on with the \ncontinuing resolution, where I hope it might be possible for the \nminority to have at least some amendments.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Presiding Officer is a new Member of \nthis body, but she should have seen when the Republicans were in the \nmajority. We didn't have amendments. They filled every tree. I will \nalso say, it speaks volumes here today--volumes. There is not a single \nperson on the other side of the aisle who has come to the floor and \nsupported the troop surge of President Bush--not a single person. I \nwonder if President Bush is aware that not a single Republican Senator \nhas come to the floor and said: I support President Bush sending 48,000 \nmore troops to Iraq. That speaks volumes.\n  I will also say this, Madam President: Senator Boxer, a couple rows \nback, just a few minutes ago, talked about one short snapshot of one \nday from the Los Angeles Times: Scores of people being murdered and \nkilled and mutilated; a little girl leaving school with blood-drenched \nsteps over which she was walking. One could see the red in the \nphotograph, and Senator Boxer was one, two, three rows back. We could \nall see that.\n  Not a single person has come to the floor to support the surge, but \nthat is what is dictating what we vote on today. It is not the majority \nleader. We, for the American people, need to have this debate.\n  Also, I certainly care a lot about the Senator from New Hampshire--\nand he knows that is true--but I have to smile. What has he done the \nfirst few weeks of this legislative session? He has brought to the \nSenate floor during the debate on ethics, lobbying reform, and earmark \nreform the line-item veto, and then he brought it forth again on \nminimum wage. And now to stop a debate on the escalation of the war in \nIraq, he now comes up with this other diversionary tactic. He is a \nwonderful man, a gentleman, but, Madam President, do you know what he \nkind of reminds me of this first few weeks of this legislative session? \nSomebody who comes into a basketball game, not to score points, just to \nkind of rough people up, just to kind of get the game going in a \ndifferent direction.\n  The game we have going today has nothing to do with supporting the \ntroops. We support the troops. Every speech that a Democrat has given \nin the last 4 years has talked about how much we support the troops. In \nfact, we were the first to raise the issue. We were the first to raise \nthe issue about a lack of body armor. We raised that first. We support \nthe troops. We have done that not only with our mouths but with the way \nwe voted.\n  The debate in the Senate should be on the resolution submitted by the \nSenator from Arizona, which they have obviously dropped--the resolution \nfrom the Senator from Arizona and Senator Lieberman from Connecticut. \nThey threw that out in an effort to go for this diversion.\n  So why don't we see how the minority feels about voting on the \nPresident's surge of $30 billion and 48,000 troops? That is what this \ndebate is about.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. GREGG. First, I appreciate the Senator's generous comments. I \ntake them as a compliment. I have been active legislatively. That is, \nobviously, our job.\n  I ask the Senator: He heard me read the language of my resolution \nearlier, and I will read it again, if he wishes.\n  Mr. REID. If I can interrupt, and I do that apologetically, I read it \nbefore the Senator from New Hampshire arrived in the Chamber because it \nis in the Warner resolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Good. If the Senator is of such a mind, I ask if this were \na freestanding resolution brought to the floor, would the Senator vote \nfor my resolution?\n  Mr. REID. I don't think I have to make that judgment now because the \njudgment, I say to my friend from New Hampshire, is not some \ndiversionary matter. The issue before this body and the issue before \nthe American people--that is why we are getting hundreds of phone calls \nin my office and other Senate offices around the country. The issue is \ndoes the Senate support the President's surge? That is the question.\n\n  I have to say the Senator from Arizona at least was willing to put \nhis name on it and move forward. We haven't heard a lot of speeches in \nfavor of his resolution. Where are they?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if the Senator will yield further, I \nguess I find it difficult to argue that it is a diversion when the \nresolution that I am proposing simply says that we will support the \ntroops who are being asked to carry out the mission they have been \nassigned. This is not a diversion. This is a responsibility, I would \nthink, of every Member of the Senate to take a position on whether they \nsupport giving the troops who have been assigned the task, the \nequipment, the financial support, and the logistical support they need \nto protect themselves and carry out that mission.\n  I think to call that a diversion does not do justice to our troops in \nthe field, so I am concerned about that. It does seem to me for the \nSenator from Nevada to take that position is inconsistent with the \nbasic philosophy of Congress, which is that the first responsibility in \na matter of warfighting is to support the troops.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been asked to yield to my friend \nfrom Washington, and I am glad to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I asked the majority leader to yield \nfor a question. I have been on the Senate floor and listened to the \nexchange between the majority leader and the Republican leader and, \nquite frankly, I was astonished and I want to understand if the \nmajority leader heard the same thing I did.\n  The Republican leader came back to you and offered to remove from \nconsideration the McCain amendment, which is the pro-escalation \namendment, essentially offering a vote on just the Warner and Gregg \namendment. Leaving aside what this says about the lack of support of \nthe proposal on their side, are we hearing from the other side that\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\nthey do not even want a vote on whether they support the President's \nescalation?\n  It seems to me we are hearing a phony debate request on who supports \nthe troops. That is not a debate that we need to have. Everyone in this \nbody supports the troops. I ask the leader if he heard the request from \nthe Republicans the same way I did, that they no longer even want to \nhave a vote on whether they support the President's escalation.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend from Washington that we \nhave a record of supporting the troops. We did it in Kosovo, we did it \nthrough the entire Balkans, and we did it in Afghanistan. We did it in \nAfghanistan with very few questions asked, and rightfully so. We have \nsupported every effort made by this President to defeat the war on \nterror, with rare exception. But the troops in the field? Never, never \nhave we wavered from that.\n  In fact, I don't know of a speech, although there could be some \ngiven, where a Democrat has talked about the war in Iraq and hasn't \ntalked about how much we appreciate the work done by these valiant \ntroops and the sacrifices of their families. That is why we were \nstunned during the State of the Union Address when the President even \nmentioned the veterans.\n  I am happy to have answered the question from the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senate majority leader for yielding for a \nquestion, and I appreciate his willingness to engage in a dialogue on \nthis issue.\n  In reference to the question of the Senator from Washington to the \nmajority leader, I do want our resolution debated. We are trying to \nmove forward. As I think the Senator from Nevada is aware, there was a \nproposal to have a 60-vote, which is the way the Senate does business, \non three resolutions--on the Warner, McCain, and Gregg resolutions--and \nthat was turned down. I only agreed to the latest proposal because I \nthink we need to move the process forward.\n  I guess what I am asking the Senator from Nevada is, isn't it really \ntrue that the way we do business here does require 60 votes? It is just \na reality of the way the Senate functions. When there was an attempt a \nyear ago, 2 years ago, actually, with the so-called nuclear option, I \nwas one who fought hard to preserve the right of the majority to have \n60 votes in the case of the appointment of judges, and I think we \nreached a bipartisan agreement on that.\n  So I still am a bit puzzled why we could not have a vote on my \nresolution that would require 60 votes in order for it to be adopted, \njust as it would be for the Warner resolution and as it would be for \nthe Gregg resolution. I don't quite understand why we couldn't do that, \nas we have done hundreds of times in the past, as the Senator knows, \nbecause we have been in the Senate for many years.\n  That is my question. Again, I thank the majority leader for allowing \nme to engage in this discussion with him.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend who came to the House \nat the same time as myself, and then we came to the Senate together--in \nfact, there is only one person ahead of me in seniority, and that is \nthe Senator from Arizona because the State of Arizona has more people \nin it than the State of Nevada--no one has ever doubted the courage of \nthe Senator from Arizona. I have read the books. I know about Senator \nMcCain. He has not only been heroic on the field of battle but also \nlegislatively, and I respect that.\n  But I say to my friend, yes, there are 60 votes required on some \nthings in this body. Not everything. The vast majority of legislation \nthat passes here is with a simple majority. I would say to my friend, \nrecognizing that it does take 60 votes, that is why I offered to do the \ndeal: McCain, 60 votes; Warner, 60 votes. That is the proposal I made.\n  That is pending before the body right now, and that has been turned \ndown five or six times. So I would be willing to do it on a simple \nmajority, if you want to do McCain on a simple majority or the Warner \nresolution on a simple majority. I would try to get that done. Right \nnow, Madam President, we have the proposal I have made.\n  I do say that the debate is not whether we support the troops. That \nis a diversion. We support the troops. The issue before this body is \nwhether the American people deserve to see how their Senator is going \nto vote; whether their Senator approves the surge, the escalation, the \naugmentation of 48,000 troops, costing approximately $30 billion extra. \nThat is what the American people care about, not whether we support the \ntroops. We all support the troops.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Nevada yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to understand what has happened \nover on the other side, the Republican side. Is it my understanding \nthey have asked now to drop the McCain-Lieberman amendment?\n  Mr. REID. I have to be honest with my friend from Illinois, who also \ncame with us at the same time from the House to the Senate, that the \nanswer is, yes. The Lieberman amendment has been given up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might continue through the Chair to ask the Senator \nfrom Nevada a question, on the issue that I think is before America \ntoday--whether we should escalate the number of troops into this war in \nIraq--we had offered to the Republican side a choice between two \nRepublican amendments: Senator Warner's amendment, which said the \nPresident's policy is wrong, and Senator McCain's amendment, which says \nthe policy is advisable and should be followed. Even given the option \nof two Republican amendments, the Republican minority, yesterday, voted \nto deny any opportunity for the Senate to debate two Republican \namendments?\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, yes, that is true. We were \nwilling because the Senator from Arizona had the ability, the courage, \nand the dignity to put this issue before the American people, even \nthough--and he knows this--the vast majority of American people do not \nsupport the escalation in Iraq. But he did it. We were willing to take \ntwo Republican resolutions--one supporting the surge, one opposing the \nsurge--and let Senators from every State in the Union raise their hand \nand tell the American people how they feel about it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I might ask the Senator from Nevada \nwhether this resolution being offered by Senator Gregg really is \nfocused not on the major issue of escalating the war but somehow is \nfocused on supporting the troops. Even the Warner resolution, a \nRepublican resolution, has the identical language of the Gregg \nresolution when it comes to that support of the troops; is that not \ntrue?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend that the rumor around here is that \nSenator Warner put that in there thinking he could get the support of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, but, obviously, he was wrong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I might also ask the Senator whether it \nappears to him now that the Republicans, at this point, don't want to \ndebate either of the Republican amendments and want to change the \nsubject; that they want to move to a Gregg resolution, which deals \nwith, as the Senator has just said repeatedly, support for the troops, \nwhich is not an issue?\n  We all support the troops. It appears to me that we have made no \nprogress in the last 24 hours, and I would ask the Senator from Nevada \nif he has a different conclusion.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend that the only thing I sense this \nafternoon--and I have to say it with a smile on my face, and I hope \neveryone recognizes this--is that every piece of legislation we have \nbrought up, the Senator from New Hampshire has tried to throw a monkey \nwrench into it. It happened on ethics, it happened on the minimum wage, \nand now on this Iraq issue.\n  I guess my dear friend, who has a stellar political record as \nGovernor, Member of the House of Representatives, United States \nSenator, chairman of the Budget Committee--and I have commented for the \nrecord many times about my admiration for him, but I guess he is the \ndesignated ``see if we can mess up the legislation'' guy this year. I \nwould hope in the future to get somebody I don't care so much about \nbecause it is hard for me to try to oppose my dear friend from New \nHampshire. Maybe when they do this every couple of months they will \nchange.\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for one more \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, again, I appreciate the courtesy of the \nmajority leader.\n  Is it not true that when the Senator says he supports the troops, \nthat there is disapproval of what they are doing and that the Senator \ndoes not think their mission is going to succeed? And is it not true \nthat maybe some of the troops may not view that as an expression of \nsupport?\n  I talked to many men and women in the military in recent days, \nranking from private to general. Isn't it true that most of them, if \nyou had the opportunity to talk to them, would say: When they do not \nsupport my mission, they do not support me?\n  Therefore, isn't it just a little bit of an intellectual problem to \nsay: Of course, we support the troops; of course, we support the \ntroops; of course, we support the troops, but we are sending you over--\nand they are going because this is a nonbinding resolution--aren't we \nsaying that we think they are going to fail and this is a vote of no \nconfidence?\n  The so-called Warner amendment, by the way, is not a Republican \namendment, no matter whose name is on it.\n  Is it not true that when I look one of these soldiers or marines in \nthe eye and say: I really support you, my friend, and I know you are \ngoing into harm's way, but I don't think you are going to succeed, in \nfact, I am against your mission, but I support you, that they do not \nbuy it? They do not buy it, I will say to my friend from Nevada, and \ndon't think that they do.\n  So I would ask my friend if it isn't true a vote of no confidence is \na vote of no confidence to the men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary. It doesn't sell.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I also have had the opportunity to go to \nIraq as many times as my friend from Arizona, and I also speak to the \ntroops and the people at the Pentagon. I have to respectfully suggest \nto my friend that there are many individuals whom I have spoken to who \nreally like what we have suggested--we, the Democrats--that there be a \nredeployment of troops.\n  Does that mean they all pull out of Iraq and leave immediately? Of \ncourse, it doesn't. But redeploy the troops. Redeploy the troops. \nRedeploy them to do what? Counterterrorism, force protection, and \ntraining the Iraqis. And my contacts in the military say they think our \nproposal is pretty good. We were on this proposal before the Iraq Study \nGroup, but they adopted it, and I hope they got it from us, and that is \nthat there should be a regional conference, including Saudi Arabia, \nEgypt, Jordan, Syria, and, yes, Iran. This is a regional problem. This \nwar will not be handled and dealt with and taken care of militarily. It \ncan only be done diplomatically.\n  We are a wonderful fighting force, and we will continue to be, but \nwhere we have lost our edge is diplomatically. We have not done well at \nall in that regard, and the people I have talked to in the military \nsupport what we are trying to do: redeployment; they support a regional \nconference; they support, of course, recognizing that this must be \nhandled politically. There has to be some meaningful reconstruction \nthat goes forward--producing less oil now than before the war, less \npotable water, and less electricity. These are the things which have to \nbe changed, and the people I talk to in the military think we are \nheaded in the right direction.\n\n  They also think we are headed in the right direction when we speak \nout on the state of deterioration of our military. This war has taken a \ntoll on our equipment--not on our troops alone, on our equipment. It is \ngoing to cost $75 billion to bring the military up to the situation \nthey were in prior to this war. They are grateful we are fighting for \nthem in that regard.\n  So, Madam President, I respect--and I don't have the military \nbackground of my friend from Arizona, but I have contacts in the \nmilitary, and I think a lot of those people are more willing to talk to \nme than someone who is running for President and someone who is more \nnoteworthy than I am. He is better known in the military, and they know \nhe can respond to them probably better than I. So they are willing to \ntell me a lot of things they wouldn't tell someone as significant as \nJohn McCain.\n  So, Madam President, I think the Democratic plan we have enunciated \nis pretty good, much of which we have enunciated for a long time and \nhas been picked up by the Iraq Study Group.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada the following \nquestion: If I follow the inquiry of the Senator from Arizona, it leads \nme to this conclusion--and let me add my voice in chorus commending his \nservice to our country and commending his courage. I share the \nadmiration, and I mean it sincerely, I say to the Senator from Arizona. \nBut his argument goes something like this: If you are not loyal to the \npolicies of the Commander in Chief, then you are not loyal to the \ntroops. If you are not prepared to say you will stand behind the \npolicy, the military policy of the President, whether you agree with it \nor not, then you do not respect the troops and don't have confidence in \nthe troops. Nothing is further from the truth.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, does he think it is possible to \ndisagree with the President's policies and still be loyal to the \ntroops? Is it possible to say the President was wrong in not bringing \nmore countries in as allies in this conflict before we invaded and \nstill be loyal to the troops? Is it possible to say we didn't send \nenough soldiers when we should have and still be loyal to the troops? \nIs it possible to say disbanding the Army of Iraq was a bad decision \nand still be loyal to America's troops? Is it possible to say the \nsituation that is grave and deteriorating in Iraq is evidence of a need \nfor a new direction and still be loyal to the troops?\n  I just don't buy the premise by the Senator from Arizona that if you \nquestion the policy of the President, somehow you are disloyal to the \nsoldiers. They are the ones following orders from the Commander in \nChief. We have a special obligation to them--I think a loyalty to \nthem--far and beyond any Chief Executive.\n  I would ask the Senator from Nevada if he believes you can be loyal \nto the troops and still disagree with the President?\n  Mr. REID. I think that is part of being a patriotic Member of this \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I was, unfortunately, engaged in a \nbriefing in S. 407 on the most recent NIE, and I have just come down to \njoin my colleagues on the Senate floor and I caught some portions of \nthe debate. But I would like to say to my colleagues that the Senator \nfrom Virginia, together with probably six or eight other Republicans, \nhas been discussing this issue very carefully and thoughtfully and \nrespectfully.\n  Frankly, we have taken to heart what the President said when he \naddressed the Nation on January 10. His very words were: ``If there are \nthose with ideas, we will consider them.'' We accept that invitation by \nour President and have tried in a very respectful way to simply state \nthat we have some serious concern with the level of 21,500 additional \ntroops. Now we learn it could even be larger than that, in testimony, \nopen testimony this morning with the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs. It could be 3,000 or 4,000 more. We tried \nin a very respectful way simply to express our concerns about an \nincrease of that level at a time when polls show most of the Iraqi \npeople don't want us there, much less increase the force. Now, I am not \nfollowing the polls, but we are asking our troops to go into a very \nheated, emotional situation in that country. We simply said to the \nPresident: Shouldn't we put more emphasis on the utilization of the \nIraqi forces? Shouldn't we let them bear the brunt of such additional \nsecurity as must go into Baghdad?\n  We learned this morning that the efforts to build up the forces have \nfallen short. I am not going to pronounce judgment on what happened on \njust 2 or 3 days' reporting, but clearly the number of Iraqis showing \nup is far below the estimates or significantly below the estimates we \nanticipated their participation would be in this operation which, in \nmany respects, is to\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\nbe joint. We talked with General Pace this morning about my concern of \nthis concept of joint command and control. He assured us the American \nforces would have a linear straight line from an American senior \nofficer right down to the sergeants operating the platoons on the front \nlines. But nevertheless the Iraqis are going to have their chain of \ncommand, and I think that puts a challenge to us.\n\n  But I don't want to digress from my main point. Our group, in a \nconscientious and a respectful way, even wrote into the resolution that \nwe in no way contest the right of the President of the United States \nunder the Constitution to take the actions he has taken thus far and \nwill take. But as long as I have been in this Chamber--now in my 29th \nyear--I have always tried to respect another Senator's way of thinking. \nI don't question his integrity or her integrity or their patriotism or \nanything else. I do not do that now. I wish to make my points based on \nwhat I have put forth in this resolution with about six other \nRepublican colleagues and a number of Democrats.\n  We simply want to suggest--and we use the word ``urge''--we urge you, \nMr. President, not ``direct you'' or ``you shall do this,'' we simply \nurge that you take into consideration all the options by which you can \nbring down this level and consider greater utilization of the Iraqi \nforces.\n  Then we have the subsidiary question that this program is in three \nparts--one part military. So much of our focus has been on that. There \nis a diplomatic part. There is an economic part. In our testimony today \nwith the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman, we stressed the need \nfor all three of those parts to come together at one time to have the \neffect that the President desires with his new plan. Somehow, we gained \nthe impression today that maybe the political part and perhaps the \neconomic part are not quite as far along as some of the military \nthinking and planning. Actually, the troops are moving in as we debate \nthis on the Senate floor.\n  So there were several questions we respectfully raised with the \nPresident, urging him to take a look at this, by means of which to \nlessen--lessen the total number of 21,500 and, indeed, more now--\ntroops.\n  We also point out the importance of the benchmarks. That is all in \nthere. We carefully lay out that the benchmarks should be clearly and \nfully understood by both sides and a method put in place by which we \ncan assess the compliance or noncompliance for those benchmarks. The \nSecretary of Defense today, in his testimony to us, in response to \nquestions from this Senator and others, said: Yes, we will put in a \nmechanism by which to evaluate the degree to which the Iraqi compliance \nis taken with respect to benchmarks, the benchmarks that basically have \nto support the President's plan. In addition, we put in the resolution \nof the Senator from New Hampshire. I think it is important that we have \nan expression in here about the non-cutoff of funds.\n  So our resolution has been presented to try as best we can to put \ntogether right here on the floor of the Senate a bipartisan consensus. \nI think the American public is entitled to see whether the Senate, an \ninstitution that is followed throughout the world, can come together \nand express in a single document--accompanied by lots of debate but in \na single document--a joinder of a number of Republicans and a number of \nDemocrats, so it is truly bipartisan, and therefore the American public \nwill get, I think, the sense of confidence that this body is carrying \nout its responsibility under the Constitution to speak to this issue \nand to put onto a piece of paper what we think is the nearest a group \nof us can gather and express ourselves. And that includes a vote.\n  I am not going to enter into further debate with the two leaders. I \nthink they are trying to work out and resolve this problem. I support \nmy leader with respect to the cloture, and that raises a question: How \ncan I advocate that I strongly adhere to my resolution and at the same \ntime support my leader? Well, when I first came to this Chamber many \nyears ago, the old-time Senators who taught me so many lessons said: \nThis is what separates the Senate from the House--the ability to have \nthis almost unlimited debate by a single Senator. And it is, throughout \nthe history of this institution, one of its revered tenets and its \nrules. To take that and deny it, deny Senators the ability to bring up \ntheir own resolutions to express their own views, is a curtailment that \nI believe we should consider long and hard. That is why I cast that \nvote yesterday.\n  So I leave it to the two leaders, but I come back again to the need \nfor this great institution to express itself through the votes of \nhopefully a significant number of Senators, that this is what we \nbelieve is the best course of action for our Nation to take as we \nrevise our strategy in Iraq, as we move ahead. And in our resolution, \nwe put in there ever so expressly that we agree with the President; it \nwould be disastrous were we to allow this Government to collapse not \nknowing what government might or might not take their place, and to \nallow the Iraqi people to lose the ground they gained through \ncourageous votes several times to put this Government together. It \nwould be bad for Iraq, it would be bad for the region, and it could \nhave ramifications on world peace and our efforts to stem this terrible \ngrowth of terrorism worldwide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nused by the two leaders in the exchange on the floor not be counted \nagainst the 90 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, war is the most serious and the most \nconsequential issue we can debate here in the Senate. American lives, \nAmerican security, and America's future are all on the line when our \ncountry decides questions of war and peace. For years, we have been \ndenied a real opportunity to fully debate this war in Iraq, a war that \nhas now claimed more than 3,000 American lives with no end in sight.\n  Last November, the voters sent us a message. They want a new \ndirection. What do we hear from the President? More of the same. In \nfact, his plan is to escalate the war by putting up to 48,000 more \nAmericans in the middle of a deadly civil war. They are two completely \ndifferent approaches. On one side, we have the American people, the \nIraq Study Group, generals who have spoken out, and a bipartisan \nmajority of Congress. On the other side, we have the President and his \nsupporters. In a democracy, we resolve these issues through debate. We \nin the Senate are ready for that debate. We are ready to move in a new \ndirection, and it starts by putting this Senate on record as opposing \nthe President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq.\n  I have been looking forward to finally having this debate in the \nSenate, but apparently some of the Republicans have a very different \nstrategy. They don't want to have a real debate. They don't want to \nconsider the resolutions that have been offered. In fact, I think the \ndiscussion we just witnessed right now showed that to us.\n  Last night, by voting against a motion to proceed to this debate, \nthey said they didn't want to talk about this. Now, I am not here today \nto question their motives, but I do want to point out the consequences. \nEvery day they block a debate, they send a message that Congress \nsupports escalation. Every day they block a debate, they deny our \ncitizens a voice in a war that has cost us dearly in dollars and in \nlives. And every day they block a debate, they are blocking the will of \nthe American public.\n  I am on the Senate floor today because I know this debate is long \noverdue, and I am not going to let anyone silence me, the troops for \nwhom I speak, or the constituents I represent. Ever since the start of \ncombat operations in March of 2003, I have been very frustrated that we \nhave been denied a chance to hold hearings, a chance to ask critical \nquestions, a chance to demand answers, to hold those in charge \naccountable, and to give the American people a voice in a war that is \ncosting us terribly. We are going to have that debate whether some in \nthis Senate like it or not.\n\n  Four years ago, I came to the Senate to discuss the original \nresolution to give the President the authority to wage war in Iraq. At \nthat time, I asked a series of questions, including: What is\n\n[[Page S1606]]\n\nthe mission? What will it require? Who is with us in this fight? What \nhappens after our troops go in? How will it impact the Middle East? How \nwill it affect the broader war on terror? And are we being honest with \nthe American people about the costs of that war?\n  After exploring those questions back almost 4 years ago, I announced \non October 9 of 2002 that I could not support sending our men and women \ninto harm's way on an ill-defined solo mission with so many critical \nquestions unanswered.\n  Now, here we are today, 4 years later, $379 billion and more than \n3,000 American lives taken. Now the President wants to send more \nAmericans into the middle of a civil war against the wishes of the \nmajority of the public and Congress?\n  As I look at the President's proposed escalation, I am left with the \nexact same conclusion I met with 4 years ago. I cannot support sending \nmore of our men and women into harm's way on an ill-defined solo \nmission with so many critical questions unanswered. Today, President \nBush wants to send Americans into battle without a clear mission, \nwithout equipment, without an endgame and without explaining the cost.\n  When he tried it 4 years ago, I stood up and spoke out and I voted \nno. Again today, President Bush wants to send more Americans into \nbattle without a clear mission, without equipment, without an endgame \nand without explaining the costs. Once again, I say: Not on my watch. \nWe need a new direction, not more Americans in the middle of a civil \nwar. I will vote for a bipartisan resolution to send a clear message \nthat we oppose the surge. It is the first step in demanding a new \ndirection in Iraq.\n  No debate on Iraq can begin without first recognizing our men and \nwomen in uniform who risk their lives and all too often give up their \nlives to keep all of us safe. Whenever our country calls, they answer, \nno matter the cost to them or their families. They are our best. They \nare our brightest, they are our bravest, and I hope to give them a \nvoice in this debate.\n  While most Americans today are going about as normal, our troops and \ntheir families are quietly making tremendous sacrifices. The burdens of \nthis war have not been shared equally, and we owe so much to those who \nshoulder those heavy burdens.\n  I had a chance to visit servicemembers from my home State on the \nground in Kuwait and in Baghdad. Every one of them makes us proud. I \nhave sat down with servicemembers and their families at Camp Murray, at \nMcChord Air Force Base, at Fairchild Air Force Base. I have talked with \nreturning servicemembers in every corner of my State. I have worked to \nhelp give them the health care and the benefits and the transition and \nsupport they deserve.\n  My home State of Washington has made tremendous sacrifices to help us \nfight and win the war on terror. To date, more than 59,000 \nservicemembers with the Washington State connection have served in \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Currently, \nthere are nearly 10,000 people with the Washington State connection who \nare serving in OEF and OIF. According to the Department of Defense, as \nof January 20, for OEF and OIF, 702 servicemembers whose home of record \nis Washington State have been injured. That is 702 injured from my \nState. In addition, 66 servicemembers whose home of record is my home \nState of Washington have paid the ultimate sacrifice. The number is \neven higher when you include those who have a connection to Washington \nState.\n  Each one of those brave Americans is someone whose mother or father, \nsister or brother, daughter or son, their families are never going to \nbe the same. Their communities will never be the same. I offer my \nprayers for those who have sacrificed for our country. We owe them a \ndebt that can never fully be repaid.\n  After nearly 4 years of losses and misrepresentations and \nmiscalculations, the American people have said they want a new \ndirection in Iraq. Generals have spoken out calling for a new \ndirection. The bipartisan Iraq Study Group called for a new direction. \nYet President Bush has ignored everyone and is now pushing to send even \nmore of our American troops into the middle of a civil war. He is \nwrong. And a bipartisan resolution is the first step we can take in \nhelping to forge a new direction.\n  But now what we have is Republicans who are denying the Senate a \nchance to vote for that new direction. In fact, they are preventing the \nSenate from even debating the merits of that direction. They may have \nstopped us from moving forward last night, but they cannot stop this \ndebate forever. The American people would not allow it.\n  If the Republicans stop their obstruction and start allowing the \nSenate to debate this misguided surge proposal, there are plenty of \nquestions we have to ask. What would be the impact of a surge? How \nwould it affect our men and women in uniform? Will it put more of them \ninto the crossfire and cause more deaths and injuries? My home State is \nhome to Fort Lewis and two of the Army Stryker Brigades. How is the \nsurge going to affect them? Will some members see their current \ndeployment extended? Will others see their deployment date moved up? \nWill all of them have the equipment they need when they are there? \nThose are the first questions we have to ask.\n\n  How will the surge affect our ability to care for our returning \nveterans? We are having trouble meeting their needs today; how will we \ndo the job in an escalated war?\n  I have heard several Members on the other side demand ideas from \nDemocrats, and my first response is simple: To discuss ideas, shouldn't \nwe discuss, first, the President's ideas? He is, after all, the \nCommander in Chief. That is the point of the resolutions, to foster a \ndebate on the President's plan for the future of Iraq. But the Senate \nRepublicans would not allow that. The Republicans' obstruction and the \nPresident's decision so far have left us with very few options.\n  I am looking at every resolution and every proposal. I am looking \nforward to having hearings and getting the facts and moving forward in \na bipartisan way.\n  Personally, I believe the way forward should include three steps. \nFirst of all, we should strategically redeploy our troops. Second, we \nshould work with Iraq's neighbors and other countries in the area to \nbuild a regional framework. And third, we need the Iraqis to take \nownership of their own country and their own future. We can send troops \nfor decades and never have a peaceful, stable Iraq until the Iraqi \npeople are willing to work together for a purpose that is larger than \ntheir own tribe or their own sect or their own self.\n  We need to refocus our efforts on the war on terror, on fighting al-\nQaida, and on addressing the other challenges that threaten our \nsecurity. I am very concerned by the reports we hear about Afghanistan, \nthat it is sliding backward and becoming more unstable. Those are some \nof the steps I would take to improve our security. That is the debate \nwe ought to be having.\n  Before I conclude, let me address two concerns. First, some people \nhave suggested that if you question the President's policies, you are \nsomehow hurting our troops. As the Vice President would say, hogwash. \nSupporting our troops means giving them a clear mission, making sure \nthey have the equipment and support they need and making sure we have a \nclear endgame. If any of those critical ingredients are missing, it is \nour duty to question the policy until we provide our troops with what \nthey need. Sending more Americans into the middle of a civil war \nwithout a clear mission, without equipment, without support, without an \nendgame, is endangering our troops, not supporting them.\n  I don't shrink from war. I voted for the war in Afghanistan. My \nfather served in World War II and he was injured in combat. I know war \nis sometimes necessary. But I also know that if we don't answer the \ncritical questions, our troops pay the price. For too long, partisans \nhave claimed to be speaking for our troops but have blocked the \ndiscussions that could truly protect them. I say, no more.\n  Finally, some people say that a nonbinding resolution is not enough. \nAnd I agree. That is why this is a first step. We can't take the other \nsteps until this Congress goes on record, in a bipartisan voice, \ntelling the President the surge is wrong. Once we have done that, the \nball is in the President's court. But today, Senate Republicans\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\nare preventing us from getting there. If he still will not change \ncourse, we will look at the other tools before us.\n  Senators have discussed a wide series of steps that we could take. I \nwill review all of them. We are also holding hearings to find out what \noptions we can take. This is the first step. If the President doesn't \nhear us, we will take the next step. And the next step. And the one \nafter that.\n  I understand that many Americans are frustrated that our troops are \nin the middle of a civil war. I am frustrated. too. I wish we had been \nallowed to start this process, these hearings, these debates and votes \na long time ago. But we are moving aggressively forward now. Democrats \nhave been in charge now for 5 weeks. And already, finally, we are \nhaving more debates, more hearings, more progress, than we have had in \nthe past 3 years. But I can promise you, this is only a beginning.\n  We can't have these debates if the Republicans are blocking us in an \nopen discussion of the war. The Republicans need to stop denying a real \ndebate in the Senate, so that together we can move our country in a new \ndirection. I believe for us to have an impact, Congress has to speak \nout in a clear, bipartisan voice. We could vote on hundreds of \nresolutions that make us feel better, but that would not help us change \ndirection. It is a strong, bipartisan message from Congress to the \nexecutive branch and to the country that has the power to make \nprogress.\n  I am willing to take the time and do this right and to build the \nsupport we need so that at the end of the day we can have a real \nimpact. I strongly oppose the surge. I believe escalation is the wrong \ndirection. I will vote to put the Senate on record opposing the surge \nif the Republicans will end their filibuster. I will continue to fight \nfor new direction in Iraq.\n  For too long, the voices of our troops and our citizens have been \nblocked. Today, Senate Republicans are trying to continue that \nobstruction. I say, no longer. The debate must begin because our \ncountry will be better for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1607-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1607-S1615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me commend my colleague from the State \nof Washington for her comments and her views. I associate myself with \nmany of the things she expressed in the Senate. I congratulate her for \nher words, her passion, and her strong feelings about where we stand \ntoday on this issue.\n  Let me also commend the Democratic leader for his efforts to engage \nin what is probably the single most important debate this Senate could \npossibly be engaged in. There are other very important matters at home \nand around the globe--but everyone would agree, regardless of your \nviews on policy, that the issue of Iraq and where we stand and the \neffort by the President to increase the number of troops on the ground \nin Iraq, particularly to place them in the large, highly densely \npopulated urban areas of Iraq, is one of the most serious issues facing \nour country.\n  We have had a series of serious and thought-provoking hearings \nconducted by Chairman Biden of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nover the last number of weeks on this issue, with people who represent \na variety of ideological perspectives. Yet without fear of \ncontradiction, I believe the overwhelming majority of the witnesses who \nhave appeared before that committee have expressed serious reservations \nabout this escalation, this surge, placing some 21,000 of our young men \nand women into Baghdad to try and act as a referee in what we all admit \ntoday is clearly a civil war.\n  Having this debate is important. I wish to take, if I can, the few \nminutes allotted to me to express my concerns about the process, my \nconcerns about the surge, and my concerns about the overall direction \nof the policy in Iraq. There is not a lot of time to do that, but let \nme share some thoughts.\n  First of all, I believe that every Member in this Chamber, regardless \nof his or her view on the issue before the Senate regarding Iraq, would \ndo everything he or she could to make sure that our brave men and women \nin uniform, serving in harm's way, would receive everything they could \npossibly need to defend themselves. That ought not to be a debating \npoint. I know of no one in this Senate who feels otherwise. And the \nfact that we have to have some discussion about this very point is a \nreflection, I think, of what has gone wrong in this debate already.\n  In fact, I point out that over the last 4 years or so, there have \nbeen amendments offered by those of us here to provide different \nadditional resources, such as for body armor, because we felt our \ntroops were not getting what they needed. There has been significant \ndiscussion here in the wake of testimony offered by our senior military \nleaders about what has happened to the combat readiness of our troops \nas a result of our failure to continue to provide the kind of equipment \nand support they deserved over the years. Certainly what has happened \nto veterans coming back has also been the subject of debate. But, \nnonetheless, I believe most Members here, if not all Members here, \nbelieve our troops deserve the kind of support they ought to have when \nthey are serving in harm's way.\n  And so, the debate is not whether you support our troops. The debate \nis whether the policy direction the President wishes to lead us in is \nthe right one. That is a debate which ought to occur in this Chamber. \nFrankly, in my view, it ought to be a debate that resolves around at \nleast a legislative vehicle that might have some meaning to it, some \nbite, some teeth, some reality, some accountability.\n  My leaders know I have strong reservations about a sense-of-the-\nSenate debate. Now, normally, we have sense-of-the-Senate resolutions \nwhen there is a consensus that develops. Normally, sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions are offered around matters that are noncontroversial and we \nwish to express ourselves regarding these matters, so we all sign on or \nvirtually everyone signs on.\n  I would say if, in fact, the goal here was to get 70 or 80 Members of \nthis Chamber--Republicans and Democrats--to sign on to a proposition \nthat said we think the surge and escalation is the wrong thing to be \ndoing, then the vehicle of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution would have \nvalue. But I would suggest here we are into the second day of this \ndebate and we cannot even decide what sense-of-the-Senate resolution we \nwant to debate.\n  So if you are sitting out there watching this Chamber at this moment, \nin terms of where we ought to be going and what the effect of what we \nare about to do is, it is rather confusing, to put it mildly, as to \nwhere we stand in all of this. We cannot even decide what sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions to bring up. If we are going to have a debate around \nhere that is meaningful, why not debate something that is meaningful?\n  So my concerns are, in many ways, that given this moment in time, \nbefore these young men and women are placed in harm's way--because I \nknow full well, after a quarter of a century here, once they are on the \nground, once they are in place, the debate changes. The debate changes. \nSo if we are truly concerned about dealing with the surge and \nescalation, then I believe we ought to be engaging in a debate that has \nsome meaningful outcomes when it comes to the decision of whether we go \nforward.\n  I, for one, would like to see a new authorization come to this body \nto be debated. The resolution on which we are operating today is one \nthat was crafted 5 years ago. It was fundamentally linked to weapons of \nmass destruction and the conduct of Saddam Hussein. The first argument \nwas, of course, a fiction. There were no weapons of mass destruction. \nAnd the second argument is no longer viable. Saddam Hussein is gone.\n  Today, we are being asked to place men and women in uniform in the \nmiddle of a civil war. It seems to me that if the President of the \nUnited States wants that to be a policy endorsed by the American people \nthrough the actions of this body, then we ought to be voting on a \nmatter that says this is something we agree with and go forward. That \nwould have some meaning to it, it seems to me. If we rejected it, then \nthe President would have a strong answer from the Congress about \nwhether we are about to continue to finance\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\nand support that activity--again, not undercutting the needs of our \ntroops in harm's way but a legitimate debate about a real issue that \nrequires Members to stand up and vote yes or no.\n  I realize I am in sort of a minority of one or two here who believes \nthe vehicles we are choosing to debate over the next several days, if, \nin fact, the debate goes on, are ones that in the final analysis are \nnothing more than really message proposals. If we are highly divided \nover which one to bring up, what is the message, in effect, if we \ncannot even decide which vehicles we want to choose to discuss?\n  Regarding the surge itself and regarding the Warner-Levin or Levin-\nWarner proposal, I have some problems with the language of that \nproposal. It essentially abdicates the power of the purse. It calls for \nselective diplomacy in the region instead of engaging all of Iraq's \nneighbors. The language opposing the surge is weak to the point of \nbeing nonexistent. And there is language that suggests that nothing in \nthis resolution ought to imply a call for redeployment--something I \nwholeheartedly believe we should be pursuing in a phased manner.\n  But those are my concerns about it, both in terms of the process and \nthe language under consideration. I realize other Members do not have \nthose problems. I respect that. But those are my concerns.\n  Now, regarding the surge itself, again this has been stated by others \nwho have examined this proposal in great detail, including our senior \nmilitary people and senior diplomats. As I said a moment ago, in \ntestimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they have \nspoken eloquently about their concerns that this proposal does nothing \nbut contribute to the chaos that reins in Iraq.\n  There are some 6 million people who live in the city of Baghdad. To \nsuggest we are going to send 17,000 or 18,000 service men and women \ninto a city of 6 million, where there are at least 23 militias along \nwith insurgents, Baathists, hardened criminals, and possibly some al-\nQaida elements, and that we are going to sort this out in a way that is \ngoing to move us toward a political settlement in the country is I \nbelieve, frankly, beyond dreaming. I do not think it has any viability \nwhatsoever. In fact, I think it contributes to a further escalation of \nthe conflict in the country and delays even further what everyone \nagrees must occur: some sort of political accommodation between Shias \nand Sunnis and Kurds--between Shias and Shias, for that matter. The \nidea that placing our troops as a referee in the middle of this civil \nconflict is going to get us closer to that result, I think, has been \nsuccessfully argued against by those whom we respect and admire in \nthese debates.\n\n  Secondly, may I say that, in fact, if you are trying to encourage \nthose elements to get together and you are also trying to encourage \nregional diplomacy to play a role here, then it seems to me we ought to \nbe talking about how best we can achieve that. When you have an \nadministration that refuses to even engage in any kind of conversation \nor negotiations with governments in the region with which we have \nserious disagreements, then I think we get even further away from the \nsuggestions made by the Baker-Hamilton study group on Iraq that \nproposed what I thought were very commonsense, sober, and sound \nrecommendations that would allow us to have a greater likelihood of \nachieving the success we ought to be pursuing. I see little likelihood \nof that occurring if, in fact, we are talking about a further military \nescalation of the conflict here. Every single person who has looked at \nthe situation in Iraq has drawn the following conclusion: There is no \nmilitary solution--no military solution--in Iraq. So continuing to \npursue that option, continuing to pursue that particular goal in the \nface of all the evidence to the contrary, I believe is a major, major \nmistake for this country.\n  I think this body--the Senate--ought to be on record expressing its \nopinion about it and that we ought to go forward in a meaningful, real, \naccountable way. Unfortunately, that is not likely to happen. In fact, \nwe may end this debate without voting on anything at all regarding \nIraq, as we need to move on to other items that the leadership clearly \nmust address in the coming weeks. So we are missing an opportunity, \nother than to express our views, which most people have done. I know of \nno Member in this Chamber who has not spoken out publicly about whether \nthey think the surge is the right direction to go in, what alternatives \nthey would offer in terms of how we might begin to talk about \nredeployment, and the need for the Iraqis to assume responsibility for \ntheir own country.\n  The American people have also publicly spoken out. They voted for a \nchange of course in Iraq last November and according to recent polls, a \nmajority of Americans oppose a surge. Now I do not believe polling data \nought to be the way you conduct foreign policy, but the fact is that \nthe American public is exhausted and fed up, to put it mildly, with our \nIraq policy. And let's consider the following data out of Iraq: Over 80 \npercent of the people in that country believe that our continued \npresence in that country contributes to the chaos they are facing, and \nover 60 percent of Iraqis believe it is appropriate to attack American \nservice men and women. Over 60 percent of the people in Iraq believe \nthat.\n  How do you justify supporting an escalation, a surge in our military \npresence, when the very people whom we are told we are trying to help \nin this case believe that, one, we contribute to the chaos, and only a \nslightly smaller number believe it is appropriate to attack our service \nmen and women? For the life of me, I do not understand how an American \nPresident could possibly support a policy that takes us further down \nthat road.\n  Now we are not just talking about only two options here of escalating \nor leaving. There are policies that come in far between these two. For \nexample, there have been suggestions about redeployment, with our \nservice men and women filling other roles like training the Iraqi \nmilitary, which was suggested by Baker-Hamilton. I think we should do \nthis. We could engage in counterterrorism activities. Border security; \nwe could play a very meaningful role in that as well. So there are \nthose of us here who believe we ought to be redeploying, bring down \nthose numbers, but none of us whom I know of have suggested we ought to \nbe just packing our bags over the next 6 months and leaving Iraq. We \nare talking about other roles we can perform, as the 300,000 Iraqi \nsoldiers and police take over the responsibility of their country.\n  Madam President, I am telling you as I stand before you today, if we \ncontinue to provide the kind of level of support militarily we are \nengaging in, there is less and less likelihood that the Iraqis are \ngoing to assume the responsibility, both politically and militarily, to \ntake over leadership of their country.\n  For those reasons, I urge that we find a means and a vehicle, sooner \nrather than later, for this body--the Senate, this coequal branch of \nGovernment--to say to the administration and to others: We believe in a \ndifferent direction. We would like a new authorization. We would like \ndebate on a meaningful proposal that would allow us to be accounted \nfor, yes or no, as to whether you want to move forward.\n  Again, with all due respect to those who crafted this, I have no \ngreater admiration for any two Members than I do for Carl Levin and \nJohn Warner, people I have served with here for many years. I respect \nimmensely the effort they have engaged in here to try to build a \nproposal that would attract a substantial majority of our colleagues to \nsupport. If you could do that, then sense-of-the-Senate resolutions \nhave value. But I rest my case on what is occurring at the very moment \nI stand before you this afternoon. We are divided here. We have some \nfour or five different resolutions. All of them are sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions. None of them have any meaning in law at all. And we cannot \nseem to come around a single debate. We ought to be having one about \nwhether we believe our resources and our young men's and women's lives \nought to be placed in harm's way. That is the debate which ought to be \noccurring here. It is not occurring yet. I think that is unfortunate. \nIt is tragic. My hope is we will find a means to address that in short \norder.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed for such time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was allotted 15 minutes. Does the \nSenator seek UC for more time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, I ask that, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I probably will not use more time, but at least I am \nprotected. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments of my colleague, \nthe Senator from Connecticut. I appreciate the frustration he expressed \nabout what has gone on in the last hours here and the difficulty of \npresenting to the country a Senate that appears unable to make up its \nmind about what resolution we ought to vote on.\n  The fact is, the last 24 hours in the Senate have not been a profile \nin courage; they have been a profile in politics. Rather than protect \nthe troops, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided \nto try to do what they can to protect the President. I think they have \nmade an enormous mistake.\n  The fact is, if we voted on the Warner resolution, those who support \nthe mission, the escalation--but the mission, as the Senator from \nArizona said--have a chance to vote no, and those who believe the \nescalation is a mistake have an opportunity to vote yes. It just does \nnot get any clearer than that.\n  No matter what happens with all this argument about the process of \none resolution versus another resolution, the bottom line is that \npeople who on Sunday shows and in hearings stand up and say they oppose \nthe escalation were, yesterday, unwilling to allow the Senate to vote \non that. They were unwilling to have a vote of conscience on the \nquestion of the direction of this war.\n  So rather than protect the troops, those troops who are about to be \nsent into a mission that, in fact, does not resolve the issue of Iraq--\nand perhaps even makes it far more dangerous, certainly more dangerous \nfor those troops being asked to perform it--are not protected by the \nSenate, making its best effort here to try to make a vote that \ndisagrees with the President.\n  The Senator from Arizona was down here a few minutes ago asking the \nquestion of the majority leader: If you do not support the troops' \nmission, then aren't you, by definition--if you vote as we would like \nto vote here--not supporting the troops? That is just an extraordinary \nleap of logic which has no basis whatsoever in real reasoning.\n  The Senator from Arizona himself has criticized the policies of this \nadministration time and again--in fact, not enough. But time and again, \nhe has said Mr. Rumsfeld was wrong or he did not have confidence in him \nor this and that. Was that a criticism of the troops? Was that not \nsupporting the troops? I am absolutely confident the answer is no. I \nknow, and we all know, the Senator from Arizona supports the troops, \nbut he has been able to draw a distinction between criticizing the \npolicy and support for the troops. I will tell you, the best way you \nsupport the troops, you support the troops by getting the policy right.\n  Right now, all over the Hill here in Washington, there are veterans \nof the Iraq war who are going around and talking to Congressmen and \nSenators and the public, advocating that this mission in Iraq ought to \nchange, that we ought to begin a process of terminating our involvement \nthere. They have a very different view of their own service than that \nwhich is expressed by some on the other side of the aisle. The fact is, \nthere is a growing sentiment among many of those being asked to do this \nvery difficult job that the missions they are being sent on don't, in \nfact, always make sense.\n\n  I remember--and I know the Senator from Arizona remembers--what it is \nlike to be a troop in a war. I remember being on a river in Vietnam \nwhen the Secretary of Defense was flying over us on one of his visits \nto take a look at what was going on. Every single one of us said to \neach other: Boy, wouldn't it be great if he came down here and talked \nto us and found out what we really think is going on. We would have \nloved the policy to change. The fact is that more and more of the \nveterans I have talked to who are returning from Iraq and some, \nregrettably, as Senator Dodd and I noticed a few days ago, whom we met \nover there who have not returned alive, are against what is happening \nand believe there is a better way to manage this war.\n  What we are trying to do is have a vote, albeit on a nonbinding \nresolution, a vote that expresses the view of the Senate with respect \nto this war. We have a moral obligation to make that statement in the \nSenate. It is our duty to have that vote. The soldiers in Iraq are \nperforming their duty. Why aren't the Senators in the Senate performing \ntheirs? Is it their duty to obstruct? Is it their duty to protect the \nPresident, to prevent a vote? Even though they go out publicly and talk \nabout their opposition to the war, their opposition to the escalation, \ntheir belief that the direction is wrong, we are not supposed to vote \nin the Senate on the question of whether you support the troops or \ndon't support the troops by sending an additional 21,000 troops over \nthere. Now is the time for the Senate to register its opposition to the \nescalation.\n  If you pursue the logic of the other side of the aisle when they say: \nWell, we can't have a vote here, we shouldn't express anything, we \nshouldn't try to change anything, then we are complicit in the very \nprocess with which we disagree. If lives are lost subsequent to our \nunwillingness to stand up and vote, do we bear any responsibility for \nthe loss of those lives? Do you go home and say to yourself at night, \nto your wife or your children: Do you know I did everything possible to \ntry to stop what is happening? When you make the next phone call to a \nmother or father or wife in your State and express your sorrow for \ntheir loss in the next days ahead, will you also be able to say, with a \nclear conscience, that you did your best to try to prevent that loss, \nto set this war on its proper course? I don't think so. I don't think \nanybody, with a clear conscience, can say that.\n  I hate the fact that we are reduced to having a vote on something \nthat isn't at this moment going to change the direction. But every step \nis incremental; every step is a building block. Every step helps to \nbuild the change of opinion we need to achieve in this country, where \npeople will understand the way you best define patriotism and the way \nyou best defend the interests of our troops on the ground in Iraq. \nSurely, we haven't reached a point in the Senate where you can't even \nhave a debate on the most important life-and-death issue facing people \nin this country. What are we supposed to do? Pack up and go home and \nlet the President continue to make a mistake? Are we supposed to be \nsomehow satisfied that the President has earned the right and the new \nSecretary of Defense? Who knows yet; the decision is out. But the \nrecord of the last 5 years, 6 years is one of mistake after mistake \nafter mistake after mistake after mistake, one after the other, from \nthe planning to the numbers of troops, to what you do afterwards, to \nhow you preserve the peace, to what kind of politics we are going to \npursue.\n  So we are doing what we can, within our limited power, with 60-vote \nrestrictions, to register our disapproval to sending an additional \nnumber of troops, which has been told to the American people is 21,000 \nbut which, in fact, is over 40,000 when you finish with the support \ntroops who are necessary. These troops deserve a policy that is worthy \nof their sacrifice. No Senator that I know of is not committed to \nsuccess. We would like to be successful. But what is the definition of \nsuccess now?\n  We have heard month after month from Ambassador Khalilizad. General \nCasey, over 7 months ago, said this is the last 6 months for Iraq. They \nhave a fundamental 6-month period within which they have to get their \nact together, and if they don't, serious problems.\n  That time came and passed. What happened? We hear another promise of \nthe next few months. We have had months and even years now of these \npromises about how this is a moment of turning the corner. This is the \ncritical moment for Iraq. This is the moment of the difference. \nEverybody has known for the whole last year or more that you have to \nresolve the oil revenues issue. As I stand on the floor tonight, the \noil revenues issue is not resolved. They say they are making progress, \nthey are getting closer, but it isn't resolved.\n\n  The fundamental question of federalism, the role between the Shia and\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\nthe Sunni and a strong Baghdad and a strong central government is \nunresolved. That is a fundamental part of the struggle. Our troops, \nwith their technology, with their great weapons, with their \nunbelievable willingness to sacrifice and their courage, they can't \nresolve that issue. Iraqi politicians have to resolve that issue. Right \nnow, as we are debating or not debating this issue, Iraqi politicians \nare still jockeying for power at the expense of our young men and \nwomen. I object to that. I get angry that we have to have a private \nfundraising effort to put together a rehab for our soldiers--thank God \nfor the people who did it--in order to take care of those who are going \nto be wounded. And our people are talking about patriotism and \nsupporting the troops? We have lost all contact with what is reasonable \nor what is real in this effort.\n  It is unacceptable that any young American ought to be giving their \nlife or going through the sacrifice for Iraqi politicians who refuse to \ncompromise, for a legislature that refuses to even meet. Less than 50 \npercent of them can be convened, a Parliament that doesn't meet, that \nis the democracy we are supposedly fighting for--Shia and Sunni \npoliticians who are jockeying amongst each other, creating their own \nmilitias, each of them playing for a future with a U.S. security \nblanket lying over it, preventing the full explosion of the kind of \nsectarian violence that would flow, if all were left to their own \ndevices. That is the one thing our presence is doing. There is a \nstopgap. It does prevent absolute chaos, but it is creating a slow, \ncancerous, insidious kind of chaos that is building on itself.\n  A couple of days ago, the largest number of civilians were killed by \na bomb, by one single suicide bomb. It gets worse by the day because \nthe fundamental issues of difference between people who have always \nlived there and will live there after we are gone are not resolved.\n  If you stand back from this and look at it and ask, as any reasonable \nAmerican would ask: What do you do to resolve this, what do you do to \nmake a difference in Iraq, I don't think any American is going to come \nto the conclusion that a soldier with a gun is going to make that \ndifference. General Casey has told us he doesn't believe it will make \nthe difference. General Abizaid said he didn't think it would make a \ndifference. The President has even said there is no military solution. \nSo if there is indeed no military solution, my question to this \nadministration is: Where is the robust diplomacy and the robust \npolitical jawboning, arm twisting that is necessary to get a solution? \nWhere is it? It is invisible to the average American.\n  If we don't get serious about that diplomacy, if we don't have a \nsummit that some of us have been calling for for 3 years, and that is \nultimately the only way to resolve these differences, then our soldiers \nare being sacrificed and being asked to sacrifice each day without a \nreasonable policy that is guiding this war.\n  What are we left to do? Are we left to say that our colleagues can \nstop a vote? We are going to walk away, and we are not going to try to \ndo what we can to change this or to stop it? I don't think so. That is \nnot the Senate that I came to serve in or I think most of our \ncolleagues came to serve in. This is a silly sort of process that is \ngoing back and forth.\n  If you are opposed to the escalation, you ought to have a right to \nvote on it. If you are for it, you will have the right to vote for it. \nGo register your vote and then go out to the country. The troops over \nthere are tougher than anybody in this room. They understand what their \nmission is. And what we do, ultimately, barring the effort to either \ncut off the funds or force the President to do something with 60 votes \nthat we don't yet have, is not going to change their dedication or \ntheir courage or their commitment to the specific mission. Because that \nis the kind of troops we have.\n  But while we are talking about the kind of troops we have, let me ask \na question: Our troops, most of them, go through basic training. They \ngo through a specialized school. They train with their brigade unit \ncompany for a while. Then they are sent over. Most of our troops are \nready to go to battle, and some of them do, new recruits, within 7 \nmonths, 9 months. We are now at the 3-year mark, 4-year mark on \ntraining of 300,000 troops in Iraq. What I hear from the experts is the \nproblem with them is not training. The problem is motivation. How much \ntraining do you think the terrorists get? How much training do you \nthink the guys get who have those machineguns and go out? Where is \ntheir training camp? Where are their barracks? Where is their 9-week \nbasic training or 12 weeks? Most of those people are out there in a \nmatter of days and hours because they are motivated.\n  Right now in the streets of the West Bank and the streets of Lebanon \nand in the streets of Iraq, the guys we are struggling against are \ngetting up earlier, staying up later, and they have more motivation. \nAnd the guys we are supporting and putting forth money and guns and all \nthe technology and all the training in the world are not motivated. \nMany of them don't show up. So unless we deal with this issue of \nmotivation, of people who are willing to die for their country and \npeople who are willing to go out and put their lives on the line and a \ngroup of politicians who are willing to make the decisions necessary to \nresolve this, this is going to go on and on and on, and it is not going \nto end well.\n  Everybody knows what the public assessment is on the latest NIE. \nPeople are learning privately what it is. The fact is, these are \ndifficult times over there. This is not getting better. It is getting \nworse. Twenty-one thousand troops are not going to change that. An \nescalation is not going to change that. More troops on the ground \nraises the stakes. More troops on the ground provides more targets. \nMore troops on the ground raises the stakes in a way that says, because \nwe heard it from the administration: Boy, this is kind of our last-\nditch stand. And if we don't make this work, we don't know what is \ngoing to happen. What a wonderful message to send to the other side.\n  We are being accused of sending bad messages. If you raise the stakes \nlike that but create a mission and actually can't necessarily achieve \nit, you are preordaining the potential of even worse consequences \nbecause you will make the negotiation even harder. You will make it \nharder for the surrounding countries to say: This is sensible, we ought \nto get involved now. And you will make it harder for the people there \nto make the compromises necessary because they know that down the road \nis this confrontation with reality with an administration that has \nalready said: We don't have a plan beyond this.\n  What a predicament. That just defies common sense. So we have made \nmatters worse. We will raise the stakes, but we don't have a way to \ndeal with it. A wing and a prayer. This is a ``Hail Mary'' pass by this \nadministration, with no guarantee. I think our troops deserve some \nguarantees of an outcome.\n  The best guarantee I can think of is to redeploy them in a way that \nputs more emphasis on what the Iraqis need to do. It doesn't mean \nleaving Iraq completely. There are plenty of over-the-horizon \nstrategies, such as in the desert deployments, a capacity to be there \nfor emergency assistance, to tamp down chaos and go after al-Qaida, an \nability to remain in a truly supportive training role without having \nour troops on the front line of a civil war. But those are not the ones \nthey are putting on the table, and that is not what we hear them talk \nabout.\n  We hear these two dramatic things: We have to go down this road where \nwe have telegraphed our move and raise the stakes, and saying they are \ntalking about complete withdrawal. No, they are not. Most are talking \nabout how to achieve success in a responsible way which honors the \nsacrifice of our troops and meets the important national security needs \nof the United States of America.\n  The only way I know of to do that is to get to the diplomatic table; \nbring our neighbors into a new dynamic where they begin to have \ncredibility; get Syria and others through the Arab League, the U.N, \nPerm 5, and begin a process of legitimate diplomacy, such as we have \nread about in the history books of our Nation for years. The great \ndiplomats of our country are aghast at what we are doing now. Listen to \nany number of them privately, some who served in the administration of \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President--Secretaries of State,\n\n[[Page S1611]]\n\nsuch as Jim Baker. Jim Baker is a model in how to build a true \ncoalition. It took him 15 trips to Syria before. On the 15th trip, he \nfinally got President Assad to agree to support what we were engaged \nin. I am not sure the current Secretary of State has made 15 trips in \nthe last 5 years. I cannot tell you the exact number, but I don't think \nit is 15 in the years she has been in office, let alone the prior \nSecretary of State.\n  Mr. President, we have to get serious about what we are going to do. \nThe fact is, there are over 3,000 young Americans who have now died. I \nthink four were reported in the newspapers yesterday. There will be \nmore tomorrow and the next day. The fact that we are losing young \nAmericans is not a reason to say we should leave. But it is a reason to \nsay we should get the policy right. It is a reason to say we owe them a \nstrategy that supports the sacrifice they are making. We ought to be \nable to do better than what we are doing now, Mr. President.\n  So this is really pretty simple. The Iraqi Study Group put forward \nsome 79 recommendations. They have all been cast aside. This was a \nmoment where the President could have brought Democrats to the table, \nall of us. We could have sat down and come together around, OK, let's \nput all these recommendations together. These will work, and we are \nwilling to support these. Let's go out jointly and see if we can \nleverage the full power of the Senate and the Congress and the country \nbehind the kind of strategy we need in the Middle East in order to \nprotect these real interests, which range from Israel, to containing \nIran, dealing with the protection of the gulf states, to Lebanon, the \nfledgling democracy, and obviously to stability in Iraq. We all \nunderstand that, not to mention oil and the economy and the other \ninterests that we have. Those are real.\n  But I respectfully submit that the current policy we are on is \nrecklessly putting those very interests at greater risk. And the \nmeasurement of that statement is in the fact that Iran is actually more \npowerful today as a consequence of what we are doing. Iran loves the \nfact that we are bogged down in Iraq because it makes it far more \ndifficult for us to play a legitimate card in order to deal with their \nnuclear ambitions. There is nobody in the world who doubts that. \nLebanon is more in jeopardy today, with Hezbollah and Nasrallah in \ngreater positions of threat to the Government and the Prime Minister. \nHamas has been in an ascendency in the last months, and we have been \nunable to move forward with a legitimate entity with which to be able \nto ultimately make peace. All these things are worse off today than a \nyear ago, than 2 years ago, and worse off than 6 years ago.\n  If they are worse off, how do you stand there and say this is a good \npolicy, that we ought to keep doing what we are doing, digging a deeper \nhole, and making it worse? I was over in the Middle East a month ago. I \nmet with leaders of the region. I can tell you that while, yes, they \nsay they don't want a precipitous departure and a crazy consequence of \nchaos as a result, they also do want the United States to play a \nsensible, constructive, and legitimate role in resolving the \nfundamental issues of the region.\n  So I think a lot of us have had enough of hearing these phony debates \nabout who supports the troops. We all support the troops. This is the \nbest trained military that many of us have ever seen. They are doing an \namazing job under difficult circumstances. Again and again, I say that \nthey deserve the support of a Congress that gets this policy right and \nthat fights for them while they are over there and guarantees that when \nthey come home, they don't have to fight for themselves to have the \npromises that were made to them kept. That is what this is about.\n  I think we can have a very simple vote. If you are for the escalation \nand you think it is the right policy, vote no against the resolution. \nIf you are against the policy of escalation and you think it is the \nwrong policy and you want to be counted, then you ought to vote aye for \nthe resolution. That is a vote we can have tonight, tomorrow, or any \ntime. Most people here know where they stand, but they are unwilling to \nshow the American people and unwilling to hold this President \naccountable. Shame on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nMissouri for being so understanding. I will make my comments quite \nbrief.\n  The entire success of the President's plan of escalation is \npredicated on the fact that the Iraqi Army is, in fact, reliable. \nTherefore, in every one of our hearings in our committees--be it the \nArmed Services Committee, be it the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nbe it the Senate Intelligence Committee--I have asked that question of \nthe various witnesses, most of whom are representatives of the \nadministration or representatives of our U.S. military. Up to this \nmoment, not one of the administration witnesses can tell us that the \nIraqi Army is, in fact, reliable in a plan that is essential that they \nare, which is to clear the area, hold the area, and then rebuild the \ninfrastructure. In the clear phase, it is not only the Iraqi Army and \nthe U.S. military--by the way, not in a single unified command but in \ndual commands of which the Iraqi Army will be the most force in \npersonnel--and I have heard that 60/40 is the ratio; maybe it is more \nthan that--60 percent Iraqi Army and 40 percent U.S. Therefore, it is \nessential that the Iraqi Army is reliable.\n  Yet every witness has not been able to tell us that, including up to \ntoday's witness, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, who I think \nis doing an excellent job. But when I laid this out to him in front of \nour committee--in this case, the Senate Armed Services Committee--\ntoday, his answer was, as of this morning, that we have to wait and \nsee.\n  Well, I am just a little country lawyer, but doesn't it seem logical \nthat if the President's whole plan is predicated on the reliability of \nthe Iraqi Army, and at this moment we still have to wait and see on the \nreliability of the Iraqi Army, then is that reason for us to escalate \nour troops in Baghdad out of 21,000, with some 17,500 going into \nBaghdad, on a plan that we do not know is going to work?\n  It is on that basis that this Senator from Florida opposes this troop \nincrease. I have said on this floor several times that the Marine \ngenerals in the west of Iraq, in Anbar Province, convinced me that an \nescalation of troops there would help them, since that is all Sunni, \nand since the main enemy there is al-Qaida. But that is western Iraq; \nthat is not Baghdad where the sectarian violence is.\n  Mr. President, I will just conclude my remarks by saying that I think \nit is our only hope of stabilizing Iraq, that it depends on three \nsuccessful initiatives: No. 1, an aggressive diplomatic effort led by \nthe U.S. with Iraq and its neighbors to quickly find a political \nsettlement between Iraq's warring factions; two, Iraqis taking \nresponsibility for providing for their own security; three, a massive \nand effective international reconstruction program.\n  With regard to the first of these initiatives, an intense diplomatic \neffort aimed at helping Iraq with a political settlement has been \ndiscussed many times by most of our Senators. This Senator believes it \nmust include sufficient autonomy for Iraq's various regions and \ncommunities but a stake for all in the central government; an oil \nrevenue sharing law; a reversal of debaathification--partial reversal--\nand a revised constitutional amendment process.\n  The lack of a major diplomatic effort to build an international \ncoalition to support a political settlement is truly baffling. Iraq is \nin a full-blown crisis.\n  So we need at least one, if not several, high-level special envoys \nempowered by the President and endorsed by congressional leadership. \nWorking together, they need to be on the ground every day, throughout \nthe Middle East, in Europe and Asia, and at the United Nations.\n  The goal should be--within a month--to assemble an international \nconference at which all of Iraq's neighbors and other key nations would \nendorse the framework of a political settlement.\n  It became painfully evident to me during my last trip to Iraq that \nPrime Minister al-Maliki either lacks the will or the nerve to take on \nthe Shiite militias on whose backing he depends for power. For example, \nhis rushed execution of Saddam Hussein--certainly justified, but \nhorribly carried out--spoke\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\nvolumes about his insensitivity to the concerns of the Sunnis.\n  Initiative No. 2: As for Iraqis taking responsibility for their own \nsecurity, this will only take place if U.S. troops begin to pull back \nfrom the primary combat role they now play and shift to an advisory \ncapacity.\n  Where are those words ringing familiar, Mr. President? From the Iraq \nstudy commission, Jim Baker and Lee Hamilton's commission. They offered \nthis recommendation.\n  Rather than increasing our forces in Iraq, as the President has \nproposed, we should be transitioning the troops to training and \nadvising Iraqi troops, training and advising antiterrorism missions and \nborder security.\n  Finally, the third initiative: The massive reconstruction effort \nrequires a reconstruction czar, a person of the highest integrity who \nwill cut through the redtape, demand our agencies produce the results \nworking together and deliver construction assistance quickly and \ndirectly to Iraqi communities.\n  Concurrently, this official should convene a donors conference to \nelicit pledges of assistance from our international partners and to \nhold them accountable for delivering this aid quickly.\n  In short and in summary, the cost of failure in Iraq will be \ncatastrophic in growing threats to us and to our allies and in more \nAmerican and Iraqi lives lost if we do not awaken to the reality that \ndiplomacy, not a military solution, is what is needed to end the \nsectarian violence in Iraq.\n  I wish to paraphrase what the President of the United States, when I \nwas a student in college, President Kennedy, said in 1961: We must \nalways be ready and willing to bear arms to defend our freedoms, but as \nlong as we know what comprises our vital interest or our long-range \ngoals, we have nothing to fear from diplomacy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I spoke briefly this morning about the need \nto have votes on the Republican resolutions--the Republican Gregg \nresolution and the bipartisan Lieberman-McCain resolution. It is very \nimportant we give the opportunity for this body to go on record saying, \nNo. 1, they do support and will not cut off funding for our troops in \nIraq. That needs to be said in the Gregg resolution.\n  It is unusual and very unfortunate that at this time, when we are \nactually at war, we are considering resolutions which would say: Well, \nwe don't support sending more troops over. We are actually sending \ntroops over, and there are some who want to say: Well, we don't support \nthe mission; good luck, guys and gals; you are going over, but we don't \nsupport what you are doing.\n  We owe them more than that. We owe them what used to be the baseline \nin our discussions. Unfortunately, in time of war, we can debate and we \nshould debate. However, the Levin-Warner resolution, the only \nresolution at this point the majority would let us vote on, sends a \nwrong message to the insurgents, militia, and, obviously, to our \ntroops.\n  This is a very serious and difficult situation in Iraq, no question \nabout it. We got the national intelligence estimate, and it says these \nare tough times. But--and I agree with my colleague from Florida--we \ncannot afford to fail.\n  During General Petraeus's testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee last week, he chillingly described the typical Iraqi \nterrorist as ``determined, adaptable, barbaric'' and that ``he will try \nto wait us out.''\n  And now we are considering a resolution signaling to this enemy that \nthis body doesn't think the terrorists will have to wait too long. By \ncapping the troop strength, this resolution limits the very leaders \nthis body confirmed as fit to lead and determine strategies and levels \nof troops.\n  The proponents of the resolution to limit troop strength must now \nbelieve that sitting here 8,000 miles away, this body is more equipped \nthan our military leaders to say what our force structure should be in \nIraq. That is unacceptable; it is totally unacceptable.\n  The question has been raised: Will this plan work? There are lots of \nchallenges. It is a challenging situation. The intelligence community, \nin its National Intelligence Estimate, says there are many difficult \nfactors; it is a complex situation. But they said this is the best we \ncan hope to do. This is our best effort to make sure something comes \nout that provides a stable Iraq, one that will not be a haven for \nterrorist groups such as al-Qaida to operate.\n  The intelligence community was also very forthright, both in the NIE \nthat we received last week and in testimony several weeks earlier in an \nopen hearing of the Intelligence Committee. They said if we cut and \nrun, Iraq would descend into chaos, giving the terrorist groups, such \nas al-Qaida and probably the Shia terrorist groups, the chance to \noperate freely in that country. It would lead to slaughter of more and \nmore Iraqis--innocent Iraqis--and it would likely involve the entire \nregion.\n  It is clear that cutting and running should not be an option. There \nmay be some people who would vote to cut off funding. We ought to let \nthem have a chance at least to say we want to end it now, not we want \nto tinker with the military strategy so perhaps we can gain some \npolitical points at home.\n  I have heard it said that some of the people who are supporting the \nLevin-Warner resolution think we should be following the guidelines of \nthe Iraq Study Group. I had the opportunity on Sunday to ask Jim Baker \nis this military plan the military plan you have supported? He said: \nYes, it is.\n  Others have said we need a new strategy, and I agree. I agree we \nshouldn't have gone forward with debaathification and disbanding the \nIraqi Army. That mistake is behind us. But we need a new strategy that \ncan lead us to victory in Iraq.\n  It seems to me the place where we want to be is getting the Iraqi \nGovernment, al-Maliki and his Sunni and Kurdish counterparts in the \nGovernment, to take responsibility and say we are going to establish \nstability, we are going to end the insurgency. To do that, they have \nsaid: We need the support of American troops, not to be on the \nfrontlines--and I agree with those who said we want to move the Iraqis \nout front when they are stopping the Shia and Sunni violence; that is \nwhere they should be. We still have a role, and we can play a very \nimportant role in helping to take out the al-Qaida leadership and the \nother organized international radical Islamist terrorists, whether they \nbe Shia or Sunni, and we can do that. That is part of what the troop \nsurge will do. But we need to have them take over, and we need to train \nthem.\n  The intelligence community said the police are not ready to take over \nnow. We have found that when we embed American troops, provide American \ntroops in smaller numbers but with Iraqis, they function better. We can \nhelp show them how to win, and that is a plan I think we ought to \npursue because what is the cost if we lose? Iraq is the center point in \nthe war on terror. And unfortunately, we have no better source than \nOsama bin Laden, who says:\n\n       I now address my speech to the whole of the Islamic Nation: \n     Listen and understand. The issue is big and the misfortune is \n     momentous. The most important and serious issue today for the \n     whole world is this Third World War, which the Crusader-\n     Zionist coalition began against the Islamic Nation. It is \n     raging in the land of the two rivers. The world's millstone \n     and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate.\n\n  That is what he calls Baghdad, ``the capital of the caliphate.'' \nThere are similar transmissions by Ayman al-Zawahiri, who said: ``We \nmust have Iraq as our caliphate.'' So we have to wait. We have to make \nsure we stabilize the area.\n  It seems to me this is absolutely the best plan than fiddling around \nand adopting a resolution that says, no, we don't need 21,000 more \ntroops. Some of the same people who said earlier this year and last \nyear that we need more troops now are saying no, no, 21,000 more troops \nis not necessary. Whom are we going to believe, someone standing on the \nfloor of the Senate or the commanding general who has responsibility \nfor making sure that our troops accomplish their mission and they are \nsafe? If he says we need those troops, I wish to vote for a resolution \nthat says we need those troops. I wish to vote for a resolution that \nsays we shouldn't cut off funding; we need to support our troops when \nthey are in the field.\n  What is at stake in this resolution deserves a commitment that goes \nfar\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\nbeyond what the political pundits and political operatives pontificate \nin Washington. I don't say all the people supporting this resolution \nhave a desire to undercut our troops, to send the wrong message to our \nallies in the region or to encourage al-Qaida and Jaysh al-Mahdi. But, \nunfortunately, that is what this resolution can do.\n  I had the honor today of talking with the head of the intelligence \nagency of one of our allies in the region. I said: What message would \nit send to your country if we adopt a resolution saying the President \ncan't send over more troops? He said: That would be very bad because we \nwant to see peace and stability survive in Iraq. It is vitally \nimportant to the entire region, and we are prepared to help the \ncoalition make sure stability is achieved. We want to make sure Iran \ndoesn't take over that country, that chaos doesn't ensue, and we--and \nhe was speaking for several of the countries in the region--we want to \nprovide aid to help rebuild the economy so there will be a stable \neconomy because a stable economy is one of the best ways to convince \npeople they don't need to get 25 bucks from setting out an improvised \nexplosive device along the roadside.\n  So we would be sending a bad message to our allies, and we would be \nsending a message of great hope to the people of al-Qaida.\n  That is not what we ought to be doing, Mr. President. What is at \nstake deserves a commitment that goes far beyond the political pundits. \nThose who call for an end to the war don't want to talk about the fact \nthat the war in Iraq will not end but, in fact, will only grow more \ndangerous if we leave with that country in chaos.\n  So as we debate these resolutions, Congress's role in the Iraq policy \nis clear: Either Congress needs to exercise its constitutional powers \nof the purse and cut funding for the operations of the troops, which is \nmadness, or get behind them. We shouldn't confirm General Petraeus and \nthen say: Oh, but we don't support your plan. So if we are not using \nour power of the purse to cut off funds and force a hasty withdrawal, \nwhat are we doing? Are we telling 21,000 brave men and women who will \nbe going to Iraq that we are uncomfortable with the dangerous mission \nyou are about to undertake but not offering any alternative? I am sure \nour troops would find that encouraging.\n  Simply put, this may be a situation where there are good politics, \nbut these good politics equal bad policy. Politics are trumping good \npolicy.\n  A headline in today's Roll Call reads: ``Democrats to Launch PR Blitz \non Iraq Vote.''\n\n       . . . Senate Democrats are launching a national public \n     relations campaign aimed at tying GOP moderates and \n     incumbents facing difficult 2008 re-election races to Bush in \n     the public's mind, Democratic leadership aides said Monday.\n\n  Is that what this is all about? Is that the politics? I think that is \na very sad message.\n  What is at stake is so much bigger than politics, bigger than the \n2008 election, and it is a real disservice to our troops to see our \nnational security become a political election gamble.\n  I previously entered into the Record an article about 12 days ago by \nRobert Kagan, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for \nInternational Peace and transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall \nFund. He wrote a piece saying it is a grand delusion if we think we can \nwalk away from Iraq and not solve it. He went on to say:\n\n       Democratic and Republican Members of Congress are looking \n     for a different kind of political solution: the solution to \n     their problems in presidential primaries and elections almost \n     2 years off.\n\n  This is coming, as he indicates in his article, just as American \nsoldiers are finally beginning the hard job of establishing a measure \nof peace, security, and order in critical sections of Baghdad.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       They have launched attacks on Sunni insurgent strongholds \n     and begun reining in Moqtada al-Sadr's militia.\n\n  And, finally, he concludes, and it is fitting advice for this body:\n\n       Politicians in both parties should realize that success in \n     this mission is in their interest, as well as the Nation's. \n     Here's a wild idea: Forget the political posturing, be \n     responsible, and provide the moral and material support our \n     forces need and expect.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope we will vote on resolutions that do that.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, you have just heard an extraordinary \nspeech, and I want to put it in perspective, if I may.\n  There was a Foreign Relations Committee meeting several weeks ago at \nwhich one of the Senators insinuated that the Secretary of State didn't \nunderstand this war because she didn't have enough of a personal \ninterest. Well, we thought that was an unfair question because this is \na woman who is spending 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, trying to do the \nright thing for our country, and that was considered a personal thing \nthat was out of line.\n  We have just now heard a U.S. Senator make a speech that was a \nwonderful, principled speech on the merits of what he is going to \nsupport in this war effort, the resolution that will come before us, \nand he never mentioned that he had a personal interest. So I want to \nmention it. I want to mention Sam Bond.\n  Sam Bond is a Princeton graduate. He is the light of Senator Kit \nBond's life. He is his only child, his only son. Sam Bond has been a \nstar from the day he was born, and we have all heard about it. Sam Bond \ngraduated from Princeton University, and he didn't get a job on Wall \nStreet to then sign up to go to business school. No, Sam Bond signed up \nfor the Marine Corps.\n  Sam Bond has spent 1 year in Iraq already, in Fallujah, and he is \ngoing back in 1 month. Sam Bond is going back to Iraq in 1 month, and \nwe just heard the Senator from Missouri not even mention his only son \nbecause he is talking about what is right for our country. He believes \nthat Sam Bond's future depends on our doing the right thing in Iraq. So \nI applaud Senator Bond, and I applaud Sam Bond.\n  I want to talk about the resolution that we are going to vote on at \nsome point. First, I think Senator Bond is correct; that we ought to \nhave the right to vote on at least two resolutions, not just one that \nis unamendable. This is, as we have been reminded time and time and \ntime again, the most important issue raging in our country and maybe \nthe world today. So I think having two resolutions, or one amendable \nresolution, is a legitimate request because there are legitimate \ndifferences of opinion. There are legitimate debatable issues that I \nthink the Senate is capable of putting forth for our country, \nrepresenting the division in our country on this important issue.\n  Some people say we should never have gone into Iraq. In hindsight, it \nis an easy thing to say. Let's remember what we were looking at as \nSenators, and let's look at what the President was looking at as the \nCommander in Chief of this Nation, whose responsibility it is to \nprotect the people of this country. The buck stopped on the President's \ndesk.\n  I don't agree with everything the President has done. Not one person \non the Senate floor agrees with everything the President has done. But \nI will tell you this: no one--no one--can ever say this President isn't \ncommitted to one thing, paramount in all of his responsibilities, and \nthat is to protect the people of the United States. He is doing what he \nthinks is best to protect our children and freedom for our way of life.\n  When he went into Iraq, many people questioned whether it was the \nappropriate thing to do. I did myself. But the President had just been \nthrough 9/11, where we saw airplanes used as weapons of mass \ndestruction that killed thousands of Americans and people working in \nNew York City. So he said, to look at it from his view: I can't afford \nto take a chance that a weapon of mass destruction would hit America \nagain, only this time it would be a chemical or a biological weapon.\n\n  I believe that is what the President was thinking. He knew that \nSaddam Hussein had chemical weapons, had used them on his own people \nand had kicked the weapons inspectors out in 1998. He had kicked the \nweapons inspectors out. Why would he have done that, was the thinking, \nif he didn't have something to hide?\n  Then there were the intelligence reports. There were the intelligence \nreports that we saw and there were the intelligence reports that the \nPresident\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\nreceived which were at a much higher level than even we were able to \nget. All of that pointed to Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass \ndestruction and the capability to deliver them. So it is a legitimate \ndebate to ask why are we there, but it is not the debate we ought to be \nhaving today.\n  The debate we ought to be having today is what should we do to have \nsuccess in Iraq because success in Iraq and Afghanistan is a part of \nthe war on terror.\n  After 9/11, we didn't treat what happened as a criminal act. In 1993, \nafter the first World Trade Center bombing, that is what America did. \nWe treated it as a criminal act. America didn't know this was the \nbeginning of a war on terror. Then there was Khobar Towers, attacked in \nSaudi Arabia, and 19 American soldiers killed. We treated it as a \ncriminal act. There was the bombing of our embassies, and then there \nwas the USS Cole. We treated those as criminal acts. But America woke \nup on 9/11/2001 and realized, finally, 10 years after the war had \nstarted, that America and our way of life was under attack. This was \nnot a crime, it was the continuation of a war.\n  So we are there now. We are not succeeding. Success would be a \nstabilized Iraq, an Iraq where people can go to the market in security \nand buy food or necessities and visit and have coffee on the street. \nThat is what success in Iraq will be. Success in Iraq will be when they \nhave self-governance. Success in Iraq will be when there are not \nsecurity forces that kill people of a different sect. Success in Iraq \nwill be when they are a stable neighbor in the Middle East and \nterrorists will not be able to get a foothold.\n  We are not succeeding yet. How can we do better? We should be \ndebating how we can do better to succeed. If victory is not the end \nresult, we will have failed our children and grandchildren. So I ask, \nwhat could possibly be the purpose of passing a resolution in what has \nbeen considered the world's most deliberative body that would send \nGeneral Petraeus to take charge of Baghdad and a new strategy and say, \nGeneral Petraeus, we have faith in you but not the mission? That is not \nthe right resolution to pass in this Senate.\n  I hope we can debate that resolution, and I hope we can debate \nagainst those who would send a signal to our troops that we don't have \nfaith in the possibility of success in their mission. I want to debate \na resolution that would say we are not going to send any more troops, \nand even if we need troop protection we are not going to send those \ntroops because Congress is going to take the place of the Commander in \nChief and the generals on the ground.\n  I want to debate a resolution that would cut off funding for our \ntroops in the field. I would like to debate what would happen to our \ntroops who are there now if a signal were sent that we were not going \nto give them the support they needed to do the job they have right now.\n  I very much hope that we will be able to take up the Levin-Warner \nresolution, and I hope we will be able to take up an alternative which \nwill not have amendments because those are not in order. But we must \nhave the ability to exercise a voice that would go in a different \ndirection, that would set benchmarks for what the Iraqi Government must \ndo if they want America to stay and help them become strong and stable \nand free.\n  I want to be able to debate also the McCain-Lieberman resolution \nbecause I think there will be a clear choice. And I hope that we have \nthe opportunity to bring that out to the American people because there \nare consequences of setting a timetable and trying to have some kind of \ngraceful exit strategy that basically says this is too tough for \nAmerica, we just can't take it and, therefore, we are going to walk \naway.\n  How about keeping our commitments, so that our allies and our enemies \nwill know, when they are partners with America or enemies of America, \nwe will stick through thick and thin, arm in arm with our allies and be \nformidable against our enemies? How about having a strategy that says \nwe have not succeeded in the way this has gone, so here is a different \napproach? We expect the Iraqis to stand up now. We are going to help \nyou, but you must lead. You must meet certain benchmarks if you are \ngoing to keep us helping you help yourselves.\n  We want the Iraqi people to succeed because we don't want terrorists \nto takeover Iraq, get the oil revenue and come and deliver their \nweapons of mass destruction to America. That is what we are talking \nabout. That is what is at stake in this war. How we execute our \nresponsibilities as Senators who have the leadership mantle is going to \ndetermine how successful our troops can be.\n  I hope we can have that debate. I hope we can have the debate on the \nLevin-Warner resolution. I hope we can have a debate on the Gregg \nresolution. I hope we can have a debate on the McCain-Lieberman-Lindsey \nGraham resolution because I think it would be the right thing for the \nAmerican people. But don't try to put one resolution on the floor with \nno amendments and call that an opportunity to have a voice. No one \ncould keep a straight face and say that is a fair process.\n  There are 100 Members of the Senate. I do not question one Member's \npatriotism. I do not question the motives of one Member. Everyone has a \nview that we believe is the right way for our country. We ought to be \nable to support resolutions that put forward those views. This is too \nimportant to have a struggle over process keep us from having the \nability to come together and try to reason and pass one good resolution \nor two that would allow us to have a voice in this debate. The world is \ngoing to listen to what we say. I hope we don't send the wrong signal \nto our allies or to our enemies that America cannot stand it when it \ngets tough. America is the beacon of freedom to the world. If we do not \nstand and fight for freedom, who will? America must never step back \nfrom that mantle and that responsibility. Freedom will die everywhere \nif we don't fight and keep it for America and our allies.\n  Let's have that debate. Let's have that debate on whatever differing \nresolutions come forward. I am not afraid to debate the Levin-Warner \nresolution, and I am certainly proud to support the Gregg and the \nMcCain-Lieberman resolutions. I wish to talk more about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am dismayed at where we now stand. \nLast fall, the people of the United States sent a message to the \nPresident of the United States that the current course of his war in \nIraq is deeply misguided and that bold, new solutions are called for. \nThe President failed to listen. Yesterday, the Senate, this historic \ninstitution, was prevented from speaking.\n  What we say in this historic Chamber about our course in Iraq, and \neven more what I hope we will do in this Chamber to correct that \ncourse, are among the most urgent concerns of the community of nations. \nIt matters to millions of Americans who have already raised their \nvoices in concern at a strategy lacking in foresight and cratered with \nflaws. It matters to millions more souls throughout the world whose \nlives, whose hopes, whose futures depend on American leadership and \nauthority.\n  But we are silenced as a Senate, silenced because yesterday, on the \nsingle most important issue facing America today, on the issue that has \ncost more than 3,000 young Americans their lives, tens of thousands \nmore their limbs and livelihoods, and countless families their well-\nbeing--on the issue where this President has squandered so much of our \nnational Treasury and national good will--the Senate was silent. It was \nsilenced by a parliamentary maneuver.\n  The people we represent deserve better from us. As you know, I am new \nto this body, but each time I step through these doors, I bring with me \nthe hopes and expectations of thousands of Rhode Islanders I have heard \nwho know it is time for a new direction in Iraq. Tired of a President \nwho has failed to listen and failed to learn, last November, they \njoined millions of their countrymen and voted for change.\n  Whenever I think of these men and women, I am filled with an enormous \nsense of responsibility. They trusted me to hear their voices and to \nmake sure the Senate hears them too. So I speak today. I share Rhode \nIsland's conviction that it is time for a change of course. Our troops \nand their families\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\nhave made countless sacrifices, and our choices in this Chamber must be \nworthy of them.\n  The situation in Iraq is dire, rife with sectarian conflict that can \nonly be resolved by Iraqi political cooperation, not by American \nmilitary force. A broad consensus has emerged from senior military \ncommanders to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and throughout the \nAmerican people that our best course would be to begin to redeploy \nAmerican troops out of Iraq. Instead, the President has insisted on a \ncostly strategy of escalation that would send more of our soldiers into \nharm's way. I believe that to be a terrible mistake.\n  It is my deeply held conviction that in order to create the best \nenvironment for real change, the President must announce, clearly and \nunequivocally, that the United States plans to redeploy our troops from \nIraq. That announcement would change the dynamic, enhancing our \nnational security position in Iraq, in the Middle East, and throughout \nthe world in three important ways.\n  First, a clear statement of American intent to redeploy forces from \nIraq would eliminate the Iraqi insurgents' case that we are an army of \noccupation. It would eliminate it once and forever. The Iraqi \npopulation's nationalist sentiment would no longer be engaged against \nus. The Iraqi people don't want us there, and a majority of them \nconsequently believe it is acceptable to kill American soldiers. That \nis not an environment in which we can gain likely success.\n  Second, without a buffering American presence, the world community \nwould understand it must face the consequences of the Iraq situation. \nOther nations in the region and elsewhere around the world would be \nmotivated to take a more active role to work together to bring peace \nand stability to the region. Now, for all intents and purposes, we are \nalone.\n  In particular, Arab nations, facing the risk of a pan-Arabic, Sunni-\nShiite conflict igniting in Iraq, must then assume greater \nresponsibility for averting such an outcome. Under current U.S. policy, \nthese Arab countries have little incentive to help calm the conflict or \nreduce the violence. Any incentive they have is buffered by America's \nrole as the peacekeeper and offset by the cost, in so many eyes, of \neven associating with the United States.\n\n  Third, Iran presently gains immensely from fomenting violence in \nIraq. Keeping America bogged down in a civil war in Iraq undermines \ncritical U.S. policy objectives, including the effort to work \neffectively with the international community to address the serious \nthreat posed by Iran's nuclear weapons program. The threat of American \nredeployment changes that calculation for Iran. The advantages Iran \ncurrently enjoys from bogging America down in Iraq would diminish or \nevaporate.\n  Some argue--we hear it right in this Chamber--that to fail to support \nthis President's judgment is to fail to support the troops. Never mind \nthe manifest and repeated flaws in that judgment: Misjudgment on \nweapons of mass destruction; misjudgment on when the mission was \ncompleted; misjudgment on the risks, costs, and demands of occupation; \nmisjudgment on the wisdom of de-Baathification; misjudgment that the \ninsurgency was in its last throes; and now misjudgment on whether there \nis civil war. There has never been a record of error, failure, and \nfalsity similar to it. Now, the unfortunate fact is the President's bad \nmisjudgments and failed diplomacy leave us few good options.\n  Changing the Iraq dynamic can set the stage for an aggressive \ninternational diplomatic effort to restore security in Iraq and combat \nterrorism worldwide. An intense diplomatic effort, with the parties \nthus motivated by the prospect of American redeployment, is our best \nremaining real chance for success. It will also staunch the hemorrhage \nof two critical American assets: Our international standing and our \nnational Treasury--and most importantly, it will bring our troops home.\n  Without such a change in the dynamic, we are likely to remain trapped \nthere, seen by many as more provocative than helpful, a great nation \nensnared. For the safety of our troops, the stability of the region and \nthe security of our Nation, that must not happen.\n  The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. It undermines our \nnational security by hurting our troops and their families, by \ndiverting our attention from al-Qaida and other critical threats, and \nby degrading our military capability for other actions. The Iraq \nquagmire demands a new strategy that is both bold and realistic. If we \nlead boldly, sensitively, and firmly on the diplomatic front, if we \nspeak, again, in realities instead of slogans, if we build consensus \ninstead of polarizing nations, we can restore America's prestige, \nleadership, and good will. The President's escalation does not help \nachieve these goals, and yesterday the Senate had the opportunity to \nsay so. We did not. We were silenced--silenced by parliamentary \nmaneuver.\n\n  The Senate has been called the world's greatest deliberative body. \nLet us deliberate. The debate over our course in Iraq echoes all over \nthe world, from world capitals to the kitchen tables of middle \nAmerica--everywhere except this silenced Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nto stop the stalling and allow this body to deliberate. Ultimately, the \nfree and unfettered clash of ideas that a real Senate debate represents \nis exactly what our troops in Iraq are fighting for.\n  Let us, in this historic Chamber, not undermine their sacrifice with \nour silence.\n  For my part, it remains my view that announcing our intent to bring \nour soldiers home will help us start down the long road toward renewed \nAmerican strength and leadership in the region and in the world. It is \na critical journey, and it is long past time to begin.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1615-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1615-S1617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SOURCES OF ENERGY IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, every time a President gives a State of \nthe Union message, there are a lot of people who praise it, there are a \nlot of people who disagree with it. One of the areas where there was \nsome agreement--but also a lot of disagreement--was on the energy \npackage the President suggested in his State of the Union message. \nSince I come from a State that is No. 1 in almost all of the \nalternative energies such as biodiesel, such as wind--we are third in \nwind energy, we are first in biodiesel, we are first in ethanol \nproduction--I would like to set the record straight and encourage \npeople to see that a lot of good has been accomplished over the last \nseveral years and that we ought to forget a lot of disagreeing rhetoric \nand move on and even enhance what we have already done. So I am here to \naddress an issue President Bush mentioned in his State of the Union \nmessage and an issue that those particularly on the other side of the \naisle have been quick to criticize.\n  In the President's speech to the Nation, he once again highlighted \nthe need for the United States to reduce our dependence upon foreign \noil. This has been something that Presidents have been stating on a \nvery regular basis, both Republican and Democratic, going back to 1973, \nwhen President Nixon gave a speech, during the first energy crisis, \nspeaking about energy independence. Of course, President Nixon was \nsaying we can do it by 1980. I don't know why he picked that date, but \nactually we are much more dependent upon foreign sources now than we \nwere even in 1980 because of the consumption of the United States and \nthe standard of living we have. People want to be free to drive their \ncar wherever they want to drive it as long as they want to. Whether it \nis a big car or little car, it is freedom in America to do it, so we \nbecome more dependent. But also along the lines of alternative energy, \nwe have made tremendous progress.\n  So President Bush did not do anything that Presidents probably \nhaven't been doing for the last 34 years, in saying we need to move \ntoward energy independence, but what they mean is less dependence upon \nforeign sources and less dependence upon petroleum. Because I would be \nmisleading my colleagues, I would be misleading my constituents if I \nsaid we have the capability--at least I don't know that we have the \ncapability--of being totally independent of foreign sources of energy, \nbut we surely have the capability\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\nof being less dependent upon foreign sources of energy, and we have the \ncapability of being less dependent upon petroleum as a basis of our \nenergy.\n  So the critics, though, it seems, have been quick to point out that \nthe President has mentioned our dangerous dependence on foreign oil in \nseven straight addresses to the Congress. That is why I pointed out \nthat every President since President Nixon has been talking about this \nissue. So it is not just President Bush who has been mentioning it and, \npresumably and impliedly, not doing anything about it. I wish to remind \nmy colleagues he has also talked about the value of domestic, \nhomegrown, renewable sources. But at the same time, there has been \ncriticism that he has done little to actually support the growth of \nalternative energy. I say my colleagues are wrong.\n  I am going to quote Senators, but I am not going to mention their \nnames because I am not here to embarrass anybody; I am here to try to \nget people to be responsible. I do wish to refer to these as all \nMembers of the Democratic Party, but I am not going to mention their \nnames. One Democratic Senator stated after the President's speech last \nweek:\n\n       The President acknowledged the need to develop alternative \n     energy, but he did not offer a real plan to put us on the \n     path to energy independence.\n\n  Now, I am going to show my colleagues how the President has been very \nmuch involved in this.\n  Another Democratic Senator stated:\n\n       So many of us believe that though the President continues \n     to refer to the problem--\n\n  Meaning the problem of not being energy independent enough--\n\n     he has never quite moved us--\n\n  Never quite moved us--\n\n     as we would like in the direction of a solution. We did \n     little or nothing in Washington to address the addiction.\n\n  Maybe he hasn't addressed the addiction, but because there is an \naddiction, he has tried to make us less dependent upon a petroleum \naddiction, as opposed to an energy addiction.\n  Finally--and I could go on and quote many more, but I will stop at \nthe third one--one more Democratic Senator commented:\n\n       We have waited 6 long years for the aggressive new \n     incentives needed to really get our biofuels industries off \n     the ground and break America's oil addiction.\n\n  Of all the statements I have quoted, it seems to me that is the one \nthat is flatout intellectually dishonest, as I am going to give some \nfacts here. The facts would suggest otherwise. The fact is the ethanol \nindustry is growing at the fastest pace in its history. There are over \n110 ethanol facilities operated across the country. These plants have \nthe capacity to produce 5.3 billion gallons of ethanol annually. I said \n110--110 ethanol facilities. We only have 170 petroleum refineries to \nmake gasoline and fuel oil in this country. So I think we are \ndeveloping an industry.\n\n  Here my colleagues can see the States that are darker, where the \nethanol industry is being located. Iowa is No. 1, my State is No. 1 in \nthe production of ethanol, but it is rapidly expanding. I still \nremember 3 or 4 years ago, or maybe it has only been 2 years ago now, \nwhen we had Members from this State and Members from this State who \nwould stand up here and offer amendments against ethanol, and it wasn't \nlong that once we got into the point where everybody realized they had \nto use ethanol, we had Members from this State and we had Members from \nthis State saying to Senator Harkin and me: Why don't you get us more \nethanol, as an example. So people are becoming more ethanol friendly, \nbut it seems you have to take them dragging and screaming into the new \nworld of alternative energy.\n  So we have a developing industry. Twenty-three States currently have \nethanol plants in operation or under construction. Today, there is some \nlevel of ethanol blended in more than 46 percent of our Nation's fuel. \nIn my State, that would be about 80 percent. In Minnesota, I will bet \nit is more because Minnesota has a State mandate. I have been \nembarrassed because when the Republicans controlled the State \nlegislature and I went to them and said we ought to be doing what \nMinnesota is smart enough to do, I had Republican legislators tell me: \nGrassley, go back to Washington and stick to your own business. But I \ntold them how I fought for the ethanol industry and alternative fuel \nand for the agricultural industry because that is where the source of \nthe energy comes from, from the family farmers of America, and I told \nthem it was embarrassing to me to fight big oil here while they were \nkowtowing to big oil back in Des Moines.\n  Well, anyway, I think things are going to be moving along. We have a \nDemocratic Governor who wants to do more with the biofuel industry in \nmy State, and I think we are going to make some progress. We may not \nhave a mandate, but we may not need a mandate now.\n  I wish to talk about where we are located. Now, according to the \nRenewable Fuels Association, the ethanol produced in 2006 resulted in \nthe reduction of oil imports by 170 million barrels of oil, with a \nvalue of $11.2 billion. Remember, $11.2 billion being spent on ethanol \nthat is not going to the Middle East to produce a profit for the oil \nbarons over there who shoot bullets at our soldiers as we are trying to \ntake on the war on terrorism.\n  Now, I say to the critics on the other side--the other side chooses, \nas evidenced by the earlier statements I quoted of Democratic \nSenators--to ignore this data when they discuss the energy track record \nof President Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress in past years.\n  I was cynical when there was a Governor Bush running for President \nand coming to Iowa to campaign saying he would be for anything but big \noil. So I had the opportunity in January of 2000, when we have our \ncaucuses in the coldest time of the year, to be in a minivan with \nPresident Bush, as a candidate for the Republican caucuses at that \ntime, to ride with him for 2 or 3 days. I thought, what a wonderful \nopportunity to be in a small car with a Governor who might be President \nof the United States, to teach him about the facts of ethanol. It \ndidn't take me very long because he came back--and you never remember \nthe exact quotes because I didn't write this stuff down. But I remember \nhim saying something along the effect of: Well, it is just common \nsense. We only have so much petroleum. We have to start relying on \nethanol to a greater extent. I guess I believed him then, but maybe I \nhad some question marks. So we went on for 2 or 3 days, and there \nwasn't anything in those 2 or 3 days to change my mind. But you wonder: \nyou say one thing as a candidate; you might perform another thing as an \nofficeholder. But I found back in 2000 that the President was a friend \nof ethanol when he told me about it, and he has performed that way in \noffice. So I am satisfied that this President is coming from where he \nstarted and albeit from a State where oil is big business and where you \nwouldn't expect him to be for it, but he has been a friend, as he \nindicated to me privately he was going to be. I think this President \nhas done well for alternative fuel. So I don't think the criticism of \nhim is legitimate.\n  The fact is that when President Clinton left office in 2000, our \nfarmers were only producing 1.6 billions of gallons of ethanol. Now, I \nam not saying President Clinton was not friendly to ethanol. He was \nfriendly to ethanol. But I think there are degrees of friendliness. But \nfor the people on the other side of the aisle who tend to be \ncriticizing this President, I want them to see where we have come since \nthis President took office. During the 8 years of the Clinton \npresidency, domestic ethanol production grew 33 percent, as my \ncolleagues can see here. Now, when we compare that to what it is since \nPresident Bush came to office in January 2001, the domestic ethanol \nindustry is producing 1.7 billion gallons annually. That grew to 4.9 \ngallons last year. When President Bush leaves office--this chart is \nsomewhat of an estimate, but we think it is on target because the \nplants are coming online and ethanol is catching on and the need for \nethanol is very real--we think this will grow to 10 billion gallons. \nThat is a 488-percent increase during this period of time compared to a \n33-percent increase.\n\n  I am not belittling President Clinton's efforts, but I think people \non the other side of the aisle ought to take into consideration when \nthey are raising a question about whether we have done enough in recent \nyears about alternative energy these facts and this growth and not \nbelittle this growth that seems to me is going on. This growth is no \naccident.\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\n  In fact, a key turning point took place in March of 2001 when \nPresident Bush took a courageous step that President Clinton should \nhave taken but did not take during the last year of his Presidency. In \n1999, the big State of California, with a tremendous consumption of \nfuel for automobiles and energy--generally, the State of California, at \nthat time, was deciding to ban the competitor to ethanol as an octane \nenhancer that is known by the acronym MTBE. It stands for methyl \ntertiary-butyl ether. It was found to contaminate ground water.\n  Obviously, California had to quit using it, but they did not want to \nsubstitute ethanol. According to the 1990 Clean Air Act, they had to \nsubstitute ethanol without a waiver by the President or Congress. They \nwere asking for that waiver. It did not happen, so we did not know \nwhere the ethanol industry sat versus the MTBE, so ethanol did not \nbenefit the way it could have if President Clinton had made a decision.\n  California Governor Gray Davis did not want his citizens to have to \nuse ethanol--which the 1990 law required--and he petitioned Clinton for \nthat waiver. While many of my colleagues and I lobbied President \nClinton to deny the waiver, he took no action. When President Clinton \nhad the opportunity to demonstrate his confidence in our Nation's \nfarmers and ranchers to produce this clean renewable alternative \nenergy, President Clinton was nowhere to be found.\n  That changed when Governor George Bush was elected President. Less \nthan 90 days into his term as President, George Bush denied the waiver \nwhich put the ethanol industry firmly on a path to growth because \nCalifornia uses so much energy.\n  Along the way, Congress considered and enacted a number of incentives \nand supportive policies to foster the development of this important \nindustry. In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy \nPolicy Act which included the renewable fuels standard, or RFS, for \nshort. This provision was a culmination of the work of dozens of \nSenators during a period that spanned three Congresses. It has also \nbeen key to the growth of the domestic ethanol industry.\n  The effort to enact a strong renewable fuels standard was bipartisan, \nbut it was approved by the majority Republican Congress with the help \nof President Bush.\n  During the consideration of the Energy Policy Act, President Bush \nasked Congress for a bill that would help diversify the U.S. away from \ncrude oil. He put his public support behind the renewable fuels \nstandard to require the use of ethanol and/or biodiesel. The President \nsupported our efforts toward a renewable fuels standard because he \nrecognized that increasing our use of ethanol and biodiesel would \ncreate new markets for farm products and increase our energy security.\n  During the consideration by the Senate during this period of time--\nand I referred to this a little bit before--no fewer than 11 amendments \nwere offered by Members of the other side of the aisle to delay, \nreduce, or render useless the renewable fuels standard which had broad \nbipartisan support, particularly from those from the Midwest. It was \nnot the Republicans offering these amendments to kill the growth of the \ndomestic renewable fuels market. It was members of the other side, some \nof whom are the same ones who may be criticizing the President today \nfor not doing enough to decrease dependence upon foreign oil.\n  Perhaps more ironic is that a strong renewable fuels standard could \nhave been enacted earlier than 2005. In November 2003, an Energy bill \nconference report came to the Senate with a renewable fuels standard \nbut ran into a filibuster in the Senate. Had there not been a \nDemocratic-led filibuster, what the President signed in August of 2005 \nwould have been signed in November 2003. We would have been 2 years \nahead of the game.\n  In addition to the renewable fuels standard, other provisions enacted \nin the past 6 years have perhaps done even more to spur the growth of \nthe renewable fuels, particularly ethanol and particularly biodiesel. \nIn 2004, Congress enacted the American Jobs Creation Act. This \nlegislation included modification and extension of the ethanol tax \nincentive. While improving the incentive, it also extended it through \n2010.\n  In the Energy Policy Act, which the President signed in August of \n2005, Congress expanded the incentive for small ethanol producers and \ncreated a new credit for small producers of biodiesel. Most recently, \nCongress extended the tariff on imported ethanol through the year 2008. \nThe tariff ensures that U.S. taxpayers are not subsidizing foreign \nethanol and that we continue to grow our domestic production of \nethanol.\n  As a result of the tax incentives, the ethanol import tariff and the \nrenewable fuels standard, the domestic renewable fuels industry, is \ngrowing faster than anyone could have ever imagined. The policies put \nin place by the Congress when Republicans controlled it, with the \nsupport and assistance of President Bush, have put this industry on a \npath of extraordinary growth. We have recognized that renewable fuels, \nsuch as ethanol and biodiesel, improve air quality, strengthen national \nsecurity, reduce the trade deficit, decrease dependence upon the \nvolatile Middle East for oil, expand markets for agricultural products, \nincrease income for farmers, and create good-paying jobs in rural \nAmerica.\n  In other words, it is as the Campbell's soup advertisement of 25 \nyears ago: everything about ethanol is good, good, good.\n  The fact is, President Bush has been the most prorenewable fuels \nPresident our country has ever had. I stated earlier when he was a \ncandidate for President coming from big oil Texas and being Governor of \nthat State, would I expect him to be a renewable fuels person in the \nfuture? No, because I have been dealing with big oil and fighting them \nversus ethanol for a long period of time. It is only within the last 3 \nor 4 years that we had the freedom of not having to fight big oil. Who \nknows, maybe today we will have to fight big oil again when it comes to \nsome ethanol products for the future, but there has been a lull. I \nthank President Bush for keeping his word to the people when he \npromised to be prorenewable fuels.\n\n  Getting back to those who claim the renewable fuels industry has \nlacked attention from President Bush and previous Republican \nCongresses, I leave with one final point. In the year 2000, the final \nyear of the Clinton administration, we produced 1.6 billion gallons of \nethanol. That is nothing negative about President Clinton. He seemed to \nbe, for the most part, very ethanol friendly. But you cannot criticize \nthis President when we have this figure: By the time he leaves office \nin 2008, we will be producing 10 billion gallons. The policy supported \nby the Republican Congress led to this growth.\n  I have proven that I don't want to sit by quietly while the other \nside tries to say otherwise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been periodically tuning in today \nduring committee hearings and other work we do around here on some of \nthe debate surrounding whether we are going to have a debate on Iraq. \nIt is hard for the average American out there who may be watching C-\nSPAN to understand whether there is any sanity in this place, whether \nwe are really rational individuals running the Senate.\n  This is supposed to be the most deliberative body, as we keep calling \nourselves, in the world. The function of the Senate is to debate and to \ndiscuss, sometimes ad nauseam, different measures. Sometimes we can \ndebate for a long time around here. People in this country wonder what \nis happening here that the Republicans won't even allow debate on the \nmost important single issue confronting America today: the war in Iraq \nand the escalation.\n  I make it clear from the outset to those who may be watching, to try \nto clear it up as much as possible, the Republicans, through \nparliamentary maneuvers and through their vote yesterday, will not even \nallow the Senate to\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\ndebate Iraq. I can talk on it if I want to. Of course, I can. But they \nwill not allow us to go to a debate on the Warner resolution, which has \nvery strong bipartisan support, and has a majority of the votes in the \nSenate.\n  We are faced with an unusual situation which I don't know has ever \noccurred here before. A matter which is life and death for so many of \nour young men and women--disrupting families, causing untold drain on \nour Federal Treasury, not just now but for years in the future, causing \nus to lose friends and allies around the world--and we can't even \ndebate it. But that is the situation in which we find ourselves.\n  I can tell you, over the last few weeks I have had thousands contact \nmy office through e-mails and phone calls. I must say, the vast \nmajority, the overwhelming majority, oppose the President's escalation \nand the war in Iraq.\n  Over the last 24 hours, since yesterday, much of their anger and \nfocus has been not so much on the President and his misguided policies \nbut on the Republicans in the Senate who won't allow Members to debate \nthe issue. As one said, we debate this in our workplace, we debate it \nin the parking lot, we debate it after church on Sunday, we debate it \nwith our neighbors, in our clubs, at the bowling alleys, but you guys \ncan't debate it in the Senate? They just cannot believe that Republican \nSenators are blocking debate on the No. 1 issue before our Nation.\n\n  In a nutshell, what callers are saying to my office is that Senators \nhave a right if they want to support the President's position on the \nwar in Iraq. They have a right to embrace his escalation of the war, \nbut they do not have a right to block legitimate debate in the Senate \non whether the escalation is wise or appropriate. They do not have the \nright to silence the voices of tens of millions of Americans who have \nhad enough of our quagmire in Iraq.\n  People in Iowa, and I suspect across the country, are saying the \nelection last November was a referendum on the war. Voters spoke loudly \nand clearly; they want our troops out of the civil war in Iraq. I \nimagine the American people probably thought their elected leaders in \nWashington got the message. Well, maybe they see now that the \nRepublican minority in the Senate does not even care about what \nhappened in the election. They want to escalate the war. But that is \nfine. If that is their choice, that is their choice. But what should \nnot be their choice is to silence debate by a majority of Senators who \noppose the escalation in Iraq.\n  I think this is what got people so upset and are calling and e-\nmailing my office. People in this country, in times of crisis such as \nthis, are always way ahead of the politicians. They know that by voting \nagainst debating the war, the Republican Senators have voted to endorse \nPresident Bush's escalation of that war.\n  It is one thing for Republican Senators to ignore the Iraq Study \nGroup's recommendations. It is one thing for Republican Senators to \nignore the results of the November election. It is one thing for them \nto ignore all the warnings of the generals last year. But what is \nunacceptable is that Republicans in the Senate refuse to listen to the \nfamilies of soldiers who are being asked to put their lives on the line \nfor this last and reckless roll of the dice in Iraq.\n  Among those being committed to the escalation are more than 600 \nsoldiers from the Iowa Army National Guard. Many of them are from the \n1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry headquartered in Waterloo, IA. \nOther units are from Dubuque, Iowa Falls, Charles City, and Oelwein. \nThese soldiers have been deployed since early last year in Anbar \nProvince, the most violent region in Iraq.\n  These soldiers were supposed to come home in the spring. But just 1 \nday after the President announced his escalation, they learned they \nwould not be coming home. Instead, their combat tour in Iraq would be \nextended to 16 months. Think about that--nearly a year and a half in \nthe middle of some of the most deadly combat in Iraq. To make matters \nworse, as we now know, many of the soldiers and their families learned \nabout it through the media before they were officially notified.\n  I want to make it clear, I know some of these members of the Iowa \nArmy National Guard. They are disciplined professionals. Even those who \nI know profoundly disagree with this escalation, I know they will do \ntheir duty. And they are doing their duty in Iraq. They deserve our \nprofound respect and admiration. But they deserve to be listened to. \nAnd their families deserve to be listened to.\n  From the letters, e-mails, and phone calls I have gotten, people are \noutraged that Republicans are not allowing the Senate to even debate \nthe escalation.\n  We got some e-mails in, and I started reading some of them. I asked \nmy staff to contact them to see if I could read them on the Senate \nfloor. I would not want to read an e-mail on the floor unless I had \npermission from the sender.\n  So I have three letters I am going to read because they are so \nprofound. One is from Barbara--I will not use the last name--in Iowa \nwhose husband is with the 133rd Infantry. This is what she writes:\n\n       Senator Harkin: I sit here to write this letter, not \n     knowing why since I'm feeling like no one cares anymore or \n     will be able to do anything about it. I am a 41 year old \n     woman, (as of today), a military wife of 23 years and a \n     mother of 3. My husband is a proud member of the 1-133rd \n     Infantry. This unit was called up to serve in the Sinai for 9 \n     months from April 2003 until January of 2004. Just a short 18 \n     months later they were ripped away from their families once \n     again to be a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. They are \n     currently serving in Iraq and have been gone for 16 months so \n     far on this mission. The soldiers and the families have \n     finally been feeling like we were seeing the light at the end \n     of the tunnel. As the new year began we all started our \n     countdown for our reunions expected for the first part of \n     April. Three days ago, our worlds came crashing down once \n     again as we learned that our loved ones would not be coming \n     home in April, but were being extended until August, thus \n     being deployed for almost 2 years by the time they return. I \n     am angry, I am devastated! How could this happen? How could \n     you let this happen? How could this be right? I have lost all \n     hope and faith in our government. I don't understand much \n     about politics so my biggest question is if so many people \n     are against this war and the increase of troops being sent \n     over then why is the president not listening? Doesn't he \n     care? I voted for him and believed in him and he has let me \n     down. I attended a meeting that was to discuss this extension \n     and we were told some good things were happening for the \n     future for the guards. Limited times of 12 months being \n     deployed and 5 years in between call ups. Even though I am so \n     happy for these changes for the future, you have to \n     understand that 700 families are devastated right now, \n     feeling left out, and not cared for because this doesn't help \n     our soldiers or us right now. Please, please think about the \n     effects this is having on our soldiers and their families. We \n     all have given so much and though we are proud to have been \n     part of serving our country, it's time for our soldiers to \n     come home. Please bring them home.\n       Sincerely,\n       Barbara\n\n  The next letter is from Jodi in Iowa. She said:\n\n       I have a 20 year old son who has put his life on hold for \n     the past 18 months. He left after only two weeks of his \n     freshman year of college. He deployed to Iraq last April and \n     was due to come home in three months. Now we are told he is \n     to stay another 4 months. I have seen no progress in the \n     Iraqi war and can not justify my son losing another 4 months \n     of his life. I feel it is the lower and middle class people \n     who are providing the men and women who are fighting this \n     war. How many of your fellow congressmen have sons, \n     daughters, husbands, wives, nieces or nephews serving in this \n     war? I have a son, a nephew and a niece in Iraq. They joined \n     the Guard for money so they could attend college, not \n     because they were eager to go to war. They were assured \n     when they signed up that they would not need to worry \n     about being deployed. They do not want nor do we want them \n     to stay longer than what they were told when they left \n     last April. Please help bring my son home. He has served \n     his time and his country and served it well.\n       Sincerely,\n       Jodi\n\n  Last, I will read a letter from Nikole:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin:\n       I write to you as the wife of a soldier in the 1-133. My \n     husband, SSG Nicholas . . . , has been stationed in Iraq \n     since the end of March 2006. He also trained at Camp Shelby, \n     Mississippi for five months prior. He was to come home at the \n     beginning of April; however, he has now been extended for an \n     additional four months.\n       My husband and I have been married for almost six years. He \n     was in the US Army when we married and then joined the Iowa \n     National Guard after exiting the service to continue to serve \n     his country. My husband is 27 years old. He has served eight \n     years in the military. Before his deployment he was a junior \n     at Iowa State University majoring in Community Regional \n     Planning and had plans to attend graduate school.\n       Our lives have been put on hold during this deployment. We \n     both went into the deployment knowing that it would be \n     difficult, but\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\n     we knew that our love would allow us to make it through. Our \n     motivation was the ability to secure our future with \n     financial freedom.\n\n  Think about that: ``Our motivation was the ability to secure our \nfuture with financial freedom.''\n\n       We planned to purchase our first house with the money that \n     we saved.\n       During his two-week leave in September, we began building a \n     new home. The house was to be finished in February. This \n     would allow me time to move in and decorate just in time for \n     his return. It was PERFECT timing. We would be able to pick \n     up our lives and move on.\n       As you can imagine, we were both extremely disappointed to \n     hear the news that he would be extended for an additional \n     four months, already a longer time than any other unit \n     deployed to Iraq.\n       I have not only lost my husband. I have lost my very best \n     friend, my lover, my confident, my motivation and inspiration \n     for life, that one person that knows and understands me the \n     most. I am sure you can relate to someone in your own life.\n\n  Sure, my wife.\n\n       Now imagine that person being torn away from you for two \n     years and place them in harm's way in a war zone. I act tough \n     to my husband so that he will have one less thing to worry \n     about. However, it IS an act. I miss him. I need him. I am \n     falling apart.\n       My intention is not to be rude, complain, and say nasty \n     comments. I am sure that you receive enough of those types of \n     letters. I just pray that our story can give you a glimpse \n     into our lives and the effect of the situation. I also pray \n     that by hearing a personal story you will reconsider and \n     allow the 1-133 to return home to their families, their \n     children, their jobs, and continue their lives as American \n     citizens.\n       Sincerely,\n       Nikole\n\n  Mr. President, I took the time to read those three letters. If we do \nnot speak for these families, who will? If we are not allowed to debate \nhere, are their voices to be silenced? They do not have the right to \ncome here on the Senate floor and speak. I have the right to read their \nletters, with their permission, but why can't we debate this and speak \non behalf of them and so many other families in this country who want \ntheir stories told and who want an end to this quagmire in Iraq?\n  They now know--people are so far ahead of us; they are so far ahead \nof the politicians around here--they know what is happening. They know \nthat Iraq was a lie; it was a mistake. They know there was never any \nweapons of mass destruction. They know now that Saddam Hussein, however \nbad he was, was not involved in acts of terrorism against the United \nStates--against his own people but not against the United States.\n  They now know that what is happening in Iraq is a civil war. As I was \ntold some years ago by a person from the Emirates--close to there--he \nsaid to me: Senator, you have to understand that Iraq was really three \ncountries. It is just a figment of the British imagination that they \nput it together in the Treaty of Versailles after the First World War. \nHe said: Really it is three countries, the Shias, the Sunnis, and the \nKurds. He said: Furthermore, Senator, it is a civil war waiting to \nhappen, and there is nothing you can do about it.\n  Yes, maybe someone as ruthless as Saddam could put the lid on it for \na while. And we would hope they would come to their senses and not have \na civil war. They have had an election. They have a parliament. And now \nit is time for the Iraqis to take matters into their own hands. The \nlonger we are there, the more involved we become, the more it becomes \nAmerica's war against the Iraqis.\n  I read the article in the Washington Post this morning about how our \ntroops are now going door-to-door in Iraq, and they just bust in. They \nbusted into the home of a woman who had a master's degree in English \ntranslation, whose husband was a major in the Iraqi Army. And she said: \nWhy didn't you just have the courtesy to knock? I would have let you \nin.\n  These soldiers are going into homes. They are going into bedrooms and \nlooking under beds, tearing sheets off the beds, looking through \ndressers of people who have nothing to do with the war. These are just \ncivilians and they happen to be caught in a zone.\n  You wonder how they feel about us after something like that happens. \nOne soldier was quoted in the paper this morning talking about his \nfirst tour of Iraq right after the invasion. He said: Things were fine. \nWe went out with the Iraqi people. Now I go over there and they spit at \nus, every one of them.\n  So the people of this country understand that this war was a terrible \nmistake from the beginning. It has been not only a mistake and a lie to \nget into it, it has been mismanaged from the very beginning. It has \ncost over 3,000 of our young men and women's lives. How many Iraqi \nlives? I am told the count is now way over 50,000, maybe as high as \n100,000, with millions more displaced from their homes, going into \nJordan. That is going to cause a lot of unrest in Jordan with all the \ndisplaced people and refugees there.\n  The answer is not to continue this miserable escalation the President \nwants to do. Everyone realizes this won't do it. It is just going to \ncause more misery, more suffering, cost more money, cost more lives.\n  That is the kind of debate we want to have. But Republican Senators \nwill not allow us to have the debate or even to have a vote on the \nresolution of disapproval. We have a duty to debate this escalation, to \nspeak up when we believe the President's policy is wrong. We have a \nduty to speak up for families, such as the ones whose letters I read, \nand for the overwhelming majority of Americans who oppose this new \nescalation. It is unconscionable that Republicans leaders, at the \nbehest of President Bush, are refusing to allow the Senate to debate \nthe escalation in Iraq. It is time for them to listen to the American \npeople and the families of our troops in the field. It is time to stop \nthe obstruction, allow the Senate to debate the Warner resolution, and \nto have a vote. That is all we are asking for. Vote your conscience. If \npeople want to vote to support the escalation, if they want to speak on \nbehalf of it, that is their right as U.S. Senators. But I hope they \ndon't realize they have a right to silence the voices of millions of \nAmericans who are looking to us to do something, to bring some \nreasoning, some rational discourse, and some clear thinking to what is \nhappening in Iraq and to confront the truth.\n  As I said earlier, our young men and women are doing their duty. I \nknow. I have an e-mail I received the other day from a young man in \nIraq who has been there for quite a while. I won't use his name because \nI didn't ask his permission to use the e-mail. He said in his e-mail \nthat he--I am not sure of the word--disagreed with the war. He said: \nThis war is not winnable. The military cannot do this over here. But he \nis doing his job. He is putting himself in harm's way day after day. \nThey realize this is a bad mistake. You think we would start realizing \nit around here, too.\n  War is not the answer in Iraq. Diplomacy is, bringing in other \ncountries. Does it mean we have to talk with Iran? I have no problem \nwith that. The President once said he didn't want to talk to Iran \nbecause they were our enemies. I guess all we want to talk to is our \nfriends. If I disagree with someone here, I want to talk to that \nperson. I want to find out why. Is there any way we can reach \nresolution? So we ought to be talking with Syria and Jordan and Iran, \nIraq, of course, Turkey, Syria--all the countries around there. We \nought to be talking to them. And there ought to be a more concerted \neffort on the diplomatic side than there is on the military side. We \nare putting too much on the military and not enough on diplomacy. I \nwould hope the Iraqis would come to their senses and not engage in a \ncivil war, but that is their decision to make. We can't make it for \nthem.\n  The longer we are there, the worse it becomes. The longer we are \nthere, the more and more Iraqis turn against us. More and more people \nin the Mideast turn against us. And more and more we lose our standing \nin the world community. I daresay we have precious few friends around \nthe world today who are willing to stand with us. Prior to this war, \nafter 9/11, the entire world was on our side. After those planes hit \nthe Twin Towers and the one hit the Pentagon and the one went down in \nPennsylvania which was probably coming here, the world was on our side. \nCountries all over the world--Muslim nations were on our side. Even \nIran sent out some feelers to go after the Taliban. They didn't like \nthe Taliban, either. And here we squandered it all, with the whole \nworld on our side 5 years ago. Now we would be hard-pressed to find a \nfew. They may be with us here and there on this or that, but\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\nwe know what they are saying about our involvement in Iraq. We know \nwhat they are saying about our standing in the world community. We know \nthat. It is going to take a long time to rebuild it. The longer we \npersist in this unconscionable, unwinnable quagmire war in Iraq, the \nlonger it is going to take us to get our standing back in the word \ncommunity. Try we must. We need to bring this war to its conclusion.\n  It is not losing the war. People say: We can't lose it. I wasn't in \nthe Senate, but I was in the House of Representatives when the Vietnam \nwar finally came to a close. We heard the same arguments then, that we \ncan't afford to lose, that the whole of Southeast Asia would be in \nflames, communism would take over the Philippines, communism would take \nover Indonesia. We heard it time after time. Guess what. None of it \nhappened. And you look back now and you go down here to the Vietnam \nMemorial wall and you read those names and you think about their \nsacrifice, families that were left behind, children, loved ones. You \nwonder what for. What for? They served their country proudly. They did \ntheir duty. But you wonder in the end, what was it for?\n\n  I think, as we look back on this war in Iraq years from now, the \nthousands of Americans who have lost their lives, we will ask that same \nquestion: What for? Why? War is not the answer. Escalation is not the \nanswer. We need to bring our troops home.\n  Those on the other side are saying we ought to talk about cutting off \nfunding. That is going to come. We are going to have a supplemental \nappropriations bill. It will be here probably in the next couple \nmonths. I, for one, am going to do everything I can to make sure we \nhave some kind of amendment on that bill which will limit the \nPresident's ability to spend the taxpayers' money on the war in Iraq. \nAfter all, the Constitution gives us the power of the purse strings, \nnot the President. If we want to say: Mr. President, you can spend the \nmoney to redeploy troops out of Iraq and to protect them while they are \nbeing deployed, you can do that, but you can't spend any of that money \nto send any more troops there and put them in harm's way and have them \ngoing door to door in Baghdad and have them be shot at by snipers, we \nwill have that opportunity when the supplemental appropriations bill \ncomes before us.\n  Right now is time for us as a Senate to stand up and say whether we \napprove of the escalation or disapprove. Republican Senators on the \nother side of the aisle won't even give us that opportunity. I hope \nthey hear from more families like the letters I just read. Maybe we \nwill get that opportunity. It is time for us to quit shirking our \nresponsibility, time for us to stand up and say whether we are for the \nescalation. I, for one, am not. Maybe others are for it. I think that \nis what we ought to debate, and that is what we ought to vote on.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1620-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      First Lieutenant Jacob Fritz\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof U.S. Army 1LT Jacob Fritz of Nebraska. Lieutenant Fritz was killed \nnear Karbala, Iraq on January 20. He was 25 years old.\n  Lieutenant Fritz was raised on his family's farm near Verdon, NE. \nFrom a young age, Lieutenant Fritz knew he wanted to be a leader. After \ngraduating from Dawson-Verdon High School in 2000, he followed through \non this goal. I had the honor of nominating Lieutenant Fritz to the \nU.S. Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from the Academy in \n2005. His brother, Daniel Fritz, 22, followed in his footsteps and is \ncurrently in his third year at West Point. Like his brother Jake, I had \nthe privilege of nominating Dan to West Point.\n  Lieutenant Fritz was leading a unit of more than 30 soldiers in Iraq \nsince October. Lieutenant Fritz described his mission as a liaison \nbetween Iraqi police and the U.S. Army. He said the work was \nchallenging, but rewarding.\n  Lieutenant Fritz was buried on January 31 with full military honors \nin a church cemetery 4 miles from his family home near Verdon, NE. \nFamily and friends paid their final respects in a moving service that \nreminded all of the courage, commitment, and sacrifice of soldiers like \nLieutenant Fritz. As his childhood friend Air Force 1LT Brett Cooper \nremembered, a life of service to his country followed by a retirement \nto the small town life that he loved was all that Lieutenant Fritz \nwanted. We're proud of Lieutenant Fritz's service to our country as \nwell as the service of thousands of brave Americans who are currently \nserving in Iraq.\n  In addition to his brother Dan, Lieutenant Fritz is survived by his \nparents Lyle and Noala and his younger brother Ethan.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring 1LT \nJacob Fritz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1620-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1620-S1621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    RECOGNITION OF G. MARTIN WAGNER\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I honor G. Martin Wagner--\na dedicated public servant who, on January 31, 2007, retired from \nFederal service after 31 years.\n  Marty Wagner has had an exemplary career working for the Federal \nGovernment. Far removed from the apocryphal ``faceless bureaucrat'' \nthat so many of those who wrongly belittle our Federal workforce often \nrefer to, Marty should serve as an example to us all in how to best \nserve the people of this great country. Marty was a leader and a doer \nwho accomplished much over the past three decades, and leaves the \nFederal Government a far better place than how he found it.\n  Over his 31 years in the Federal civil service, Marty earned many \nhonors and awards for his efforts to make the Federal Government a \nbetter place to work for all Federal employees. His service has also \nresulted in a Federal Government that is more caring and responsive to \nthe needs of the American public.\n  Marty grew up in Tucson, AZ. In his youth, he played guitar and sang \nfolk songs in old time ``hootenannies.'' He has a deep, recognizable \nvoice, which would have served him well as a professional musician or \nradio persona. Fortunately for us, his career took a different path and \nMarty became a dedicated, hard-working Federal employee--serving in a \nnumber of agencies and departments over the past 31 years.\n  Most of us who know and have worked with Mr. Wagner over the years, \nassociate him with his almost two decades of service with the General \nServices Administration, GSA, where he has been an innovative leader \nand promoter of initiatives for improved and more accessible \ninformation technology for Federal workers and the public alike. Most \nrecently, Marty has served as Deputy Commissioner of the new Federal \nAcquisition Service, FAS. Prior to accepting this position, Mary also \nserved as Acting Commissioner and Acting Deputy Commissioner of FAS. \nHowever, Marty was also a leader before his days at GSA, and I call to \nmy colleagues attention just one of his major accomplishments over his \nFederal career.\n  Early on, Marty was an economic analyst at the Environmental \nProtection Agency. His outstanding work in the environmental arena \nproved to be invaluable to the quality of the air we breathe. In \naddressing the economic impact of pending EPA regulations, Marty was \ninstrumental in producing the findings that resulted in the first \nrequirement to remove lead from gasoline. I believe Marty could have \nretired at this point and have served his country well but, \nfortunately, this was just the first step in a long and distinguished \ncareer with the Federal Government.\n  G. Martin Wagner was a masterful manager and leader of innovative \nchange within the Federal Government. The results of his untiring \nefforts over the past 30 years are evident in numerous Federal \nprograms, resulting in a much more effective and efficient Federal \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\n  Throughout his career, Deputy Commissioner Wagner has been a leader \nfor positive change and modernization. When you worked with Marty you \nknew where you stood and that his positions were based upon his strong \npersonal beliefs in how best to serve the American public and the \nFederal employees that he managed and with whom he worked. He is an \nhonest, straightforward individual who did not shy away from challenges \nand difficult issues but, rather, sought the middle ground of \ncompromise while always championing progress and better service.\n  From his work on implementing the gargantuan task of modernizing \nFederal telecommunications to his personal crusade of making sure each \nand every Federal worker was treated with respect and provided \nopportunities for advancement, Marty Wagner has always proved to be a \ncapable and innovative leader. When we think of a government that is \nmore efficient and effective, we need to pay our thanks to the good \nwork of Deputy Commissioner Wagner.\n  I am sure that Marty's retirement from the Federal Government will \nnot be the last we hear of him. Such an active, well-rounded, \nintelligent individual is not going to just while away the hours but, \nrather, seek out new challenges and opportunities to help his country \nand fellow citizens.\n  G.

Despite a wound to \nhis side, Beasor stayed with his unit during the duration of the fight \nand was promoted to company commander. Wounded again, he returned to \nhis unit a second time in order to fight against the Nazis in the \nDecember 1944 Battle of the Bulge. It was during this offensive that he \nearned the Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, three Bronze \nStars, and two Purple Hearts. After 27 years of distinguished service \nto the U.S. Army, including time at Fort Jackson, where he trained \nreplacement troops for the Korean War, Beasor retired as a colonel.\n  A graduate of the University of Alabama, Beasor was elected sheriff \nof Tuscaloosa County in 1970. He served as sheriff until 1991, and \nduring his lengthy tenure he was able to greatly improve Tuscaloosa \nCounty. Beasor is responsible for integrating the Sheriff's Department, \nstreamlining the homicide squads, and extensively working to improve \nthe Alabama Boys' and Girls' Ranch. Beasor has been inducted to both \nthe Alabama Military Hall of Honor and the Alabama Law Enforcement Hall \nof Fame.\n  His service to the Nation has been exceptional, and Beasor Walker is \nmore than deserving of this recognition. His sacrifices are appreciated \nand important to the freedom we enjoy every day. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in thanking my friend Beasor Walker for his service to our \nNation and to the State of Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1621-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:29 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 433.

A bill to endorse further enlargement of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization (NATO) and to facilitate the timely admission of \nnew members to NATO, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``NATO \nFreedom Consolidation Act of 2007''. Last year this legislation passed \nthe Senate by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, the House was unable to \nact prior to adjournment last year.\n  I was pleased that thirteen of my colleagues, including Senators \nBiden, Chambliss, Coleman, Dodd, Hagel, Hutchison, Martinez, McCain, \nSmith, and Sununu, joined me in proposing this important legislation.\n  The goal of this bill is to reaffirm United States support for \ncontinued enlargement of NATO to democracies that are able and willing \nto meet the responsibilities of membership. In particular, the \nlegislation calls for the timely admission of Albania, Croatia, \nGeorgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine to NATO and authorizes security \nassistance for these countries in Fiscal Year 2008. Each of these \ncountries has clearly stated its desire to join NATO and is working \nhard to meet the specified requirements for membership.\n  I believe that eventual NATO membership for these five countries \nwould be a success for Europe, NATO, and the United States by \ncontinuing to extend the zone of peace and security. Albania, Croatia, \nand Macedonia have been making progress on reforms through their \nparticipation in the NATO Membership Action Plan since 2002. \nUnfortunately, Georgia and Ukraine have not yet been granted a \nMembership Action Plan but nevertheless have made remarkable progress. \nThis legislation will provide important incentives and assistance to \nthe countries to continue the implementation of democratic, defense, \nand economic reforms.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has been evolving to meet the new \nsecurity needs of the 21st century. In this era, the threats to NATO \nmembers are transnational and far from its geographic borders. There is \nstrong support among members for NATO's operation in Afghanistan, and \nfor its training mission in Iraq. NATO's viability as an effective \ndefense and security alliance depends on flexible, creative leadership, \nas well as the willingness of members to improve capabilities and \naddress common threats.\n  If NATO is to continue to be the preeminent security Alliance and \nserve the defense interests of its membership, it must continue to \nevolve and that evolution must include enlargement. Potential NATO \nmembership motivates emerging democracies to make important advances in \nareas such as the rule of law and civil society. A closer relationship \nwith NATO will promote these values and contribute to our mutual \nsecurity. Georgia is a young democracy that has made tremendous \nprogress since the ``Rose Revolution.'' It is situated in a critical \ngeo-strategic location and is host to a large portion of the Baku-\nTbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline that carries important energy resources to the \nWest from Azerbaijan and, in the future, Kazakhstan. Georgia is \nresisting pressure from breakaway republics backed by Moscow. In the \npast, border disputes have been identified as reasons a country may not \nbe invited to join NATO. But in this case, Russia's action, not \nGeorgia's, are frustrating Tbilisi's NATO aspirations.\n  Three years ago, the United States Senate unanimously voted to invite \nseven countries to join NATO. Today, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia are making significant \ncontributions to NATO and are among our closest allies in the global \nwar on terrorism. It is time again for the United States to take the \nlead in urging its allies to bring in new members, and to offer timely \nadmission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine to NATO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Schumer, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 495. A bill to prevent and mitigate identity theft, to ensure \nprivacy, to provide notice of security breaches, and to enhance \ncriminal penalties, law enforcement assistance, and other protections \nagainst security breaches, fraudulent access, and misuse of personally \nidentifiable information; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Specter \nin reintroducing the Leahy-Specter Personal Data Privacy and Security \nAct. This is a comprehensive data privacy package aimed at better \nprotecting Americans' privacy. Senator Specter has been a valuable \npartner on this, and I also thank Majority Leader Reid for his \nleadership and commitment to enacting data privacy legislation this \nyear.\n  When Senator Specter and I introduced this bill in 2005, we had high \nhopes of bringing urgently needed data privacy reforms to the American \npeople. The Judiciary Committee reported this bill favorably in \nNovember of 2005, but with the last Congress, it simply sat on the \ncalendar. The leadership would not bring it forward.\n  The irony is while they refused to bring it forward, the problems of \ndata breaches remained a persistent and pernicious threat to Americans' \nprivacy. Yesterday we learned that the Department of Veterans Affairs \nhas lost a portable hard drive containing the sensitive personal \ninformation on as many as 48,000 veterans. I can imagine what the \nveterans in my State feel about that. I can imagine what the veterans \nin Montana feel about that.\n  Last week, there was a major data breach involving a State computer \nserver in my home State of Vermont. It jeopardized the financial data \nof at least 69,000 Vermonters whose personal financial information had \nbeen stored on the computer used by the Vermont Agency of Human \nServices. Can you imagine 69,000 people, in a State of barely over \n600,000 people.\n  This is not unique to Vermont. Last month mega retailer TJX disclosed \nthat it suffered a major computer breach involving credit and debt card \npurchases involving possibly hundreds of thousands of American \nconsumers. And, even as disturbing as that is, while they knew about \nthe breach in mid-December, none of those customers were told about it \nuntil a month later. It is as if a thief had gone to each one of their \nhouses and stolen their data.\n  Of course, all of this comes on the heels of the theft of the \npersonal data of 26.5 million of our veterans and active-duty personnel \nat the VA last year. Think about this: You are a man or a woman serving \nyour country in Afghanistan or Iraq, and this information is stolen--\nwith data about where you live and what family members are left at home \nwhile you are overseas. How do you think that makes you feel?\n  According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, more than 100 million \nrecords containing sensitive personal information have been involved in \ndata security breaches since 2005. We need strong Federal data privacy \nand security laws to protect Americans' personal data, and to address \nthe ills of lax data security.\n  Our bill requires that data brokers let consumers know what sensitive \npersonal information they have about them and to allow individuals to \ncorrect this. It is a simple matter of fairness. There is a clear \nprecedent for our approach in the credit reporting context. Our bill \nalso requires that companies who have databases with sensitive personal \ninformation about Americans establish and implement data privacy and \nsecurity programs. In the information age, any company that wants to be \ntrusted by the public must earn that trust by vigilantly protecting the \ndatabases that they use and maintain. In addition, our bill requires \nnotice when sensitive personal information has been compromised. The \nAmerican people need to know when they may be exposed to a data breach. \nWhether it is a government agency or a private company, if they lose \nyour sensitive information, your Social Security number, your address, \nor anything about you,\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\nyou have a right to know. If they are holding that information about \nyou, and they lose it, you have the right to know it has been lost.\n  We also have tough criminal penalties for anyone who would \nintentionally or willfully conceal the fact that a data breach has \noccurred when that breach causes economic damage to consumers.\n  Then finally, we address the important issue of the Government's use \nof personal data. This would require Federal agencies to notify \naffected individuals when Government data breaches occur.\n  We should never have to worry about our Government having this \ninformation on us and losing it, but certainly in the last 2 or 3 \nyears, we have seen so many millions of files that have been lost or \nput in jeopardy. We live in a world in which our Government also is \nincreasingly turning to the private sector to get personal data that \nthey, in some instances, couldn't legally get on their own. To address \nthis, our bill puts protecting Americans' privacy first and foremost: \nGovernment data has to be protected and we have to know if the \nGovernment falls down on the job.\n  This is a comprehensive bill. It not only deals with the need to \nprovide Americans notice when they have been victims of a data breach, \nit also deals with the underlying problems of lack of security and lack \nof accountability to prevent data breaches from occurring in the first \nplace.\n  Today, Americans live in a world where their most sensitive personal \ninformation can be accessed and sold to the highest bidder with a few \nkeystrokes on their computer. Our privacy laws greatly lag behind both \nthe capabilities of our technology and the cunning of identity thieves. \nThis legislation closes that gap. I commend the leadership for being \nwilling to bring up our data privacy bill. I wish that the leadership \nin the last Congress had brought this bill up last year. But, I am glad \nthat the new leadership will do so this year.\n  For the sake of all Americans, I urge all Senators to support this \nlegislation and to act now to pass comprehensive data privacy and \nsecurity legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 495\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) databases of personally identifiable information are \n     increasingly prime targets of hackers, identity thieves, \n     rogue employees, and other criminals, including organized and \n     sophisticated criminal operations;\n       (2) identity theft is a serious threat to the nation's \n     economic stability, homeland security, the development of e-\n     commerce, and the privacy rights of Americans;\n       (3) over 9,300,000 individuals were victims of identity \n     theft in America last year;\n       (4) security breaches are a serious threat to consumer \n     confidence, homeland security, e-commerce, and economic \n     stability;\n       (5) it is important for business entities that own, use, or \n     license personally identifiable information to adopt \n     reasonable procedures to ensure the security, privacy, and \n     confidentiality of that personally identifiable information;\n       (6) individuals whose personal information has been \n     compromised or who have been victims of identity theft should \n     receive the necessary information and assistance to mitigate \n     their damages and to restore the integrity of their personal \n     information and identities;\n       (7) data brokers have assumed a significant role in \n     providing identification, authentication, and screening \n     services, and related data collection and analyses for \n     commercial, nonprofit, and government operations;\n       (8) data misuse and use of inaccurate data have the \n     potential to cause serious or irreparable harm to an \n     individual's livelihood, privacy, and liberty and undermine \n     efficient and effective business and government operations;\n       (9) there is a need to insure that data brokers conduct \n     their operations in a manner that prioritizes fairness, \n     transparency, accuracy, and respect for the privacy of \n     consumers;\n       (10) government access to commercial data can potentially \n     improve safety, law enforcement, and national security; and\n       (11) because government use of commercial data containing \n     personal information potentially affects individual privacy, \n     and law enforcement and national security operations, there \n     is a need for Congress to exercise oversight over government \n     use of commercial data.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I seek recognition today to discuss the \nPersonal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2007, which I am introducing \nwith Senator Leahy. Not long ago, personal information--Social Security \nnumbers, birthdates, mothers' maiden names, addresses--all remained \nrelatively private. Some information--for example,\n\n[[Page S1636]]\n\nwhether you had a mortgage on your home--might have been publicly \navailable, but finding that information required a trip to the local \ncourthouse. For the most part, the sheer difficulty of obtaining \npersonal information kept it private. This privacy--what Justice \nBrandeis called the freedom to be left alone--has been a cherished \nvalue throughout American history.\n  As everyday transactions increasingly occur electronically, personal \ninformation can be stored, transmitted and accessed much more easily. \nMost Americans have benefited from this change. Because personal \ninformation is available electronically, Americans enjoy the \nconvenience of purchasing goods over the phone or on the Internet. They \ncan obtain a home mortgage in a matter of hours. They can apply for a \ncredit card while they wait at the store. The availability of such \ninformation also helps law enforcement agencies conduct investigations \nand apprehend criminals.\n  In electronic form, personal information is both more valuable and \nmore vulnerable. As the multitude of security breaches that have \noccurred over the past 2 years demonstrate, electronic information is \nmore vulnerable because it can be accessed anonymously from afar and \ncan be stolen in a split second. According to the Privacy Rights \nClearing House, since February 2005, over 100 million records \ncontaining personal information have been subject to some sort of \nsecurity breach. The first of these incidents to come to light involved \ncommercial data broker ChoicePoint, which in February 2005 reported \nthat identity thieves had gained access to personal information of \n163,000 people. The identity thieves had obtained the information by \nsetting up sham accounts with ChoicePoint. ChoicePoint eventually \nsettled with the FTC for $15 million, including $5 million for consumer \nredress. However, consumers might never have found out about the \nbreach. The incident only came to light because of a law California had \nrecently adopted requiring ChoicePoint and others to provide notice of \nsecurity breaches involving personal information to California \nresidents who were affected by the breach. As a result of the \nCalifornia law, Americans for the first time began learning that data \nbrokers and others were routinely collecting and selling their personal \ninformation, and in so doing, they were not always keeping the \ninformation secure.\n  After the ChoicePoint incident came a long series of security \nbreaches involving major American companies. In March of 2005, Designer \nShoe Warehouse reported that hackers had gained access to personal \ninformation, including credit card numbers, on over 100,000 of its \ncustomers. Weeks later, Lexis Nexis reported that hackers had gained \naccess to the personal information of over 300,000 individuals. Other \nblue-chip companies where unauthorized persons have gained access to \npersonal information include Wal-Mart, General Motors, Wachovia Bank, \nH Block, Honeywell, AT, Lloyd's of London, ARCO, Visa, MasterCard, \nBank of America, FedEx, OfficeMax, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Ralph \nLauren. The largest incident came in June 2005, when Card Systems, \nwhich processes payments for the country's largest banks and credit \ncard companies, reported that hackers had accessed 40 million records \ncontaining personal information. Most recently, TJ Maxx Stores and \nMoneyGram both had the personal information of their customers stolen \nfrom their computer systems. This list only includes security breaches \ninvolving wrong-doers who were trying to obtain personal information. \nThe list would be much longer had it included inadvertent disclosure of \npersonal information or incidents involving stolen computers or other \nequipment that happened to contain personal information.\n  A large number of colleges and universities have also suffered \nsignificant breaches, including the University of Southern California, \nwhich in July of 2005 reported that hackers has accessed 270,000 \nrecords containing personal data. Other educational institutions that \nhave been hacked include Boston College, Northwestern University, Tufts \nUniversity, UCLA, Michigan State, Carnegie Mellon, Perdue, Stanford, \nDuke, the University of Iowa, the University of Colorado, and the \nUniversity of Utah.\n  Governments also have not been immune from attempts by identity \nthieves to obtain personal information. Hackers have accessed personal \ndata at the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, the Air Force \nand the Department of Agriculture. Hackers obtained over half a million \nrecords containing personal data from a State agency in Georgia. The \nSan Diego County Employees Retirement Association, the California \nDepartment of Corrections, the Nebraska Treasurers office, the city of \nLubbock, TX, and a Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program in Hawaii \nhave all been the victims of similar thefts.\n  Electronic personal data is more valuable because identity thieves \ncan steal a large volume of data and use it before anyone even knows \ntheir personal information has been compromised. For the last 5 years, \nidentity theft has topped the FTC's list of consumer complaints. From \n2002 to 2004, the number of complaints rose 52 percent, to 246,570. Put \nanother way, that's one complaint every 2 minutes. But this is only the \ntip of the iceberg. Not all consumers report identity theft to the FTC. \nNot all victims report identity theft to their local police. Sixty \npercent of those who did file a report with the FTC did not call their \nlocal police department. It stands to reason that many did not call the \nFTC.\n\n  A recent study by the Better Business Bureau concluded that 8.9 \nmillion Americans were victims of identity fraud in 2006, and that each \nvictim lost approximately $6,300. Ultimately, it has been predicted \nthat nearly 20 percent of Americans will become victims of identity \ntheft. Worse, according to the study, it took victims an average of 40 \nhours on the phone with creditors and credit bureaus to clear their \nnames. I use the term ``clear'' loosely, because in many cases the \ndamage caused by identity theft is irreversible. Victims will have \nfraud alerts on their credit reports for years to come, making it more \ndifficult for them to open new accounts or make major purchases. Some \nwill be erroneously contacted by collection agencies. Many will not \neven know they have been victimized until they try to get a car loan or \na mortgage on a home.\n  Individuals who have not yet been victims also suffer. Businesses \nlose nearly $50 billion a year from identity thieves posing as \ncustomers. These losses translate into increased prices for every \nconsumer. All Americans are victims of identify theft, even if their \nown information remains secure.\n  In some cases, the availability of electronic personal data can lead \nto tragedy. In 1999, a former high school classmate of Amy Lynn Boyer \nobtained her former work address and Social Security number from an on-\nline data broker. Using this information, he called Amy's mother and \nposed as the former employer, convincing Amy's mom to give him Amy's \nnew work address. He then drove to Amy's workplace and fatally shot \nher.\n  In an effort to protect the privacy and security of our personal \ninformation, and prevent future tragedies, small and large, last \nCongress, Senator Leahy and I introduced the Personal Data Privacy and \nSecurity Act. The problem is one of large proportions and many have \nviews on how to go about tackling it. Six committees, three on the \nHouse side and three on the Senate side, introduced legislation last \nCongress addressing data security. At least two other Senate committees \nbecame involved in the issue. It is my hope that the differences among \ncommittees and members can be bridged this Congress. The problem is \nsimply too large to ignore.\n  In an effort to start that process, Senator Leahy and I are again \nintroducing the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act. We are \nreintroducing the bill in largely the same form that it was approved by \nthe Judiciary Committee last Congress. The bill takes a comprehensive \napproach to the problem, an approach I believe is necessary. First, the \nlegislation goes after identity thieves by increasing penalties for \ncrimes involving electronic personal information. It also contains \ncriminal penalties for those who intentionally conceal a security \nbreach involving personal data. Those who actively conceal breaches \nattempt to protect themselves by gambling with the reputations and \nfinances of innocent Americans. They deserve to be punished.\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\n  The bill also empowers Americans to look after the privacy of their \nown information. The bill will allow individuals to gain access to \ntheir personal information when it is in the hands of commercial data \nbrokers. For individuals who believe their information is wrong--\npossibly because the activities of identity thieves--data brokers must \nprovide assistance with correcting their information.\n  The legislation also places some of the burden of protecting privacy \non those that collect personal information. It will require the \ncompanies, government agencies, universities and others that deal with \npersonal information to identify and remedy any weaknesses in their \ncomputer systems.\n  Such measures will not always be enough. As I've already noted, the \nnature of electronic information makes it vulnerable even when \nreasonable steps are taken to protect it. Currently, over 30 States \nhave adopted legislation requiring companies, agencies, universities \nand others to give notice when they experience a security breach that \ninvolves personal information. However, no Federal law imposes such a \nrequirement. As a result, companies are forced to comply with over 30 \ndifferent State laws, an expensive and time-consuming endeavor.\n  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act requires that both \naffected individuals and law enforcement receive notice. Knowledge is \npower. Once individuals learn that their personal information is \nexposed, they can take steps to protect themselves. And, the company, \nschool or agency that experienced the breach must help. They must \nprovide individuals whose data was lost with credit monitoring. For \nlarge breaches, the media must be notified. Media reports over the 2 \nyears have made Americans far more aware of the problem of security \nbreaches. Hopefully, we can raise awareness by continuing the practice \nof making public announcements. Notice will also give law enforcement a \nhead start in catching those who steal personal information.\n  Finally, this legislation will protect the privacy of all Americans \nby providing a check on the government's use of commercial databases. \nFederal law enforcement agencies use commercial databases to track \ncriminals and criminal activity. Correctly used, these databases can be \nvery useful tools in the fight against crime. However, there should be \nsome check on their use. The bill makes it clear that protections \nsimilar to those provided by the Privacy Act are applied to the \ngovernment's use of commercial databases. The legislation also aims at \nmaking sure the government's use of such data is secure.\n  This bill represents a comprehensive effort to protect the privacy \nand security of the personal information of all Americans. The lives of \nmost Americans have been made easier because our personal information \nis readily available to those who have a legitimate need for it. This \nlegislation aims to keep such information out of the hands of those who \nhave no legitimate need for it. I want to take a moment to thank my \ncolleague, Senator Leahy, who has been tireless in his efforts to \npromote individual privacy. He has long fought these issues on the \nSenate floor and has been a leader in securing the privacy rights of \nall Americans. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2007. This bill is a \nmuch-needed solution to the daunting problem of ensuring the privacy \nand the security of our personal data, which has become such a precious \ncommodity.\n  Several forces are converging to make our personal information more \nvaluable--and more vulnerable--than ever. The world is digital and so \nis our personal data. In this day and age, almost everything we do \nresults in a third party creating a digital record about us--digital \nrecords that we may not even realize exist. We seek the convenience of \nopening bank accounts, managing our credit cards, and making major \npurchases over the Internet. And we often complete these transactions \nwithout ever speaking to another person face-to-face or over the \ntelephone. Businesses, nonprofits, and political parties are \npersonalizing their messages, products, and services to a degree we've \nnever seen before, and they are willing to invest significant amounts \nof money in collecting personal information about potential customers \nor donors. And we are living in an age where identity-based screening \nand security programs can be vitally important, resulting in more \ninformation being collected about individuals in an attempt to identify \nthem accurately.\n  As a result, personal information has become a hot commodity that is \nbought, sold, and--as so often happens when something becomes \nvaluable--stolen.\n  We are at a crossroads. We all know about the security breaches that \nhave been on the front pages of newspapers. They have placed the \nidentities of hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk. The fear \namong the American public is so widespread that it has become the basis \nof an entire ad campaign by a credit card company.\n  But this is about much more than information security. Until \nCalifornia law required a company named ChoicePoint to notify \nindividuals in 2005 that their information was compromised and that \nthey might be vulnerable to identity theft, many Americans had never \nheard of ChoicePoint. As news stories focused on the data broker \nbusiness, many Americans were surprised to discover that companies are \ncreating digital dossiers about them that contain massive amounts of \ninformation, and that these companies sell that information to \ncommercial and government entities. The revelations about these \nsecurity breaches highlighted the fact that Americans need a better \nunderstanding of what happens to their information in a digital world--\nand what kind of consequences they can face as a result.\n  When I am back home in Wisconsin, I hear from people who do not \nunderstand why companies have the right to sell their sensitive \npersonal information. I hear from people who are shocked to discover \nthat personal information about them is available for free on the \nInternet.\n  There is no question that data aggregators facilitate societal \nbenefits, allowing consumers to obtain instant credit and personalized \nservices, and allowing police officers to locate suspects. But these \ncompanies also gather a great deal of potentially sensitive information \nabout individuals, and in many instances they go largely unregulated.\n  Too many of my constituents feel that they have lost control over \ntheir own information. Congress must return some power to individual \nAmericans so that we can all better understand and manage what happens \nto our own personal data.\n  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act takes a comprehensive \napproach to the privacy and security problems we face. It gives \nconsumers back some control over their own information. The bill \nrequires data brokers to allow consumers to access their own \ninformation and to investigate when consumers tell them that \ncorrections are necessary. And it requires companies to give notice to \naffected consumers and to law enforcement if there is a serious \nsecurity breach, so that individuals know their identity may be at risk \nand can take steps to protect themselves.\n  In addition, the bill extends existing criminal law to ensure that it \ncovers unauthorized access of data broker systems, as well as \nconcealment of security breaches. It requires companies that buy and \nsell information to have appropriate data security systems in place. \nThese protections will help safeguard against future privacy violations \nand security breaches in the commercial data industry. But that is not \nall this bill accomplishes.\n  The bill also contains some critically important privacy and security \nprovisions to govern the government's use of commercial data. This is \nan aspect of the data broker business that has not yet gotten as much \nattention in the wake of the security breaches over the past few years. \nThe information gathered by these companies is not just sold to \nindividuals and businesses; government agencies of all stripes also buy \nor subscribe to information from commercial sources. We all remember \nthe discovery in 2005 that the Pentagon had a contract with a marketing \nfirm to analyze commercial and other data about high school and college \nstudents.\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\n  Although the government should be able to access commercial databases \nin appropriate circumstances, there are few existing rules or \nguidelines to ensure this information is used responsibly. Nor are \nthere restrictions on the use of commercial data for powerful, \nintrusive data mining programs. The Privacy Act, which governs when \ngovernment agencies themselves are collecting data, likely does not \napply because the information is held outside the government and is not \ngathered solely at government direction.\n  As a result, there is a great deal we do not know about government \nuse of commercial data, even in clearly appropriate circumstances such \nas when the agency's goal is simply to locate an individual already \nsuspected of a crime.\n  We don't know under what circumstances government employees can \nobtain access to these databases or for what purposes. We don't know \nhow government agencies evaluate the accuracy of the databases to which \nthey subscribe. We don't know how the accuracy level of the data \naffects government use of the data. We don't know how employees are \nmonitored to ensure they do not abuse their access to these databases. \nWe don't know how those who misuse the information are punished. And we \ndon't know how government agencies, particularly those engaged in \nsensitive national security investigations, ensure that the data \nbrokers cannot keep records of who the government is investigating, \nrecords which themselves could create a huge security risk in light of \nthe vulnerabilities that have come to the forefront in recent months.\n  That is why I am so pleased that this bill includes provisions to \naddress the government's use of commercial data. A comprehensive \napproach to data privacy and security would be incomplete without \ntaking on this piece of the puzzle. The bill recognizes there are many \nlegitimate reasons for government agencies to obtain commercially \navailable data, but that they need to be subject to privacy and \nsecurity protections. It takes a common sense approach, pushing \ngovernment agencies to take basic steps to ensure that individuals' \npersonal information is secure and only used for legitimate purposes, \nand that the commercial information the government is paying for and \nrelying on is accurate and complete.\n  Specifically, the bill would require that federal agencies that \nsubscribe to commercial data adopt standards governing its use. These \nstandards would reflect long-standing basic privacy principles. The \nbill would ensure that government agencies consider and determine which \npersonnel will be permitted to access the information and under what \ncircumstances; develop retention policies for this personal data and \nget rid of data they no longer need, minimizing the opportunity for \nabuse or theft; rely only on accurate and complete data, and penalize \nvendors who knowingly provide inaccurate information to the Federal \nGovernment; provide individuals who suffer adverse consequences as a \nresult of the agency's reliance on commercial data with a redress \nmechanism; and establish enforcement mechanisms for those privacy \npolicies.\n  The bill also directs the General Services Administration to review \ngovernment contracts for commercial data to make sure that vendors have \nappropriate security programs in place, and that they do not provide \ninformation to the government that they know to be inaccurate. And it \nrequires agencies to audit the information security practices of their \nvendors.\n  These are basic good government measures. They guarantee that the \nFederal Government is not wasting money on inaccurate data and that \nvendors are undertaking the security programs that they have promised \nand for which the government is paying.\n  We live in a new digital world. The law may never fully keep up with \ntechnology, but we must make every effort we can. I am proud to be \ninvolved in this comprehensive, reasoned approach to privacy and \nsecurity, and I hope it will move forward in this Congress. I \ncongratulate Senators Leahy and Specter for their excellent work on \nthis bill. This bill is important and it deserves serious \nconsideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 497. A bill to repeal a prohibition on the use of certain funds \nfor tunneling in certain areas with respect to the Los Angeles to San \nFernando Valley Metro Rail project, California; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Pesident, today I rise to introduce a bill for myself \nand Senator Feinstein to allow for subway tunneling in parts of Los \nAngeles.\n  In 1985, in response to a methane gas explosion that destroyed a Ross \nDress for Less Store in Los Angeles, Representative Waxman worked to \nenact a law that prohibits subway tunneling in his district.\n  In 2004, the Los Angeles City Council passed a motion in support of \nreversing the laws banning tunneling. In February 2005, the Los Angeles \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority board also voted to begin \ndiscussions of subway expansion.\n  As a result, a panel of scientific experts was created to conduct an \nindependent safety review that determined that subway tunneling could \nmove forward safely with new technology.\n  Representative Waxman introduced a bill to lift the Federal tunneling \nprohibition in the last Congress--where it passed the House--and again \nin this Congress. Senator Feinstein and I are introducing the same bill \nin the Senate.\n  This legislation has the support of Los Angeles Mayor Antonio \nVillaraigosa and the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n  This bill is necessary to expand the subway, which is extremely \nimportant in Los Angeles--a city that ranks time and time again as the \nmost congested region in the country. The Wilshire corridor is densely \npopulated and is a large commercial area. The freeways and streets are \nfilled--we need transit in this area.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 498. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the Medicare program for beneficiaries residing in rural areas; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator \nCollins from Maine, I am introducing legislation to address the needs \nof the nearly one-quarter of all Medicare beneficiaries who live in \nrural America. These beneficiaries are systematically disadvantaged in \nthe Medicare program. The beauty of Medicare is its equity, its \nuniversality, and its accessibility. But we have compromised these \nvalues by stratifying payments, by under-representing rural voices on \nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, and by continuing to use \nobsolete payment data that hurts rural America.\n  First, we must stop indexing physician payments for work based on \ngeographic differences. Rural areas already have a hard enough time \nrecruiting and retaining the Nation's top talent. Currently, even \nthough 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries live in rural areas, only \n10 percent of the Nation's physicians serve them. Lower payments to \ndoctors in these areas only perpetuate this dangerous shortage of \nmedical expertise. We should not be discouraging medical school \ngraduates from moving to underserved rural areas by continuing to offer \nsub-par pay--in fact, we should be providing incentives to encourage \nthem to work in underserved areas. My legislation proposes a project to \nhelp rural facilities to host educators and clinical practitioners in \nclinical rotations.\n  Lack of dollars to rural health facilities has also prevented \ncommunities from investing in vital information technology. The \nInstitute of Medicine published a report in 2005 detailing the ways in \nwhich health IT could assist isolated communities. For example, since \nrural physicians tend to be generalists rather than specialists, \nvirtual libraries within physician offices would provide both doctors \nand patients with a wider and deeper source of information at their \nfingertips. Rural residents can also be quite far from health \nfacilities, so technology that allows emergency room physicians to \ncommunicate with EMS workers in an ambulance can help patients receive \nlife-saving treatment before they physically reach the hospital. These \nkinds of technologies will improve both the quality and efficiency of \ncare given in rural areas. My legislation offers funding for\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\nquality improvement demonstration projects, to allow isolated \ncommunities to invest in this otherwise out of reach technology.\n  Lastly, this legislation will end the disproportionately low \nrepresentation of rural interests on the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission. This lack of representation has resulted in policies that \nhurt rural communities. Those policies have hurt--and continue to \nhurt--the people of my State of Wisconsin, and they hurt my colleague \nSenator Collins' constituents as well. For every dollar that Medicare \nspends on the average beneficiary in the average State in this country, \nMedicare spends only 82 cents on a beneficiary in Wisconsin. In Maine, \nMedicare spends only 80 cents per dollar it spends on the average \nbeneficiary.\n  How is this the case, if beneficiaries in Wisconsin and in Maine pay \nthe same payroll taxes as beneficiaries in other States? Because the \ndistribution of Medicare dollars among the 50 States is grossly unfair \nto Wisconsin, and to much of the Upper Midwest. Wisconsinites pay \npayroll taxes just like every American taxpayer, but the Medicare funds \nwe get in return are lower than those received in many other States.\n  With the guidance and support of people across my State who are \nfighting for Medicare fairness, I am introducing this legislation to \naddress Medicare's discrimination against Wisconsin's seniors and \nhealth care providers. My bill will decrease some of the inequitable \npayments that harm rural areas. It will provide rural areas the help \nthey need to grow crucial health information technology infrastructure. \nIt will offer the necessary incentives to help attract the Nation's top \nmedical talent to underserved rural areas. And it will mandate rural \nrepresentation on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. Rural \nseniors are already underserved in their communities; they should not \nbe underrepresented in Washington as well.\n  Rural Americans have worked hard and paid into the Medicare program \nall their lives. In return, they deserve full access to the same \nbenefits as seniors throughout the country: their choice of highly \nskilled physicians, use of the latest technologies, and a strong voice \nrepresenting their needs in Medicare policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Commission to Study the Potential \nCreation of the National Museum of the American Latino to develop a \nplan of action for the establishment and maintenance of a National \nMuseum of the American Latino in Washington, DC, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about bi-partisan \nlegislation I am introducing today. I am proud to be joined by Senator \nMel Martinez, Senator Bob Menendez, and 20 additional Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  The National Museum of the American Latino Community Commission Act \nwill establish a Commission to study the potential creation of a \nNational Museum of the American Latino Community. The Commission \nmembers, selected by the President and Members of Congress, will be \ntasked with studying the impact of such a Museum and the cost of \nconstructing and maintaining a museum, developing a plan of action and \na fundraising plan, and proposing recommendations to make the Museum a \nreality.\n  As we begin our efforts to pass this significant legislation, the \nU.S. House of Representatives is set to complete their consideration of \nH.R. 512, the House companion bill, and will pass the bill on the House \nfloor today. It has been a pleasure to working with Representative \nXavier Becerra and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who have \nchampioned this legislation for several years. I hope to work with the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resource Committee to quickly advance the \nSenate bill, so that we can, at last, move forward.\n  If we are successful in our efforts, I believe we will have done our \npart to enhance the experience of the millions who visit our Nation's \ncapital every year. By passing this legislation, we will contribute to \nthe ongoing, deeply rewarding, and profoundly important process of \nnational self-discovery.\n  Washington, DC is the symbolic heart of our country. When Americans \ntravel to their capital, they expect the museums, monuments, and \nnational parks they visit to reflect the complete American experience. \nI celebrate the opening of the National Museum of the America Indian \nand efforts underway to establish the National Museum of African \nAmerican History and Culture because I believe we must celebrate our \nrich, diverse national heritage.\n  Hispanics have long been a part of our country's history and my own \nfamily's story illustrates this truth.\n  Over 400 years ago, in 1598, my family helped found the oldest city \nin what is now these United States. They named the city Santa Fe--the \nCity of Holy Faith--because they knew the hand of God would guide them \nthrough the struggles of survival in the ages ahead. In Hispanic \nPioneers in Colorado and New Mexico, a new book by Colorado Society of \nHispanic Genealogy, their triumph over extreme adversity is documented. \nThe time has come for the story of these pioneers to be told in our \nNation's capital.\n  As a proud American, I want to ensure that every individual who \nvisits Washington has a chance to learn the full history of who we are \nas Americans. It is my hope that the Senate can work to pass this \nimportant bill. In doing so, we will preserve our shared America \nhistory.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish long-term care trust accounts and allow a refundable tax \ncredit for contributions to such accounts, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term \nCare Trust Account Act of 2007. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague Senator Blanche Lincoln who has been a tireless leader on \nissues of importance to the health of our Nation. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with Senator Lincoln on this legislation as well as \nother opportunities to improve health care in America.\n  We are an aging Nation. With babyboomers rapidly retiring, the need \nfor long-term care planning is becoming even more critical. However, we \nknow all too well that planning for the likelihood of disability in \nyoung or old age is not done as actively as we would like it to be. \nCurrently, only about 7 percent of all money spent on long-term care \ncomes from private insurance. Too often, insurance is not being \npurchased, funds are not being saved and persons with disabilities are \nforced to rely on Medicaid for their daily care.\n  As a Nation, we need to do better. Senator Lincoln and I believe that \nour bill will encourage Americans to invest in their futures and in \ntheir care, which is an important first step.\n  Specifically, our legislation will create a new type of savings \nmechanism for the purpose of preparing for the costs associated with \nlong-term care services and purchasing long-term care insurance. An \nindividual who establishes a long-term care trust account can \ncontribute up to $5,000 per year to their account and receive a \nrefundable 10 percent tax credit on that contribution. Interest accrued \non these accounts will be tax free, and funds could be withdrawn for \nthe purchase of long-term care insurance or to pay for long-term care \nservices. Our bill also will allow an individual to make contributions \nto another person's Long-Term Care Trust Account. This will allow \nrelatives to help their parents or a loved one prepare for their future \nhealth care needs.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that \nnational spending for long-term care was more than $190 billion in \n2004, representing about 12.5 percent of all personal health care \nexpenditures. While those numbers already are staggering, we also know \nthat the need for long-term care is expected to grow significantly in \ncoming decades. Almost two-thirds of people receiving long-term care \nare over age 65, with this number expected to double by 2030. We also \nknow that the population over age 85, those most likely to need long-\nterm services and supports, is expected to increase more than 250 \npercent by 2040 from 4.3 million to 15.4 million.\n  Today, millions of Americans are receiving or are in need of long-\nterm care services and supports. Surprisingly, more than 40 percent of \npersons receiving long-term care are between the ages of 18 and 64. \nSome were born with disabilities; others came to be disabled through \naccident or illness. No one can predict their long-term health care \nneeds. Therefore, everyone needs to be prepared.\n  Currently, long-term care insurance is the main way to prepare for \npossible future care and support needs. Long-term care insurance helps \nprotect assets and income from the devastating financial consequences \nof long-term health care costs. Today's comprehensive long-term care \ninsurance policies allow consumers to choose from a variety of benefits \nand offer a wide range of coverage choices. They allow individuals to \nreceive care in a variety of settings including nursing homes, home \ncare, assisted living facilities and adult day care. Some of the most \nrecent policies also provide a cash-benefit that a consumer can spend \nin the manner he or she chooses. When we buy long-term care insurance, \nwe are also working to ensure that we can make more independent long-\nterm care decisions and reduce the strain on state Medicaid budgets.\n  Unfortunately, for too many, the struggle to pay the immediate costs \nof long-term care insurance sometimes outweighs the security these \nproducts would provide. As Americans are spending more and saving less, \nI fear the American middle class is woefully unprepared to meet the \ncoming challenges of their long-term care needs. Moving forward in our \neffort to help individuals prepare for life in their later years, we \nmust encourage them to purchase long-term care insurance and save for \nlong-term care services. The Long-Term Care Trust Account Act of 2007 \nis designed to achieve both goals.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will help all Americans save for \ntheir future and their independence during times of vulnerability. I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 504\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe above-the-line deduction for teacher classroom supplies and to \nexpand such deduction to include qualified professional development \nexpenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing today, \nalong with Senators Warner, Landrieu, Vitter, Coleman, Smith, and \nNelson of Nebraska, would increase and expand the Teacher Tax deduction \nprovided in current law. The Teacher Tax deduction is available to \nschool teachers and other educators who incur out-of-pocket expenses in \norder to purchase classroom supplies for their students. The bill we \nare offering today would increase this above-the-line tax deduction to \n$400, allow the deduction to be taken for expenses related to \nprofessional development, and make the deduction permanent.\n  This bill builds upon a $250 tax deduction in current law authored by \nSenator Warner and myself, which became law as part of the tax relief \npackage in 2001. This tax relief was later extended through the end of \nthis year, but we need to act to extend it further.\n   I would suggest that there is no reason why we should not make the \ndeduction permanent. Teachers who buy classroom supplies in order to \nimprove the educational experience of their students deserve more than \njust our gratitude. They deserve this modest tax relief to thank them \nfor their hard work.\n  So often teachers in my State, and throughout the country, spend \ntheir own money in order to improve the classroom experiences of their \nstudents. Many of us are familiar with a survey of the National \nEducation Association that found that teachers spend, on average, $443 \na year on classroom supplies. Other surveys show that they are spending \neven more than that. In fact, the National School Supply and Equipment \nAssociation found that educators spend an average of $826 to supplement \nclassroom supplies, plus $926 for instructional materials on top of \nthat--for a total of over $1,700 out of their own pockets.\n  In most States, including mine, teachers are very modestly paid for \ntheir jobs. I think it is so impressive that despite challenging jobs \nand modest salaries, teachers are willing to dig deep into their own \npockets to enrich the classroom experience, because they care so deeply \nfor their students.\n\n  Indeed, I have spoken to dozens of teachers in Maine who tell me they \nroutinely spend far in excess of the $250 deduction limit that is in \ncurrent law. I have made a practice of visiting schools all over Maine, \nand so far, I have had the opportunity to visit more than 160 schools \nin my State. At virtually every school I visit, I find teachers who are \nspending their own money to benefit their students. Year after year, \nthese teachers spend hundreds of dollars on books, bulletin boards, \ncomputer software, crayons, construction paper, stamps, inkpads--\neverything you can think of. Let me just give you a couple of examples. \nAnita Hopkins and Kathi Toothaker, who are elementary school teachers \nfrom Augusta, ME, purchase books for their students to have as a \nclassroom library, as well as workbooks and sight cards. They have also \npurchased special prizes for positive reinforcement for their students. \nMrs. Hopkins estimates that she spends $800 to $1,000 of her own money \non extra materials to make learning fun and to create a stimulating \nclassroom environment.\n  This bill would also expand the Teacher Tax deduction to make it \navailable to teachers who incur expenses for professional development. \nWhenever the provisions of ``No Child Left Behind'' are being debated, \nwe hear a lot of discussion about the need for highly-qualified \nteachers. One of the best ways for teachers to improve their \nqualifications is through professional development. Yet, in towns in my \nState, and I suspect throughout the country, school budgets are often \nvery tight, and money for professional development is either very \nlimited or non-existent. For that reason, I believe we should allow \nthis tax deduction to also apply when a teacher takes a course or \nattends a workshop and has to pay for it out of his or her own pocket.\n  In my view, students are the ultimate beneficiaries when teachers \nreceive professional development to sharpen their skills or to learn a \nnew approach to presenting material to their students. Studies have \nconsistently shown that, other than involved parents, the single \ngreatest determinant of classroom success is the presence of a well-\nqualified teacher. Educators themselves understand just how important \nprofessional development is to their ability to make a positive impact \nin the classroom.\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\n  The Teacher Tax relief that we have made available since 2001 is \ncertainly a positive step, and I was proud to have authored that law, \nalong with Senator Warner. This bill would increase that deduction from \n$250 to $400, reflecting more accurately what teachers really spend, \nand would make the deduction permanent. The National Education \nAssociation has endorsed this bill, and I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of the NEA's letter be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  This bill is a small but appropriate means of recognizing the many \nsacrifices that our teachers make every day to benefit the children of \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2007.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Senator John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Warner: On behalf of the National \n     Education Association's, NEA, 3.2 million members, we would \n     like to express our strong support for your legislation that \n     would increase, expand, and make permanent the tax deduction \n     for educators' out-of-pocket classroom supply expenses. We \n     thank you for your continued leadership and advocacy on this \n     important issue.\n       As you know, the educator tax deduction helps recognize the \n     financial sacrifices made by teachers and paraprofessionals, \n     who often reach into their own pockets to purchase classroom \n     supplies such as books, pencils, paper, and art supplies. \n     Studies show that teachers are spending more of their own \n     funds each year to supply their classrooms, including \n     purchasing essential items such as pencils, glue, scissors, \n     and facial tissues. For example, NEA's 2003 report Status of \n     the American Public School Teacher, 2000-2001 found that \n     teachers spent an average of $443 a year on classroom \n     supplies. More recently, the National School Supply and \n     Equipment Association found that in 2005-2006, educators \n     spent out of their own pockets an average of $826.00 for \n     supplies and an additional $926 for instructional materials, \n     for a total of $1,752.\n       By increasing the current deduction and making it \n     permanent, your legislation will make a real difference for \n     many educators, who often must sacrifice other personal needs \n     in order to pay for classroom supplies.\n       NEA also strongly supports your proposal to extend the tax \n     deduction to cover out-of-pocket professional development \n     expenses. Teacher quality is the single most critical factor \n     in maximizing student achievement. Ongoing professional \n     development is essential to ensure that educators stay up-to-\n     date on the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare \n     students for the challenges of the 21 st century. Your bill \n     will make a critical difference in helping educators access \n     quality training.\n       We thank you again for your work on this important \n     legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you \n     to support our nation's educators.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager, Policy and Politics.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support, once again, of \nAmerica's teachers by joining with Senator Collins in introducing \nlegislation regarding the Teacher Tax Relief Act.\n  Senator Collins and I have worked closely for some time now in \nsupport of legislation to provide our teachers with tax relief in \nrecognition of the many out-of-pocket expenses they incur as part of \ntheir profession. In the 107th Congress, we were successful in \nproviding much needed tax relief for our Nation's teachers with passage \nof H.R. 3090, the ``Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.''\n  This legislation, which was signed into law by President Bush, \nincluded the Collins/Warner ``Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001'' \nprovisions that provided a $250 above the line deduction for educators \nwho incur out-of-pocket expenses for supplies they bring into the \nclassroom to better the education of their students. These important \nprovisions provided almost half a billion dollars worth of tax relief \nto teachers all across America in 2002 and 2003.\n  In the 108th Congress we were able to successfully extend the \nprovisions of the Teacher Tax Relief Act for 2004 and 2005. In the \n109th Congress we were able to successfully extend the provisions for \n2006 and 2007.\n  While these provisions will provide substantial relief to America's \nteachers, our work is not yet complete.\n  It is now estimated that the average teacher spends $826 out of their \nown pocket each year on classroom materials--materials such as pens, \npencils and books. First year teachers spend even more.\n  Why do they do this? Simply because school budgets are not adequate \nto meet the costs of education. Our teachers dip into their own pocket \nto better the education of America's youth.\n  Moreover, in addition to spending substantial money on classroom \nsupplies, many teachers spend even more money out of their own pocket \non professional development. Such expenses include tuition, fees, \nbooks, and supplies associated with courses that help our teachers \nbecome even better instructors.\n  The fact is that these out-of-pocket costs place lasting financial \nburdens on our teachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving \nthe profession. Little wonder that our country is in the midst of a \nteacher shortage.\n  Without a doubt the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 took a step \nforward in helping to alleviate the Nation's teaching shortage by \nproviding a $250 above the line deduction for classroom expenses.\n  However, it is clear that our teachers are spending much more than \n$250 a year out of their own pocket to better the education of our \nchildren.\n  Accordingly, Senator Collins and I have joined together to take \nanother step forward by introducing this legislation.\n  This proposed legislation will build upon current law in three ways. \nThe legislation will: One, increase the above-the-line deduction, as \nPresident Bush has called for, from $250 allowed under current law to \n$400; two, allow educators to include professional development costs \nwithin that $400 deduction. Under current law, up to $250 is deductible \nbut only for classroom expenses; and three, make the Teacher Tax Relief \nprovisions in the law permanent. Current law sunsets the Collins/Warner \nprovisions after 2007.\n  Our teachers have made a personal commitment to educate the next \ngeneration and to strengthen America. And, in my view, the Federal \nGovernment should recognize the many sacrifices our teachers make in \ntheir career.\n  This Teacher Tax Relief Act is another step forward in providing our \neducators with the recognition they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 506. A bill to improve efficiency in the Federal Government \nthrough the use of high-performance green buildings, and for other \npurposes; to the committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Snowe and Boxer, to introduce the High Performance \nGreen Buildings Act. This legislation encourages the government to \nimprove the energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and environmental \nimpacts of our Nation's Federal buildings, and will reenergize and \nfocus the Federal Government's leadership and commitment on this issue.\n  Buildings in the United States have an enormous impact on the \nenvironment and also on our overall energy situation. According to the \nDepartment of Energy, buildings in the United States use almost 40 \npercent of the total energy consumed in this country. That figure is \nexpected to rise to 53 percent by 2030, meaning that over half of the \nenergy consumed in this country will be used by buildings alone. In \naddition, buildings are the source of 35 percent of national carbon \ndioxide emissions, 49 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, and 25 \npercent of nitrogen oxide emissions.\n  However, the impact of buildings is even broader than that. Americans \nspend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors and the quality of \nthe air they breathe can have an impact on their health, as well as \nwork productivity and absenteeism. The U.S. Green Buildings Council, a \nnational non-profit, indicates that on average, installing high \nperformance lighting enhances worker productivity by 6.7 percent. There \nare also numerous sources of indoor air pollutants, ranging from mold \nto radon, and strong building design that considers ventilation can \nhelp to remedy these potential health problems.\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\n  It is important that we confront these issues, and our legislation \ndoes just that. High Performance Green Buildings are designed with the \nimpact on occupants, surroundings and energy consumption in mind. \nBuildings designed or renovated on these merits save money, have \nhealthier occupants, and have a more positive impact on their \ncommunities.\n  While the initial investment cost of green buildings may be higher \nthan a traditional building, many of these costs are recouped over \ntime. For instance, the Federal government spends about $170 million \nper year on the lighting of federal buildings; using new lighting \ntechnology can reduce energy use by 50 to 75 percent. Some estimates \nshow that the payback time for energy efficient lighting is as little \nas four months.\n  The High Performance Green Buildings Act focuses the Federal \nGovernment's efforts on promoting sustainable design in federal \nbuildings, and realizing the economic benefits associated with reduced \nenergy use and increased occupant health. It creates an Office of High \nPerformance Green Buildings within the General Services Administration \n(GSA), which manages buildings owned or leased by the Federal \nGovernment. GSA is the largest ``landlord'' in the country the \ngovernment owns or leases nearly 500,000 buildings in the United \nStates, covering 3.1 billion square feet. The new Office will promote \npublic outreach, focus ongoing research and development, and create an \nAdvisory Committee consisting of Agency representatives and experts \nfrom various sectors, to improve coordination across Federal Government \nagencies and bring best practices to the Federal government.\n  Additionally, the High Performance Green Buildings Act provides \ngrants to schools, in consultation with the Environmental Protection \nAgency and the Department of Education, to provide technical assistance \nto address environmental and health concerns. The health of our \nchildren is our primary concern and this legislation takes important \nsteps to ensure their well-being.\n  It is clear that having sustainable design in our buildings is smart \npublic policy and a wise financial investment, and this bill will allow \nthe Federal Government to increase its leadership role on the promotion \nof green buildings. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 506\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for reimbursement of certified midwife services and to provide \nfor more equitable reimbursement rates for certified nurse-midwife \nservices; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Midwifery Care \nAccess and Reimbursement Equity (M-CARE) Act of 2007. For too many \nyears, certified nurse midwives (CNMs) have not received adequate \nreimbursement under the Medicare program. My legislation takes steps to \nimprove reimbursement for these important healthcare providers.\n  Since 1988, CNMs have been authorized to provide maternity-related \nservices to Medicare-eligible women of child-bearing age. There are \napproximately three million disabled women of child-bearing age on \nMedicare; however, if they choose to utilize a CNM for ``well women'' \nservices, the CNM is only reimbursed at 65 percent of the physician fee \nschedule. This is not right and does not come close to offsetting the \ncosts incurred by these professionals.\n  At this incredibly low rate of reimbursement, the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Committee (MedPAC) agrees that a CNM simply cannot afford to \nprovide services to Medicare patients and has supported increasing \nreimbursement for CNMs. In fact, the Commission recommended in 2002 \nthat CNMs' reimbursement be increased and acknowledged that the care \nprovided by these individuals is at least comparable to similar \nproviders.\n  My legislation would make several changes to improve the ability of \nCNMs and certified midwives (CMs) to effectively serve the Medicare-\neligible population. First, and most importantly, my bill recognizes \nthe need to increase Medicare reimbursement for CNMs by raising the \nreimbursement level from 65 percent to 100 percent of the physician fee \nschedule. CNMs provide the same care as physicians; therefore, it is \nonly fair to reimburse CNMs at the same level. Several states have \nrecognized this in their Medicaid programs--approximately 29 States \nreimburse at 100 percent of the physician fee schedule for out-of-\nhospital services.\n  In addition, the M-CARE Act would establish recognition for a \ncertified midwife (CM) to provide services under Medicare. Despite the \nfact that CNMs and CMs provide the same services, Medicare has yet to \nrecognize CMs as eligible providers. My bill would change this.\n  This bill will enhance access to ``well woman'' care for thousands of \nwomen in underserved communities and make several needed changes to \nimprove access to midwives. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 508. A bill to amend the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \nto apply whistleblower protections available to certain executive \nbranch employees to legislative branch employees, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce the Congressional \nWhistleblower Protection Act of 2007, which will extend whistleblower \nprotections currently available to certain executive branch employees \nto legislative branch employees.\n  Presently, executive branch employees are shielded from retaliation \nfor exposing waste, fraud, or abuse by the Whistleblower Protection \nAct. The bill I'm introducing today simply extends those same \nprotections to legislative branch employees.\n  A theme that has dominated this new Congress, as well as the \nelections this past November, is accountability and responsibility in \nWashington. I have fought hard for whistleblowers over the years \nbecause they are key in our efforts to ensure government accountability \nto the people we are sent here to serve. In most instances, the only \nreason we discover waste or fraud is because employees are brave enough \nto stand up to the wrongdoers and expose their offenses. Without these \nwhistleblowers, the American taxpayer would continue to foot the bill.\n  The Office of Compliance has called for these changes on numerous \noccasions in recent years, and they are very supportive of this bill. \nWe have already taken the steps to protect whistleblowers in the \nexecutive branch. It doesn't make sense not to extend these same \nprotections to whistleblowers in our own backyard. My bill will, very \nsimply, give congressional employees the same protections that workers \nin the other branches of government already possess.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill to ensure \nthat those who help us in the fight to hold government accountable are \nnot punished for their efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide improved aviation security, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Aviation \nSecurity Improvement Act with Senators Stevens, Rockefeller, Lott, and \nLautenberg, who are all original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  When the 9/11 Commission released its report in 2004, the Commission \nexpressed continuing concern over the state of air cargo security, the \nscreening of passengers and baggage, access controls at airports, and \nthe security of general aviation. Congress responded then and enacted \nmeasures to address inefficiencies highlighted by the Commission. \nHowever, implementation through the rulemaking process was slow, and as \na result, significant shortfalls in our security regime remain.\n  In fact, a little more than year ago, the 9/11 Public Discourse \nproject issued a scorecard that gave inadequate grades in those key \nareas where the Commission had advocated for improvements in aviation \nsecurity. Checked Baggage and Cargo Screening received a ``D,'' Airline \nPassenger Explosive Screening received a ``C,'' and Airline Passenger \nPrescreenig received an ``F.''\n  Over the past year, the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, \nhas continued working to significantly bolster air cargo security in \nthe United States. While that is a good step in response to the report \ncard, more must be done. The government must remain vigilant in its \neffort to provide security for our Nation, and the steps proposed in \nthis bill will both improve our existing security system and give TSA \nthe flexibility to combat new and emerging threats.\n  The bill we are introducing today would require the screening of all \ncargo going on passenger aircraft within 3 years. We expect TSA to \ndevelop a robust screening program that improves upon current measures \nand ensures the security of all cargo transported in commercial \npassenger air carriers.\n  To improve our ability to detect explosives in checked baggage and at \npassenger screening checkpoints, the bill extends the Aviation Security \nCapital Fund and promotes the purchase and installation of advanced \nbaggage screening systems that can be integrated into the daily \nworkings of our Nation's air transportation system. This capital \ninvestment will improve security screening by permitting TSA employees \nto better focus on potential threats while reducing the high workplace \ninjury rates.\n  The bill addresses airline passenger explosive screening in several \nways:\n  1. By promoting advanced research and development for checkpoint \ntechnology;\n  2. By enhancing screener training to more clearly identify and \naddress potential threats; and\n  3. By requiring the Administration to complete and implement a plan \nover the next year that thoroughly addresses the threat of and response \nto carry-on explosives.\n  Airline passenger prescreening also remains a primary concern of the \nCongress. Not enough progress has been made by the TSA to develop an \nadvanced passenger prescreening system since it took on this task \nnearly 4 years ago. Too many passengers are inconvenienced each year by \nfalse positives when matched against passenger watchlists.\n  Our bill would ensure a system is in place to coordinate passenger \nredress matters, and that the TSA moves rapidly to develop a strategic \nplan to test and implement an advanced passenger prescreening system.\n  Our bill also takes steps to improve general aviation security, \nairport access issues for airline employees, screener staffing issues, \nand other issues where there have been consistent shortcomings over the \npast several years.\n  The 9/11 Commission's report and subsequent Public Discourse project \nhelped keep Congress and the Administration focused on the need for \naviation security. While they did not have all the answers for quick \nfixes, they did offer a vital blueprint, particularly in the areas of \ninfrastructure and transportation system security.\n  My colleagues and I used that guideline in drafting the legislation \nwe are introducing today. We believe that once this bill is enacted, it \nwill significantly improve aviation security in the specific areas I \nhave highlighted, and the aviation system as a whole. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to move this bill quickly. We have had 5 \nyears to consider what does and does not work. Now it is time to \nimplement what we have learned.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 509\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today in honor of \nWorld Wetlands Day proc1aiming February 2 America's Wetlands Day.\n  February 2, 1971 was the date of the adoption of the Convention on \nWetlands in the Iranian city of Ramsar on the shores of the Caspian \nSea.\n  Each year since 1971, leaders from all parts of the world have used \nthis day to raise public awareness of the value and benefits of \nwetlands--not only as ecological gems, but as economic boons, \nincubators of biodiversity, and a sportsman's paradise.\n  The signing in 1971 of the Convention on Wetlands provided a \nframework for national action and international cooperation toward the \nconservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. Wetlands can \nbe found in every country and are among the most productive ecosystems \nin the world.\n  Those of us from Louisiana have a rather unique perspective on the \nsubject of wetlands. You see, Louisiana's coast is really America's \nWetland. It is not a beach, but a vast landscape of estuaries, rivers, \nfreshwater marsh, forested floodplains, and vernal pools.\n  The landscape that extends along Louisiana's coast is one of the \nlargest and most productive expanses of coastal wetlands in North \nAmerica. It is the seventh largest delta on earth, where the \nMississippi River drains two-thirds of the United States. It is also \none of the most productive environments in America--``working \nwetlands'' as they are known to Louisianians--producing more seafood \nthan any other State in the lower 48. It's the nursery ground for the \nGulf of Mexico and habitat for one of the greatest flyways in the world \nfor millions of waterfowl and migratory songbirds.\n  Even more importantly, Louisiana's coastal wetlands provide storm \nprotection for ports that carry nearly 500 million tons of waterborne \ncommerce annually--the largest port system in the world by tonnage. \nThat accounts for 21 percent of all waterborne commerce in the United \nStates each year. In fact, four of the top ten largest ports in the \nUnited States are located in Louisiana.\n  These wetlands also offer protection from storm surge for two million \npeople and a unique culture. Louisiana's low-lying coastal communities \nare home to more than 2 million people--nearly half the State's \npopulation. Even as those communities recover from the back-to-back \n2005 hurricanes, they remain threatened and compromised as the land \nthey occupy erodes from beneath their feet.\n  Tragically, Louisiana's wetlands are eroding at a devastating rate: \napproximately 24 square miles per year disappear--that is the \nequivalent of approximately one football field lost every 38 minutes. \nWithin the next 50 years--even with current restoration efforts taken \ninto account--those wetlands are expected to recede an additional 500 \nsquare miles.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey recently found that Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita alone transformed 217 square miles of marsh to open water. \nTragically, these eroding wetlands are Nature's levee system--they \ndiminish a hurricane's destructive power by reducing storm surge and \nabsorbing wave energy.\n  Scientists have estimated for every 2.4 square miles of wetlands, \nstorm surges are lowered by about one foot. Some studies suggest that \nonly one square mile of wetlands may achieve this. Because these \nwetlands are nurseries for many species of fish and shellfish, their \nloss has a profound impact on the $1 billion dollar per year fishing \nindustry supported by Louisiana's fragile coastal environment.\n  The costs associated with Louisiana's coastal wetland loss are not \nonly Louisiana's to bear--they are the entire Nation's. For instance: \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita impacted more than 26,000 businesses, \ndestroyed 275,000 homes, and caused more than $44.7 billion in insured \nlosses.\n  Today, more than 40 percent of the Nation's oil and nearly a quarter \nof the Nation's natural gas is produced in or transported through \nLouisiana.\n  More than 20 percent of the nation's imported oil is delivered to and \nprocessed in Louisiana.\n  Louisiana is second only to Texas in the number of oil refineries on \nits soi1--with 17 refineries, most of which are located in the coastal \nzone.\n  The erosion of Louisiana's coastal wetlands--America's Wetlands--\nendangers the U.S. energy supply and it endangers the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure in the Gulf Coast: Refineries and petrochemical \nfacilities that drive U.S. economic growth are at risk of being \nflooded, damaged and shut down, as we saw during the 2005 hurricanes.\n  That is why I am submitting a Sense of the Senate resolution that \nwill acknowledge February 2, as World Wetlands Day and express that it \nis the sense of the Senate that we must raise awareness of the Nation's \nimperiled wetlands--in Louisiana and throughout the country. We need to \nraise awareness of these critical issues and we need to work locally, \nregionally, nationally, and internationally to confront this problem \nhead on.\n  The good news is that scientists know how to restore the wetlands and \nthey have been very successful in reinforcing barrier islands that \nprotect these ecological gems. What has heretofore been lacking is not \nthe will, but the resources with which to undertake this critical \nchallenge. The passage of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act \nchanged that and certified America's commitment to providing long-term, \nsustainable funding to address this problem. Today, we have the will; \nwe have the way; let's get to work and preserve America's wetlands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/06/senate-section/article/S1652-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 73--DESIGNATING FEBRUARY 6, 2007, AS ``RONALD REAGAN \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Stevens, \nMrs. Dole, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Hatch, Mr. McCain, Mr. \nMcConnell, and Mr. Reid) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, the resolution I am honored to submit \ntoday with my colleague, Senator Feinstein, is to commemorate today, \nFebruary 6, 2007--what would be Ronald Reagan's 96th birthday--as \nRonald Reagan Day.\n  President Ronald Wilson Reagan, a man of humble background, worked \nthroughout his life serving freedom and advancing the public good, \nhaving been employed as an entertainer, union leader, corporate \nspokesman, Governor of California and President of the United States. \nIn 1981, when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated President, he inherited a \ndisillusioned Nation shackled by rampant inflation and high \nunemployment. During Mr. Reagan's presidency he worked in a bipartisan \nmanner to enact his bold agenda of restoring accountability and common \nsense to government, which led to an unprecedented economic expansion \nand opportunity for millions of Americans.\n  Mr. Reagan's commitment to an active social policy agenda for the \nNation's children helped lower crime and drug use in our neighborhoods. \nPresident Reagan's commitment to our armed forces contributed to the \nrestoration of pride in America, in her values and in those cherished \nby the free world, and prepared America's Armed Forces to meet 21st \nCentury challenges. President Reagan's vision of ``peace through \nstrength'' led to the end of the Cold War and the ultimate demise of \nthe Soviet Union, guaranteeing basic human rights for millions of \npeople. It is entirely appropriate that on February 6, 2007, which will \nbe the 96th anniversary of Ronald Reagan's birth, and the third since \nhis passing, we declare February 6th, 2007, to be Ronald Reagan Day and \nurge all citizens to take cognizance of this event and participate \nfittingly in its observance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
