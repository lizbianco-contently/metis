Mr. President, one of the issues we have to address this \nmorning--I have talked here on the floor and I have talked in press \nconferences about this--is how difficult it has been to get the energy \nand business tax extenders. It has been very difficult. We have had \nnine votes to get where we are--nine votes spread over a period of \nmonths. Finally, with the work of a number of Senators--principally \nSenators Baucus and Grassley, and two other members of the Finance \nCommittee, Senators Cantwell and Ensign--we have worked to put together \na package, and it is delicately put together.\n  I have tried to explain to my House colleagues how difficult it is \nfor me to accept what they have sent us. They have broken this up and \nsaid: Hey, look, this is what we want, and you should take it.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent now--they sent us \none part of the thing we sent over to them, and that is the tax \nextenders, both the energy tax extenders and the business tax extenders \nin one package, and that is what I am going to ask consent about; that \nthis matter I have just acknowledged, H.R. 7060, which is just as I \nhave explained it--the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act is \nwhat they call it--which was received from the House, that the bill be \nread\n\n[[Page S10026]]\n\nthree times and passed and the motion to consider be laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate.\n  Remember, out of the package they sent, they broke this up and sent \nus the tax extenders--the energy and business tax. I ask unanimous \nconsent that matter be accepted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, but I would like to make a brief statement.\n  The Senate and House are on the verge of a very historic action to \ndeal with the crisis in our economy, an action that would not have been \npossible if Democrats and Republicans had not worked together and had \nworked with the administration. In the Senate, over the last several \nmonths, we have had the same kind of work with respect to the unanimous \nconsent request that has just been made. We tried, each of us in our \npartisan ways, to get something passed that we could send over to the \nHouse of Representatives that deals with the so-called tax extenders--\nthe energy extenders and AMT relief. What we found was that neither \nside could prevail if we tried to do it our way.\n  As the majority leader has said, we had something like nine separate \nvotes, I believe. We finally concluded that the only way we could, for \nthe good of our constituents, extend these important tax provisions and \nfix the AMT was to have a series of votes which expressed the will of \nthe Senate, work together to pass in a bipartisan way legislation that \nwe would then send to the House of Representatives. Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate agreed that the legislation represented by \nthe consent agreement is an important priority for the American people, \nand that is why we approved this bipartisan package by an overwhelming \nvote of 93 to 2. But before the package received the overwhelming \napproval, the energy tax extenders failed as a stand-alone bill, as I \nsaid, nine times.\n  The Senate has spoken clearly. This legislation will pass the Senate \nif it receives a vote in the same packaged form that passed by the vote \nof 93 to 2. It is the path we must continue to follow. The majority \nleader has made that point, the minority leader has made that point, \nand I reiterate that point again to our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives. For that reason, I object to the request that has been \nmade.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have served in the House of \nRepresentatives. My friend, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, has \nserved in the House of Representatives. I understand the House. I loved \nmy experience in the House, but their rules of engagement are different \nthan ours. And if it were up to me, I would accept this in a second. I \nthink it is fine. But, Mr. President, I don't have that ability here. I \ndo not have the strength and the power legislatively and procedurally \nthat they have in the House.\n  The House is like the British Parliament. If you are in the majority \nthere, you can get a lot of things done that we can't being in the \nmajority here. And my majority is extremely slim; it is 51 to 49 when \neverybody is here. Many days, I am in the minority.\n  So I just beg my House colleagues to understand that this isn't \nsomething we are trying to surprise them with. It has taken me this \nlong to get here. The ability to get here has been long and hard. And \nwe are not trying to pull anything over on the House.\n  Mr. President, for us, as a congressional body, House and Senate, to \napprove this legislation would be historic--long-term tax credits for \nrenewable energy, creating thousands and thousands of jobs. For the \nfirst time in a long time, we are extending the business tax credits \nfor 2 years. The business community, small businesses and big \nbusinesses, is elated over that because we have given them 1-year \nextensions time and time again.\n  In this legislation, there is some really good stuff. There is mental \nhealth parity, there is something that every State west of the \nMississippi will benefit from--the State of Nevada, as an example. We \nhave been cheated for years because the law is, if you have Federal \nproperties there to take away from your tax base, then the Federal \nGovernment should help. And they have helped but not very much. Eighty-\nseven percent of the State of Nevada is owned by the Federal \nGovernment. The legislation we have sent to the House removes some of \nthe unfairness in that.\n  So I just tell my friends from the House of Representatives, we can't \ndo this. We can't do it. You send us over these things piece by piece; \nwe can't get it done. The reason we were able to get AMT done was \nbecause it was part of a package. So I say to my colleagues: I wish we \nhad more votes and we could just run over you, like they do in the \nHouse, but we can't do that. I wish we could do what we thought was \nright on this side of the aisle and not worry about you, but we can't \ndo that.\n\n  In the House of Representatives, this matter will get 250, 300 votes. \nThis will pass overwhelmingly in the House. This is bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I hope my friends who are part of the Blue Dog caucus would \nunderstand. We are not trying to embarrass them or embarrass anyone \nelse. We believe things should be paid for. We look forward to working \nwith them in time to come.\n  I say, I wish we were not going to spend $700 billion. I wish we \nweren't going to spend $60 billion, unpaid for, on the AMT, but that is \nwhere we are. I hope my friends in the House will understand we are \ndoing the best we can.\n  Senator Kyl said it twice, I said it three times, it took us nine \nvotes to get where we are. If we leave this Congress without having \ndone this, it doesn't speak well of this Congress.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I regret the Senate is unable to \ntake up and pass this legislation. We all know how important it is.\n  The problem here now is that the Senate has demonstrated the limit of \nwhat it can do and what it cannot do. The Senate has now demonstrated \nit cannot pass the tax extender bills. This cannot be done. I want to \nfollow on what the leader said. This is not a matter of embarrassing \nanybody. Sometimes our good friends in the other body think we are \ntrying to embarrass them. This is not a matter of trying to embarrass \nanybody. It is a matter of trying to get some good public policy passed \nhere for our country in these closing days of the Congress. We are \ntalking about energy incentives to help make us more independent from \nOPEC; mental health, trying to get a mental health parity bill finally \npassed, which clearly is important for obvious reasons.\n  Then the awful words are ``tax extenders.'' It helps America be \ncompetitive--the research and development tax credit to help kids get \nto school. This is very simple stuff. It is very basic stuff.\n  I think some of our colleagues and friends on the other side think we \nare trying to stuff them, trying to embarrass them, it is partisan. \nThis is not a matter of embarrassing anybody. This is not a partisan \nmatter. This is an American matter--do something for America. If we go \nback too far in the weeds, some of our colleagues will say: Gee, we \nhave this $700 billion fiscal relief bill and doesn't that add too much \nto the deficit.\n  I don't know if it will. It is not like passing a $700 billion \nappropriations bill. This is an authorization. It is similar to the so-\ncalled Chrysler bailout, the so-called New York bailout, where \ntaxpayers made money on the deal.\n  If I were a Blue Dog, I wouldn't get too worried about the big \npricetag. The main point is we need to get this passed now. It is very \nmodest. Next year is another year and we can deal with all kinds of \nissues we all want to deal with, but for the good of the country I very \nmuch say to my colleagues across in the other body on the other side: \nPlease don't miss this opportunity. Please do what is right. Let's pass \nthis bill before you leave town because not to do so would not be a \nresponsible thing to do. It must be passed over there.\n  It is a Senate bill we are sending over. That is the only responsible \nway out of this difficult situation we are in. Nothing is perfect. \nNobody gets everything. But we have demonstrated now\n\n[[Page S10027]]\n\nthat the House-passed bills here cannot pass. That has been \ndemonstrated by the objection we just heard. It cannot pass. The only \nsolution then is to take up the bills which were worked in a compromise \nwith the Republican Members here and Blue Dogs over there; insofar as \nthe extender, 2 years, only 1 year paid for. That is the compromise and \nit seems to me that is pretty fair compromise. It seems to me the House \nshould take it up--I hope they do--and do the right thing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the chairman is here and the assistant \nRepublican leader, the mark of the Blue Dogs is on what we have done in \nthis Congress. We struggled because of the Blue Dogs insisting, and \nrightfully so, on paying for different things. The chairman of the \nFinance Committee will remember the difficult time we had on SCHIP, and \nthat was because of the mark of the Blue Dogs, wanting to make sure we \npaid for what we did. It is not as if we ignored them; we tried to \nfollow their lead because their cause is a righteous cause. They want \nthis Government to start paying for things and stop running up the \ndeficit. We look forward to working with them in the future.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. As the leader said, we did end up paying for the \nchildren's health insurance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10027-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the weekend bipartisan \ncongressional negotiators worked hard to amend significantly what we \nhave come to call the Paulson plan. The whole point of the work over \nthe weekend--since last Thursday, in fact--was to do everything we \ncould to protect taxpayers. We owe our thanks to Senators Gregg and \nDodd and Senators McConnell and Reid, as well as Members of the House \nof Representatives and the administration and their staffs for working \nhard, sometimes during most of the night, to have this ready for us \ntoday. Actually, it was ready yesterday and was posted on the Internet \nso that not only we, but people across this country and around the \nworld, could see what was proposed.\n  Under the amended plan, the Secretary of Treasury will have authority \nto buy and sell troubled mortgage assets to get the economy moving \nagain. Taxpayers will have authority to provide oversight, minimize \nlosses, and make sure profits go to reduce the Federal debt. There will \nbe restrictions on excessive executive compensation and reasonable \nefforts will be made to make adjustments to help keep people in their \nhomes.\n  People have been calling my office all week about it, as they have \nall Senators. They are angry about the need to do this. I am angry, \ntoo. But callers' opinions have been changing about whether we should \ndo it, as I believe have the minds of most Senators.\n  Most realize that the largest reason for this emergency legislation \nis mortgage loans that people cannot pay back and securities based upon \nthose mortgages. This has derailed housing and created problems for \nbanks. It has spread uncertainty and caused people with cash to be \ncautious.\n  Most realize now that we are not spending $700 billion. The Secretary \nmay buy up to $700 billion in troubled mortgage assets--enough to \nrestore confidence--but he may buy much less. Over time, he will sell \nthose assets, hopefully at a profit, sometimes at a loss. My guess--and \nit is only a guess--net cost to the taxpayer will be $100 billion or \nless, two-thirds of what Congress spent in January on the economic \nstimulus package of tax cuts and rebates. There might even be a profit, \nwhich under the plan, would go to reduce the Federal debt.\n  Most now realize it is important for the Secretary of Treasury to be \nable to buy enough mortgage assets so that institutions are strong \nagain, will start lending again, and people will stop hoarding their \ncash. Next week we can fix the blame. Today we need to fix the problem.\n  Congress should approve the amended plan without delay--today. If the \nHouse can pass it today, there is no reason why the Senate cannot pass \nit today and send it to the President. Otherwise, there is a real risk \nthat credit will freeze and Americans will not be able to get car, \nstudent, auto, mortgage, or farm credit loans--or even to cash their \npaychecks.\n  This has come so fast and taken such an unexpected turn that it is \nhard for most Americans to know what to think about it. As Senator \nDomenici and Senator Gregg have suggested, think about it as a wreck on \nthe highway.\n  Think about it as someone who should have known better, dumping \nthousands of bad mortgage loans and other assets in the middle of an \neight-lane interstate, threatening to bring a halt to all economic \ntraffic. Stopped in one lane is your home loan. In the next is your \nauto loan. In the third lane is your student loan. In the next is your \nmortgage loan. Next, your money market account. Next, the money for \nyour farm credit loan or even your payroll check.\n  Vehicles carrying these essential credits that Americans rely on \nevery day have ground to a halt on the economic highway, blocked by a \nbig pile of bad mortgage loans. So we end up with this massive wreck in \nthe middle of the economic highway.\n  Think of the Federal Government as the salvage crew and Secretary \nPaulson as the driver of the wrecker. His job is to buy the salvage and \nget it off the highway as soon as possible so that traffic can start \nmoving again.\n\n  And think of yourself, the taxpayer, as the owner of the salvage \ncompany--doing everything possible to make sure the driver of the \nwrecker can get the pile of bad loans off the highway and sell them for \nat least as much as it cost him to pick them up. If he does this, then \nthe lanes will open again, and the vehicles carrying your auto and \nmortgage and farm credit loans and payroll checks will start moving \nagain. And the economic traffic will start up again. But that will not \nbe the end of fixing the problem.\n  The Federal Government's compassion several years ago got out ahead \nof its common sense when it made it possible for people to borrow money \nand buy homes who couldn't pay back their mortgage loans. Clever \nfinanciers created exotic instruments based upon these loans, some of \nwhich turned out to be worth less than the loans. People who should \nhave known what was going on--both in their own companies and in \nregulatory agencies--didn't understand what was going on or they turned \na blind eye to it, or worse, they misled people.\n  As the New York Times described it yesterday in an article, what \napparently has happened is that mortgage foreclosures set off questions \nabout the quality of debts across the entire credit spectrum. These \nquestions set off a spiral of claims against insufficient insurance, as \nin the case of AIG, and of insufficient capital in the case of banks. \nSo we end up with this massive wreck in the middle of the economic \nhighway.\n  This week--today--we need to fix the immediate problem. Clean the \nwreck off the highway. But next week we need to begin to take steps to \nremodel our regulatory agencies--most of which were designed to deal \nwith the calamities of the 1930s. I suspect it will be a matter of a \ndifferent kind of regulation that suits these times rather than one of \nmore regulation. And we need to find out if there was fraud or \nmisleading actions so we can do our best to make sure this doesn't \nhappen again.\n  Next week we can fix the blame. Today we should unclog the economic \nhighway and fix the immediate problem to make sure Americans can buy \nhomes and cars and houses, go to college, get farm credit loans and \ncash their payroll checks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, at 12:30 today the Senate will consider a \nprocedural motion to go to the Amtrak reauthorization bill. I am urging \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.\n  For a long time Amtrak has been a question mark in Washington--will \nit survive? Do we need it? It will survive if we have the will to \nsupport it. The question whether we need it has been answered \nconvincingly. All across the United States, not just in the northeast \ncorridor, in my State of Illinois, Amtrak has become an affordable \nalternative for people who cannot afford to pay for gasoline for their \ncars. Amtrak ridership is higher now than it has been for decades in \nIllinois. It is very difficult for a person in my State to get a \nreservation for a seat on an Amtrak train. Clearly it is a popular \nmeans of transportation and in demand. Friends of mine who tried to \ntravel from downstate to Chicago say unless you think weeks in advance \nto make a reservation, you can't get on the train--and of course I \nthink that is the wave of the future, and a good one. More and more \npeople taking this affordable alternative are leaving their cars behind \nand are leaving congestion and pollution behind. That is a positive \ndevelopment.\n  But we cannot have an Amtrak moving forward that serves the needs of \nAmerica without an authorization bill. The last time we passed an \nAmtrak authorization bill into law was in 1997. It has been 11 years \nsince we passed an authorization and, as a result, this agency has been \nlanguishing, surviving from year to year, lurching from one inadequate \nbudget to the next, trying to stay alive. The Amtrak trains you see on \nthe tracks today are rolling stock that is pretty ancient by travel \nstandards.\n  By travel standards, it has been around 20, 30, 40 years. It has been \npushed to the limit. Now we need it more than ever, and we need to pass \nthis authorization bill.\n  Our leader on the Democratic side is Senator Lautenberg. Frank \nLautenberg of New Jersey has really made a name for himself in the \nfield of transportation during his service in the Senate, and he has \nworked so hard to make sure Amtrak moves forward in the 21st century.\n  We need to pass this authorization bill today. This bill does so many \nthings that are absolutely essential: increases capital grants to \nAmtrak so it can start rebuilding its trackage, making sure it is safe \nand that trains can move faster so they can have better ontime \nperformance.\n  They also develop State passenger corridors. Illinois has a terrific \nprogram and a lot of demand for expansion of Amtrak. Downstate, we now \nhave three different corridors: St. Louis to Chicago, Quincy to \nChicago, and the route that runs through Champaign and Carbondale. But \nwe have requests from northern Illinois, Rockford, Galena, into \nDubuque, IA. We have requests from Chicago to the Quad Cities and into \nIowa, even farther. All of these communities begged me for the \nopportunity for Amtrak service.\n  Many of these same communities have been coming to Congressmen and \nSenators over the years asking for air service. They still want it, but \nthey are realistic in realizing short-haul service is now better served \nby passenger rail or at least can be supplemented with passenger rail, \nand so they are asking for that alternative too. We need to expand that \nopportunity around the United States.\n  If you want to order a new Amtrak train and cars, get on a waiting \nlist in Canada or Europe. We don't make many, if any, here in the \nUnited States. That has to change too. With Amtrak with a clear and \nbright future, I believe there can be more investment in capital in \nAmtrak here in the United States. I would like to see facilities in my \nState of Illinois or some adjoining State building the train cars we \nneed for the future instead of heading off to Canada or Europe and \ntrying to bid for them.\n  We also have to come to a better relationship with the freight \nrailroads. You see, with very few exceptions, Amtrak doesn't own the \nrailroad track, the freight railroads do, and there was a long-standing \nagreement that Amtrak would have priority to move passengers over that \nfreight rail track. Well, of course, that means Amtrak is at the mercy \nof dispatchers who will put a loaded passenger train on a siding or a \npassing track and let it sit for long periods of time waiting for a \nfreight train. That is not the way it is supposed to work. The \npassenger rail, Amtrak, is supposed to have priority. In this bill, we \ngive the Surface Transportation Board the ability to take a look and \nsee if the freight railroads are discriminating against Amtrak in terms \nof service and whether damages should be awarded.\n  Finally, after all of these years, we put some teeth into the \nenforcement of a law that has been on the books for a long time saying \nthat the freight railroads have to work to give the passenger rails \nthis kind of opportunity. This is an important piece of legislation, \nlong overdue. It has been held up for so many years, and it is so \nimportant that we do it now.\n  We believe, as I think most Americans do, that high-speed rail is \npart of our future. It is not just a nostalgic view of the past with \npassenger trains; it is part of our future as well.\n  This bill has important investments in Amtrak, important improvements \nwhen it comes to rail safety.\n  One of the provisions in this bill will require, over time, that they \nput on the engines of trains what they call positive train control. \nWhat that means is we would have avoided the accident in Los Angeles \nthat killed people recently. When a train would approach a red light, \nthe engineer would have to give a positive force to change the train or \nit would automatically shut down and slow down. So it really creates a \nsafety measure that could have saved lives in California and will save \nlives across America if it is instituted. That and several other things \nhere will make a big difference in passenger service.\n  I hope this bill gets a strong bipartisan rollcall of support. I know \nthere are Republicans who feel strongly, as I do, that this is an \nimportant step forward for the 21st century for passenger service on \ntrains for Americans and that Amtrak is part of America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Let me thank the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, \nLamar Alexander, for his eloquent remarks here this morning. I would \nsay to anyone who wants to try to understand the situation we are in, \nin terms that everybody can see and feel, they ought to read his \nspeech.\n  I also thank him because he used a metaphor I developed with some of \nmy staff to try to explain this, and he has added to it and amplified \nit. He has taken the idea that we came up with in my office--I asked my \nstaff to sit down with me and talk, and the only thing we could think \nof about the clogging of this passageway was a word that didn't sound \nas though it was a very good word to use, which was ``constipation.'' I \nsaid: Could we not think of some metaphor that is better than that?\n  After 20 minutes or so, the idea came forth of a superhighway, with \nfour or six lanes loaded with cars traveling at full speed, 65, 70 \nmiles an hour, and then there was a crash that took all lanes and \nstopped all of them and the cars piled up for miles back.\n  As the good Senator from Tennessee, a wonderful friend of mine, has \ngone on from that simple beginning I just described to analogize the \nentire problem we have, that accident where--these cars that are all \ncracked up are the toxic assets we are buying. They are toxic because \nthey are all broken down, they are not worth anything anymore, and we \nare going to buy them. That is why we are setting up this rescue fund. \nWhen we buy them, eventually get them, all of the cars will be loosened \nfrom that long 20, 30 miles that they are blocked by this accident, \nwhich is the toxic assets, but it is really the cars stopping movement. \nAnd then he went on to explain what all those cars were, because so \nmany people think\n\n[[Page S10029]]\n\nthis is Wall Street. This rescue plan is not Wall Street. Some of the \nlarge institutions that hold this paper that is clogging the highway, \nsome of them are in New York, but we read today that some of them are \nin Europe. So we should understand that it is where the money moves, \nwhere the money comes from, and as it moves out into our country, to \nthe hinterland, that is where the problem is because these assets, \nthese cars that end up in a wreck, these toxic assets, were purchased \nby banks and institutions all over the country and all over the world, \napparently. Some countries bought a lot of them, from what is coming \nout now, and their banks are having the same kinds of problems \nthousands of miles away from the United States.\n  So we are going to be called upon as Senators to decide whether we \nwant to rescue this American financial system which was the greatest \ndelivery system for money that the world has ever seen. The reason we \nlive in such high prosperity with so many material things of wealth, so \nmuch wealth that is material, from the number of houses--you might own \ntwo of them--from cars to appliances to everything that is there, it is \nfinancing; it is the financial system that is so magnificent in America \nthat permits all of that to happen. And it is breaking down. We better \nrescue it if we can or look what we will be saying to our people: We \nare unable, in the worst kind of crisis as it pertains to the material \nwealth of our country, with that breaking down in front of our eyes, so \nthat as my friend the Senator from Tennessee said, the things we want \nto have--will not be available. In essence, we will be a country that \nis bankrupt. You do not know where the money will be, you do not know \nwhat notes and instruments will be valid, you do not know who will \ndeliver money to whom, and you will have a literal fiscal mess, a \nliteral financial money mess.\n\n  Fix it or be charged with letting it break down. Vote for this and \nfix it. Do the rescue plan or walk out of here as a Senator who can \nclaim no victory, can claim they didn't see fit----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 5 minutes has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That they didn't see fit to lend their vote to a rescue \nplan of this type. And I believe, no matter how much guff you are \ngetting from your constituents, no matter how much they are talking to \nyou on the phone and in letters and other ways, you have to explain it \nto them right and then you have to vote what is right for the United \nStates. That is why we are here.\n  Now, some will say: It is easy for you, Domenici; you are leaving the \nSenate after 36 years. But I hope that I could tell you that in my \nmind, I can carry back and say: I have only been here 12 years and I am \nstill going to stay here, and I would vote this way if I were a Senator \nwho had to go back and try to run again. It is unequivocal that my \nresponsibility is to produce a rescue plan, and I hope the House passes \nit soon, and I hope our majority leader sees fit to call it up soon--\nsooner rather than later. With each day, more damage is being done here \nand around the world.\n  I think we are lucky to have two good people managing the affairs of \nthe United States, and I want to close on that note. We could certainly \nhave had leaders in the Treasury and in the Federal Reserve who were \nnot as good as ours on this subject, and that is helpful because most \nof us who are studying this can go back to our offices and then talk to \nour families and our constituents and say: We are understanding it, and \nwe think we are being dealt the right information and a good plan.\n  With that, I once again thank Senator Lamar Alexander, my good \nfriend, for his excellent speech this morning. I say to anybody who \nwants to understand it, read it--to understand our problem, read it. I \nthank him for using a little bit of my thinking in his speech. Once \nagain, thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10029-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10029-S10030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, while the Senator from New Mexico is on \nthe floor, I want to, one, thank him for his characteristically lucid \nand honorable put-the-national-interest first statement and also to say \nthat I gather, this afternoon, colleagues will be coming to the floor \nto pay tribute to some who are not running again, as Senator Domenici \nis not running. I have to go to Connecticut to join my family for a \ncelebration of Rosh Hashanah right after the vote, so I wish to take \nthis moment to thank Senator Domenici for his extraordinary service and \nto say to him what an honor and a pleasure it has been. Sometimes it is \nan honor to work with some people but not a pleasure; sometimes it is a \npleasure and not an honor. With you, it has been both.\n  You just spoke to our responsibility to our country in this economic \ncrisis, and you spoke from your inner characteristically American core \nof optimism, that we have the best financial system in the world and we \nhave every reason to be optimistic, but we are really in a crisis. To \nme, that is the kind of service you have given our country. And you are \na characteristic American story because your family does not go back to \nthe Mayflower, as we used to say in my family, like yours. Your family \ncame from Italy to this country, and they gave you a love for this \ncountry, a confidence that if you worked hard and used the abilities \nGod gave you, there was no limit to how far you could go.\n  Like so many others, you have served your country with extraordinary \nhonor and effect across a wide range of subject areas. I think \nparticularly of the great work you have done in trying to regularize \nand make orderly and efficient and responsible our budget process; from \nthat kind of nuts-and-bolts dollars-and-cents to the passionate \nadvocacy you have given for equal treatment in our insurance system for \nthose who need assistance from our medical system for mental illness, \nto treat mental illness exactly as physical illness.\n  So, Senator Domenici, it has been an honor to serve with you. If I \nmay get a little ethnic, which you and I usually do, I would say, in \nleaving the Senate this year, you are following in the footsteps of \nanother great Italian-American hero whom I grew up admiring in a \ndifferent field of endeavor, Rocky Marciano. Remember, Rocky retired \nundefeated, and you are too.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It has always been a pleasure working with you and \nbeing with you, and I wish you the very best. I know you are heavily \ninvolved in another kind of campaign and you are doing something very \ndifficult, and I know you must go through difficult times even though \nyou are enthusiastic about what you are doing. That must be difficult \nbecause it is, in fact, very different, and you choose these situations \nand you handle them well.\n  I compliment you, wish you the very best, and hope after the \nPresidential election, whatever happens, you come back and have a very \ngood life in the Senate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend.\n  I offer thanks and best wishes to other colleagues who are leaving--\nSenators Allard, Hagel, and Craig.\n  I particularly wish to say a word about a colleague of the occupant \nof the chair, Senator Warner of Virginia. Senator Webb was kind enough \nto ask me to join him in a tribute to John Warner, and I wish to say a \nfew words about him because our lives have intersected so much in \nservice here.\n  I begin by quoting another great Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, who, \nwhen he arrived in Paris as U.S. Minister to France--what we would now \ncall an Ambassador--presented himself to the French Minister of Foreign \nAffairs. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs asked Jefferson, \nbecause he was replacing Benjamin Franklin:\n\n       Do you replace Monsieur Franklin?\n\n  Jefferson replied:\n\n       I succeed him. No one can replace him.\n\n  I would say of another great Virginian, John Warner, that no one can \nreplace John Warner. He is a Senator's Senator, a patriot, a true \nservant of our country and of his beloved State, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, all of which will be forever grateful for his lifetime of \nservice and dedication.\n  Senator Warner began his service to our country at the age of 17. Let \nme say, generally, without revealing his\n\n[[Page S10030]]\n\nexact age, that would be more than 60 years ago. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Navy during World War II. In 1950, at the outbreak of the Korean \nwar, he interrupted his studies of law to return to Active military \nduty. Similar to so many who served our country in that period--and I \nmeet them all the time in Connecticut, particularly World War II \nveterans, the ones, for instance, whose families will call and say: My \ndad or my grandfather thinks he may have been entitled to a medal, but \nhe never got it--they rushed back after the war to return to their \nfamilies and to their work. We check the records. In almost every case, \nin fact, these veterans of World War II deserve medals. In almost every \ncase, when we give them to them, as I have had the honor to do on many \noccasions, the veterans of World War II will say: I didn't want this \nfor myself. I wanted it for my grandchildren. Then they almost always \nsay: I am no hero, I am an ordinary American called to serve our \ncountry in a time of crisis.\n  The truth is, these veterans and those who followed them in \nsucceeding conflicts, including the distinguished occupant of the \nchair, may each think of themselves as ordinary Americans but, in fact, \ntogether they have protected America's security, saved our freedom. \nThose veterans of World War II defeated the threats of fascism and \nNaziism. Think about what the world would be like if our enemies in \nWorld War II had triumphed and think about the extraordinary period of \nprogress and economic growth that followed after the successful \nconclusion of World War II.\n  John Warner was part of that. His service continued. In 1969, he was \nappointed Under Secretary of the Navy. From 1972 to 1974, he served as \nSecretary of the Navy. Throughout the rest of his career, including his \nlong, distinguished, and productive service on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, John Warner has shown unwavering support for the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces and, of course, in a larger sense, \nunwavering support for the security of America and the ideal of freedom \nwhich was the animating impulse and purpose that motivated Jefferson \nand all the other Founders to create America, a country created on an \nideal, with a purpose, with a mission, with a destiny. John Warner has \nalways understood that. The fact that he is a Virginian is part of that \nunderstanding.\n  It has been my great honor to serve with John Warner in the Senate, \nparticularlyon the Armed Services Committee, where over the years I \nhave come to work with him. Senator Warner is a great gentleman, a word \nthat can be used lightly but belongs with Senator Warner, a person of \npersonal grace, of civility, of honor, of good humor, someone who in \nhis service here has always looked for the common ground. As all of us \nknow, when we make an agreement with John Warner, even on the most \ncontroversial circumstance, his word sticks. He keeps the agreement, no \nmatter how difficult the political crosscurrent may be. He has had an \nextraordinary record of productive service to America and to Virginia.\n  One of the things I cherish is that in 1991, after Saddam Hussein's \ninvasion of Kuwait, I was asked to join with Senator Warner in January \nof 1991 to cosponsor the resolution which authorized the Commander in \nChief to take military action to push Saddam Hussein and Iraqi forces \nout of Kuwait which they, of course, did successfully, heroically, and \nwith great effect on the stability and future of the Middle East. It \nturned out that in 2003, when it came time again for the Senate to \ndecide whether we were prepared to authorize yet another Commander in \nChief to take military action to overthrow Saddam Hussein--and I don't \nneed to talk about the causes for which we argued for that case--\nSenator Warner asked me if I would join him again as a cosponsor. It \nwas a great honor for me to do that, and it passed overwhelmingly with \na bipartisan vote.\n  In a very special way, notwithstanding this kind of work and work we \ndid together, for instance, to establish the Joint Forces Command, \nlocated in Norfolk, VA, to make real the promise of joint war fighting \nthat was inherent to the Goldwater-Nichols legislation but was not \nquite realized, I worked with Senator Warner and Senator Coats, a \nformer colleague from Indiana, to accomplish that.\n  Fresh in my mind and expressive of the range of John Warner's \ninterest and of his commitment to the greater public good was the fact \nthat at the beginning of this session of Congress, he sought to become \nthe ranking member of the Subcommittee on Climate Change of the \nEnvironment Committee, which I was privileged to about to be chair of. \nWe talked about the problem. John didn't, as this challenge to mankind \nhas taken shape, rush to the front of it. He was skeptical. He \nlistened. He read. He concluded the planet is warming, that it \nrepresents a profound threat to the future of the American people, \npeople all around the globe, and that it represents a threat to our \nnational security, which has been the animating, driving impulse of his \npublic service. We talked and decided to join together. I call it the \nWarner-Lieberman Climate Security Act; he calls it the Lieberman-Warner \nClimate Security Act, which is a measure of the relationship we have \nhad and his graciousness. Without his cosponsorship, we would not have \ngotten it out of subcommittee, first time ever. We wouldn't have gotten \nit out of the Environment Committee, first time ever reported favorably \non this important challenge to the Senate floor. We wouldn't have been \nable to achieve the support of 54 Members of the Senate, the first time \na majority of Members of the Senate said we have to do something about \nglobal warming, including our colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator \nObama, which means the next President will be a proactive leader and \npartner with Congress in the effort to do something about climate \nchange. It wouldn't have happened without the support of John Warner, a \nfinal extraordinary act of leadership by this great Senator.\n  He has a lot of great years left in him. I hope we can find a way for \nhim to continue to be part of the work all of us have to do: One, to \nkeep our country secure--and there is no one with more expertise and a \nmore profound commitment to that--and, two, to get America to assume \nits proper leadership role in the global effort to curb global warming.\n  He is a dear friend, a great man. It has been a wonderful honor to \nserve with him. I pray he and his wife and all his family, beloved \nchildren and grandchildren, will be blessed by God with many more good \nyears together.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to say how pleased and, frankly, \nrelieved I am that the negotiators have reached an agreement on the \neconomic rescue plan for our country. I found, as people began to be \nterribly anxious, justifiably, around our country, about their life \nsavings, about their businesses, about their jobs, I was getting two \nmessages from the public. One was their fear that we would not act to \nrescue our economy and them, and then their second fear was about what \nwe would do to rescue our economy and them. The negotiators have both \ncome up with a plan that will rescue our economy, will protect our \ntaxpayers. In it, I am proud to say, is a proposal somewhat similar to \none that Senator Cantwell and I put forward for a 9/11-type commission \nto review the regulations of our financial institutions, to reform them \nso we learn from this crisis and, to the best of our ability, we make \nsure it never happens again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are at a place, in terms of the \nlegislative calendar, where there are lots of things piled up and not \nmuch time to get them done. I am reminded of something someone once \nsaid: In the legislative process, you can't allow the perfect to become \nthe enemy of the good, in a place where you are lucky if the adequate \neven survives.\n\n[[Page S10031]]\n\n  That is where we find ourselves right now with regard to the issue of \nthe tax extender legislation. We have a bill that impacts a broad range \nof Americans; 24 million Americans will be subject to the alternative \nminimum tax if Congress does not act. We have energy tax extenders that \nput in jeopardy lots of investment in renewable energy sources such as \nwind and solar. We have students who are affected because of a student \nloan provision, teachers who are affected by a teacher deduction that \nis allowed for expenses. We have the rural schools' fix included. All \nthese things will be impacted if Congress fails to act.\n  Where we are with regard to that is, the Senate has passed a bill \nwith 93 votes that we have sent to the House. The House is now trying \nto send that back, broken up in different ways and with different sorts \nof offsets.\n  The point is, we have to get it done. We have to look at what the \ntraffic will bear. We have done everything we can in the Senate. When I \nwas a Member of the House, I used to gripe about the Senate and its \nrules. Why can't we send things over there and get them done in a \ntimely way?\n  The reality is, to get anything comprehensive done and anything \nconsequential, it takes 60 votes. Already it is clear we will not be \nable to get 60 votes. We voted on this issue numerous times in the \nSenate. We voted on it repeatedly, the very provisions the House is \ntrying to get us to adopt, without success.\n  In fact, last week we voted. We only got 53 votes in the Senate out \nof the 60 that are necessary. So it seems, to me at least, we are at a \npoint where we flat have to get this done. It is no substitute for a \ncomprehensive energy bill, but it is the least we can do. If the least \nwe can do is the best we can do, we ought to do at least the best we \ncan do, which is to pass these energy tax extenders and get some of \nthis investment in energy technologies that would help us toward our \ngoal of energy independence and reducing carbon emissions.\n  I urge our colleagues on the House side to accept this bill. It is a \nsignable bill. It is very clear we have done everything we can in the \nSenate with repeated votes. The proposal the House has put forward is \nnot going to move in the Senate, and we have a very short clock to work \nwith here in order to get something done. It should not be a question \nof the political winners and losers. It ought to be about the American \neconomy and the American people. We need to do something that is a \nwinner for them, and that ought to be moving this piece of legislation \nin the House. It has 93 votes in the Senate. It is there. It is \nawaiting action.\n  It is absolutely clear the proposal they have sent here cannot secure \nthe necessary votes to move. That bill that is over there will be \nsigned by the President. It moves us in a direction of energy \nindependence and puts some energy policy in place that is important to \nthe future of this country, as well as all the other tax provisions I \nmentioned, including preventing 24 million American families from being \nhit by the alternative minimum tax at the end of the year. So I hope, \nagain, this legislation will pass.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:15 will be controlled by the Republican leader, and the time \nfrom 12:15 until 12:30 will be controlled by the majority leader.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the rail safety \nand Amtrak authorization bill. This is a bill that I think will move \nforward a major alternative option for our passengers and for the \nmobility of our country--Amtrak.\n  Most people think of Amtrak as the Northeast corridor, and going from \nBoston all the way through New York and Washington and on down through \nFlorida. That is a very important route. In fact, that route has more \nthan 2,600 trains operating every day. So it is a major part of our \ntransportation infrastructure in what is called the Northeast corridor.\n  However, we have a national system for Amtrak as well. It is a \nnational system that goes, of course, down the east coast, as I \nmentioned, but it also goes down the west coast. It goes all the way up \nand down the west coast. It has lines that go across the top of our \ncountry, across the bottom of our country east to west, and right down \nthe middle, what is called the Texas Eagle, which goes from Chicago, \ndown through St. Louis, down into Texas, and across to San Antonio, \nwhere it meets the Sunset Limited, which goes from California to \nFlorida.\n  So we have the skeleton of a national system. It is a system we must \npreserve. It is a system that has become more and more of an option as \ngasoline prices have increased. We saw how many people went to train \nuse after 9/11, when the aviation industry was shut down. It is \nsomething we must support and keep.\n  Now we are increasing ridership every year. During fiscal year 2007, \n25.8 million passengers, representing the fifth straight fiscal year of \nrecord ridership, boarded Amtrak. Ridership is up 7 percent more over \nthis time last year, as people have gone to the trains because of the \nhigh gasoline prices.\n  This bill authorizes $2.6 billion annually over 5 years. It \nauthorizes that amount. In Congress we authorize, and then the \nappropriations come later on an annual basis. And $2.6 billion would be \nthe ceiling for the next 5 years for Amtrak. But to put this in \nperspective, when we are talking about alternatives in our \ntransportation system, we have authorized, in SAFETEA-LU, the highway \nauthorization bill, $40 billion. The FAA bill, introduced in this \nCongress, proposes to invest $17 billion annually in aviation. Last \nyear we passed a Water Resources Development Act authorizing $23 \nbillion over the next 2 years.\n  We are talking about $13 billion over 5 years--$2.6 billion each \nyear, which is the very least of the authorizations of any of our \ntransportation systems. If included with the number of passengers \nserved by our aviation industry, in 2007, Amtrak would rank eighth in \nthe number of passengers served, with a market share of right at 4 \npercent. There are nearly twice as many passengers on an Amtrak train \nas on a domestic airline flight.\n  So we have crafted a bill--and I have to tell you honestly, this is \nnot my bill. Actually, it started with Trent Lott. Senator Lautenberg \non the majority side now has continued to be a leader in this field. I \nsupport the bill Frank Lautenberg and Trent Lott negotiated because it \nis right for our country. I have always said, for me, Amtrak is \nnational or nothing.\n  There was a time in this Congress when nobody ever talked national. \nThey only talked about saving the Northeast corridor. Of course, that \nis the rail line that is owned by Amtrak. The other rail lines mostly \nare not separated, although I would like to see that changed. But we \nare using freight rail, and we are at the behest of the freight rail \nlines. So it is not as efficient. But it is very important we keep \nthose relationships and work toward having the separate lines on those \nrail rights of way. Today, we are talking about a national system.\n  There was a time when we only talked about the Northeast corridor.\n\n[[Page S10032]]\n\nBut many of us who are on the national lines, who have been supportive \nof the Northeast corridor, said: Wait a minute. We cannot create a \nstepchild in the rest of the country. If my taxpayers in Texas and \nTrent Lott's taxpayers--now Thad Cochran's and Roger Wicker's \ntaxpayers--are subsidizing Amtrak in the Northeast corridor, we want to \nhave a chance at the national system because it has so much potential \nto work with States and cities to use mass transit systems that feed \ninto the national system, and it will help all of us with mobility. In \nfact, all of those who support the Northeast corridor have been very \nsupportive also of the national system.\n  We have had a partnership in Congress for the last 10 years that I \nhave been here to make sure we are making Amtrak financially \nresponsible with the least amount of Federal help of any of the \ntransportation modes. Highways are $40 billion a year. We are $2.6 \nbillion a year. So we have a bill that has been crafted, I think, in \nthe very most responsible way. I recommend it, and I appreciate very \nmuch the opportunity to take this bill as we have crafted it, with a \nlot of give and take, and recommend to the Congress and the Senate we \npass it today.\n  Mr. President, I wish to yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from the Acting President pro tempore's home \nCommonwealth of Virginia, one who I have to say has been a longtime \nsupporter of Amtrak and has been such a leader in this Congress. This \nis his last term in Congress. He has decided not to seek reelection. He \nis someone who has been a leader not only on Amtrak but certainly on \nour military affairs for our country, the man whom we call the squire, \nthe senior Senator from Virginia.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my long-time friend and colleague \nin the Senate, the Senator from Texas. For so many reasons she is a \nreal leader on our team, on the team of leadership.\n  But how many times, if I might ask the Senator from Texas, have you \ntaken this bill to the floor of the Senate on behalf of Amtrak, rail \nsafety, Metro? Would you mind telling us how many times?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I say to Senator Warner, thank you. It is my pleasure \nto have supported Amtrak from the day I walked in the door 15 years \nago. I think the partnership between the Northeast corridor supporters \nof Amtrak and the rest of the country supporters has created a much \nstronger system. We are seeing that in the ridership. I think if we \nmake the commitment to Amtrak we make to the other modes of \ntransportation, it will be better for our whole country and give more \noptions to the people of our country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recognize that great contribution, but I \nwanted it a part of the Record.\n  I say to my long-time friend, Mr. Lautenberg, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New Jersey, I hope in your remarks you will recite \nhow many times you have gone to the floor on behalf of people seeking \nthe needs of not only Amtrak but the rail safety and the Metro funds \nwhich are in this bill this time.\n  These two Senators have been the engine on this very important piece \nof legislation. The distinguished Acting President pro tempore and I \nare proud to represent Virginia, one of the beneficiaries of this \nsystem. But I have also tried through my many years in the Senate to \nhave a voice for the District of Columbia.\n  This Amtrak as well as the Metro funds in here are the pulse beat, \nthe arteries which feed the Nation's Capital. Some 40 to 50 of the \nvarious Government agencies serving our Nation are accessed with \nAmtrak. I say to my colleagues in the Senate, all 100 Senators--all 100 \nSenators--have staff members and the families of staff, and ourselves, \nwho very often utilize the Metro system and indeed access part of the \nAmtrak system. This is a 10-year funding for the Metro for capital \nimprovement and operating.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to say on that point, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia has mentioned how important \nthe Metro part of it is. I think he has represented so well the \ninterests of all the people who live and work in Virginia, Maryland, \nand the District of Columbia.\n  It also applies, I would expand, to the visitors to our capital \nbecause the rail line on Amtrak that goes from Baltimore Airport to the \nDistrict, our capital, and from Washington National Airport to our \ncapital, has been so helped by having this kind of service from Amtrak \nat National Airport or Baltimore to be able to get on that train and \ncome visit our capital. That is a mode of transportation that is used \nby the millions of visitors who come to visit our capital.\n  This is part of the mobility we provide to people who bring their \nfamilies here. It is the most efficient and least costly way to get \ninto the District to show children the opportunity to see our \ncapital. I appreciate the senior Senator from Virginia pointing out \nthat this is part of our responsibility.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to add that this system, the Metro \nsystem, is a feeder to the Amtrak. It was started in 1960 under \nPresident Eisenhower. Each year, the Congress has been a supporter of \nthis system. But key to this--and I compliment my colleagues in the \nHouse, Congressmen Moran and Davis--are the matching funds from each \nState, so the portion of authorization we seek for Metro in this would \nbe matched by the several States and the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. President, I intend to cast a ``yea'' vote on cloture on the \nmotion to concur with the House amendment to the Railway Safety-Amtrak \nbill. I believe this legislative package is critical for so many \nreasons.\n  Of highest importance to me, though, is a much-needed authorization \nof $1.5 billion over 10 years for the Washington Metropolitan Area \nTransit Authority, WMATA, the Metro system that probably brought a \nmajority of our staffers to work this morning.\n  WMATA has been one of the Washington, DC, metro area's most \nsuccessful partnerships with the Federal Government.\n  In 1960, President Eisenhower signed legislation to provide for the \ndevelopment of a regional rail system for the Nation's Capital and to \nsupport the Federal Government. Since 1960, Congress has continually \nreaffirmed the Federal Government's commitment to Metro by passing \nperiodic reauthorizing bills.\n  Over half of Metro's riders at peak times are Federal employees and \ncontractors, and a large percentage of these riders are Virginia \nresidents.\n  Based on Metro's 2007 Rail Ridership Survey, approximately 40 percent \nof respondents identified themselves as Federal workers who ride \nMetrorail to work. 39 percent of that group identified themselves as \nVirginia residents.\n  We are talking about thousands of cars taken off the major roadways \neach day because of our area's Metro system.\n  Metro's record riderships have occurred during historic events where \npeople from all over the country flock to the Nation's Capital to honor \ntheir Federal Government: President Reagan's funeral, Fourth of July \ncelebrations, Presidential inaugurations. In addition, the Metro system \nproved indispensable to the Federal Government and the Nation's Capital \ngenerally in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001.\n  Over 50 Federal agencies in the National Capital Region are located \nadjacent to Metro stations. Federal agencies rely on WMATA to get their \nemployees to and from the workplace year-round, in all types of \nweather.\n  As I mentioned, the Railway Safety-Amtrak bill includes $1.5 billion \nin Federal Transit Authority funding over 10 years for capital and \npreventative maintenance projects for WMATA. This language was added by \nvoice vote to the Amtrak bill by my delegation mate, Congressman Tom \nDavis, as a floor amendment during the House's Amtrak debate over the \nsummer.\n  These dollars will be matched by the Commonwealth of Virginia, \nWashington, DC, and the State of Maryland.\n  This critical investment will help provide for much-needed \nimprovements to this stressed transit system. Projects such as station \nand facility rehabilitation and tunnel repairs will be undertaken.\n\n[[Page S10033]]\n\n  These funds will also allow WMATA to add new rail cars and buses to \nhelp congestion during peak hours.\n  This critical legislation, which would authorize much-needed Federal \nfunding, contingent on State and local dedicated matches, recognizes \nhow vital Metro is to the region and the Federal Government.\n  Such legislation is integral to the well-being of the area's \ntransportation system, as we struggle to address traffic congestion, \nskyrocketing gas prices, global climate change, and the local quality-\nof-life concerns.\n  From its inception, the Federal Government has played a significant \nrole in funding the construction and operation of the Metrorail system. \nI hope this Congress will continue to show that support.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' for WMATA today.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in voting for cloture on this important rail safety and Amtrak \nreauthorization bill. I am pleased to be doing this with the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and am particularly \ndelighted to have the chance to share in the twilight area of the \ndistinguished career of the senior Senator from Virginia on this issue. \nJohn Warner and I have been friends for many years. We both had some \nmilitary experience in World War II, and Senator Warner went on to \nKorea to continue his duty. We are grateful for not only his duty in \nthe military but his service to the country. Senator Warner is a man \nwith balance and sensitivity. It doesn't mean he always agrees, and \nwhen he doesn't, you know that. He is not hesitant to let you know that \nhe disagrees, but he always does it as a gentleman and always with a \ncourtly touch, if I might say.\n  So I am pleased to be here and to have his interests in taking care \nof the District of Columbia, the State of Virginia, and the State of \nMaryland in terms of having the kind of rail service that is essential \nnow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I would just \nexpress my appreciation and thanks to the Senator from New Jersey. \nAfter 30 years in the Senate, much of that time has been spent working \nwith him on a wide range of issues, many of them international issues \nof great importance. But I am always happy to come back to the \nfundamentals of what makes this institution work, and that is our staff \nand employees and others who are dependent upon this system. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \ngiven 2 minutes for Senator DeMint. I overlooked his coming to the \nfloor. It is my fault. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes \nand also to give the other side 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, when we look at railroads and the role \nthey serve in our country, it is interesting to see that we are now \nfighting for having better rail service when we are practically \noverwhelmed with demand for it. However, on an average day in America, \ntwo people are killed and more than 24 injured in railroad-related \naccidents.\n  The recent Metrolink collision in Chatsworth, CA, that killed 25 \npeople and injured 135 serves as a tragic reminder that we must act to \nprotect the millions of passengers who ride trains each day in this \ncountry. Yet Federal rail safety programs have not been reauthorized \nsince 1994. Some railroad employees are working under laws that date \nback over a century ago. It is critical that we bring our safety laws \ninto the 21st century for travelers, for the rail workers, and our \ncountry's railroads.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Inouye and the Commerce Committee, \nworking in a bipartisan fashion, we held two hearings to gain input \nfrom the administration, large and small railroads, and rail workers. \nWe were very careful with that. The bill we put together was reported \nout of committee unanimously. It passed then unanimously on the Senate \nfloor last month.\n  The bill before us today continues an agreement between the Senate \nCommerce Committee leaders and our counterparts in the House which also \npassed a rail safety bill. It requires new lifesaving technologies such \nas positive train control, also called PTC systems. Federal accident \ninvestigators say this technology could have made a difference in this \nmonth's California crash.\n  Our bill updates the hours of service laws to ensure that train crews \nand signal workers get sufficient rest to remain alert and reduce \nfatigue.\n  It gives the Federal Railroad Administration the tools to better \noversee the safety of the rail industry, including more inspectors and \nhigher penalties for violations of Federal safety laws. In all, the \nrail safety improvements in this bill are long overdue for workers, for \nthe industry, and for Federal regulators.\n  In addition to the rail safety legislation, this bill reauthorizes \nAmtrak for the first time since 1997. As with rail safety, the Senate \nhas passed legislation on this already in this Congress by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote on the Senate floor last October. I \ncoauthored that bill with Senator Lott, and it reflects our shared \nvision for expanding the use of passenger trains in the United States. \nWe held several hearings on this bill and received input from Amtrak, \nfreight railroads, the States, and rail labor.\n  Since we were blocked from going to conference and reconciling the \ndifferences with the House Amtrak bill, we worked out a bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement with our House counterparts. This portion of the \nbill before us today substantially changes our Federal policy toward \npassenger rail travel. It provides the funding that Amtrak needs to \nsucceed as a real option for travelers. Included in this funding is a \nnew $2 billion grant program for States to pursue passenger rail \nprojects. In all, this bill would authorize over $2.5 billion each year \nfor Amtrak, but it includes the States also for the next 5 years. I say \n``includes the States also'' because it gives the States an opportunity \nto establish their own rail corridors that have so much interest now. \nThis level of funding will allow more passenger trains to serve more \ntravelers, will create infrastructure-related jobs in America, and will \nallow Amtrak to make long-term growth plans.\n  With this investment also comes more accountability. Our bill \ncontains significant reforms, many called for by Senators who have not \nalways supported Federal funding for Amtrak. These reforms will require \nthe railroad to improve its efficiency and management by mandating a \nnew financial accounting system, requiring States to pay for those \nAmtrak services they get, and considering passenger trains run by \nfreight railroads. Our bill also allows private firms to submit \nproposals to build new high-speed lines where there is interest, which \nallows for a full public discussion of this potential.\n  Both the rail safety and the Amtrak portions of this bill are needed \nand long overdue. Since we last passed rail safety legislation, more \nthan 9,000 people have been killed and more than 100,000 have been \ninjured in train-related incidents. Think about that. Here we are, we \nare having a little battle about this, when we can be saving lives, \nmaking people more comfortable in their travel, and making rail service \nmore reliable.\n  Since we last passed Amtrak legislation, gas prices, everyone has \nnoticed, have tripled, highways have gotten more crowded, and we have \nsuffered two of the worst years ever for flight delays. The House took \nup this bill and passed it on a bipartisan voice vote last week. Now \nthe Senate needs to invoke cloture, pass this bill, and send it to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  I ask that all Senators let us proceed to this question and help \ntravelers, the rail workers, States, and the American railroad and \nsupply companies in this critical industry.\n  Mr. President, what is the time situation please?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. With the additional time granted, \nthe majority now has 7 minutes 10 seconds, and the minority has 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, our bill will result in a \nsubstantially safer railroad industry. In recognition of this, the \nAssociation of American Railroads and many railroad labor\n\n[[Page S10034]]\n\nunions together strongly support our bill.\n  Our bill will expand the resources of the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, the agency which regulates railroads for safety. It has \nprovisions which would authorize 200 more inspectors and raise the \nmaximum amounts for civil penalties that the agency can levy for \nviolations of our safety laws. These violations can cost up to $100,000 \neach.\n  Too often it takes a catastrophe to get people around here to focus \non severe gaps in our laws. Regrettably, earlier this month, America \nexperienced that kind of tragedy. The accident took place in \nChatsworth, CA. That train collision was only a couple of weeks ago--\nSeptember 12, 2008. The devastation we see here, including the loss of \nlife and the number of injuries, is unacceptable if we can do anything \nabout it, and we can.\n  We also owe it to the residents in communities such as Graniteville, \nSC. This was January 6, 2005. They had nine fatalities. We want to make \nsure these things don't happen again. In 2005, we had over 5,400 people \nevacuated from the area surrounding the accident to avoid the fog of \ndeadly chlorine. Had this accident happened any later that morning, the \nconsequences would have been much worse. Factory workers would have \nbeen at work in nearby mills and schoolchildren would have been in the \nnearby schools. So we owe it to the memory of those people to pledge \nthat wherever we can avoid this kind of thing happening, we must do it.\n  We also owe it to the people of Luther, OK, who last month watched \nthis massive fireball erupt after a train derailed and caused ethanol \ntanks to explode. Look at that picture. You can't see the train. That \nis what happened. We have to be better prepared to prevent these things \nfrom happening.\n  These are not trivial improvements we are talking about today in this \nlegislation. I hope we can quickly finish our work on this bill and get \nsent to the President's desk for enactment, so that we can avoid the \nkinds of tragedies that we know are possible.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Federal \nRailroad Safety Improvement Act, H.R. 2095, which reauthorizes our \nFederal passenger rail program and contains a provision that would \nprovide much needed funding for the Washington Metropolitan Area \nTransit Authority, WMATA.\n  I am a proud original cosponsor of the Amtrak reauthorization \nlegislation, which seeks to improve the safety, efficiency, and \nreliability of our Nation's largest passenger rail service provider. \nWith increasing traffic congestion on our Nation's roadways, it is time \nto invest in long-term and diversified infrastructure projects that \nimprove passenger rail service. I have long stated my belief that \nAmerica has been seriously neglecting its infrastructure, and I am \npleased that this bill puts us on the path to making a renewed \ninvestment in passenger rail service. Notably, the bill before us today \nauthorizes $13 billion for Amtrak over 5 years and includes $1.5 \nbillion to develop high speed rail corridors throughout the United \nStates, including the Southeast corridor which will connect Washington, \nDC, to Charlotte, NC.\n  However, most importantly the legislation before us includes a bill \nthat many of us in the Maryland and Virginia delegations have long been \npushing for a long time. I want to thank Chairman Lautenberg and his \nstaff for working with me and my colleagues to include the National \nCapital Transportation Amendments Act of 2007, S.1446.\n  In short, the Metro funding provision would authorize $1.5 billion \nover 10 years for Metro to finance capital and preventive maintenance \nprojects for the Metrorail system. The Federal funding would share the \nfunding burden with the States because the money would be contingent on \nthe District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia jointly matching the \nFederal contribution toward Washington Metro's capital projects.\n  Appropriate funding for the Metro system is critically important to \nour Federal workforce, the millions of tourists who visit our Nation's \nCapital area, as well as the millions of people who live around \nWashington, DC. I have worked diligently with my Senate and House \ncolleagues over the past 2 years to pass this legislation, and I ask my \ncolleagues to help secure passage of this provision in the Amtrak \nauthorization bill.\n  Metrorail and Metrobus ridership continue to grow as more than 1 \nmillion riders on average per weekday choose Metro as their preferred \nmode of transit for traveling around the National Capital Region. As \nthe price of gasoline has soared, more people are turning to Metro as \ntheir primary mode of transportation. I would note that in fiscal year \n2008, there were 215 million trips taken on Metrorail, which is the \nhighest yearly total ever. This represents an increase of 4 percent \nover last year. In fact, 31 out of 34 of Metrorail top ridership days \nhave occurred since April of this year. On Metrobus, there were 133 \nmillion trips taken, an increase of 1.4 million relative to 2007, and \nalso the highest yearly total ever. New funding authorized in this \nlegislation would provide the necessary resources to increase bus and \nrail capacity and meet forecasted ridership demands before the system \nand region become totally mired in congestion.\n  The Federal role in supporting Metro is clear, with a long track \nrecord to draw upon. Washington Metro began building the rail system in \n1969 with Federal funding authorized under the National Capital \nTransportation Act of 1969. On two separate occasions, Congress has \nauthorized additional funding for Metro construction and capital \nimprovements. According to a 2006 Government Accountability Office \nreport:\n\n       WMATA provides transportation to and from work for a \n     substantial portion of the federal workforce, and federal \n     employees' use of WMATA's services is encouraged by General \n     Services Administration guidelines that instruct federal \n     agencies to locate their facilities near mass transit stops \n     whenever possible. WMATA also accommodated increased \n     passenger loads and extends its operating hours during events \n     related to the federal government's presence in Washington, \n     DC, such as presidential inaugurations and funerals, and \n     celebrations and demonstrations on the National Mall.\n\n  In fact, during rush hour, Federal employees account for over 40 \npercent of Metro ridership. The Metro system was also critical to the \nevacuation of Washington, DC, following the 2001 terrorist attacks. \nMetro was deemed a ``national security asset'' in a Federal security \nassessment conducted after 9/11. In short, the operation of the Federal \nGovernment would be nearly impossible without the Metro system and the \nFederal Government's emergency evacuation and recovery plans rely \nheavily on Metro.\n  The future of Metro and its continued success relies upon consistent \nsupport from the Federal Government and the regional localities it \nserves. Now is the time for the Federal Government to commit itself to \nproviding more long-term Federal funding for the Washington Metro \nsystem. Together, along with our jurisdictional partners, we must \ncontinue to invest in the transit system that has brought so many \nbenefits not only to the region but also to the Federal Government and \nthe entire Nation. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this \nbill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized for 2 minutes, and that time will be charged to the \nminority.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I do appreciate the leadership on this \nbill. I am particularly honored to serve with John Warner. He has been \ninvolved with so many great victories here, great leadership. He will \ncertainly be missed.\n  I don't want to be the one to rain on the parade here because I \ncertainly know there are some good improvements in this bill. \nObviously, there is some disagreement whether this bill should go \nthrough. The Heritage Foundation calls it the biggest earmark in \nhistory. We do have to recognize that with this, on top of the over $20 \nbillion in earmarks we passed last week, the American people have to be \nlooking in on us and asking, What are they thinking?\n  If we adopt this cloture motion, we are setting up 30 hours of debate \non what I am sure to many is an important bill, but this is in a time \nwhen we are talking about a financial crisis of proportions we have not \nseen since the Great Depression. We have instilled panic in the \nAmerican people, and people are working around the clock to determine \nwhether we should spend $700 billion to intrude into the private \nmarkets.\n\n[[Page S10035]]\n\n  To take 30 hours during this time is to suggest to the American \npeople it is business as usual here while we have a crisis and panic on \nthe outside. I encourage my colleagues to let's put this off until \nlater. Whether you support it or you don't, this is not the time to \ntell the American people one thing and to proceed as it it is business \nas usual. We should not be spending 30 hours of debate on an Amtrak \nbill, with the pork that has been added to it, at a time when we need \nto be addressing a crisis in America.\n  I thank the leadership for all their work on this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER Mr. President, due to the Jewish holidays, I am \nunable to attend the cloture vote today on the Federal Railroad Safety \nImprovement Act.\n  However, I want to take this opportunity to express my support for \nthis important piece of legislation that will have a significant impact \non rail safety for my State of California and our Nation.\n  On September 12, a Union Pacific freight train collided head on with \na Metrolink commuter train during rush hour in Chatsworth, CA. This \ntragedy claimed 25 lives, and injured 135 people, many of whom have \nsustained lifelong injuries.\n  This was a senseless tragedy that did not have to occur. Several \nsafety measures could have been employed to help avert this tragedy, \nincluding the implementation of positive train control, PTC, systems on \nsingle tracks shared by commuter and freight rail.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board has called for the \nimplementation of positive train control systems since the inception of \nits Most Wanted Transportation Safety Improvements list in 1990. In its \nmost recent list, the NTSB states:\n\n       The board believes . . . positive train control is \n     particularly important in places where passenger trains and \n     freight trains both operate.\n\n  That is why I joined Senator Feinstein in introducing legislation \nafter the accident that would require positive train control systems to \nbe implemented by 2014 nationwide and in areas of high risk by 2012.\n  While I would have preferred that the Federal Railroad Safety \nImprovement Act mandate positive train control in high risk areas by \n2012, I am pleased this bill takes a step in the right direction by \ngiving the Federal Railroad Administration, FRA, the authority to \nrequire the implementation of PTC sooner than 2015.\n  I also believe the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act makes key \nadvances to address other necessary safety improvements.\n  In addition to requiring the implementation of positive train control \nsystems on rail lines used by passenger trains and trains carrying \nhazardous materials, the bill authorizes $250 million in grants for \nStates and railroad carriers to aid in the deployment of PTC systems \nand other rail safety technology.\n\n  The legislation also revises work hours for train crews and signal \nemployees by requiring an uninterrupted off-duty period of 10 hours \nbetween shifts, a total monthly cap of 276 hours for train crew work \nhours, and creates the first mandatory ``weekend'' for railroad \nemployees by requiring consecutive days off.\n  The Senate has an opportunity to vote this week on the first \ncomprehensive rail safety bill since 1994 and send a clear message to \nAmericans that we have taken action to protect the public by making \nrail safety a priority.\n  In light of the recent rail tragedy in southern California, there is \nno excuse for failing to pass rail safety legislation.\n  This month, I hosted a Commerce Committee briefing on the rail \naccident. What became clear at this briefing was that the FRA has had a \nlax attitude toward rail safety oversight in recent years and that \nCongress must act now to assure the public's concerns and ensure the \nsafety of commuter rail.\n  In the wake of the California rail tragedy, this is not the time to \nhave a partisan debate over increased regulation of rail safety \nintended to protect passengers.\n  Commuter rail systems across the nation need resources and oversight \nby FRA to keep Americans safe.\n  As gas prices continue to rise and more and more families turn to \npublic transit, we must take additional steps to ensure the safety of \nour commuters.\n  Our colleagues in the House have acted in support of this \nlegislation. Now is the time for the Senate to act so that we can begin \nto take the steps necessary make our rail commuter and freight rail \nlines safer.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my Senate colleagues on \nthis important issue in the next Congress.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, with gas prices as high \nas they are in our country, rail is becoming a more popular mode of \ntransportation. As we find ourselves dealing with more trains on the \nrails, with crews being asked to work longer hours and make more trips, \nit is imperative that we ensure these operations are conducted safely.\n  The Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act would make sure that rail \ncrews are properly rested and that hazardous materials are properly \nsecured. It also includes critical improvements to our rail \ninfrastructure at bridges and grade crossings. I regret that I could \nnot be here to cast my vote on Monday, but if I were here, I would have \nvoted in favor of cloture. This bill deserves an up-or-down vote \nbecause the American people deserve a safe rail transportation \nsystem.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Rail \nSafety Improvement Act, which passed the House of Representatives last \nweek by voice vote. This legislation is necessary in order to make our \nrail lines safe. I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  First, I thank Chairman Inouye, Chairman Lautenberg, and Senator \nHutchison for their terrific leadership on this important bill. They \nworked in a bipartisan fashion to advance the first comprehensive rail \nsafety bill since 1994. I appreciate their genuine efforts to make \nAmerica's rail system as safe as possible.\n  The Rail Safety Improvement Act would prevent train accidents by \ndeploying new safety technology.\n  It would also take steps to minimize train worker distraction and \nfatigue, and it would help those impacted by accidents.\n  Finally, it would invest in the future of rail, in which I firmly \nbelieve.\n  Let me explain what this bill does. After years of delay, this bill \nwill mandate and authorize new funding for the installation of advanced \ntrain collision avoidance systems known as positive train control. It \nwill also address grade crossings--establishing a grant program to fund \nimprovements at crossings with a history of deadly collisions.\n  This bill will limit trainmen shifts to 12 hours, preventing tired \nengineers from falling asleep at the throttle; it will establish new \nhours of service rules tailored to ensure commuter rail line workers \nare rested; it will improve training for those who work the rails, and; \nit will permit the Federal Railroad Administration to ban cell phone \nuse and other distractions.\n  The bill will create a program to assist victims and their families \ninvolved in passenger rail accidents.\n  The bill will also lay out a path that will guide the future of rail \nin America. It invests in Amtrak; it establishes competitive grants to \nexpand the existing rail network into new areas; and it establishes \nsignificant Federal support for developing high speed rail in the \nUnited States.\n  This legislation is necessary and long overdue. Congress has not \nreauthorized the Federal Railroad Administration--the FRA--since 1994, \nand without congressional guidance FRA has failed to respond to the \nNational Transportation Safety Board's repeated calls for improvements. \nFor example: NTSB has called for positive train control collision \navoidance systems since the 1970s, and NTSB has called on FRA to ban \nthe use of cell phones by engineers on duty since 2003. Without \nguidance from Congress, the FRA has done neither.\n  Beyond the calls made by NTSB, in California, three deadly crashes \ninvolving the Metrolink commuter rail system since 2002 demonstrate \nthat the FRA needs a new mandate.\n\n[[Page S10036]]\n\n  In 2002, a freight train in Orange County, CA, ran a signal and \ncrashed into a stopped commuter train, killing three and injuring \nhundreds. NTSB found the collision would have been prevented by \nPositive Train Control, but nothing changed.\n  In 2005, a Metrolink train hit a vehicle left on the tracks at a \nhighway rail intersection. This crash, which killed 11 southern \nCalifornians, was not unique. Such intersections lead to an average of \n3,081 collisions and 368 deaths each year.\n  Seventeen days ago in Chatsworth, a Union Pacific freight train \ncollided head-on with a Metrolink commuter train carrying 225 people \nheaded home for the weekend. Twenty-five people died and 135 were \ninjured.\n  In response to this terrible tragedy, I joined with Senator Boxer to \nintroduce legislation requiring positive train control systems on \nAmerica's trains--with priority given to high-risk routes where \npassenger and freight trains share the same tracks.\n  How can we have fully loaded freight and passenger trains traveling \non the same track in opposite directions with nothing more to prevent a \ncollision than signals and the attentiveness of a single engineer?\n  How can we apply 19th century safety systems to a very serious modern \nday problem?\n  This is a particularly acute issue in California, which has a great \ndeal of single track, heavily traveled rail.\n  Mr. President, 41 percent--51 of the 125-mile--Los Angeles to San \nDiego Amtrak and commuter rail corridor is single track. This is the \nsecond most heavily traveled passenger rail line in the United States. \nOn the Amtrak and commuter rail line from L.A. north to Santa Barbara \nand San Luis Obispo, 80 percent the track is single-tracked--177 of 225 \nmiles, with only limited passing sides. Also 88 percent--75 of 85 \nmiles--of the Altamont Commuter Express commuter rail linking Stockton \nand San Jose is single track.\n  In California, we cannot afford to wait for crash avoidance systems \nto come down in cost. We need action now.\n  Let me point out for a minute how positive train control works.\n  Every train's position is tracked through global positioning, which \nis new technology that can monitor its location and speed. These \nsystems constantly watch for excessive speed, improperly aligned \nswitches, whether trains are on the wrong track, unauthorized train \nmovements, and whether trains have missed signals to slow or stop.\n  Each train also has equipment on board that can take over from the \nengineer if the train doesn't comply with the safety signals. The \nsystem will override the engineer and automatically put on the brakes.\n  Versions of these systems exist and are in use today. They are in \nplace in the Chicago-Detroit corridor and Amtrak has a system in the \nNortheast corridor. San Diego has a more simple system, known as \nAutomatic Train Stop, which has been in existence since the 1940s and \nwould have probably prevented the Metrolink's most recent deadly crash. \nBut the railroad industry resists these collision prevention systems. \nThey ask for more time. They say that the technology is still being \ndeveloped.\n  By enacting the Rail Safety Improvement Act, Congress will \ndemonstrate that it gets the message that positive train control will \nsave lives. This legislation includes key parts of the Rail Collision \nPrevention Act that Senator Boxer and I introduced.\n  The positive train control systems mandated by this bill will prevent \n40 to 60 train crashes a year and save lives.\n  And FRA will have the power to issue civil penalties if the systems \nare not in place.\n  While the bill that Senator Boxer and I introduced would have \nrequired collision avoidance systems on high risk track to be in place \nearlier than this legislation, the Rail Safety Improvement Act is \nnevertheless a major step in the right direction.\n  The FRA will have the power to move deadlines up on the highest risk \nrail routes, and I fully expect FRA to impose aggressive deadlines on \nsingle track, heavily traveled rail lines.\n  I believe we must do all we can to see that the Senate acts on it \nbefore the session comes to a close.\n  I believe rail has a bright future in America but only if the \npublic's safety is assured.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSpecter be given 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this legislation is vital for the \ninfrastructure of America. Amtrak provides an indispensable service. \nContrary to assertions, there is much in this bill which provides for \nreform: a greater role for the private sector by allowing private \ncompanies to bid and operate underperforming Amtrak routes; requires \nAmtrak to establish and improve financial accounting; requires Amtrak \nto consult with the Surface Transportation Board, freight railroads, \nand the FRA.\n  Most of all, when the Senator from South Carolina comments about this \nis an earmark, this is thoughtfully considered legislation by both \nHouses of the Congress. It has been held up by the technical refusal of \nsome Senators to allow conferees to be reported. But this sort of gives \nlie to the whole challenge of earmarks as a generalization. Of course, \nif it is a bridge to nowhere or some provision slipped into a bill by a \nsingle Member which does not have any merit, but where you have the \nCongress of the United States authorized by the Constitution to \nappropriate, this is thoughtful authorization of funds.\n  If this is an earmark, then those who condemn earmarks in their \ntotality are absolutely dead wrong and nothing proves it as \nconclusively as saying that the Amtrak legislation is an earmark, when \nit has been carefully considered by both Houses of Congress, which is \nour constitutional responsibility and our constitutional authority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to use leader time. All other \ntime has expired; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield back all our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority time has expired. The \nmajority has yielded back its time.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we now turn to legislation, thankfully, to \nimprove the safety of America's railroads. This bipartisan, bicameral \nlegislation will achieve something we can all agree on, I hope--the \nimproved safety of our Nation's railroads.\n  The pictures Senator Lautenberg placed before us are, to say the \nleast, descriptive.\n  Through new technology, updated regulations, and an expanded Federal \nagency that is up to the challenge of policing the railroads, the bill \nwill save lives.\n  To reach this goal, Senators from both sides of the aisle have worked \ntirelessly, putting aside partisanship and overcoming obstacles that \nwould derail the needed safety and infrastructure improvements we owe \nthe American people. The picture we saw a few minutes ago, the tragic \ncollision that occurred in southern California in Chatsworth on \nSeptember 12, reminded us all it has been entirely too long--almost 15 \nyears--since Congress last reauthorized a bill to set the route of the \nFederal rail safety programs.\n  The Senate took its first steps at rectifying this situation by \npassing, by unanimous consent, Senator Lautenberg's rail safety bill, \njust before the August recess. It is a bill he worked hard on with Kay \nBailey Hutchison and which is now an important piece of legislation we \nmust address.\n  Similar to myself, Senators Lautenberg and Hutchison believe we \ncannot wait another day to reauthorize and improve these lifesaving \nprograms. I am glad we can finally move to consider this good piece of \nlegislation today.\n  In addition to our rail safety programs, this legislation will also \nreauthorize Amtrak and improve the railroad safety operations \ninfrastructure.\n  We last passed an Amtrak reauthorization bill more than 10 years ago. \nOur national railroad has been without\n\n[[Page S10037]]\n\nguiding legislation since 2002, and that was only temporary. With all \nthe challenges facing the traveling public today--high gas prices, long \ndelays at airports, and constant highway congestion--improving our \nNation's intercity passenger rail system is an idea whose time has \ncome.\n  Eight years ago, my wife and I decided we would travel from \nWashington to Chicago on an overnight train. What a good experience \nthat was. Where I was raised, there was no railroad. But now, 8 years \nlater, people would take the trains, such as we did, more often because \nof the jamming at our airports and our busy highways, but they simply \nare not available. Trains offer a fuel-efficient and environmentally \nsound way to quickly enhance our transportation system, and this bill \nwill improve both the existing Amtrak system and help us develop new \nrail service in corridors across the country, such as in Nevada, where \na high-speed rail corridor is being planned and would connect Las Vegas \nto southern California.\n  Despite this progress, some Senators took it upon themselves to \nprevent the House and Senate from going to conference on this bill in \nan attempt to kill the legislation. It is hard to comprehend, but that \nis true.\n  Thankfully, the sponsors of this bill did not give up when they faced \nthese challenges. Senator Lautenberg and Senator Hutchison instead \nbegan working with the House to put together the combined rail safety \nand Amtrak legislation, and today we see the fruit of their labor.\n  This package has been approved by the House by voice vote, with near \nunanimous support, last Wednesday and is now ready to be sent to \nPresident Bush for his signature once the Senate passes it, which I \nhope we do.\n  It contains important new safety requirements for our railroads, such \nas the implementation of positive train control systems, known as PTC \nsystems. These systems can prevent train collisions, such as the \nterrible crash in California less than a month ago.\n  This bill ensures the railroad industry adopts this vital technology \nwherever passenger trains and hazardous cargo shipments travel.\n  This legislation is supported by the railroads and their workers and \nwas developed working closely with the administration.\n  Democrats and Republicans, in both the Senate and the House, have \nmade a strong statement that we need to move our Federal rail safety \nprograms and our passenger rail system into the 21st century. I hope we \ncan move forward on this legislation quickly and get it to Senator Bush \nfor his signature.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the House is going to vote in the next half \nhour on the recovery plan. We are going to attempt this afternoon to \nget a consent agreement to move so that we will have a 60-vote margin \nto approve this legislation. We would do that sometime on Wednesday, \nlate in the day.\n  In the meantime, we are working to see if we can complete an \nagreement to move and complete the Indian nuclear treaty, also on the \nsame day. That would be Wednesday. I think we are very close to being \nable to work that out. That would allow all afternoon today, all day on \nTuesday, and Wednesday to work on those two items.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to make sure I heard correctly, and my \ncolleagues understand, that we would address the rescue package with a \nvote Wednesday night? A Wednesday night vote on the rescue package, is \nthat what I heard?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We have to make sure it passes the House. I am \nconfident that will be the case. Yes, we will work to see if we can get \nagreement, both the majority and minority, to have a vote on that \nsometime Wednesday.\n  I also say I know there is a lot of anxiety, people wanting us to \ncomplete this this afternoon. We pushed things a lot, to a 12:30 vote. \nMany people wanted a much earlier vote. The holiday starts sundown \ntoday which, as I understand it, is around 6 o'clock, quarter to 6, \nmaybe even earlier than that. People have to go home so they can \nprepare for the holiday.\n  I know people have said let's go ahead and do this anyway. We cannot \ndo that. This is an important piece of legislation. It would be \nlegislative malpractice for us not to talk about it before we vote on \nit. I am confident everyone understands that.\n  The one thing I didn't mention is we are going to have to have a \nfinal passage vote on the matter on which cloture was just invoked. We \nwill also do\n\n[[Page S10038]]\n\nthat on Wednesday. We should be able to complete--if things go well, we \nshould complete all of our work Wednesday. The House is leaving today, \nso that fairly well limits what we can do. But if anyone has any \nquestions, I will be happy to acknowledge them. We are having a caucus \nat 1:30 so we can talk to Democrats about this recovery program.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield further?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is the majority leader's feeling there simply would \nbe no way to address the rescue package this afternoon before sundown?\n  Mr. REID. That is right. I do say this will, of course--I could be \nwrong, but I am very confident there are enough votes to pass this \nlegislation. There will be 60 votes to pass this recovery plan once we \nget it from the House. That should be in the next several hours. That \nwill give people all the time that they need to talk about it. I do not \nwant to be jammed in that regard. But there is no way we could do it. \nIt is just not fair. This is the Senate where people are supposed to be \nable to talk. We just can't start voting on something that is costing \nthe country up to $700 billion without at least advising our \nconstituents why we are voting for or against something of this \nimportance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't want to get into a big debate with the leader \nabout this, but the House of Representatives, of course, is voting \ntoday, and they have not had the package any longer than we would have \nhad it today. I know all of this is complicated by the holiday that is \nbeginning at sundown. But this is a matter of extraordinary importance. \nBoth sides realize it is important to the financial future of our \ncountry. I did at least want to raise the possibility one more time \nthat maybe there would be some way we can vote on it today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the House has had--has been debating this \nsince 8 this morning. That is 5 hours. I just think it is inappropriate \nfor us to have that matter--we will not even get the bill for another \ncouple of hours. I think it is inappropriate for us to charge into this \nwithout having had the opportunity to work on it. If it passes the \nHouse, I have already said publicly I am confident there are enough \nvotes to pass it in the Senate. I have no doubt that is true.\n  Everyone should just calm down. I know this is a mad rush, but we \nmake mistakes by rushing into things. There is nothing wrong with our \ntalking about this until Wednesday. That is the day after tomorrow. I \nthink the anxiety of the chairman of the committee who has worked so \nhard on this--I know he would like to get this done so he can go home \nand spend some time with his little girls. But I think discretion is \nthe better part of valor. I don't think it is appropriate, and I don't \nthink we could do it if we wanted to. We have people who are gone \nbecause of the holiday. They are gone right now. It is not fair to \nthem. I do not think it is fair to the body generally that we rush into \nthis, with Senators being gone. There is no question the holiday has \nbeen announced for more than a year. For some people this is a very \nimportant time of the year for them for their religious observance, and \nI am not going to tell Senators who are already not here because of \nthis that they are going to miss this most important vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Leader, I am not on the committee so I am not here \nwith any rush from having written this or having spent time there. I \njust want to share with you my concerns.\n  I believe we are in a time situation that is of utmost importance. I \nbelieve the next 2 days could see many bad things happen that will be \nvery harmful and irreversible for millions of people. The banking \nsystem and banks, financial institutions in the world during the next 3 \ndays, even though they believe you, that we are going to pass this \nlegislation--things can really happen to those that would not happen if \nwe passed this legislation now. I just want to say I understand \nreligious holidays and I understand the significance of the one you are \nspeaking of. But I also believe--I think I understand what is happening \nout there and what is happening in the world, and 24 hours is enough \ntime for many things to happen; 48 is too long.\n  Many things will happen which are detrimental and harmful. I urge you \nonce again to repeat that you think we are going to pass this. I think \nit is important that we instill some confidence that we are going to \nget a right decision; that the delay is just an interim delay because \nit is unavoidable, at least you feel that way as leader of the Senate, \nbut that we are going to pass it. If the world doesn't believe that, \nonce the House passes it, a lot of our work will go for naught and a \nlot of things will happen that are not good. I am sure of that.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we have both Presidential candidates \nfinally agree on one thing--we should pass this. Both agree. There are \nthe two leaders, Senator McConnell and I have done what we can to \nadvance this program. I have no doubt that it will pass the Senate. We \nwill wait to see what happens in the House, but I have no doubt it will \npass the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the majority leader yield for a point?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have seen the vote count. I know it will pass the \nSenate. But I urge Senators, let's not be stampeded into things without \neven reading it. Here is a report from the Department of Justice's \nInspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility about the \ninvestigation into the firing of the U.S. attorneys, one of the \ngreatest scandals to hit the Department. This came about because we \nrushed through on a piece of legislation at the last minute. The \nAdministration slipped in a provision that was on the basis of the \nadministration saying: Trust us--and they manipulated it. \nPeople eventually may go to jail because of this. Millions of dollars \nof investigations are going on because of this.\n\n  Keep in mind, 10 days ago we were asked to pass something immediately \nbecause of the urgency--they told us the world is falling, the sky is \nfalling. That proposal said we would give the Secretary of the Treasury \ncarte blanche to do anything he wants. That proposal said his decisions \ncould not be reviewed by any court, any person, any administrative \nbody, and they insisted that is the only thing--the only thing--the \nadministration could accept.\n  After it was pointed out by myself and others that meant he could \nactually write himself a check for $700 billion and nobody could ask \nabout it, when a number of those things came about, they suddenly \nrealized they could make changes. We sat in a meeting, all the \nSenators, with the Secretary of the Treasury and Chairman Bernanke, the \nhead of the Federal Reserve. I remember asking a question, a simple \nquestion. They went around and around and never answered it. Two days \nlater they finally answered it.\n  Let's take time to read what we are voting on for the sake of this \ncountry, realizing what happened before when we were stampeded into \nvoting for something because the sky was falling.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I say to the majority leader, only 10 days ago we were \nasked to give a $700 billion blank check to the Secretary of the \nTreasury because the sky was falling. I think the majority leader, \nworking in a bipartisan way, did the right thing in terms of standing \nup against that stampede that was being brought upon us by the White \nHouse. Because of the process that has been underway in a bipartisan \nway, the blank check is no longer there. There are constraints on this \nlegislation that make it better. But to have the judgment of the \nSenate, to have us rush to judgment on a $700 billion rescue package, \nwould be an absolute mistake. I think the majority leader is correct in \nterms of wanting us to take the time to review this legislation, which \nnone of us have yet seen, to review it through Tuesday, let the Jewish \nholiday pass, and then come back and take the appropriate steps so we \nmake sure the sound judgment of the Senate is being brought on this \nlegislation.\n  I am very much in agreement with the majority leader that we should \ntake our time to get it done right.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to my friend and all Senators, I have \nindicated what we have left on our plate to do. I hope we can complete \nthat by Wednesday.\n\n[[Page S10039]]\n\n  There are other things that could come up that may extend the time. \nWe may not be able to finish things on Wednesday. There are things the \nHouse is sending over to us today, or not sending to us today, that we \nmay have to act on. I am going to do my very best, working with the \nRepublican leader, to get us out of here on Wednesday, but that is no \nguarantee. I am going to do the very best we can, but there may be \nother things that come up that we are forced to work on. Even though \nthe House is gone, certain things they have done, if we decide we have \nthe opportunity to do those, we may have to do some of those things.\n  I want everyone to know we will do our very best to get out of here \nsometime Wednesday night, but there is no guarantee on that, so I \nwouldn't make plans on Thursday to go golfing or anything like that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10039-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6849, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6849) to amend the commodity provisions of the \n     Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 to permit \n     producers to aggregate base acres and reconstitute farms to \n     avoid the prohibition on receiving direct payments, counter-\n     cyclical payments, or average crop revenue election payments \n     when the sum of the base acres of a farm is 10 acres or less, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 6849. \nThis important piece of legislation would revise the 2008 farm bill and \nhelp thousands of Kentucky farmers.\n  As many of you may know, the farm bill prohibits producers from \nreceiving certain commodity payments on farms of 10 base acres or less. \nUnfortunately, Kentucky has the greatest number of farms that will be \nimpacted by this provision. According to the USDA Farm Service Agency \nand the University of Kentucky, one-fourth of Kentucky's farms are 10 \nacres or less, which indicates that approximately 20,000 of the \nCommonwealth's 80,000 farms could be affected by this provision. While \nI supported the farm bill, I opposed the inclusion of this program in \nthe final legislation.\n  Last month, I wrote USDA Secretary Ed Schafer to express my concerns \nregarding USDA's implementation of this provision. I was concerned that \nUSDA had interpreted the law in a way that disqualifies farmers with \nmore than 10 base acres because that land is not located on a single, \ncontiguous tract. As clearly outlined in the Joint Explanatory \nStatement of the Managers that accompanied this legislation, Congress \nintended that USDA allow for aggregation of farms for the purposes of \ndetermining the suspension of payments on farms with 10 base acres or \nless.\n  H.R. 6849 would remedy this issue by suspending this program for the \n2008 crop year. I strongly support this provision since it could lessen \nthe impact on my farmers and will perhaps provide encouragement to USDA \nto implement this provision in the manner that Congress intended.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Harkin-Chambliss \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate; and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5679) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 6849) was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10039-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate stands \npoised to approve H.R. 2095, a bill that provides for a new generation \nof rail safety improvements, the reauthorization of Amtrak, and the \ncritical Federal funding for the Washington Metro system.\n  All three elements of this legislation are essential to bringing \nAmerica's rail into the 21st century. There are many reasons we need to \ndo that. We need to do that because it is important for quality of \nlife, we need to do that because it is good for our environment, we \nneed to do that for energy security, we need to do it because it should \nbe an important priority for our Nation.\n  Now we are ready to move forward. I wished to focus my comments on \ntitle VI, which is the National Capital Transportation Amendments, a \nsection that incorporates legislation I sponsored to reinvest in the \nWashington Metro system.\n  At the outset, I wish to thank my cosponsors, Senators Mikulski, \nWarner, and Webb. This has been a bipartisan regional effort, where we \nhave worked together in an effort to come up with the right proposal.\n  I noticed a little earlier today that Congressman Tom Davis of \nVirginia was on our floor. I wish to acknowledge his hard work on this \nlegislation. He was critically important in getting this legislation \nthrough and the strategies in order to be able to accomplish an \nopportunity to finally vote on this legislation.\n  Along with my colleagues from Maryland and Virginia, Congressman \nHoyer was very instrumental, and others. Our collective thanks also go \nto the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee, Mr. Lieberman and Ms. Collins. They were \nvery helpful in moving forward on this bill. I would like to thank also \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens and Senator \nSmith for accommodating the strategies so we could actually vote and \npass the bill during this session.\n  A final word of thanks goes to Senator Lautenberg. He has been the \nchampion on Amtrak. He has been the real champion to keep us focused on \nmodernizing Amtrak and how important passenger rail is to our Nation. I \nwish to thank him for his persistence and for being able to marshal \nthis bill through the Congress of the United States.\n  The record on the interest of the Federal Government in the \nWashington metropolitan area and transit goes back to 1952, when \nCongress directed the National Capital Regional Planning Council to \nprepare a plan for the movement of goods and people. That plan became \nthe basis for the National Capital Transportation Act of 1960, which \nclearly states the Federal interests. From that legislation I quote:\n\n       That Congress finds that an improved transportation system \n     of the Nation's capital region is essential to the continued \n     and effective performance of the functions of the Government \n     of the United States.\n\n  In 1966, Congress created the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \nAuthority, WMATA, to plan, construct, finance, and operate a rapid rail \nsystem for the region. By any measure, Metro has succeeded beyond \nanyone's expectations. Metro is the second-busiest rapid rail transit \nsystem in the Nation, carrying the equivalent of the combined subway \nridership of BART in San Francisco, MARTA in Atlanta, and SEPTA in \nPhiladelphia. Metrobus is the fifth most heavily used bus system in the \nNation. In all, the Metro system moves 1.2 million passengers a day. In \nthe fiscal year which ended 3 months ago, 215 million trips were taken \non Metrorail. That is 7 million more than in 2007.\n  In fact, 22 of the 25 Metrorail top ridership days have occurred \nsince April of this year. And 133 million trips were taken on Metrobus \nin fiscal year 2008, which is the highest year total ever, an increase \nof 1.4 million relative to 2007.\n  But let me get to the Federal Government for one moment, our \nresponsibility. Federal facilities are located within footsteps of 35 \nof the Metrorail's 86 stations; that is by design. Nearly\n\n[[Page S10040]]\n\nhalf the Metrorail rush hour riders are Federal employees, nearly 50 \npercent during peak time are Federal employees.\n  Approximately 10 percent of Metro's riders use the Metrorail stations \nat the Pentagon, Capitol South or Union Station. In other words, 10 \npercent of the ridership is directly related to the Capitol and the \nPentagon, obviously our responsibility, serving the military, serving \nthe Congress.\n  GSA's location policy is to site Federal facilities in close \nproximity to Metro stations. It is in their RFP. They put it there. \nThey want it to be within walking distances of the Metro. Metrobus is \navailable at virtually every Federal facility. Every weekday, 34,000 \nbus passengers either arrive or depart from the Pentagon.\n  Metro is now a mature system and showing signs of age. That is no \nsurprise; 60 percent of Metro's system is now more than 20 years old. \nThe average age of our bus facilities is 60 years. It is time we invest \nin modernization of these facilities. Today we act to protect the \nsubstantial investment the Federal Government and the region have made \nin an asset designed to serve the Federal workforce and the national \ncapital region.\n  Metro is the only major public transportation in the country without \na substantial dedicated source of funding. The need to address the \nshortcoming is urgent. That is what this legislation is about. The \nlegislation we, hopefully, will pass will put WMATA on firm footing. \nThe legislation authorizes $1.5 billion in Federal funds over 10 years. \nFor every Federal dollar, Metro's funding partners in Maryland, \nVirginia, the District of Columbia will put up an equal match from \ndedicated funding sources. We finally get the dedicated funding sources \nMetro needs.\n  The bill contains important financial safeguards. It establishes an \nOffice of Inspector General for WMATA and expands the board of \ndirectors to include Federal Government appointees.\n  Also included in the bill is a provision that will improve cell phone \ncoverage within the Metro subway system. I am sure that is going to \nmake some of my colleagues happy that their cell phones will work on \nthe Metro. Within 1 year, the 20 busiest rail station platforms will be \nrequired to have cell phone access. That requirement will go systemwide \nwithin 4 years.\n  WMATA can charge licensed wireless providers for access. This is a \nclassic win-win situation, providing customers with enhanced service, \ngiving riders an extra level of security in the event of a national or \nregional emergency, and giving the Transit Authority a much-needed \nrevenue flow.\n\n  We have a great opportunity today to advance passenger rail service \nand safety in America, and transit in the Nation's Capital. Today, the \nSenate is taking a major step in putting Metro back on track. That is \ngood for Washington, that is good for America and I thank my colleagues \nand I urge them to support the final passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I would be happy to yield to Senator Warner, who has been \nthe real champion on this issue. I mentioned earlier in my remarks the \ntremendous leadership that Senator Warner provided in not only \nsupporting this legislation and what he has done as far as regional \nissues in Washington but figuring a strategy so we could reach this \nmoment. I congratulate him.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was simply going to rise to say that the portion of the \nlegislation we voted upon relating to the Metro is derivative of your \nregulation which you, and I was privileged to be a cosponsor, Senator \nWebb was a cosponsor, Senator Mikulski, the four of us put in. So \nalthough it may not be the exact bill number, it is, in fact, building \non the foundation you laid.\n  I thank you very much for that, as do all our colleagues, every one \nof whom have people who utilize this system, the whole Federal \nGovernment.\n  But the important thing is, the District of Columbia can look to the \nSenators from Maryland, Virginia, and indeed the Members of the \nCongress and the House of Representatives, from time to time, to serve \nits interests. This is one which is very important, if not vital, to \nour Nation's Capital. I compliment the Senator for his leadership. As I \nleave the Senate, whatever modest mantle I have in this area, I convey \nto you and to Senator Webb and Senator Mikulski.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Senator, you have been an inspiration to all of us on \nthese issues and a model for how we should work together on regional \nissues. I congratulate you for a great record in the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you. I have been a lucky man.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                         Tribute to John Warner\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I say to my leader, from my days as a naval flight \nofficer, how privileged I have been having served in Southeast Asia, to \nserve under his leadership when he was Secretary of the Navy and I was \na young naval flight officer, pleased to serve under his leadership \nthen, and delighted to be able to follow his leadership here again \ntoday on the important legislation we have been voting and debating \nhere.\n  I wish to comment on what Senator Cardin said. You provided an \nexample for us. You provided an example for us how we are supposed to \ntreat other people. You treat other people the way you wish to be \ntreated. You are an embodiment of the Golden Rule.\n  If you look in the Bible, it talks about the two great commandments. \nThe second one is to love they neighbor as thyself; treat other people \nthe way you want to be treated. You certainly embody that. I, \npersonally, am going to miss you. I know a lot of others are as well.\n  You talk about passing the mantle to Senator Cardin. Your mantle is \nso heavy, it is amazing to me you can even walk around, all you have \ndone and all you have accomplished.\n  But you are the best. It has been an honor to serve with you, again, \nhere in this capacity.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nDelaware. You mentioned naval aviation. It requires an extraordinary \nperson to go into that program to fly those aircraft. I believe yours \nwas a P-2; was it not?\n  Mr. CARPER. It was a P-3.\n  Mr. WARNER. I remember that airplane. It flew many missions. Your \nprimary mission was watching the Soviets, I repeat the Soviet Navy, and \nits submarines operating off the shore and was vital to our security, \nto track and know where those submarines were because they had missile \narmaments which could inflict great harm on this country.\n  So I commend you, sir, for your service and I humbly thank you for \nyour remarks.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit about \nthe legislation Senator Warner, Senator Cardin, Senator Lautenberg, and \nothers have crafted. It has been described as legislation that will \naccomplish three things: One, to eventually provide better transit \nservice for folks in this part of the country, to help--whether you \nhappen to work here, live here or visit here, the opportunity in years \nahead, to get out of our cars, trucks and vans, leave them wherever \nthey are, at home, in the parking lot or at work and take transit.\n  It will help the quality of our air. It will help reduce congestion \nin this part of our country. It will reduce our reliance on foreign \noil. It works on all different kinds of levels.\n  I know Senator Warner has done good work, along with Senators Cardin \nand Mikulski and Senator Webb. I also wished to say to Senator \nLautenberg how much I appreciate his leadership in crafting the \nlegislation, the Amtrak legislation, the rail safety legislation that \nis before us today.\n  On the rail safety legislation, this is the first time in 10 years \nthat we have actually come back and taken up a major reform of rail \nsafety. The legislation provides some money--about $1.5 billion--for \nrail safety programs over the next 5 years.\n  The best thing it does is with respect to something called positive \ntrain control systems. A terrible accident, a commuter train and \nfreight train accident out in California earlier this month, could have \nbeen prevented had those trains been fitted with--especially, the \ncommuter rail train--a positive train control system. This legislation \nrequires the installation of that kind of system in all trains by the \nyear 2015. I would argue that it should be\n\n[[Page S10041]]\n\nsooner. My hope is it will be in a number of trains before that date, \nbut it should be on all trains by that date. In the situation in \nCalifornia, apparently the engineer may have been text messaging and \nmissed a stop signal, ran the stop signal and ran right into a freight \ntrain, killed a lot of people, including him. Had we had this positive \ntrain control system in place, all that damage and heartache would have \nbeen spared.\n  Another major provision of this legislation on the rail safety side \ndeals with hours of service. I used to think we flew a lot of hours. I \nspent a lot of time when I was on Active Duty in the Navy. People who \nwork on trains spend a lot of time operating the trains as well. \nCurrently, they are able to work up to 400 hours per month. Under \ncurrent law, they are allowed to work up to 400 hundred hours per month \ncompared to about 100 hours for commercial airline pilots. This \nlegislation drops that limit by about a third, down to around 275 hours \nper month. That is still a lot of hours to work in a month but better \nthan what they had been working with for years.\n  The last piece I want to mention on rail safety deals with the \nhighway-rail grade crossing. This is a case where you don't have a rail \noverpass or a road going under a railroad bridge but a situation where \nyou have the rail and the highway meeting at the same level. This \nlegislation requires the 10 States with the most highway-rail grade \ncrossing collisions to develop plans to address the problem within a \nyear of enactment. It also requires each railroad to submit information \nto an inventory of highway-rail crossings, including information about \nwarning devices and signage.\n  In short, this legislation is going to save lives. It is going to \nsave money. It is going to provide a much better situation for people \nwho are running and operating trains, people who are traveling on \ntrains, and for those of us who are driving around in our cars, trucks, \nand vans, trying to get across a rail crossing.\n  Next I would like to turn to Amtrak, an issue that is near and dear \nto my heart. In our State, we have a lot of folks who take the train. \nAmtrak has a train station in Wilmington, DE, and that train station is \nabout the 11th or 12th busiest in the country. A lot of people depend \non Amtrak in my State, as they do up and down the Northeast corridor.\n  I used to serve on the Amtrak board of directors when I was Governor \nof Delaware. I rode Amtrak as a passenger. As someone who represents a \nState where we do a lot of repairs on locomotives, we do a lot of the \nrepair work on the passenger and dining cars and so forth, I wanted to \ntalk in sort of broad terms about this legislation.\n  Mr. President, what is the situation with the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate has an order to recess at 1:30.\n  Mr. CARPER. In that case, we better recess. I will have the \nopportunity later to pick up my remarks and talk about the Amtrak \nprovisions in this bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10041-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know this afternoon at some point the \nmajority leader intends to speak about the service of a number of the \nMembers of this body who are going to be retiring at the end of the \nyear. But seeing that people are elsewhere right now, I thought I might \nseize this moment and say a few words about two of my Republican \ncolleagues with whom I have had long relationships, and both of whom I \nrespect a great deal, and to wish both of them success as they leave \nthis body.\n\n\n                          Senator John Warner\n\n  The first is Senator John Warner. Right now, with the situation \nfacing this country, we are in more turmoil, we are facing greater \nproblems than at any time, probably, since the combination of the Great \nDepression and the end of World War II. We need people who are willing \nto work to solve the problems of this country rather than simply \nfalling back into partisan rhetoric or simple party loyalties.\n  I think it can fairly be said that throughout his lifetime of \nservice, and particularly his service in politics, there is one thing \neveryone can agree on about John Warner: He has always put the \ninterests of the people of Virginia and the people of this country \nahead of political party. He has been very clear at different times \nthat he and I are in different parties. But this is an individual who \nhas served this body with great wisdom and a deeply ingrained sense of \nfairness, and someone who has the temperament and the moral courage of \na great leader.\n  Our senior Senator has a history and a family heritage involving \npublic service. If you go into Senator Warner's office, you will see a \npicture of a great-uncle who lost his arm serving in the War Between \nthe States. His father was an Army doctor who participated in some of \nthe most difficult campaigns of World War I. Senator Warner himself \nenlisted at the age of 17 in the Navy toward the end of World War II \nand was able to take advantage of the GI bill to go to college. Then \nwhen the Korean war came about, he joined the Marine Corps, went to \nKorea as an officer of marines, and, in fact, remained as a member of \nthe Marine Corps Reserve for some period of time.\n  He, as most of us know, gave great service in a civilian capacity in \nthe Pentagon. He had more than 5 years in the Pentagon, first as Under \nSecretary of the Navy, and then as Secretary of the Navy, and after \nleaving as Secretary of the Navy, was the official responsible for \nputting together our bicentennial celebrations in 1976.\n  I first came to know John Warner my last year in the Marine Corps \nwhen I was a 25-year-old captain and was assigned, after having served \nin Vietnam, as a member of the Secretary of the Navy's staff. John \nWarner was the Under Secretary at the time. John Chafee--later also to \nserve in this body--was the Secretary. Then, toward the end of my time \nin the Marine Corps, John Warner was the Secretary of the Navy and, in \nfact, retired me from the Marine Corps in front of his desk when he was \nSecretary of the Navy. I have been privileged to know him since that \ntime.\n  I was privileged to follow him in the Pentagon, when I spent 5 years \nin the Pentagon and also was able to serve as Secretary of the Navy.\n  Shortly after I was elected to this body, Senator Warner and I sat \ndown and worked out a relationship that I think, hopefully, can serve \nas a model for people who want to serve the country and solve the \nproblems that exist, even if they are on different sides of this \nChamber. We figured out what we were not going to agree upon, and then \nwe figured out what we were going to be able to agree upon. I think it \nis a model of bipartisan cooperation on a wide range of issues, ranging \nfrom the nomination of Federal judges, to critical infrastructure \nprojects in the Commonwealth of Virginia, to issues facing our men and \nwomen in uniform, to issues of national policy.\n  It has been a great inspiration for me, it has been a great privilege \nfor me to be able to work with Senator Warner over these past 2 years.\n  Last week was a good example of how bipartisan cooperation, looking \nto the common good, can bring about good results when Judge Anthony \nTrenga made it through the confirmation process, an individual whom \nSenator Warner and I had interviewed and jointly recommended both to \nthe White House and to the Judiciary Committee.\n\n[[Page S10042]]\n\n  I am particularly mindful--I see the Senator; the senior Senator has \njoined us on the floor--I particularly am mindful of the journey I took \nupon myself my first day as a Member of the Senate when I introduced a \npiece of legislation designed to give those who have been serving since \n9/11 the same educational opportunities as the men and women who served \nduring World War II.\n  Perhaps the key moment in that journey, which over 16 months \neventually allowed us to have 58 cosponsors of that legislation, \nincluding 11 Republicans, was when Senator Warner stepped across the \naisle and joined me as a principal cosponsor, and we developed four \nlead sponsors on that legislation--two Republicans, two Democrats; two \nWorld War II veterans, two Vietnam veterans--that enabled us to get the \nbroad support of the Congress and eventually pass that \nlegislation. History is going to remember John Warner as a man who \naccomplished much here during his distinguished tenure. He was the \nfirst Virginia Senator to support an African American for the Federal \nbench. He was the first to support a woman. He was the first Virginia \nSenator to offer wilderness legislation. Senator Warner has never \nwavered in his determination to do what is right for America, even when \nit caused him from time to time to break with the leadership of his own \nparty.\n\n  There are important legacies, but perhaps more than anything else, we \nwill remember Senator John Warner's tenure here as having been a \npositive force for the people who serve in uniform. There is not a \nperson serving in the U.S. military today or who has served over the \npast 30 years whose life has not been touched by the leadership and the \npolicies of John Warner and whose military service has not been better \nfor the fact that Senator Warner, as a veteran, as someone who has \nserved in the Pentagon, and as someone who served on the Armed Services \nCommittee, understood the dynamic under which they had to live, \nunderstood the challenges they had to face when they served, and \nunderstood the gravity of the cost of military service. Senator John \nWarner has stood second to none in protecting our troops and their way \nof life.\n  When John Warner announced his retirement 13 months ago on the \ngrounds of the University of Virginia, he reminded us that at the end \nof the day, public service is a rare privilege. In my work with him \nover these many years, and particularly over the last 2 years, I can \nattest to the fact that he certainly approaches this work in that \nhumble spirit.\n  So on behalf of the people of Virginia and all those who have worn \nthe uniform of the United States in the past 30 years, I wish to thank \nSenator Warner for his exceptionally talented leadership and all he has \ndone and his staff has done for our State and for our country. This \ninstitution will miss John Warner, his kindness, his humility, his \nwisdom, and his dedicated service. I know we in Virginia will continue \nto benefit from his advice and his counsel for many years to come.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to say a few words today about Senator \nChuck Hagel, who will be leaving this body.\n  Chuck Hagel and I have known each other for more than 30 years. We \nboth came to Washington as young Vietnam veterans, determined to try to \ntake care of the readjustment needs of those who had served in Vietnam. \nSenator Hagel had been an infantry sergeant in Vietnam; wounded, came \nup, worked in the Senate for awhile, became a high-ranking official in \nthe Veterans' Administration. He later ran the USO before he came to \nthis body. He is known in this body as an expert on foreign affairs.\n  Again, as with Senator John Warner, he is someone who puts country \nfirst, who puts the needs of the people who do the hard work of society \nfirst. It has been a rare privilege for me to have made a journey with \nsomeone, beginning in the same spot in the late 1970s and ending up \nhere in the Senate. I know this country will hear more from Chuck Hagel \nin the future. I certainly wish him well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am very deeply moved by this moment. As \na matter of fact, now--this is just a month or so short of 30 years--I \ncan't think of another opportunity or moment in the Senate when I have \nbeen so moved and so grateful to a fellow Senator. I have served with \nfive individuals, you being the fifth now, in the Senate to come from \nVirginia, to form the team we have all had, some different in different \nways, but generally speaking, Virginia's two Senators have worked \ntogether on behalf of not only the Commonwealth but what is best for \nthe United States.\n  I remember one time so vividly we stood together here at the desk on \na rather complex issue, and there were clear political reasons for us \nto vote in a certain way. But you turned to me and you asked what I was \ngoing to do, and I replied, and you said: That is what I will do \nbecause that is in the best interest of the country though it may not \nbe politically to our benefit, or possibly to our State. But that is \nthis fine man whom I finished my career in the Senate with as my full \npartner and, most importantly, my deep and respected friend. Our \nrelationship, as you so stated, started many years ago--over 30--when \nwe worked with the Navy Secretary together.\n  You mentioned Vietnam. To this day, I think about that chapter in my \nlife. I remember John Chafee, whom I am sure you recall very well. He \nand I one time were asked to go down to the Mall. The Secretary of \nDefense sent us down there, and we put on old clothes and went down, \nand there were a million young men and women--over a million--\nexpressing their concerns about the loss of life, the war in Vietnam, \nand how the leadership of this country had not given, I believe, the \nfullest of support to those such as yourself, Senator, and Senator \nHagel, who fought so valiantly and courageously in that war.\n  In the years I have been privileged since that time to serve here in \nthe Senate--I might add a footnote that Senator Chafee or then-\nSecretary of the Navy Chafee, and I was Under Secretary--went back \ndirectly to the Secretary of Defense and sat in his office, and that \nwas sort of the beginning of the concept of ``Vietnamization'' when we \ntried to lay those plans to bring our forces home.\n  But anyway, in the years that passed, I remember so well working with \nSenator Mathias on the original legislation to establish the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial. I felt strongly that it would be some tribute \nfitting to the men and women who served, as you did, so valiantly \nduring that period. I think time has proven that while there was \nenormous controversy about that memorial, it has in a very significant \nmeasure helped those families and others who bore the brunt of that \nconflict, you being among them.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for working together this short \nperiod we have been here. As I leave, I leave with a sense of knowing \nthat for our Virginia, but perhaps even more importantly, for the \nUnited States of America, there is one man in Senator Webb who will \nalways do what is right for his country and will fear absolutely no one \nin trying to carry out that mission. Whether it be a vote or a piece of \nlegislation, or whatever it may be, he will persevere. He showed that \non the GI bill legislation.\n  I was privileged, as I might say, just to be a corporal in your squad \non that, but you led that squad with the same courage that you fought \nwith in Vietnam and that you will fight with today and tomorrow and so \nlong as you are a Member of the Senate. I hope perhaps maybe you might \nexceed my career of 30 years in the Senate, and that wonderful family \nof yours will give you the support my family--my lovely wife today and \nmy children--has given me so that I could serve here in the Senate.\n  America will always look down on you as a proud son. I don't know \nwhat the future may be, but I know there are further steps of greatness \nthat you will achieve, Senator. I wish you the best of luck from the \ndepths of my heart. I thank you for these words today, similar to words \nwe have shared, both of us, in speaking of our working partnership here \nin the Senate. I thank you, sir. I salute you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, if I might address the senior Senator \nthrough the\n\n[[Page S10043]]\n\nChair, it is a rare opportunity to say something like this on the \nSenate floor, but I will reiterate my appreciation for the leadership \nthe senior Senator from Virginia has shown in my case since 1971--it is \nhard to believe--as an example, the example he has set here in the \nSenate for 30 years in terms of how to conduct the business of \nGovernment. I can think of no one whom I would rather have shared the \npast 2 years with in terms of learning the business of the Senate and \nhaving something of a handoff here in terms of how we take care of the \ngood people of the Commonwealth of Virginia. There is only one other \nperson in this body I can say these words to, but I say them from my \nheart: Semper fidelis, John Warner. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank you.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is the Senate in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is postcloture on the motion to \nconcur.\n\n\n                Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor with a heavy \nheart and a clear purpose. Last Thursday would have been the 56th \nbirthday of a great actor, a devoted father and husband, Christopher \nReeve. Many Americans got to know Christopher Reeve when he put on that \nblue and red uniform of Superman and acted in so many Superman roles. \nHe was also on television and stage. So we always think of Christopher \nReeve as the first Superman.\n  Then, in May of 1995, Christopher Reeve was involved in an equestrian \naccident. He was riding a horse and got pitched off the horse. He \nsuffered injuries to his spinal column, starting in his neck, which \nleft him paralyzed from the neck down.\n  In the years following the accident, Christopher Reeve not only put a \nface on spinal cord injury for so many, but he motivated \nneuroscientists around the world to conquer the most complex diseases \nof the brain and the central nervous system.\n  Even before I met Mr. Reeve in 1998, I was a big admirer. Of course, \nI liked Superman movies. Then I watched what he did after he had been \nparalyzed. After the accident, he could afford the very best doctors \nand nurses, the best caregivers and therapies. He could have just \nwithdrawn into himself, focused on his own well-being which was a full-\ntime job in and of itself.\n  Christopher Reeve made a different choice that defined him as a great \nhuman being. He chose to become the man whom I first met in 1998 when \nhe first testified before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health, Human Services, and Education on which I was a ranking \nmember at that time. I had been chairman before and then Senator \nSpecter was ranking. In 1998, Senator Specter was chairman of that \nsubcommittee. Mr. Reeve came on a mission to give hope and help to \nother people with disabilities and thus became a kind of real-life hero \nto people around the world.\n  Later on, I got to know Christopher Reeve as a friend, someone who \nhad an impish sense of humor, a great smile, was warm and personable. \nHe spent all of his waking time, days, thinking about and getting \ninformation about spinal cord injuries, research that had been done, \nhow it was being researched here and in other parts of the world, at \nthe same time finding time to direct a movie.\n  Christopher Reeve began to inform me and others on the committee that \nthe kind of research we were doing into spinal cord paralysis was \ndisjointed; it was not well put together. Then he went on a mission to \nthink about, with others--with scientists and researchers and those of \nus in the Senate and the House--how we might accomplish pulling this \nresearch together in a more unified structure.\n  In 2002, I first introduced the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act with \nbipartisan cosponsors. The bill has passed the House twice, but we have \nnever succeeded in passing it here.\n  As I said, it is a bipartisan bill. It addresses the critical need to \naccelerate the discovery of better treatments and one day a cure for \nparalysis. As I said, currently paralysis research is carried out \nacross multiple disciplines with no effective means of coordination or \ncollaboration. Time, effort, and valuable research dollars are used \ninefficiently because of this problem. Families affected by paralysis \nare often unaware of critical research results, information about \nclinical trials, and best practices.\n  This bill will improve the long-term health prospects of people with \nparalysis and other disabilities by improving access to services, \nproviding information and support to caregivers and their families, \ndeveloping assistive technology, providing employment assistance, and \nencouraging wellness among those with paralysis.\n  In August of last year, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee cleared this bill for full Senate consideration. Two months \nafter that, our colleagues in the House passed the bill unanimously by \nvoice vote. Yet for the last 12 months, this bill has languished in the \nSenate, as I understand it, due to the objections of one Senator, my \nfriend, the junior Senator from Oklahoma. At least that is what I am \ntold. I could be corrected, but that is what I am told.\n  In the past, I have heard the Senator from Oklahoma question our role \nin promoting health legislation because he has said sometimes in the \npast that too often we get caught up in one cause or another pushed by \na celebrity and other worthwhile causes get left behind because they \ndon't have someone famous out there pushing for them. I guess once in a \nwhile I might agree with that point. But even though this legislation \nhas Christopher and Dana Reeve's names behind it, it was really written \nfor the thousands of ordinary Americans living with paralysis and \nspinal cord injuries and their families and friends who pushed the \ncause of improved research and treatment.\n  I want to read a couple of stories of Americans today. One story \nbelongs to Marilyn Smith of Hood River, OR. She is one of the many \nparalysis advocates who volunteer their time through the Unite to Fight \nParalysis organization. She took the time recently to share her story \nwith me. I want to read a portion of it for the Record. Here is what \nMarilyn said:\n\n       Paralysis doesn't just happen to an individual, it happens \n     to a family. In December of 2002, our son became a \n     quadriplegic when a careless driver failed to tighten the lug \n     nuts on one of his wheels. It came off and flew into our \n     son's pickup, shattering his cervical vertebra. Our family \n     was thrown into physical, emotional and financial chaos. We \n     have done the best we could after this calamity, but our \n     lives will never be the same. As parents, our greatest wish \n     before we pass on is to see our son's health restored. We \n     have traveled from Oregon to Washington, DC, for 4 straight \n     years to lobby for passage of the Christopher and Dana Reeve \n     Paralysis Act, a well-crafted piece of legislation with \n     bipartisan support that will make a measurable difference in \n     our lives.\n\n  I think Marilyn's story underscores the tremendous cost paralysis \nimposes on families. The Spinal Cord Injuries and Illness Center at the \nUniversity of Alabama Birmingham has done a lot of work to quantify \nthat cost. I believe their findings might surprise some of my \ncolleagues.\n\n  According to the Spinal Cord Injury and Illness Center, the first-\nyear cost of an injury to the C-1, C-4 vertebrae is upwards of \n$683,000, with costs in each subsequent year averaging out at more than \n$120,000. Think about that for a moment. That figure represents a cost \nof personal care attendants, medical treatment and therapy, \ntransportation, and all the necessary modifications made to one's home.\n  Leo Halland of Yankton, ND, knows this cost all too well. He has been \nliving with paralysis for the past 32 years. He, too, has a story to \ntell. I will read a short selection from a letter he sent over the \nweekend. He said:\n\n       I know there is much in life I will never understand, and \n     now near the top of that list are: One, how a single Senator \n     can stop a piece of good legislation; and, two, how some of \n     his colleagues can support those efforts. Failure to act on \n     this legislation is doing great medical harm.\n\n  I just have to say, frankly, I am surprised there continues to be an \nobjection to moving this bill. I negotiated this bill with my \nRepublican colleagues before it was marked up in the\n\n[[Page S10044]]\n\nHELP Committee in July of last year. During the course of those \nnegotiations, we received through Senator Enzi, who is the ranking \nmember of that committee, specific requests to, one, remove \nauthorizations for the titles related to the National Institute for \nHealth Research. In the interest of getting legislation passed, we \naccepted this change. We removed the NIH reporting provisions in \nresponse to concerns that they were duplicative of reporting \nrequirements in the NIH reauthorization legislation. So we took that \nout.\n  We responded to all of the feedback from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services and the NIH by incorporating both substantive and \ntechnical changes they wanted.\n  At that point, we were assured there were no more objections, and the \nbill passed out of our committee with no amendments and no objections. \nWe just passed it out of committee.\n  So given all of the efforts we made to meet concerns raised by \nSenators on the other side of the aisle, and given that Senators had an \nopportunity to file amendments at that time in the committee but chose \nnot to, I had every expectation that the bill would pass the full \nSenate. Instead, it continues to be held due to one Republican \nobjection. This bill is long overdue for passage.\n  When I introduced the bill 17 months ago, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, the \nDirector of the NIH, spoke at a rally in support of the bill. They had \nsuggestions on some changes which we did. But he spoke in support of \nthe bill. Here is something Dr. Zerhouni said that day:\n\n       So really as the Director of an institution that is \n     committed to making the discoveries that will make a \n     difference in people's lives, I feel proud and I feel \n     pleased. But at the same time, I'm humbled. I'm humbled \n     because in many ways [the Christopher and Dana Reeve \n     Paralysis Act] is the harbinger of what I see as the \n     combination of the public, the leadership in Congress, and \n     the administration and government in our country that is \n     absolutely unique, and humbled because at the same time, I \n     know it contains a lot of expectations from us. And I am \n     at the same time confident that we can deliver on these \n     expectations of NIH, with our sister agencies throughout \n     the government. But the key thing I would like to provide \n     is an expression of commitment. At the end of the day, if \n     you do not have leaders and champions that look at a \n     problem in its entirety, today in the 21st century, you \n     cannot make progress.\n\n  That was Dr. Zerhouni. I wholeheartedly agree with him. You have to \nlook at it in its entirety. Progress is vital in science and biomedical \nresearch. It is also important in the legislative process. As Senators, \nof course, we have a duty to ensure due diligence in considering \nlegislation. That is one of our responsibilities. But to keep this bill \nfrom getting an up-or-down vote, despite strong support from both sides \nof the aisle, and the fact that the House passed it unanimously, I am \nnot certain that is exercising due diligence. I don't know what it is \ncalled, but I don't know if that is due diligence.\n  Brooke Ellison of Stony Brook, NY, is another passionate advocate. \nShe was paralyzed from the neck down when she was 7 years old after she \nwas struck by a car while walking home from the first day of school. \nShe is now 25 years old. In the years since her accident, she has \ngraduated from college--Harvard--with an undergraduate degree and a \nmaster's degree, and founded the Brooke Ellison Project for those \nfacing paralysis and adversity, and she asked me to pass along these \nwords.\n\n       I have seen up close and in person how very quickly any one \n     of our lives can change and we find ourselves facing \n     challenges unlike anything we may have expected. Eighteen \n     years ago, I learned this lesson in a personal and profound \n     way. Yet each day, an increasing number of people find \n     themselves in similar circumstances, and we need to do all we \n     can to alleviate their suffering. Christopher Reeve lived his \n     life as a testament to helping to reduce the challenges \n     people suffering from paralysis face. The Christopher and \n     Dana Reeve Paralysis Act is critical to changing the fate, \n     and sometimes even dire conditions, that millions of people \n     face. And the events in my life have shown me all too clearly \n     how essential it is to be passed.\n\n  I wish to be clear; by putting this bill on hold, we are also putting \nBrooke Ellison and Leo Hallan and other people living in paralysis on \nhold. It tells the more than 400 Iraq war veterans who have returned \nwith spinal cord injuries that they are on hold. It puts the needs of \nBethany Winkler from Yukon on hold. She has been paralyzed for 7 years, \nsince falling in an accident. She has taken the time to come to \nWashington to lobby for this legislation. I met Bethany in the past, \nand I can testify to what a passionate and effective advocate she is \nfor the cause of paralysis research and care.\n  Although we often find ourselves on different sides of the table, I \nwish to say publicly I respect the fact that Senator Coburn believes \nstrongly this legislation inappropriately grows the size of the Federal \nGovernment. I have heard that stated. I see my friend is on the floor, \nand he can state it if he wants. But if that is the case, I wish to say \nI disagree with that assessment. I am on the Appropriations Committee, \nsure, but I am on an authorizing committee as well, and this \nlegislation appropriates no money for paralysis research. It doesn't \nappropriate any money for care or quality-of-life programs. It simply \nsays we authorize funding for programs. So they still have to be funded \nthrough the regular appropriations process.\n  So I come down to the floor with renewed hope. This past week, the \nSenate passed several bills by unanimous consent with new authorization \nfor Federal spending. Two of those bills, the Drug Endangered Children \nAct and the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, which were \nalso being held up, and again were authorizations for appropriations, \nreceived unanimous consent and were passed. So I have come to the floor \ntoday, and as soon as I finish, in another page or two, I will ask \nunanimous consent that the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act \npass.\n  But I am going to give two more cases. One is from Donna Sullivan, \nanother of the many concerned advocates for paralysis research and \ncare. Donna is fighting not for herself but for her son, and here is \nwhat she said:\n\n       Three years ago, my son was the lone survivor of an \n     airplane crash. His injuries were extensive, and my heart \n     literally felt as if it was broken. After numerous operations \n     and procedures, under the care of well-trained doctors in \n     three States, he has overcome all of his injuries except for \n     one, it is his spinal cord injury, which waits for science to \n     move forward and allow him further recovery.\n       Together, we have attended research symposiums and visited \n     our legislators in Washington, DC, to share our story and the \n     promise that research holds. It is our hope that the Senate \n     will join others who understand the potential and release \n     this bill. When you understand the potential paralysis \n     research holds, it is difficult to ignore, and it is \n     difficult for me to accept that some do.\n\n  Christopher Reeve spoke up passionately for people such as Donna \nSullivan and her son. Christopher Reeve's untimely death in 2004 robbed \nthe paralysis community of its most passionate and effective advocate. \nAs we know, his widow, wife Dana, continued her husband's quest until \nher untimely death in 2006 of lung cancer. Across the country, \nthousands of ordinary Americans, whose lives have been touched by \nparalysis, have taken up Christopher and Dana Reeve's advocacy work at \ngreat cost to their health and wealth.\n  Well, I have one last story I have to share with you. It has to do \nwith a young man--a big kid; strong. His dad had been in the Navy in \nWorld War II and imbued that in each of his kids. Each kid went in the \nmilitary--different branches. But this one kid, Kelly--big Irish kid--\nhe went in the Navy. He went in the Navy. He went to work on an \naircraft carrier. He was one of the launch people, an enlisted guy on \nthe deck of an aircraft carrier.\n  They were cruising off the coast of Vietnam. Unbeknownst to Kelly, on \none of the planes--it was an A-6 Intruder--the pilot had run up his \nengine. The intakes on an A-6 are on the bottom. They are big intakes. \nHe was not supposed to have run up his engine, but he ran up his engine \nto 100 percent of power. Kelly, doing his job, got too close to the \nintake and got sucked into the intake. He had a hard hat on--his Mickey \nMouse ears and his hard hat on--and evidently the pilot, through later \ninvestigations, saw something going wrong with his engine, heard a thud \nin his plane, and pulled the power back. Someone saw Kelly's feet \nsticking out of the intake, and they got people up there and rushed him \ndown to the infirmary on the ship and then put him in some kind of \ntraction thing, got him off the ship, and got him back to the States.\n\n  I will never forget the day my sister called me about Kelly. It was \nmy nephew. When my sister called me, I was a\n\n[[Page S10045]]\n\nMember of the House of Representatives, and she called me up to see \nwhat I could do to help. She was extremely distraught, as you can \nimagine. Kelly was 20 years old and had his life ahead of him. So I \nwent to work, as any Congressman would, for my family, and I got him in \nat the VA hospital out in California, near Stanford, and that is the \nfirst time I flew out to see him. He was quadriplegic at the time. He \ncouldn't move anything.\n  I can remember walking in there and seeing this kid--and I don't mean \nto be overly maudlin about this, but you see, I was a Navy pilot. I \nused to fly my plane around a lot of times, and these kids always \nlooked up to their father because he was in the Navy and I was in the \nNavy. I was a Navy pilot. I still have pictures of my jet and young \nKelly as a kid sitting in the cockpit of my jet with my helmet on \ndreaming that someday he, too, would do something such as that. So I \nkind of felt a lot of responsibility for this because I had encouraged \nhim to get into the Navy, to go into aviation, to do things with \nairplanes.\n  I will never forget the first time I saw him lying in that hospital \nbed at Stanford--I think that is right, the Stanford VA hospital--and \nthe look on his face. I mean, this kid was scared. He couldn't move \nanything, and he was wondering what was going to happen to him.\n  Well, he had good medical care, and the good news is that over some \nyears he actually got the use of his arms back, through sheer will and \ndetermination. And through those years he then went back to school. I \nremember how tough it was for him, using a wheelchair to get around on \ncampus. That was before the Americans with Disabilities Act. That was \nbefore we had ramps and widened doorways and things such as that. This \nwas in the 1980s when he was going to school.\n  I remember his father building him ramps and stuff so he could get in \nand out of places and learn how to live. Well, that happened 28 years \nago--28 years ago. Now, the good news is Kelly is alive and well. He \nlives by himself, in his own home, and has a van that has all these \nautomatic lifts that put him into the van so he can drive himself \naround. He can't use the lower half of his body, but he can drive \naround.\n  He started a small business and he is very self-sufficient. I saw \nKelly--well, whenever the Democratic Convention was--because he lives \nin Colorado, and so I went to see him. We were talking about this and \nthat, a lot of things, and I can't begin to tell you what a profound \neffect Christopher Reeve had on my nephew's life. It seemed as though \nall of a sudden there was someone like him, who was big and strapping \nand full of life, with a lot of energy, and then one accident and that \nis it. So I could see Kelly could identify with someone such as a \nChristopher Reeve, a healthy, strong, vibrant man, and suddenly one \naccident and that is it. So he followed him. Kelly is on the computer, \non the Internet, and he follows research all the time. During this \nperiod of time in the late 1990s, he became more and more encouraged by \nwhat Christopher Reeve was doing and how he was pulling all this stuff \ntogether. He kept asking me about it: What are you guys going to do? \nAre you going to pass this? Are you going to do something about \nparalysis research? Kelly follows this today to the nth degree.\n  Then Christopher Reeve passed away, and then his wife. I saw my \nnephew Kelly out in Colorado last month. Once again he asked me, he \nsaid: Are you going to get that bill passed or not?\n  I said: I don't know. I will try. I am still trying.\n  Of course he knows all about this. He knows it passed the House. He \nfollows all this. He just wondered what the problem was.\n  I said: A person has a hold on it.\n  Can't you bring it up, do this?\n  I don't know if we can bring it up or not--go through cloture and \ndebate and all that kind of stuff. I don't know. He reminded me it \npassed the House. I said: I know that, it passed the House unanimously. \nIt passed out of our committee.\n  So I told Kelly when I saw him in August: We will come back in \nSeptember and I will try another go at it and we will see what happens. \nI hope we get it passed.\n  Here we have the medical community, in the personage of Dr. Zerhouni, \nsaying this does what we should be doing, bringing everything together, \ncoordinating it. It authorizes appropriations but doesn't appropriate \nany money.\n  I can tell you, it is not just because there was a famous person \nbehind it. There are people such as my nephew Kelly all over the United \nStates who are wondering, are we going to pursue this? I don't like to \ngive anyone false hope. My nephew is a realistic person. He has lived \nwith this for 28 years now. But he still believes strongly that we \nought to be pushing the frontiers and that we ought to be doing \neverything we can to promote research, of course--obviously into \nparalysis, because that is what affects him. If anybody wants to talk \nabout this and what needs to be done, he can talk about it at greater \nlength and in more depth and understanding than can I.\n  I was not going to do this until my colleague from Oklahoma came to \nthe floor. I see him here. All I say is I hope we can move this bill. I \nam hopeful, after looking it over and understanding we do not \nappropriate any money, and looking at what we did with a couple of \nother bills earlier, we can get this bill through. I will be glad to \nengage in any colloquies such as that.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1183\n\n  I am constrained to ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 326, S. 1183, the Christopher \nand Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, that the committee substitute amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill as amended be read a third time and passed, and \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, first let me say to my \ncolleague, I know he is dedicated to this cause. It is an important \ncause. I have four basic problems with what we are doing here.\n  We did negotiate this bill. I also expressed in public that I would \nnot allow this bill to go unless we had a full debate on the Senate \nfloor. That has never been in confusion.\n  I also stated if we were in fact to offset the authorizations in the \nbill with some of the wasteful spending that we have today--and I \nunderstand the contention by the Senator from Iowa, who is also an \nappropriator who does not believe this will lead to spending--if we do \nnot believe it will lead to spending, why authorize it in the first \nplace? It is a false hope.\n  The third point I would make is everything this bill wants to do can \nalready be done, except name it after Christopher and Dana Reeve--\neverything. So what I would like is a unanimous consent request, after \nrebuttal from the Senator from Iowa, that I be given 10 minutes to \nexplain my objections to the bill in detail, and also to offer for the \nrecord a letter from Dr. Zerhouni, dated July 30 of this year, in which \nhe adamantly opposes any disease-specific bills. He outlined \nspecifically why they should not be there.\n  The final point I would make, we spend $5.9 billion on this right \nnow. We should spend more, but we do not have the money to spend more \nbecause this Congress will not get rid of $300 billion worth of \nwasteful spending. We appropriate $300 billion that is pure waste every \nyear. It is not that we do not have the money. It is not that this bill \nwill spend the money. It is not that we cannot have this; it can happen \nright now under the leadership at NIH. It is the fact that the very \nproblems we are faced with today in terms of the financial collapse of \nthis country and the liquidity of this country is because we have gone \ndown a road of fiscal irresponsibility.\n  On that basis, I will object and await Senator Harkin's rebuttal. I \ndo congratulate him for his commitment and his dedication. I believe \nthe people at NIH want to solve this as well as anybody else and they \nrecognize that they already have the power to do this.\n  I will make one final comment. This bill could have come to the \nfloor. We could have taken care of it in 2\\1/2\\ hours if we had debate \nand amendments. The majority leader refused to let this bill come to \nthe floor.\n  It is important for the American people know what a hold is. A hold \nis saying: Let the bill come to the floor, but I don't want to pass it \nwith my vote\n\n[[Page S10046]]\n\nunless I have an opportunity to debate it and amend it, and what has \nbeen done has precluded us on that.\n  We did a lot of negotiations on this. The one thing we couldn't get \nnegotiated is offsetting the negotiating level. Everybody knows that is \na nonstarter with me. That is the only way we establish fiscal \ndiscipline in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as I mentioned, and I ask my friend from \nOklahoma, two bills I understand went through by unanimous consent this \nweek, the Drug Endangered Children's Act and the Emmett Till Unsolved \nCivil Rights Crimes bills. I understand the Senator from Oklahoma had \nholds on those bills. Is that correct?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely. In response to your question, the Emmett Till \nbill, we attempted to do that. It was passed in connection with other \nbills, and we believed, since we had assurances that the appropriators \nwould in fact take care of that inside the Department of Justice, we \ndid not have that in the bill but outside, the appropriators would take \ncare of that and we wouldn't spend additional money.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Do I understand from my friend from Oklahoma there was \nnot an offset for the authorizations in that bill? And then the other \nwas the Drug Endangered Children's Act. I am told there was not an \noffset for the authorization in that bill either. The Senator did not \nhave a hold on that bill?\n  Mr. COBURN. No, I never had a hold on that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Those were just two passed by unanimous consent that did \nnot have----\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. COBURN. What I can tell the Senator is I have held every bill \nthat comes before this body that we have an objection to \nconstitutionally, or from the Director of NIH, that does spend money \nthat is already for them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask my friend from Oklahoma, did the director of NIH--I \ndon't have a copy of that letter. Did the Director of NIH object to \nthis bill? Because he already said he supported it.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will gladly deliver to the Senator a copy of his \nletter. You can read it. What he objects to is any disease-specific \nbill. The reason for that is very simple. There are over--let me give \nyou the exact number. There are 12,161 subcategories of diseases. His \nprinciple is we ought to let the scientists decide the direction of the \nresearch, not Congress. Because if we decided on this and we set it up \nand a consortium will take it directly from the research--if we did \nthat on everything, we would have the most misguided, misdirected, and \nwasteful expenditures on research you could imagine. He lists \nspecifically the fact that we had 2,036 categories and over 12,000 \nsubcategories, and philosophically he objects to all disease-specific \nbills.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond to my friend from Oklahoma, one of the reasons \nhe wouldn't mention this is because, as my friend from Oklahoma surely \nknows, paralysis is not a specific disease. Paralysis can happen across \na wide spectrum of diseases and illnesses and conditions. So this is \nnot a specific disease. In that way, this is not a disease-specific \nbill as such, and that is probably where the confusion comes in. \nBecause Dr. Zerhouni was very supportive of this approach; I read it in \nhis comments that he made. But he is against disease-specific \nauthorizations or appropriations. I can tell the Senator from Oklahoma, \nso am I, and I chair that. I chair it now. I have been ranking member \nor chair of that subcommittee going back 18 years. I cannot remember \none time ever appropriating specifically one disease over another.\n  There are times, of course, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, in \nwhich we as legislators, as public servants, take information and input \nfrom our constituents or from the country and through the hearing \nprocess--and this is usually on the authorizing side more than the \nappropriating side--try to give some guidance and direction to those to \nwhom we give our taxpayers' money. Again, we have prodded NIH in the \npast to perhaps do certain things.\n  I mean we, the Congress, have started different institutes at the \nNational Institutes of Health. At different times people come together \nand say there should be an institute to look at this and we, as public \npolicy people, set that up.\n  Then there are times when we get the Director of NIH, or some of the \nother heads, some of these people here from these different institutes, \nand we ask them, What are you doing about this kind of research? Spinal \nmuscular atrophy, which I never heard of before until a few years ago, \nI found out it is even more prevalent and has a higher mortality rate \nthan muscular dystrophy. But they weren't doing much research into \nspinal muscular atrophy, so we talked about that, we explored that. We \ntalked about a lot of things in cancer or Parkinson's disease, in which \nwe explored with these heads of NIH what the public wants and what we \nare hearing from the public. They take that into account. They may make \nsome adjustments one way or the other.\n  I don't see anything wrong with that. That is part of our legitimate \nrole as public servants, and responding to the legitimate requests and \nneeds of the public. The people who work at NIH, and the people who run \nthese institutes, are not high priests of some religious order who do \nnot answer to anyone except the head person. They have to answer to the \npublic. These are public moneys that go in there.\n  Sometimes we consult with them, we talk with them, bring them \ninformation and say, here, the public wants to know why we are not \ndoing more in this area. They take that into account, sometimes \nrespond--sometimes better than others--sometimes not. But at least that \nis the input we have and that is what we are saying here with this \nlegislation. We are not telling them exactly what they have to do.\n  Again, the Senator from Oklahoma says they can do everything that is \nin this bill. But they are not doing it. That is the point. They are \nnot doing it. You can disagree. You can say they should not do it. I \ndid not hear the Senator from Oklahoma say they should not be doing \nwhat we have in the bill. He is not saying that. All I heard him say \nwas that he wanted to debate it for a couple of hours and offer an \namendment.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, as a member of the HELP Committee \nfrom which this bill came, the Senator from Oklahoma had all kinds of \nopportunities in the committee to amend this bill. For all I know, some \nof the changes we made may have come from him. They came through \nSenator Enzi, who is the ranking member, and we incorporated them into \nthe bill. But the Senator from Oklahoma cannot deny that he was a \nmember of this committee when this bill passed out of committee. If the \nSenator from Oklahoma wanted to amend it, he had every opportunity to \ndo so at that time. Yet no objection was raised when we passed it out \nof committee; only when we get it here on the floor.\n  We operate around here a lot of times on unanimous consent. And we \nusually do it on bills that are generally accepted by everybody. We \nhotline, and our staffs look at them to see whether anyone has an \nobjection. This bill has been hotlined on both sides of the aisle. Out \nof 100 Senators, only one Senator has an objection, the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Now, again, people wonder--this one letter from this one woman says: \nHow can one Senator stop something like this? Well, you are seeing one \nSenator can.\n  Now, again, to the extent that the Senator from Oklahoma has a \nlegitimate point, his point is that this could be brought up under the \nnormal process and debated and passed. Well, it looks as though we are \ngoing to be back again on Wednesday. I will have to consult with our \nleadership. But if the Senator from Oklahoma would agree to a couple of \nhours of debate, an amendment that would be voted up or down, if he has \nan amendment or two, and then final passage, maybe we could do that on \nWednesday.\n  I do not know what the heck we are going to be doing Wednesday. Quite \nfrankly, we could do that. I understand we are going to be in tomorrow, \nbut no legislative business can be done tomorrow under the Jewish \nholiday, but we could on Wednesday.\n  So if the Senator from Oklahoma wants to enter into an agreement for \nan hour or two, I do not know if anyone\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\nelse wants to debate it. If he wants to offer an amendment or two or \nsomething like that, maybe we can have a vote on it, voice vote it. \nMaybe he wants a record vote on it. I do not know. But I have not heard \nany kind of a suggestion from the Senator from Oklahoma that we could \ndo something like that.\n  So, again, we operate around here in a spirit of comity. What that \nmeans is we kind of trust one another. You know, I kind of trust the \nSenator from Michigan; I trust the Senator from Idaho on a lot of \nthings. We build ourselves on trust. We do not try to pull the wool \nover someone's eyes here. We do not try to slip something through to \nwhich someone may have an objection.\n  So if we have bills like this we hotline them. We have them called \naround. Lord knows, we have plenty of staff around here. They look at \nall of these things to see if there is something in a bill their \nSenator would object to or want to change. We do that for bills that \nare generally widely accepted. A lot of times bills come back: There is \nno objection. Go ahead and pass them through.\n  I thought this was one of those simply because it came out of \ncommittee. The Senator from Oklahoma was on the committee--is on the \ncommittee--and had no objections when it came out of committee. We had \nincorporated all of the changes that Senator Enzi gave us. We \nincorporated those plus changes from NIH and the Department of Health \nand Human Services. So it is very frustrating then to have this \nobjection at this time.\n  Now, one other point the Senator from Oklahoma said. He said this is \nan authorization for appropriations. That is true as most of the bills \nare that we pass around here. One way or the other it is an \nauthorization. But he says that will lead to new spending and blah, \nblah, blah. That is not necessarily true. It may be that we may want to \nput some money in this program, but we may want to take it from \nsomeplace else. We could do that. That has been done a lot around here. \nWe may think that, well, perhaps we will take a little bit here and a \nlittle bit here and put it into this. Appropriations committees do that \nall the time. So it is not necessarily true this is going to lead to \nany new spending. It may lead to a realignment of spending but not \nnecessarily new. So the Senator from Oklahoma is not quite correct that \nit would lead to new spending.\n  Secondly, paralysis is not a disease-specific illness. It cuts across \nall kinds of diseases, illnesses, and conditions. Then I do not know--\nthe Senator mentioned something about $5.9 million. I brought that \ndown, but I have no idea what that is all about.\n  I also have a letter from the Congressional Budget Office, dated July \n25, 2008, to the Honorable Kent Conrad as chairman of the Committee on \nBudget. There were certain questions in here that I thought were \npertinent to one of the objections raised by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Question No. 1: Does an authorization of future appropriations \nprovide the authority for Federal programs or agencies to incur \nobligations and make payments from the Treasury?\n  Answer: No. A simple authorization of appropriations does not provide \nan agency with the authority to incur obligations or make payments from \nthe Treasury.\n  Question: Even if legislation authorizes appropriations for a \nprogram, is it not the case that a subsequent act of Congress is \nrequired before an agency can spend money pursuant to the \nauthorization?\n  Answer: Yes.\n  This is from the head of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  For discretionary programs created through an authorization, the \nauthority to incur obligations is usually provided in a subsequent \nappropriations act. An agency must have such an appropriation before it \ncan incur obligations.\n  Question No. 4: If no new spending occurs under authorizing \nlegislation, does it have the effect of increasing the Federal deficit \nand/or reducing the Federal surplus?\n  Answer: No. An authorization of appropriations by itself does not \nincrease Federal deficits or decrease surpluses. However, any \nsubsequent appropriation to fund the authorized activity would affect \nthe Federal budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter appear at this point in the \nRecord, as well as the July 30, 2008, letter to Congressman Barton from \nDr. Zerhouni.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2008.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter responds to the questions \n     you posed on July 17, 2008, about the impact on the federal \n     budget from enacting legislation that authorizes future \n     appropriations but does not affect direct spending or \n     revenues. Consequently, this letter does not address \n     legislation that would permit agencies to incur obligations \n     in advance of appropriations (for example, legislation \n     providing new contract authority).\n       Question #1: Does an authorization of future appropriations \n     provide the authority for federal programs or agencies to \n     incur obligations and make payments from the Treasury?\n       Answer: No. A simple authorization of appropriations does \n     not provide an agency with the authority to incur obligations \n     or make payments from the Treasury.\n       Question #2: Can an agency or program spend money without \n     the authority from Congress to incur obligations and make \n     payments from the Treasury?\n       Answer: No. An agency is not allowed to spend money without \n     the proper authority from Congress to incur obligations. (See \n     31 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, which outlines limitations on expending \n     and obligating funds by officers and employees of the United \n     States Government.)\n       Question #3: Even if legislation authorizes appropriations \n     for a program, isn't it the case that a subsequent act of \n     Congress is required before an agency can spend money \n     pursuant to the authorization?\n       Answer: Yes. For discretionary programs created through an \n     authorization, the authority to incur obligations is usually \n     provided in a subsequent appropriations act. An agency must \n     have such an appropriation before it can incur obligations. \n     (Legislation other than appropriation acts that provides such \n     authority is shown as increasing direct spending.)\n       Question #4: If no new spending can occur under the \n     authorizing legislation, does it have the effect of \n     increasing the federal deficit and/or reducing the federal \n     surplus?\n       Answer: No. An authorization of appropriations, by itself, \n     does not increase federal deficits or decrease surpluses. \n     However, any subsequent appropriation to fund the authorized \n     activity would affect the federal budget.\n       Question #5: Would CBO's projection of federal debt change \n     as a result of enacting legislation that only authorizes \n     future appropriations? Is it not correct that the agency's \n     projection of future debt would be identical both before and \n     after the enactment of such legislation?\n       Answer: Enacting legislation that only authorizes future \n     appropriations would not result in an increase in CBO's \n     projection of federal debt under its baseline assumptions.\n       I hope this information is useful to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter R. Orszag,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Health & Human Services, National \n           Institutes of Health,\n                                      Bethesda, MD, July 30, 2008.\n     Hon. Joe Barton,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Barton: This letter responds to your request to \n     update you on implementation of the NIH Reform Act's \n     provisions requiring trans-NIH research coordination \n     supported by a Common Fund.\n       I am pleased to report that trans-NIH research has become a \n     vital component of our research enterprise. The NIH Reform \n     Act has enabled this Agency to adapt to new research \n     opportunities while continuing to pursue the latest and best \n     science. Congress has appropriated $495.6 million to support \n     such coordinated research projects as molecular libraries, \n     metabolomics technology development, the human microbiome, \n     epigenomics, computational biology, clinical research and \n     high risk science. These endeavors reflect the value of \n     research not defined by any single disease, but by gaps in \n     our knowledge of human biological systems that play a role in \n     all diseases.\n       As examples, the Microbiome and Epigenome initiatives are \n     the result of technological advances and discoveries \n     emanating from the Human Genome Project. The subsequent \n     innovations in high-throughput sequencing and other \n     techniques have given us tools to search for microorganisms \n     associated with the human body that have not been previously \n     identified. The Microbiome project will decipher this \n     underworld of particles and define their role in health and \n     disease Similarly, epigenetics follows the success of the \n     Genome Project by focusing on the regulation of gene \n     expression, leading to the understanding of how our genes \n     respond to developmental and environmental signals. Such \n     research efforts are accomplished solely through \n     collaborations and the focus on basic biology unrelated to \n     specific organ systems or diseases.\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\n       We also have created multiple-Institute collaborations for \n     the Obesity Research Task Force, the Blueprint for \n     Neuroscience, the NIH Nanotechnology Task Force and the NIH \n     Pain Consortium.\n       This trend should continue in the best interests of \n     scientific discovery. As I have repeatedly testified before \n     Congress, the key transformation from yesterday's approach to \n     medical research to the science of today has been the \n     convergence of concepts, opportunities and needs across all \n     conditions and diseases. As we learn more about the molecular \n     causes of diseases, we have found great similarities among \n     the mechanisms that lead to diseases--once thought unrelated. \n     Increasingly, research in one field finds unexpected \n     application in another. The greatest research advances of \n     recent years involve the fields of molecular and cell biology \n     as well as genomics and proteomics. These applications will \n     not be limited to specific diseases or populations. Greater \n     interdisciplinary efforts will be required as the mysteries \n     of human biology are uncovered. The approaches mandated by \n     the NIH Reform Act will require NIH to seek new ways of \n     conceptualizing and addressing scientific questions. The \n     translation from discovery to patient care will be better \n     facilitated.\n       The scientific boundaries between NIH's Institutes and \n     Centers have become blurred by the interdisciplinary \n     coordination among them. The functional integration required \n     by the Reform Act has helped this process. As you consider \n     legislation affecting NIH in the future, I caution you that \n     it would be a grave mistake to go backwards in mandating \n     disease-specific research at a time when barriers need to be \n     torn down, not rebuilt.\n       Recent discoveries demonstrate common characteristics for \n     many varying diseases. These discoveries have spawned new \n     ideas, methods and technologies leading to a new era of \n     personalized medical treatment that will predict and preempt \n     disease while requiring greater participation of patients in \n     their own care. We are moving from the current paradigm of \n     late, reactive intervention to a future paradigm of early \n     intervention characterized by treatment tailored to the \n     personal makeup of each patient.\n       We are discovering the underpinnings of disease at a \n     staggering rate. For example, in the case of type 2 diabetes, \n     one of the greatest health threats facing our Nation, we have \n     progressed from having no knowledge of genetic factors ten \n     years ago to discovering two genes associated with the \n     disease five years ago, to 16 genes today. And in a matter of \n     days, an additional 14 genes will be revealed. These \n     discoveries are fueled by various components of medical \n     research, including basic genomics that are part of our \n     multidisciplinary approach to disease research.\n       We are certain that the best approach to research at NIH is \n     the functional integration of research programs at our \n     Institutes and Centers. The flexibility provided in the NIH \n     Reform Act allows us to adapt to changes in science by \n     pursuing the common factors of disease. Of course, NIH will \n     focus on individual diseases, as appropriate and in accord \n     with independent, peer-reviewed science. However, disease-\n     specific mandates, while well intended, might undermine the \n     progress we have made.\n       Please let me know if you are interested in additional \n     details of NIH's implementation of the Reform Act. I have \n     sent a similar letter to Chairman Dingell.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Elias A. Zerhouni,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. So, again, I see my friend from Oklahoma has departed the \nfloor briefly.\n  Madam President, I put in a unanimous consent request. Has it been \nobjected to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I heard there was a reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator did object.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It has been objected to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. May I inquire of the Senator how much more floor time he \nwill take?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am about done.\n  Well, I am sorry for so many people who suffer from paralysis in this \ncountry who really have, many of them, traveled to Washington at their \nown expense, at great personal not only expense but inconvenience and \ntrouble and effort--can you imagine what it must be like--who had every \nreason to believe this would pass and give them new hope, new \nencouragement that we were now going to be able to bring a new focus, \ncoordination, to this.\n  Now, again, the Senator says they can do everything that is in this \nbill already. The fact is, they are not. That is why we are here. That \nis why we are Senators. That is why we are public servants. That is why \nthe public elected us to come here and do things, to get the Government \nto do things that it is not doing or to stop it from doing something \nthat it is doing.\n  This is one of the things we ought to be telling the people who are \ninvolved in this research they ought to be doing. They ought to do \nthis. We do it all the time. And if they will not do it, we ought to be \ntelling them to do it. I am sorry, again, that this Christopher and \nDana Reeve Paralysis Act has been stopped by a single Senator. I wish \nwe could find some way of getting around it. I ask my friend from \nOklahoma if he does not mind, the Senator said something about debating \nthis bill and opening it for amendment.\n  We are going to be here on Wednesday. Now, I have not cleared this \nwith our leadership--I have to do that, of course; I do not run the \nSenate. But I would have to clear it with our leadership, and then our \nleadership would have to clear it with the other side. But if we can \nget a couple of hours on Wednesday to debate this bill and amend it in \na 2-hour period of time, with an up-or-down vote on an amendment or \ntwo, would that be acceptable to the Senator?\n  Mr. COBURN. It would be more than acceptable provided the bill comes \nto the floor and offsets the authorizations. The problem we have is \nthat in the last year, in your subcommittee alone on appropriations, we \nhad 398 million dollars' worth of earmarks outside of the authorization \nprocess. None of them were authorized.\n  Now you want to spend more money on programs that you want to \nauthorize, but you will not take away the $398 million of earmarks that \nwere never authorized. That is my whole point. Bring the bill to the \nfloor, offset some spending somewhere else, and we will not even have \nto go to the floor. Just offset it; you can have the bill.\n  But the fact is, nobody wants to offset it. The intention is to spend \nthis money. Even though we play the games, how did we get $9.6 trillion \nin debt? We got it playing this same game, saying: Here is $115 \nmillion; it does not cost anything. But that is really untrue because \nit does. If you authorize it, you are going to spend more money. We \nhave grown 61 percent since 2001 in terms of discretionary spending in \nthis country, and we are broke. And we have a financial crisis in front \nof us.\n  I am trying to stand and say, if you want to do something, get rid of \nsome of the 300 billion dollars' worth of waste, which I consider 398 \nmillion dollars' worth of earmarks that were unauthorized waste. So it \nis easy to bring it up. Bring this bill without the authorizing money, \nput it in, you got it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Oklahoma again, the Senator from \nOklahoma did not object to a bill passing this week by unanimous \nconsent that has an authorization for appropriations in it. Is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is true.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Oklahoma, that is very true, on \nthe Emmett Till bill, but not on this one.\n  Mr. COBURN. We received assurances that it would be offset at the \nappropriations level.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I can assure my friend--I said this when my friend \nfrom Oklahoma was off the floor--the Senator from Oklahoma seems to say \nthat since it was an authorization for appropriations in here, that we \nare going to appropriate new money. That is not always the case. \nSometimes the Appropriations Committee will take money from other \nthings; maybe take a little bit here, take a little bit here and put it \ninto something else. That happens a lot, I can tell the Senator, as an \nappropriator.\n  So it does not always necessarily follow because we authorize the \nmoney that we are going to add new money. We could take it from other \nplaces. We do not know.\n  Mr. COBURN. In response to the Senator through the Chair, that is a \nrarity that occurs here. The fact is, the Federal Government is growing \nthree times faster than the income of the people in this country. It is \nbecause we will not put our own financial house in order.\n  I want to do the best we can do for people with paralysis. I think we \nought to get rid of some of the 380 billion dollars' worth of waste and \ndouble the money in NIH. That is what I think. But we will not, nobody \ncan, including my colleague from Iowa. When I have offered amendments \non the floor to get rid of wasteful spending, rarely, if ever, have you \njoined me to get rid of the wasteful spending. Instead, we have \ncontinued wasteful spending.\n  Just like we are going to talking about Amtrak. Amtrak has a $100 \nmillion subsidy. Nobody in this country,\n\n[[Page S10049]]\n\nother than us, would allow Amtrak to continue losing $100 million a \nyear on food subsidies on the train. No airline does that. No bus \ncompany does that. But because we have a $2.6 billion subsidy, we think \nit is fine that we should subsidize people's food on the train.\n  I can give you a thousand examples of things that we should be doing \nthat we are not. I am not opposed to the efforts that you want to try \nto accomplish. What I am saying is we need a discipline change in this \nCongress. The American people have had it with us. We are wasting money \nhand over foot. And it is not what you want to do is bad, I am for what \nyou want to do, I am saying let's get some discipline and let's make \nsome priority choices.\n  Every family out there has to choose among priorities. They have to \nmake a hard choice on what is important and what is not.\n  This is important, yes. We have told your staff the moment this \npassed the committee that we were going to hold it on the Senate floor \nunless it was offset. That is not a new threat. That is not news to \nyour staff. They have known that for a long time, and so does every \nMember of this body. In fact, you received a letter from me in January \nof 2007 that said very specifically: If you bring a bill to the floor \nthat is not offset, that is going to spend new money, unless we are \ngoing to get it debated and offer amendments, we are going to object. \nSo that is where we stand.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, he just let a bill go through this \nweek that had an authorization for appropriations on it and let it go \nthrough under unanimous consent, but not this one. So I see it is up to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, as one Senator, to decide what is good and \nwhat is bad around here.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, we also stopped 10 billion dollars' worth of new \nauthorizations this year. We also stopped $10 billion. There is no \nquestion the Emmett Till bill went through with the assurances. I am \nnot 100 percent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What assurances? I am an appropriator. I did not give you \nany assurances. No one asked me about it. So, obviously, now the \nSenator from Oklahoma has set himself up as the arbitrator of what is \ngood and bad and right and wrong and everything else around here.\n  Now, come on, there are 100 Senators around here.\n  I wish to respond to one other thing about Amtrak. The Senator from \nOklahoma mentioned the airlines. This is something I know a little bit \nabout. I fly a lot of airplanes. Every commercial airline in the \ncountry now uses GPS, global positioning satellites. Do you know how \nmuch they spent to put all those satellites up there? Zero. The \ntaxpayers of this country put up billions of dollars. We maintain them. \nWe keep them in orbit. When one decays, we put another one up. We keep \n24 in orbit all the time. Not only do our airlines use it, every \nairline around the world uses it, as do ships and everybody else. That \nis not a subsidy for the airlines? How about all the traffic \ncontrollers? They don't work for the airlines, they work for the \nGovernment. How about all the navigation systems we maintain, the \nApproach System, the ILSs, and everything else, paid for by the \ntaxpayers? We appropriate money around here all the time for airports, \nrunway lights, approach systems that all the airlines use. They don't \npay for all of those facilities. How about all the airports? Local \ncities provide the land.\n  If my friend really wants to see how much we are subsidizing the \nairlines, add it up. It would be a heck of a lot more than what we are \nsubsidizing Amtrak. But I am not opposed to that, subsidies for \ntransportation, for new technologies, for moving people. I am not \nopposed.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is sort of saying we subsidize Amtrak but \nwe don't the airlines. I didn't mean to get into that, but that is the \npoint I was trying to make.\n  Lastly, on this issue of offsetting authorizations, now we have to \noffset every authorization that comes up here. I want to ask the \nSenator from Oklahoma--we just passed a Defense authorization bill, \nauthorizes a lot of new things in there. I ask the Senator from \nOklahoma, were any of those offset?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely not. I voted against it and proudly did so \nbecause we had $16.8 billion worth of earmarks in there that will be \nforced onto the American taxpayer that will never see the light of day. \nThey were in the report language, and we put something in the bill that \nsaid you couldn't amend it. None of those are competitively bid; $16 \nbillion worth of earmarks, none of them competitively bid. So what \nhappens? Defense authorization, we got $16 billion that we probably \ncould have bought for 10, but because we have a system that says we are \nnot going to watch out for the taxpayer, we will not do it.\n  So what I would say to the Senator is, what you want to do is great. \nI am not against it. How you are doing it I am against. Unless we \nchange how we do things here, until we start becoming responsible \nfiscally, there has to be somebody putting on the brakes. I don't want \nto be known as a Senator who blocks research, but in fact, as the \ndoctor related, this can all be done, and they are probably doing it.\n  The Senator from Iowa voted for the reform of NIH. You proudly voted \nfor the reform of NIH. Paralysis is a disease-specific category because \nit is based on a problem in terms of mobility. So it falls into a \ncategory.\n  I don't know whether he wants this specifically, but what I am saying \nto you is, if you will bring a bill with $115 million worth of offsets \nto the floor in terms of authorization, we will say yes tomorrow.\n  The point is, until we establish with the American people that we are \ngoing to be as wise with their money as they are with their money, then \nwe have to do some changing.\n  I do not apologize at all for standing in the way of this bill on \nprinciple. Somebody has to say timeout in this country in terms of \nspending. A newborn child born this year faces $400,000 in unfunded \nliability. When you fund the $115 million and if you offset it with \nsomething else, something else will get offset. The average increase in \nthis area has been about 7.5 percent per year. What is the name of all \nthose children who aren't going to get to go to college, will not have \na great opportunity economically for the future, because we won't live \nwithin our means?\n  The last time I knew, when the airlines made money, they paid taxes. \nSo, in fact, they are contributing to all those things that were \nmentioned because they are taxed at one of the highest corporate tax \nrates in the world. One of the reasons the airlines can't compete is \nbecause we have a tax rate that essentially is close to 50 percent by \nthe time we add in State income taxes. So they participated in the \ndevelopment of all those programs. They are great advancements.\n  Let's finish this debate. Let's talk off the floor. I will gladly \nwork with Senator Harkin to accomplish whatever he wants, but I will \nnot break down on the letter I sent in January of 2007 that says I \nbelieve we have to change the way we operate. I know there is \ntremendous resistance to that in this body. I understand that. But the \nAmerican people don't understand it. What they understand is they have \nto make hard choices. Either we mean to fund the $115 million or we are \nsending a charade to the people who want this bill passed. It is one or \nthe other. The fact is, they have had a chance.\n  I will also put in the Record that in the last Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill, there was $105 million that Senator Harkin \nspecifically put in for earmarks that he directed. That is real \nspending. That is enough to pay for the whole bill over 10 years.\n  The fact is, we have a major disagreement on specifics on how we \ncontrol and how we change this country. I will fight for the taxpayer \nevery time. I apologize to the Senator for some of my emotion. It is \nbecause I am thinking about the kids who are coming, not the political \nrealm of today. I understand that we need to do more in NIH. I am on \npublic record to take that to $60 billion. I will pay for it, easily \npay for it. There is $80 billion worth of fraud in Medicare. What have \nwe done about that? Nothing. We gutted the very program that cut \nspending for medical devices, durable medical equipment, the last bill \nthrough here. We had a way to save over $2 billion a year. We gutted \nit. The Senator voted for it. He voted to gut the $2 billion worth of \nsavings.\n  So there are plenty of things we can do, but what we are not going to \ndo anymore with my consent is to pass\n\n[[Page S10050]]\n\nbills that increase the liability for our children in the future, even \nwhen we do it for the sake of doing something good.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You can look at society and say there are a lot of \nproblems out there. You can look at this Congress and say we spend a \nlot of money that we don't agree on. There is a lot of money spent in \nthis Congress I don't like, that I don't agree with. But does that mean \nthis one Senator should stand here and stop good things from happening \njust because I don't like the way something is being spent, the way \nsomething is being done, that I should use the privilege of being a \nSenator, a privilege, a right, a privilege of being a Senator to just \nstop something that is good?\n  There are 435 Members of the House, not one objection; 99 Members of \nthe Senate, not one objection. But one Senator, the Senator from \nOklahoma, is concerned about deficits and about appropriations. OK. I \nagree. There are some problems. We have to face our deficits and debt. \nDoes that mean, then, that we stop every good thing from happening \naround here until that is taken care of? That is taking the privilege \nof being a Senator way beyond what we ought to have a right to do, to \nstop something like this just because we are upset about something else \nthat is bad about spending.\n  Heck, I can share with the Senator from Oklahoma a lot of horror \nstories about how we are wasting money in this Government. He doesn't \nhave a corner on that market, I assure him. Some of the things he may \nthink are wasteful, I might agree. Maybe some of the things I think are \nwasteful, he may not agree. I don't know. But that is how we work \nthings out here, in a collegial manner, working together to try to get \nthese things solved.\n  It is very hard to explain, when I tell people that one Senator can \nstop something like this. They don't understand how that is possible, \nbut it is. One Senator can stop things around here. I wish this weren't \nso in this case because there are too many people with paralysis who \nwere counting on us to get this done and move ahead to coordinate the \nresearch in paralysis and bring all of it together. But we never give \nup. We just keep trying.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on the motion to concur.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 6 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Economic Bailout\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, the House of Representatives today \ndefeated the proposed financial rescue plan devised by a bipartisan, \nmulti-institutional group. This action will precipitate an economic \ncatastrophe for the United States of America. While the initial \nresponse to this ill-advised action has been so far limited to equity \nmarkets and corporate bond markets, I predict the defeat of this plan \nwill soon permeate our entire economy. It will also have serious and \nnot completely predictable consequences in all markets throughout the \nworld.\n  The plan has many features in it that those who oppose had sought. It \nadded many new safeguards for the taxpayer. Yet a rigid adherence to an \nideological purity on both sides that has never existed in our Nation \nled many in the House to reject this plan.\n  I do not know right now in what form the consequences of this action \nwill hurt the average American. Higher interest rates for houses and \nother things, other long-term purchases, a continued freeze on the tax \ncredit markets, loss of jobs and contraction of the economy, loss of \nbillions of dollars in pension plans--the consequences will come.\n  This action cannot be the last word this Congress has to say. I urge \neveryone involved to begin to work again immediately on adjustments to \nthe plan that will at least satisfy a majority in the House.\n  This Congress has an approval rating at an alltime low. None of us \nshould be surprised as to why. We cannot let the situation lie as it \nnow is as a consequence of not passing in the House of Representatives. \nThe leadership and those Members who feel compelled to get something \ndone for the United States in a moment of great economic peril should \ncome together and see to it that we do what is right.\n  It is difficult to do what is right because frequently our people do \nnot understand. There are those who are obviously concerned that those \nwho vote don't understand and indicate that we should not have a big \nbailout. This is not a big bailout bill. We got off on the wrong path \nwhen we started talking about bailouts.\n  There are no bailouts here. What we are going to do is buy assets, \nbuy mortgages, buy promissory notes, buy things of value that, as of \ntoday, are very low in value and are clogging the pathways for money to \nflow. We are going to buy those. We are not going to bail anybody out. \nWhen we buy those, the channel will be open again. The road will be \nopened. The freeway will be opened. The cars will run. Money will flow. \nThe liquid channels will become liquid again. Unless and until we do \nthat, they are clogged.\n  The clogged items, the things that clog up our money market lines, \nare going to be purchased by this rescue plan. They will be owned by \nthis rescue plan. This rescue plan will hold these assets as nobody \nelse could hold them. It is too big a quantity and you cannot afford to \nhold them, but we can hold them and then sell them later. There is good \nindication and justification that if we do not wait too long that this \nrescue plan will sell these assets and perhaps we will come out with \nmore money than we paid for the rescue plan.\n  We need this mechanism because in our democracy our President does \nnot have the authority to do it. So somebody must do it, and it means \nCongress must, even though it is complicated, even though it is \ncomprehensive, and even though it is hard for the public to understand. \nWe must continue to explain this to the public. They will be wondering \ntoday and tomorrow and the next day, as banking institutions fail, as \nother things around them that have money at the bases will stop working \nright.\n  As I said, so far the equity markets--that is the stock markets--they \ncan see those falling perhaps by historically large numbers, \npercentages. Corporate bond markets--we have already seen the effect on \nthem. But there will be other things happening that will make the \npeople understand. But it should not be that we have to let all of \nthese terrible things happen in order to get our heads together and \nknow it is going to happen and try to fix it and tell our people we \nhave to fix something that is broken and that will only cause them and \ntheir families more grief and more hard times if we do not use a rescue \nplan to buy those assets that are clogging the financial highways and \nfreeways so that money will flow.\n  I know I have spoken two or three times on the subject. Some will say \nthat is enough. But I will speak and I will argue and I will debate and \nI will attend meetings for as long as they go on with Senators and \nRepresentatives in an effort to make the vote that happened today not \nthe last action on this terribly difficult subject for the people of \nthe United States--a rescue plan to let the financial markets work in \nAmerica.\n  The greatest financial markets in the world are soon to be rubbish, \nare soon to be in terrible shape. The best will turn out to be the \nleast. In the meantime, we are all going to suffer. Just remember, \nwithout the flow of money we can hardly do anything in our country. We \ncan hardly buy anything. We can hardly sell anything. Anything you look \nat of value can hardly happen without the flow of money, credit cards, \nchecking accounts, bonds. All of those things we have become acquainted \nwith that are taken for granted are in jeopardy because of what I have \njust described and what we hope has been described over and over.\n  For those who read, I urge they read the speech of Senator Lamar \nAlexander this morning on the subject. He used a metaphor that I have \ngiven to a group of Senators of a freeway full of automobiles at high \nspeed going down the road, and each one of those cars was something \nvaluable happening in America. When the six lanes of the\n\n[[Page S10051]]\n\nroad were clogged by a six-car accident, the cars loaded with good \nthings for America, financial things, were all stopped because of the \ncar wreck.\n  Now, if that metaphor makes sense, what our rescue proposal says is, \ngo out and buy the salvage and get it out of the road. Let the cars \nflow, and each of those cars that contains things that will make our \nlives different and valuable will be flowing down the road. The salvage \ncan be repaired and, believe it or not, sold for more than we bought it \nat in salvage off the highway.\n  That is as best I can do. As somebody said: But we need just one or \ntwo words to express it. Somebody answered and said: Yes, the American \npeople like one or two words, but they also like a story. So I just \ntold them the best story I can of what this is all about.\n  I hope before too long there will be more support so Members of the \nCongress, the House in particular, will be strengthened by some changes \nin public opinion that will give them confidence to vote for this \nrescue plan.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Madam President, I withdraw that suggestion and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, Madam President, we certainly need to confront \nthe challenges we are facing now with this banking situation. I know \nSenator Domenici is so eloquent and speaks with such conviction on it \nand believes strongly that we need to get busy.\n  The underlying business, however, at this time does remain the Amtrak \nbill, the reauthorization. That is the legislation the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, has brought up. I would assume that the leadership is \ntrying to figure out what to do in light of the House vote. If they \nwant to proceed and discuss that legislation, I will certainly be glad \nto yield the floor to them. But I do think we need to talk about this \nreauthorization of Amtrak.\n  I have watched this issue for a number of years and have drawn \nincreasingly concerned. The legislation provides $9.7 billion for \nAmtrak and passenger rails through 2013 for operating and capital \ngrants and debt repayment.\n  Operating--that means in simple language they are losing money, so we \nare going to make up their losses. Capital grants means they want more \nmoney to help them expand the system. Instead of the Amtrak system \nitself paying for this on a normal basis, they want the taxpayer to pay \nfor it. Debt repayment--we have seen a lot of people having debt and \nnot being able to pay their debt. It appears Amtrak needs a bailout \nbecause they cannot pay their debts. I wish we were in better shape, \nbut the fact is, we're not.\n  It also includes an amount of $1.5 billion for the Washington Metro \nArea Transit Authority--this is another $1.5 billion on top of the \nmoney that has been put in that program for some time. What is it for? \nFor capital and preventative maintenance. I guess that means keeping \nthe system running.\n  I will talk a little bit more about that in a minute. But I would \nnote that in 1997, a little over a decade ago, Congress had a big \ndiscussion about Amtrak and what to do about it, and there was a \nconsensus that the system be fundamentally reformed and that there be \nnew accountability for Amtrak. It provided, in 1997, that by 2002 there \nwould be no more Federal subsidies to Amtrak.\n  I tell you, we do not have accountability in this Government of ours. \nIt is not functioning sufficiently in my view, and one reason is we \nmake assertions, and when things do not work out the people who did not \nsucceed at whatever task they were given--we just give them more money, \nand they know that. They expect that to happen, so they do not make the \ntough decisions necessary to be successful.\n  Kenneth Mead, the former Department of Transportation inspector \ngeneral who dealt with accountability, succinctly stated it this way:\n\n       The mismatch between the public resources made available to \n     fund inner city passenger rail service, the total cost to \n     maintain the system that Amtrak continues to operate, and the \n     proposals to restructure the system comprise a dysfunction \n     that must be resolved in the reauthorization process of the \n     Nation's inner city rail system.\n\n  Now, the Heritage Foundation, an exceptionally fine think tank, has \nlooked at this, and they have concluded that we do not have the reform \nthat Inspector General Mead said was necessary. In fact, they say that \nfundamentally this reauthorization makes little reform at all of \nsignificance, and this request for money may be the biggest Amtrak has \never asked for. I say we have a problem.\n  Let me share a few thoughts. I know many people have a romantic \nattraction to rail systems and want to see them successful and think we \ncould do well if we could have more rails and people would ride the \nrails and it would save energy and we would all be happy and we could \njust, I guess, like the Orient Express, play cards and eat meals on \nwhite table cloths. Well, let's look at the reality of what we are \ndealing with.\n  I do not think Amtrak is going to work in Alabama. Our population is \ntoo diverse, and the routes it runs do not seem to fit the traffic \npatterns of people. I wish it could. I do not want to be a person to \nsay don't send Amtrak through my State. Few people probably benefit \nfrom it. Few people might have a job depending on it. But sometimes we \nas a nation have to ask ourselves what is the proper utilization of our \nmoney, and are we making any progress.\n  I do not think you can justify many, perhaps most, of the routes \nAmtrak is running, but some of them could be. Some more of them could \nperhaps become viable if the losses they were taking in this system on \nbad routes were put into some of the marginal routes, where they \nupgraded them and they could run the system better, cleaner, and more \ntimely, with fewer delays, and that kind of thing. But fundamentally \nthe romantic view that we are going to have some sort of major \ninternational rail system does not seem to be realistic.\n  I remember as a child growing up in the country we used to say--I \ngrew up on the railroad tracks. It was not but a couple hundred yards \nfrom my house to the railroad track. My daddy had a country store \nthere. There were three country stores in that neighborhood and one \nrailroad depot. So we had a passenger train.\n  When I was a young kid, a passenger train came through there. But \nthere has not been a passenger train through Hybart, AL, in 40, 50 \nyears. Now there is only one store left in the community and no \nrailroad depot. It has been closed for many years.\n  Things happen. This country changes. People change. Let me ask this \nquestion to my colleagues. Would the Nation be better off if somebody \nin Washington, DC, said: Oh, that is such a shame. This little town of \nHybart might lose their three stores, and they might have the depot \nclosed. Maybe we ought to fund the railroad, give them enough money, \nbail them out, so they can continue to operate their passenger train \nthrough there. Would we be better off if we had done that? I do not \nthink so. I hate to see it happen.\n  We also had a little post office attached to the house of my \nneighbor, and they closed that a number of years ago. That was \nheartbreaking. Mrs. Hybart from Hybart ran the post office. When she \nretired, they closed it. We hated to see that, but maybe the Postal \nService was right. Maybe it was such a small operation it couldn't be \njustified to be continued. Somebody has to make decisions somewhere.\n\n  So let me point this out to my colleagues. Using my home State as an \nexample, we have a train that goes through Birmingham and on up to \nWashington. Birmingham is our largest city. What are your options if \nyou are in Birmingham and want to come to Washington, DC, our Nation's \nCapital? If you want to go on a commercial airline, which most people \ndo, frankly, there are several flights every day, direct flights from \nBirmingham to Washington. If you take your personal vehicle you can \nleave anytime that you desire. You can leave early in the morning or \nyou can leave midday, whatever. If you take the train, though, there is \nonly one train a day leaving, and you have to leave at precisely that \ntime or you don't get on the train. So that limits options at the \nbeginning.\n  When people are deciding when and how to make a trip, they ask \nthemselves these questions: What about the time it takes to make a trip \nfrom Birmingham to Washington, DC? Well, the air time is about 2 hours \n12 minutes. The personal vehicle, if you drive by\n\n[[Page S10052]]\n\ncar, we calculate 11 hours. It may be 10 or 11 hours. By train, it is \n18 hours.\n  How many stops would you make? If you take an airline, of course, a \ndirect flight, there is only one stop--at Washington. If you take your \nvehicle, maybe you make four or five stops, three or four stops. Let's \nassume you make four. But Amtrak, Amtrak makes 18 stops, and it does \nnot take the shortest route to the Nation's Capital.\n  What about cost? How much does it cost? I was surprised, actually, \nwhen we looked at these numbers. I questioned my staff. Could it be an \nerror? This is what they told me: The primary cost of a round-trip \nairline ticket from Birmingham to Washington is $328. It has gone up \nsome. That is what they tell me is the recent fare for this trip. If \nyou look at your automobile, and there is only one person in the car--\nyou may have four--but if one person is driving to Washington, it is \nabout $200 for the gasoline at the current high prices; $4 or so a \ngallon. What about the Amtrak train ticket that is going to take 18 \nhours instead of 2, what does it cost? Four hundred and forty-five \ndollars.\n  So you think this may have something to do with why people are \nchoosing to fly or drive, rather than take the train? I kind of wish it \nwasn't so. I wish there was some way we could make this different than \nit is, but those are the facts and that is why many of the Amtrak \nroutes are not practical.\n  People say: Well, why don't we make more routes, more trips, more \ntrains, more often every day, and maybe more people would use it. I \ndon't think so. I think the losses would swell even larger. You can't \nmake this happen, in my view. I wish we had a different statement I \ncould say about it, but that is it.\n  One reason we maintain these routes around the country that are \nlosing money substantially is because Congress maintains them because \npolitics gets into it. Nobody wants to stand, as I am doing right now, \nand suggest it is not going to be the end of the world for the State of \nAlabama if we don't have an Amtrak running through there, if it is \ncosting the taxpayers billions of dollars every year to keep it \nrunning.\n  I wish to mention, briefly, the Washington Metro earmark of $1.5 \nbillion. This includes Northern Virginia and the Maryland suburbs--some \nof the richest, most prosperous areas in the country. But they want us \nto send huge amounts of money here to fund the extension of their \nsubway, their train system. I think we have a right--the people outside \nthis area need to ask why they should do that.\n  Let me share this. My home county that I have been talking about has \ndouble-digit unemployment. It is reported by the New York Times that in \nmy county--Wilcox County, where I grew up and went to school--the \naverage citizen spends a larger percentage of their income on gasoline \nthan any other county in America. So I guess what we are talking about \nnow is we are going to ask people in my county who are struggling to \nget by with high unemployment rates and low wages and long distances to \nwork, to subsidize a big, fancy subway system extension and operation \nthat goes beyond, what I think is fair. What principle is being \nutilized to decide this is a good allocation of limited wealth in \nAmerica?\n  So this is a huge mark. It is a huge item. Let me tell my colleagues \nhow huge it is. Our State, as I recall, under the formula for highway \ndistribution moneys, with every State in America, is about average. \nAlabama is about an average size State in population and probably in \nsize. The tax revenue from gasoline comes to the Federal Government and \nwe allocate it out by complex formulas that we have fought over for \nyears. Alabama and Mississippi felt as though we weren't being fairly \ntreated, but we are doing a little better now under the formula. But \nthe amount of money Alabama gets, as I recall, it is not much over $500 \nmillion a year for the entire interstate highway system in Alabama to \nbe utilized with the State highway money: $500 million per year. \nWhereas, they who are pushing this Metro system--$1.5 billion payment--\nwould, in one project alone, be three times the annual funds that my \nState gets for highways. I don't think that is fair. I know it is a \nhuge project. But, it is not a project I think can be justified. I wish \nwe could do this and that would be good.\n  Somebody said: Well, Government employees like it. Many of them live \nout that way. Well, I have to tell my colleagues that Government \nemployees are treated pretty well. You may not know this, but one \nreason they take subways is most of the agencies subsidize their \nticket. If you take the Metro, the Government agency gives you a \ntransportation allowance. So they have tried everything they can to \nincentivize riding the subway, but the Metro is still losing money. \nThis is an additional subsidy from the Federal Government to the \nWashington Metro.\n  So I have to tell my colleagues I believe this is an important \nmatter. I do not believe this legislation is sound. I don't think it is \ngood for the taxpayers. I believe it is, in many ways, including this \nvery large, one appropriation of $1.5 billion, that is clearly unfair \nto the rest of the country. We shouldn't pass it. I am sorry the \nmajority leader seems determined to move forward with this bill. But as \nI said, I would not object if he sets it aside temporarily, to discuss \nwhat we are going to do about the financial crisis.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Senator Domenici\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, it is with mixed feelings of remorse \nand pleasure that I speak on the subject of the retirement from the \nSenate of my colleague and friend from New Mexico, Pete Domenici. He \nand his wife Nancy have been close and dear personal friends. When I \nwas elected to serve in the Senate, they reached out to my wife Rose \nand me and made us feel at home and very comfortable in our new Senate \nenvironment. That was 30 years ago.\n  The Domenici family will surely be missed, but I know we will stay in \ntouch. I wouldn't be surprised to get a call from Pete if he sees or \nhears about my not doing right on an issue he feels deeply about. He is \nnot bashful, nor easily intimidated, and he is going to continue to be \nconsulted for advice and counsel from time to time by me and others who \nrespect him so highly and realize they would benefit from his good \njudgment and insight.\n  From public works to budget and energy, to appropriations, he has \nbeen a conspicuous and forceful advocate of public policy in the Senate \ncommittees. His contributions to public policy during the years of his \nservice in the Senate are unsurpassed, and the genuineness of the \nrespect in which he is held by his colleagues is unequaled. It has been \na great honor to have served with Pete Domenici. I extend my sincere \ncongratulations to him on his outstanding career in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10052-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10052-S10053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SPACED-BASED INTERCEPTOR STUDY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, today I wish to describe an important step \ntowards providing the American people with a global, persistent \nballistic missile defense system. This step is the space-based \ninterceptor, SBI, study that was recently funded in H.R. 2638, the \nfiscal year 2009 Continuing Resolution, which contains the fiscal year \n2009 appropriations for the Department of Defense.\n  Congress appropriated $5 million for the Secretary of Defense to \nconduct an independent assessment of a space-based interceptor element \nof our missile defense system. This is the first time since the Clinton \nadministration and a Democrat-controlled Congress in 1993 cancelled all \nwork towards a space-based layer missile defense system that we have \nthe potential to expand our space-based capabilities from mere space \nsituational awareness to space protection.\n  In the past 15 years, the ballistic missile threat has substantially \nincreased and is now undeniable. Today, at least 27 nations have \nballistic missile defense capabilities, and last year alone over 120 \nforeign ballistic missiles were launched. North Korea and Iran are \ndeveloping and proliferating ballistic missile technology and continue \nto be major threats to our allies and our deployed forces.\n  Developments in China, as illustrated in the 2008 Annual Report on \nMilitary Power of the People's Republic of China, raise the concern \nabout accidental or unauthorized launches of\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\nintercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, by China's military.\n  In addition to the long-established threat of ballistic missiles as a \ndelivery system for weapons of mass destruction, on January 11, 2007, \nthe world witnessed the vulnerability of space assets when China \nlaunched a ballistic missile to destroy a satellite. This capability \nextends beyond China; the Director of National Intelligence recently \ntestified, ``over the last decade, the rest of the world has made \nsignificant progress in developing counter space capabilities.''\n  Every part of our daily lives depends upon the capability and \nreliability of our space systems. An attack on our space systems would \nnot only adversely affect our military and intelligence systems, but \nalso items such as: the Internet backbone, financial systems, \nnavigation systems, manufacturing inventory control systems, emergency \nresponse systems, and weather tracking. Our vulnerabilities have not \ngone unnoticed; Wang Hucheng, an analyst for the People's Liberation \nArmy has called our space systems the ``soft ribs'' of the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  The $5 million appropriation for the SBI study allows the Secretary \nof Defense to enter into a contract with one or more independent \nentities to review the feasibility and advisability of developing a \nspace-based interceptor element to the ballistic missile defense \nsystem. It is clear from the project tables in H.R. 2638, specifically \nthe Program Element numbers in those tables, that Congress understood \nthe importance of funding this study.\n  I have the utmost confidence in Secretary Gates to make the decision \nabout what research and development entity should perform this study. I \nwould like to recommend that an entity like the Institute for Defense \nAnalysis, IDA, lead the study. IDA has the experience and technical \nexpertise to provide policymakers a complete picture of the merits of a \nspace-based interceptor system.\n  The study could lead to the development of new technologies and \nconcepts that would provide the United States, our allies, and our \ndeployed forces protection from the threat of rapidly proliferating \nballistic missile technology, as well as the rising threat of attacks \non our vulnerable national security space systems.\n  I would like to share the views of a few senior military leaders \nabout what they believe to be the benefits of conducting the space-\nbased interceptor study.\n  GEN Kevin Chilton, Commander of United States Strategic Command, \nstated:\n\n       Space based systems have great potential to address many \n     significant global missile defense challenges. The high \n     ground space provides could alleviate many geographic and \n     political challenges.\n\n  GEN Henry Obering, Director of Missile Defense Agency, stated, the \nstudy is ``a pragmatic hedge against an uncertain future, not an \nacquisition program for space-based missile defenses. It is opportunity \nto learn--while there is time to learn--what is possible in space \nagainst the day when emerging threats may compel us to decide.''\n  MG Thomas Deppe, Vice Commander of Air Force Space Command stated:\n\n       Starting the preliminary studies and analysis on a space-\n     based layer now will provide time to understand the potential \n     benefits and technological challenges of such a system. Early \n     studies help to reduce risk and better determine cost and \n     feasibility of any space-based endeavor by identifying \n     required technologies.\n\n  The United States must study space-based defenses now while we \nactually have the time to gather the data necessary to make informed \npolicy decisions and before we are forced to make a decision in a time \nof crisis.\n  I would like to thank Senators Inhofe, Allard, and Sessions for their \nsupport in ensuring this important initiative was funded.\n  This study--some in this body have been afraid of--will help Congress \nunderstand what a space-based layer in our missile defense system could \ndo to defend this Nation from ballistic missile attacks and threats to \nour space systems.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of Senators Kyl and Inhofe. I supported the Space Test Bed \nstudy requested by the President. I would have preferred to be here \ntoday urging that my fellow Senators keep an open mind until that study \ncan begin providing data to policy makers.\n  Yet there are those who refuse to study--even study--whether space-\nbased interceptors can offer added defensive capability against \nballistic missile threats to the United States, our allies, our \ndeployed forces, even our national security space systems. As a result, \nthis space interceptor study is the best we could get out of the \nCongress this year.\n  Let there be no mistake, this is an important step forward. I am \npleased to have been able to help to push this study across the finish \nline.\n  I urge the Secretary of Defense to move quickly to get this study \nunderway so that the next administration and the next Congress can \nbuild on today's study and finally move past the ivory tower debate \nabout the weaponization of space.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I strongly agree with Senator Kyl in \nregard to the space-based interceptor study. This study provides the \nSecretary of Defense an independent assessment of a space-based \ninterceptor element of our missile defense system. I think we all agree \nthat a layered missile defense capability provides us with the best \ndefense against ballistic missile delivered weapons of mass destruction \nas well as a defense against attacks against our satellites which have \nbecome so necessary to what we do militarily and economically.\n  This study will be an independent investigation into the technical \nfeasibility and cost effectiveness of incorporating a space-based layer \nto our ballistic missile defense system. The study is neither a \nprocurement program nor an attempt to weaponize space. It could lead to \nthe development of new technologies and concepts that would provide the \nUnited States, our allies and our deployed forces protection from the \nthreat of rapidly proliferating ballistic missile technology, as well \nas the rising threat of attacks on our vulnerable national security \nspace systems.\n  As Senator Kyl stated, last year 120 foreign ballistic missiles were \nlaunched. North Korea, Iran, and China remain likely suspects in \nballistic missile proliferation and China has proven its ability to \nattack satellites. Recent Russian aggression in Georgia and reports on \nthe state of China's military raise concerns about accidental or \nunauthorized launches of ICBMs.\n  The threat exists. It is important to do these studies now in order \nto develop the technologies and the defenses we need. Waiting until our \nNation or our allies are attacked is too late. Wishing away the threat, \nas some in this Congress would have us do, is not a solution.\n  I thank my colleagues for this important move to ensure the safety of \nour Nation. Having the knowledge gleaned from this study will allow us \nto decide on the next step, should it be necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10053-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10053-S10054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHANGES TO S.

Madam President, I am proud to note that Congress, \nSaturday, voted to pass and send to the President the Inspector General \nReform Act of 2008. This bipartisan bill reflects the broad \ncongressional support for the outstanding work of our inspectors \ngeneral and our desire to ensure that these important and unique \nGovernment officials are given the tools and the accountability to \nperform at their very best. I want to commend my colleagues, Senator \nMcCaskill and Senator Collins, with whom I cosponsored this bill in the \nSenate, for their leadership and hard work on this issue. I also want \nto recognize the efforts of Congressman Cooper of Tennessee in the \nHouse, who has worked diligently on this legislation or some version of \nit through several Congresses.\n  It has been 30 years since Congress, as part of its post-Watergate \nreforms, passed the Inspectors General Act of 1978 that created an \nOffice of Inspector General in 12 major departments and agencies to \nhold those agencies accountable and report back both to the agency \nheads and Congress on their findings. The law was amended in 1988 to \nadd an inspector general to almost all executive agencies and \ndepartments.\n  The experiment has been a great success, hailed as a sort of consumer \nprotector for the taxpayer deep within each agency. IG audits generate \nbillions of dollars in potential savings each year. They also safeguard \nsomething even more valuable public trust\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\nin our Government by exposing shortcomings in Government practices and \nofficial conduct. Some of these efforts generate front page headlines, \nbut most of it unfolds quietly but critically behind the scenes as the \nIGs help their respective agencies establish effective and efficient \nprograms and practices that make the most of the taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars.\n  It is not an easy job to undertake and, over the years, we have \nbecome aware of several instances where the independence of inspectors \ngeneral appears to be under siege. It is vital that Congress reiterate \nits strong support for the internal oversight IGs can provide and \nensure they have the independence they need to carry out this vital, \nbut often unpopular work.\n  Unfortunately, we are also aware of instances in which the watchdog \nneeds watching--that is, situations where the inspector general has \nbehaved improperly or failed to provide vigorous oversight.\n  This legislation attempts to address both problems.\n  It includes an array of measures designed to strengthen the \nindependence of the inspectors general, such as requiring the \nadministration to notify Congress 30 days before attempting to remove \nor transfer an IG. This would give us time to consider whether the \nadministration was improperly seeking to displace an inspector general \nfor political reasons because the IG was, in effect, doing his or her \njob too well. It requires that all IGs be chosen on the basis of \nqualifications, without regard to political affiliation.\n  The legislation would codify and strengthen the existing IG councils, \ncreating a unitary council that can provide greater support for IGs \nthroughout the Government.\n  The bill would provide greater transparency of IG budget needs, \nincluding funds for training and council activities, to help ensure the \nIG offices have the resources they need for their investigations.\n  The legislation also adjusts IG pay. It prohibits bonuses for IGs to \nremove a potential avenue for improper influence by the agency head. To \ncompensate for this ban and to reflect the importance of the work they \ndo, most IGs would receive an increase in their regular pay. Currently, \nsome IGs earn less than other senior officials in their agency and \nsometimes even less than some of their subordinates.\n  Our bill also enhances IG accountability by strengthening the \nIntegrity Committee that handles allegations against inspectors general \nand their senior staff, and facilitating greater oversight of the \nIntegrity Committee by Congress.\n  Both the House and Senate versions of this bill received overwhelming \nbipartisan support, and since Senate passage last spring we have worked \nwith the House to craft the consensus language that has now won \ncongressional approval. We have also worked with the administration to \naddress many of their initial concerns, and it is my great hope that \nthe President will promptly sign this bill into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10055-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10055-S10056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AFRICA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, last week I chaired a hearing on the \n``resource curse'' and Africa's management of its extractive \nindustries. In too many parts of Africa, a wealth of natural resources \nthat should be fueling economic development are instead sources of \ncorruption and conflict. This is especially the case with Sub-Saharan \nAfrica's leading oil-producing nations. Just a few days ago, \nTransparency International released its corruption index, naming of \nAfrica's top 3 oil producers--Chad, Equatorial Guinea, and Sudan--among \nthe top 10 most corrupt countries. This corruption as well as the \ndiscrepancy between persisting poverty and skyrocketing revenues is a \nrecipe for instability in these countries, breeding weak and failing \nstates.\n  Nowhere are the consequences of the ``resource curse'' more acute or \nalarming than Nigeria's Delta region. For the last three decades, local \ncommunities there have been marginalized politically and economically \nas oil companies, with the government's backing, have seized some of \nthe world's richest oil deposits. And, while the private sector is \npervasive, the federal government is virtually absent--replaced by \nroving bands of criminals, working in many cases for local governors. \nThe weak infrastructure, lack of opportunities for political \nparticipation by local communities, endemic poverty, influx of arms, \nand presence of lootable extractives have turned the delta into a \npowder keg over recent years.\n  In that swamp--and I say ``swamp'' both literally and \nmetaphorically--have arisen several armed groups that seek to appeal to \nthe legitimate grievances of communities for both political and \ncriminal ends. These groups, many of which claim to be part of a loose \ncoalition called the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, \nor MEND, have targeted oil companies operating in the region, \nkidnapping employees for ransom and attacking pipelines and other \ninstallations. Simultaneously, they have become heavily involved in the \nlucrative trade in oil stolen from the delta's vast pipelines which is \ncalled ``bunkering.'' Some estimates suggest that as much as 10 percent \nof Nigeria's current production is siphoned off illegally, creating a \nshadow economy that undermines the security of the wider Gulf of Guinea \nregion.\n  The Nigeria Government's response to the Delta crisis--sporadic \nmilitary campaigns, empty promises of development and half-hearted \nattempts at political dialogue--has only made matters worse. In many \ncases there are definite but ambiguous links between the military and \nthe militants--each out for personal gain as the political economy of \nwar perpetuates the illicit nature of these activities. In addition, \nthe military campaigns to date have only served to provoke the \ninsurgency, leading to fighting that has left civilians killed and \ndisplaced. Furthermore, the lack of clear distinction between the \nsecurity forces of the oil companies and the Nigerian military feeds \ncommunities' perception that the two are interchangeable. Meanwhile, \ndespite promises made, there has still not been a serious initiative to \naddress the underdevelopment of the region. The necessary revenues are \nclearly available with Nigeria's economic boom, but a lack of political \nwill prevails. This is in part because there are officials at the \nfederal, state, and local levels who continue to benefit from the \ninstability in the delta, either by their involvement in the illegal \noil trade or other corruption.\n\n  Without a commitment from the top leadership in Nigeria--as well as \nsupport from key members in the international community--a growing \nnumber of individuals at the top will continue to profit, while those \nat the bottom have almost no say in the development of their society. \nGenuine peacemaking in the delta region will require not only \nlegitimate political negotiations but a convincing case for \ntransforming the illicit war economy into one of peace. There will need \nto be viable institutions, not one hollowed out from corruption, which \ncan address economic and political decisionmaking. And there will need \nto be opportunities for local communities to engage and hold their \nleaders accountable. Only then will we begin to see change in the \ndelta.\n  Under this administration, the United States has made few efforts to \naddress the instability in the Niger Delta, despite Nigeria being a key \nU.S. partner and the fifth largest source for U.S. oil imports. I \nrecognize that the insecurity in the delta makes it very hard for our \nembassy officials--who are doing great work in an already tough \nposting--to travel there, but without consistent diplomatic outreach \nand presence in the region, our ability to engage is severely \nhandicapped. How can we be sure the information we are getting is valid \nif we don't have our own eyes and ears to help inform our strategic \nthinking? The information gap in the Niger Delta is a very real deficit \neven though it may not seem pressing compared to some of the other \nnational security threats we face. Getting our diplomatic corps into \none of the world's most neglected regions will help us identify the \nfull scope of the area's problems and come up with a sound plan for \naddressing them.\n  In June, I wrote to Secretary Rice, expressing my concern and \ninquiring about the potential for more frequent diplomatic travel to \nthe region. I understand that along with the security concerns, \nfinancial costs also play a role here. But the costs to U.S. long-term \nsecurity of not directly engaging this problem now are much greater.\n\n[[Page S10056]]\n\n  The work of our diplomats on the ground though must be backed by \nhigh-level support from Washington. On the Niger Delta--or Nigerian \naffairs in general, for that matter--we have not seen adequate \nleadership from the Secretary of State or the President. Looking to the \nnext administration, we must reengage at all levels. This must be a top \npriority for whoever becomes the next Assistant Secretary for African \nAffairs, and I will work in my capacity in Congress to ensure we give \ngreater attention to the crisis in the delta. We must think creatively \nabout how we can rally our international partners and muster the many \nresources at our disposal to push for a comprehensive solution. In the \nmonths and years ahead, I believe there are few more pressing issues in \nterms of U.S. security and interests in Africa.\n  Now is the moment to engage. Just over a week ago, insurgents in the \ndelta declared an ``oil war,'' after accusing the Nigerian military of \nnew and unprovoked attacks. The 6 days of conflict that ensued between \nthe militants and Nigerian soldiers were the most intense violence the \nregion had seen in years. Reports suggest that oil output was cut by at \nleast 150,000 barrels, but more importantly the violence left hundreds \nof people killed and many more displaced. I fear that we may only see \nthis situation get worse as all sides, regardless of their rhetoric, \ncling to military strategies that only further entrench this conflict.\n  Nevertheless, there is an opportunity here to use this escalation to \nrefocus international attention on this crisis and jumpstart a \ncomprehensive political process to address its underlying causes. In \nthe last month, there have been some positive developments that can be \nbuilt upon.\n  First, President Yar'Adua recently announced the creation of 40-\nperson technical committee and an entire ministry for the Niger Delta. \nIf managed well and held accountable, these entities hold the potential \nto finally deliver on promises for economic development in the delta, \nespecially infrastructure construction and job creation.\n  Second, the Government has called for the development of a \ncertification scheme to track the theft and lucrative sale of so-called \n``blood oil.'' It is unclear how such a scheme would work or whether \nthe will really exists in Abuja to support it, but this provides an \nentry point to discuss ways to improve maritime security. A 2005 report \nby the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggested that \nbetter surveillance of two river systems alone could make a huge dent \nin the illicit oil trade in the delta.\n  Third and finally, it should be noted that Nigeria's ranking improved \nin this week's Transparency International's corruption index, \nsuggesting some progress has been made. Of course, these rankings are \nnot precise and far more progress is needed.\n  Mr. President, I realize that this situation is very complex and that \nmany talented and thoughtful people have met over the last decade in \nvarious conferences, workshops, and summits to devise plans for peace \nin the delta. I am not under the illusion that stabilizing this region \nwill be easy or straightforward, but I do know that the United States \ndoes not currently have the institutional leadership, resources, or \ncoordination that we need to effectively engage in that undertaking and \nwield meaningful leverage. As we look ahead to the next administration \nand Congress, this must change not only the sake of African communities \ncaught in the midst of violence and poverty but also for our own \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10056-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10056-S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am worried about our country. The Senate is in a position \n     to do something about it. Currently we are being kicked \n     around by oil interests both abroad and within our \n     boundaries. This must come to an end. [Misinformation is \n     being circulated about energy.] For example, if we drill in \n     new areas in Alaska it will affect gas prices of a penny a \n     gallon ten years from now--this is a ridiculous statement. \n     They have no basis for a stupid statement like that. I \n     believe we need to eliminate importation of oil on principle. \n     It is essential to drill by opening up new fields in Alaska, \n     offshore on Pacific coast, the Atlantic coast, and the Gulf \n     of Mexico. Shell Oil indicates that they can extract oil from \n     shale for $28 per gallon. Even with government subsidies, I \n     advocate a crash program to start extracting oil from shale \n     and from oil sands in Canada. It requires energy to extract \n     oil from shale. Why not atomic energy to extract that oil? In \n     American Falls, we are trying to get a coal gasification \n     plant. We could use your help in running that through. \n     Potentially this can be a cheap source of hydrogen. American \n     Falls has the potential of truly being in a county of power. \n     There is also the potential of using plant materials for \n     alcohol production. We have an incredible debt. This is a way \n     of solving that debt problem. All things are possible; we \n     have the means to do it. We can solve our energy problems \n     while simultaneously turning America around economically.\n     Jim, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       What I want a Senator for Idaho to vote for legislation \n     that will help solve our climate crisis. And a Senator who \n     does not couch his words in terms such as utilizing proven \n     reserves; that means you want to drill in ANWR, right? You \n     are the problem, not the solution.\n     Bud, Victor.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for asking for our input on this incredibly \n     important matter. I own and operate a 3,000-acre diversified \n     farming operation in Oakley. I raise potatoes, wheat, barley, \n     corn and alfalfa. I probably do not need to say any more \n     about how energy prices are affecting my operation. Not just \n     fuel alone, but so many other inputs that we depend on such \n     as fertilizer, chemicals, PVC pipe for underground irrigation \n     are going up faster than fuel. In the Idaho potato business, \n     we depend on a national market to stay viable because of our \n     distance from large population areas. The cost of sending a \n     semi-trailer load (450 cwt.) of potatoes to Florida is \n     currently over $6,000. That is making it far more difficult \n     to compete with the local growers, even though their product \n     is usually inferior to Idaho.\n       As far as my view of a solution. Drill here and drill now! \n     It is ludicrous and maddening what the liberals has done in \n     curtailing our ability to use our own resources. They are \n     100% responsible for this mess, and they will pay down the \n     road if they do not realize it soon. As a nation, we are on \n     the verge of an energy crisis that I am not sure we can ever \n     recover from, if it occurs. Their plan to push conservation \n     and tax the big oil companies is simply irresponsible. No one \n     ever saved their way into prosperity. We need to turn the oil \n     companies loose to tap our own reserves and build more \n     refineries, and allow private enterprise to develop new \n     sources of energy.\n       Thanks again for this opportunity to vent.\n     Randy, Oakley.\n                                  ____\n\n       I ride my bike so my gas price is $0/gallon. Plus, my \n     pollution impact is non-existent, impact to the roads minimal \n     and impact to my health is high.\n     Mike, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our concrete and sand and gravel business uses between \n     30,000 and 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel per month. So our \n     unexpected increase in costs is almost $500,000 this year. \n     The knee-jerk answer to this problem I hear is ``you guys \n     just pass it along to the consumer''. But we have commitments \n     to certain prices on our jobs. Jobs in our industry do not \n     get repriced every night when fuel goes up. So we cannot pass \n     all of the increase along and so profits suffer.\n       The other side of this is what about the consumer of our \n     products? What does he do with that kind of increase? He is \n     the homeowner, the small contractor, the big contractor, the \n     farmer, or the dairy owner. He takes the hit so we can export \n     our whole productive economy to foreign countries that hate \n     us anyway. How much of this run up is speculation? When the \n     bubble bursts, will the federal government bail out the \n     speculators?\n     David, Rupert.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have got a story on energy prices for you. My story is \n     based on fact from the congressional record of Senator \n     Crapo's voting history.\n       Once upon a time (in 2007), there was a good energy bill \n     (H.R. 6) that supported the research and development of \n     alternative fuels. (This should have been done a long time \n     ago so the work could have been done ahead of time so it is \n     ready we need it, instead of now when it is an ``emergency'', \n     but the Congress did not care about it then.)\n\n[[Page S10057]]\n\n     There was an amendment to this bill (1505) proposed by Sen. \n     Inhofe that would have given many billions of dollars to the \n     oil companies instead of having that money go to supporting \n     alternative cleaner renewable energy resources. There had \n     already been a history of [giving billions of dollars in tax \n     breaks to the oil companies. I believe that the oil companies \n     have suppressed information on cleaner energy, pollution \n     impact on the environment, and vehicle efficiency \n     technologies through media spin. Senator Crapo says he is a \n     good man and supports cleaner energy sources instead of the \n     oil companies. But when the vote for the Inhofe amendment \n     came up, he voted for it. And the nation lived miserably ever \n     after.]\n       Seriously, when you go along with the president on such \n     outrageous things as imprisonment and torture of people in \n     secret prisons for indefinite periods without charges filed, \n     suspension of habeas corpus, illegal wiretapping of U.S. \n     citizens without warrants and then giving retroactive \n     immunity to the telecoms for doing it, etc., etc., I find it \n     hard to take seriously your claim that you have the public's \n     best interest in mind. You are voting along with the \n     president's wishes in serious violations of the Constitution. \n     It is against your oath of office, and you should not be \n     doing it.\n     Rockford, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Historically, the United States has paid less at the pump \n     than all other industrialized nations. Today--with the \n     alleged heinous increases--we continue to pay less than \n     Canada does at the pump (over $2/liter) and as you know it is \n     from Canada that we get most of our oil. I approve of \n     protecting the environment at the pump.\n       Thanks for asking\n     Lynn, Island Park.\n                                  ____\n\n       I support your recent position of the ``global warming'' \n     legislation that would have resulted in higher gas prices and \n     higher energy costs, in general. I cannot believe that \n     Congress has failed to act on measures to make this nation \n     independent of OPEC's monopoly; we saw the current situation \n     coming way back in the 1970s with long gas lines etc. I am an \n     environmentalist; however, I believe we should responsibly \n     develop all potential oil reserves including off the coasts \n     and in ANWR. This ``global warming'' hysteria is plain old \n     hogwash, and a lot of players are or will make millions off \n     people's fears. It is a proven fact that the planet and the \n     oceans have been in a cooling state since 1998; the record \n     snowfalls in Idaho this year are testimony. It has been shown \n     that the activity on the sun if far more important than man's \n     activities when it comes to changing climate. Man's \n     activities simply make things worse than they would be \n     naturally.\n     Bill.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for taking the time to ask about the people here \n     in Idaho. Recently my husband lost his job. With high gas \n     prices, it has been difficult for his to travel to job \n     interviews. I have had to find a new job, because I cannot \n     afford the 40-minute drive to and from work everyday. My \n     father and mother live in Logan, Utah. My dad has cancer and \n     became very ill last February. He became paralyzed from the \n     cancer, choking off the spinal cord. Luckily, he is \n     recovering very well. But both my parents need help. \n     Unfortunately, with the high gas prices, I have not been able \n     to visit my parents in three months. My family cannot afford \n     to take a vacation. Not even a short drive to Yellowstone \n     Park. With no job for my husband, sky-high gas prices, high \n     food prices, we cannot do anything. My husband may end up \n     taking a job 8\\1/2\\ hours away from us. With gas prices, we \n     will be lucky to see him once a month. This is a sad \n     realization for me and my three children.\n       My in-laws and several friends are farmers. Their lives are \n     a struggle. Farmers are talking about selling their beloved \n     farms for housing developments. This will happen is the gas \n     prices do not come down. Then where will we be? There will be \n     no food for anyone. At least, we will not be able to afford \n     the food in the stores. The future is looking bleak for the \n     people in our areas.\n       Senator Crapo, please do something to help the people of \n     Idaho. Let the Senate know we here in Idaho do not want to \n     lose everything. Help the prices go down; help the people \n     feel they can enjoy life.\n     Katrina, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am the Director of Career Services at ITT Technical \n     Institute here in Boise. Many of our students are driving \n     from as far away as Ontario, Oregon, to come to our school. \n     Since the gas prices have increased, we are seeing it impact \n     our enrollment level and our drop level. Many of our students \n     would love to take the bus to our campus, but our classes get \n     out at 10:30 at night and there are no busses running late \n     enough to get them home. Why is it we do not have buses that \n     run at least until midnight on all of the major streets in \n     the valley? I know that more people would ride bus if it \n     actually accommodated their work, school, and shopping \n     schedules. How can we get out of our cars, when there are no \n     viable alternatives?\n       I am a baby boomer taking care of elderly parents. As I age \n     and my parents age, I am more aware of the dangers we face \n     with elderly drivers on our roads. Their reflexes are slower, \n     their hearing is bad, and their eyes are often clouded with \n     cataracts. We need a safe an efficient way of transporting \n     people of all ages around the city.\n       Our elderly and disabled are often confined to their homes \n     where they are out of our sight. Many of them are living at \n     or below the poverty level. These prices are forcing those \n     who already have cut back on everything to now look at \n     whether or not they can even buy food.\n       To make alternative transportation even worst, we do not \n     have roads that our designed to accommodate both cars and \n     bicycles. I would actually ride a bike to work, or even walk \n     if their was more than 12 inches between me and the cars that \n     are going 45 miles per hour along side me.\n       My last word is, drill now in the U.S., and help us to \n     become less dependent on countries that hate us. The entire \n     world is looking to find alternative to gas and we have been \n     trying to find alternatives ourselves since the 70s. We are \n     not the only nation hurting from energy prices. Are we so \n     arrogant that we think we are the only ones who are hurting \n     from this, or the only ones who will solve the problem? \n     Alternatives to gas, is not something that will be solved \n     overnight. We can drill safely and we can do it quickly. We \n     know where it is, all we need to do is drill. So while the \n     world is looking for a solution.

The increase in gasoline prices \n     has definitely had an impact upon my family. We are feeling \n     the pinch not only in fuel prices but in the prices of \n     everything we buy. We recently purchased two used three-\n     cylinder cars, a Geo Metro and a Subaru Justy as an attempt \n     to save on commuting costs. Sadly, there does not seem to be \n     anything we can do about our other increasing costs.\n       We are firm believers in the viability of nuclear power. I \n     believe that we have the solution to most of our energy needs \n     already in hand in the form of nuclear power generation. \n     France and Japan produce 85% of their electricity by nuclear \n     power and neither nation has reported any significant \n     problems. We have the technology and the resources to make it \n     safe and economical. The American masses who oppose the use \n     and expansion of this technology are driven by fears based on \n     outdated information and are lead by uninformed or self \n     promoting fear mongers. We need to move quickly to support \n     nuclear technology. We need to expound on the facts and \n     expose the purveyors of false information.\n       Nuclear power produces far less pollution and has a far \n     safer history than any other type of power generation \n     technology. The waste generated by nuclear power generation \n     can be captured and safely stored in a can until we develop \n     the technology to permanently dispose of it. Can we say the \n     same for fossil fuel-based energy production? No, we spew it \n     out into the atmosphere where it affects everything and \n     everyone. If those who claim that the world is being \n     destroyed by global warming truly believed their own rhetoric \n     they would support the expansion of nuclear power generation. \n     I believe the solution to the so called ``nuclear waste \n     problem'' could have been developed by now had we continued \n     our research funding and as a result we would not be facing \n     the energy crisis we now find ourselves in.\n       If you would like additional information with supporting \n     documentation I would be happy to provide it. I am not a \n     nuclear scientist and do not profess to be an expert at all. \n     I only hope to see this viable technology considered as part \n     of our policy to reduce foreign oil dependency.\n     Tim, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       In 2004 my mother-in-law passed away in Filer. My father-\n     in-law was not coping well without his wife. My wife and I \n     live in Soda Springs. We made the decision to have the wife \n     move back to Filer with her dad for awhile. She found a great \n     job in Twin and things were going well so we purchased \n     another home in Twin and she stayed there helping her family, \n     Dad and making much more money with a career in Twin Falls \n     that was not available in Soda Springs. This was fine until \n     last year when fuel started rising. With two homes, double \n     utilities and raising gas prices our weekly commutes of 177 \n     miles between Soda and Twin all but ended. We are in the \n     process of moving the wife back to Soda and renting out the \n     Twin Falls home. Fuel costs and rising costs in general have \n     created a huge hardship for us. With both of our incomes, it \n     is just cheaper to combine in Soda rather than try to \n     commute. With two good incomes, you would think we would be \n     in fat city! We give up a very good income by my wife moving \n     back to Soda. We have almost divorced over this as it has \n     caused so much stress.\n       My thoughts on energy: I know we have much natural gas and \n     it burns in vehicles\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\n     but no infrastructure to utilize it. It is also clean. I also \n     know this country has a huge supply of coal. The Germans \n     refined gas from coal in WW2. The tree huggers and go gooders \n     will never permit it. We need to stop any use of foreign oil \n     as soon as possible. They have us over a barrel . . . no pun \n     intended.\n     Bob and Dianne, Soda Springs.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a disabled 52-year-old man on a fixed income; SSI. I \n     am a past City of Pocatello employee for almost 20 years in \n     the field of law enforcement. I have no retirement and depend \n     solely on SSI income. I was born and raised in Pocatello, \n     worked for the municipality and now struggles to survive. I \n     now stay home or go to medical appointments. I no longer has \n     discretionary funds, not even for gas.\n       That's my story, and I'm stuck with it.\n     Michael.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you so much for your honest interest in the everyday \n     Idahoan and the effect that gas prices have on our lives. I \n     do not have a unique story to share with you. I am \n     wholeheartedly in agreement that we need new sources for our \n     energy usage. I believe that we need to drill for oil on our \n     own soil. It would seem to me that there must be ways to do \n     that and keep environmental concerns in mind. I believe that \n     there are things that can be done to make vehicles use \n     gasoline more efficiently; perhaps even run on alternate \n     materials. Public transportation needs updated and should \n     include ways to help all members of our population.\n       I am very fortunate that my husband and I have jobs that \n     have not been cut due to the recent rise in energy costs, but \n     we are making changes in the way we live our day. I got a job \n     closer to home, we stopped going for evening drives as a form \n     of entertainment, we are not going on a vacation this summer, \n     we combine our errands into one trip, we had a more efficient \n     heating/cooling system installed in our home, and got a more \n     efficient roof. We are doing what we know how to do, as I \n     imagine are most people.\n       I do want to suggest that docking the oil companies with \n     wind-fall taxes isn't going to help. They will just hike the \n     prices of the gas to cover their taxes. Some creative minds \n     need to be gathered together to help the U.S. get themselves \n     out of the mess they've gotten themselves into. It is time to \n     cut the ties with eastern oil producers. That would seem a \n     much more efficient and strong message than fighting with \n     their countries' leaders. Big oil companies will, no doubt, \n     have to make some changes to the way they do business. We all \n     have to make changes. So many people have lost their jobs. \n     For some people, the cost of gas offsets the income they make \n     by going to work.\n       I hope these thoughts will be of some help to you. I thank \n     you, again, for working to help all of us.\n     Peggy, Boise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10058-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today I applaud the passage of the \nNative American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination \nReauthorization Act of 2008, NAHASDA. This act will continue to provide \nthousands of homes for American Indian and Alaska Native families.\n  The bill passed today reauthorizes and enhances the Native American \nHousing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, NAHASDA, adopted in \n1996. The act provides formula-based block grant assistance to Indian \ntribes, which allows them the flexibility to design housing programs to \naddress the needs of their communities.\n  The system set up by this housing law has been very successful in \naddressing the housing crisis in Indian Country, and this \nreauthorization will go even further in providing homes to thousands of \nIndian families who desperately need them. Instead of being a one size \nfits all national program; it provides grants to tribes, allowing them \nto tailor housing programs to fit their needs. It has already enabled \nthousands of families to rent and own homes, and now thousands more \nwill have access to much needed housing.\n  Despite the continued success of NAHASDA, there is still a housing \ncrisis in Indian Country, where 90,000 Indian families are homeless or \nunderhoused. Of those who do have housing, approximately 40 percent of \non-reservation housing is considered inadequate, and over one-third of \nIndian homes are overcrowded.\n  The legislation passed today will strengthen NAHASDA by providing \ntribes with increased flexibility, with the goal of producing more \nhomes in Indian Country. The bill will allow funds to be utilized for \ncommunity buildings such as daycare centers, laundromats, and \nmultipurpose community centers, with the hope of not only building \nhomes but also building communities. The bill also authorizes a study \nto assess the existing data sources for determining the need for \nhousing and funding programs.\n  Adequate housing is the first and most necessary step in building a \nstrong community, and many people in Indian Country have gone on for \nfar too long without a roof over their heads. This bill is more than \njust a housing act--it will give tribes more authority over their own \nland and truly help build stronger communities in Indian Country.\n  Mr. President, please allow me to thank Leader Reid, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Dodd, Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka and Senator \nShelby for their commitment in getting this legislation passed.\n  Thank you to the Senate staff for their hard work on this bill, \nincluding Allison Binney, Heidi Frechette, Tracy Hartzler-Toon, David \nMullon, Jim Hall, Jenn Fogel-Bublick, and Mark Calabria.\n  Also, thank you to Representative Kildee, Representative Frank, \nRepresentative Watt, and their staff, Kimberly Teehee, Dominique McCoy, \nCassandra Duhaney, and Hilary West.\n  Finally, this bill would not have been possible without the tireless \nwork of tribal leaders, the National American Indian Housing Council, \nthe National Congress of American Indians, the National Indian Health \nBoard, and Indian housing advocates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10058-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10058-S10059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid the following statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                  NASA\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, we have just passed \nthe NASA reauthorization bill. It is noteworthy that next week, October \n1, the 50th anniversary of the start of the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, and if my colleagues will recall, that was 1958. \nMy colleagues may remember what was happening. The Soviet Union had \nsurprised us by putting into orbit the first satellite, Sputnik and \nAmerica, in midst of the cold war among two superpowers, was absolutely \nshocked that we were behind in our technology; that we could not be \npremier. Then, lo and behold, 3 years later, they shocked us again by \nputting the first human in orbit, Yuri Gagarin, for one orbit when, in \nfact, we only had a rocket, the Redstone, that could get a human into \nsuborbit. Then we put Alan Shepard and subsequently Gus Grissom in \nsuborbit, and then, in the meantime, the Soviet Union put Titov into \nseveral orbits. Of course, the eyes of the world then focused in on \nCape Canaveral, when a young marine, one of the original seven American \nastronauts, named John Glenn, climbed into that capsule knowing that \nthe Atlas rocket had a 20-percent chance of failure. He rode it into \nthe heavens for only three orbits. There was an indication on the \ninstrument panel that his heat shield was loose, and as he started the \ndeorbit burn, John Glenn knew that if that was an accurate reading, on \nreentry into the Earth's fiery atmosphere, heating up in excess of \n3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, he would burn up. It is that memorable time \nwhen we heard his last words before he went into the blackout period on \nradio transmissions: John Glenn humming ``The Battle Hymn of the \nRepublic.'' It is hard to tell that story without getting a lump in my \nthroat.\n  Of course, what then happened, months before we flew John Glenn, we \nhad a young President who said: We are going to the Moon and back \nwithin 9 years. This Nation came together. It focused the political \nwill, it provided the resources, and it did what people did not think \ncould be done.\n  A generation of young people so inspired by this Nation's space \nprogram started pouring into the universities, into math and science \nand technology and engineering. That generation that was educated in \nhigh technology has been the generation that has led us to be the \nleader in a global marketplace by producing the technology, the \ninnovations, the intellectual capital that has allowed us to continue \nto be that leader.\n  So it is with that background that this Senator, who has the \nprivilege of chairing the Space and Science Subcommittee within the \nCommerce Committee, wants to say: Happy birthday, NASA. We are sending \nto the House of\n\n[[Page S10059]]\n\nRepresentatives tonight this NASA reauthorization bill, which will give \nthe flexibility to the next President, and his designee as the next \nleader of NASA, the flexibility in a very troubled program that has not \nhad the resources to do all the things that are demanded of it to try \nto continue to keep America preeminent in space; also to continue to \nhave access to our own International Space Station that we built and \npaid for; and then to chart out a course for the future exploration of \nthe heavens that will keep us fulfilling our destiny of our character \nas an American people, which is that by nature we are explorers and \nadventurers.\n  We never want to give that up. If we ever do, we will be a second-\nrate nation. But we would not because we have always had a frontier, a \nnew frontier. In the development of this country, it used to be \nwestward. Now it i upward and it is inward and that is the frontier we \nwant to continue to explore.\n  So happy birthday, NASA. It is my hope that we will have the House of \nRepresentatives take this up on their suspension calendar tomorrow.\n  I wish to give great credit to the staff who are in the room for the \nmajority and the minority. They all have worked at enormous overload--\nChan Lieu and Jeff Bingham. Jeff, despite the fact of having suffered a \nheart attack earlier this year, and we didn't even let him out of his \nrecuperative bed but that I was on the phone with him getting him to \nstart corralling all these other Senators and House Members so we could \nget a consensus, so we could come together in an agreement.\n  The result tonight is the fact that this has been cleared in a 100-\nMember Senate, when Senators are on edge and they are always looking \nfor something to object to, and there is no objection here, as ruled by \nthe Presiding Officer.\n  My congratulations to all the people, to the staff of the Commerce \nCommittee, and to the staff of the Science and Technology Committee in \nthe House of Representatives, chaired by Congressman Bart Gordon of \nTennessee. I am very grateful for everybody coming together and making \nthis happen.\n  I want to say a special thanks to all of the Senate staff who worked \nso hard on the NASA authorization bill. Not just Chan Lieu and Jeff \nBingham, but also Ann Zulkosky and Beth Bacon on the Commerce \nCommittee, as well as Art Maples, my Congressional Fellow. We also had \ntremendous support from our legislative council, Lloyd Ator and John \nBaggley.

That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the Harkin grants for Iowa public schools. Since \n1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million for the \nState government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to \nreceive these grants for a range of renovation and repair efforts, \neverything from updating fire safety systems to building new schools or \nrenovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal funding is \nused to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it often has a \ntremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Cedar Rapids Community School District received Harkin grants \ntotaling $4,912,132 which it used to help modernize and make safety \nimprovements throughout the district. Six Harkin construction grants \ntotaling $3,750,000 have helped with several projects. A 1999 grant was \nused to help build Viola Gibson Elementary School, and Harkin grants \nhelped the district build additions for science and fine arts at \nJefferson, Kennedy, and Washington High Schools; additions which \nincluded media centers and additional classrooms at Hoover, Roosevelt, \nand McKinley Middle Schools and Pierce and Wilson Elementary Schools \nand to also make plumbing and HVAC improvements at McKinley. These \nschools are the modern, state-of-the-art facilities that befit the \neducational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, \nthey are the kind of schools that every child in America deserves.\n  The district also received six fire safety grants totaling $1,162,132 \nto make improvements at buildings throughout the district. The \nimprovements included upgraded fire alarm systems, electrical work and \nother safety repairs. The Federal grants have made it possible for the \ndistrict to provide quality and safe schools for their students.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Cedar Rapids Community School District. In particular, I would like \nto recognize the leadership of the board of education--John Laverty, \nKeith Westercamp, Lisa Kuzela, Ann Rosenthal, Melissa Kiliper-Ernst, \nMary Meisterling, and Judy Goldberg, and former board members Richard \nBradford, Ken Childress, Doug Henderson, Jeff Ilten, Dennis Kral, Becki \nLynch, Susan McDermott, Ron Olson, and Al Smith.\n  I would also like to recognize superintendent David Markward, former \nsuperintendent Lew Finch, and staff members including Doug Smith, Bob \nGertsen, Steve Graham, Susan Peterson, Tom Day, Chris McGuire, Barb \nHarms, Brian Krob, Kathy Conley, Connie Tesar, Wayne Knapp, Larry \nMartin, Bill Utterback, Joyce Fowler, Tim Virden, Rick Netolicky, Becky \nDeWald, Ralph Plagman, Bob Tesar, Terry Strait, Mary Wilcynski, Shannon \nBucknell, Richard Sedlacek, Ken Morgan, Valerie Dolezal, Mike Allen, \nSteve Hilby, Kristen Ricky, Brian Litts, Gregg Petersen, Kathleen \nReyner, and David Dvorak, and the following individuals from Shive \nHattery: George Kanz, Keith Johnk, Jim Knowles, Doug DuCharme, Tim \nFehr, and Chad Siems.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities.

Madam President, I wish today to recognize Rose \nLarson of Rapid City, SD. This summer, Rose retired from Federal \nservice after a career spanning over 21 years.\n  Rose worked as an office manager in the Rapid City district office \nfor Senator Tom Daschle for approximately 18 years and joined my \ndistrict office staff in March 2005. Over her years of service, she \nprovided consistent and commendable service to both myself and Senator \nDaschle. Her expertise with the various office technologies often kept \nthe offices up and running efficiently. She was also able to \neffectively serve as a front line of communication for the general \npublic when they contacted my office with comments on issues of \nimportance.\n  Over 11 years ago, Rose was diagnosed with breast cancer. She fought \ncancer with a steadfast passion and commitment to beat the disease. Her \nsuccess has served as inspiration to others who have battled and are \ncurrently battling cancer. She has worked tirelessly to educate \nfriends, family, and the general public on cancer prevention, \ntreatment, and how to fight the disease. She has worked with the \nAmerican Cancer Society on Relay for Life events in western South \nDakota and helped develop teams to raise money to fight cancer.

Madam President, I wish today to recognize and \ncommend George Strandell of South Dakota for his nearly 40 years of \nservice to Golden West Telecommunications Cooperative, Inc. George is \nretiring after serving the past 8 years as general manager and chief \nexecutive officer of Golden West.\n  George worked for 19 years as a primary engineering consultant for \nthe Golden West Telecommunications Cooperative before being hired as \nthe company's outside plant engineer. He served in that capacity for 4 \nyears before serving 8 years as district manager and then 8 years as \ngeneral manager of Golden West.\n  Throughout his career, George had dedicated himself to building \neffective relationships and partnerships on behalf of Golden West and \nthe independent telecommunications industry. He is well-respected \nthroughout South Dakota, the region and Nation as an effective \ncommunicator, an administrator willing to tackle and resolve personnel \nand industry challenges and issues. He is able to effectively \ncommunicate to elected leaders and officials on issues affecting Golden \nWest customers, employees, and the independent industry.\n  Throughout his career, he has always worked hard to put the customer \nfirst. He has helped expand and enhance Golden West's role in the \nindustry, among allies and associates, but also improved the company's \nability to serve rural communities and customers and the overall \ngeneral public.\n  George provided steadfast oversight to the South Dakota Network, \nwhich was formed by a number of South Dakota independent \ntelecommunications firms to offer customers more choice in long \ndistance service. George spent considerable time and effort working \nwith other managers to ensure the network's success to move voice, \ndata, and video over 20,000 miles of fiber optics throughout the \nregion. Access lines have increased under George from 31,000 in 2000 to \n43,000 in 2008, as well as Internet access increasing from 5,000 to \n23,000 in the same period.\n  On a national level, George has been a stalwart advocate in promoting \nand assisting the independent industry. He has served on numerous \nboards and committees that have advanced the promotion and \nunderstanding of the issues affecting the independent \ntelecommunications firms and their customers.\n  Over the years, I have relied on George's guidance and understanding \nof the many issues affecting the telecommunications industry. I have \nappreciated his insight and input and I want to wish him all the best \nin this well-deserved retirement. I know that whatever his pursuits in \nretirement, he will approach them with the same level-headed, calm, and \ncommitted approach that earned him deep respect over his accomplished \ncareer with Golden West.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10064-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10064-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10064-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10064-S10065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               ENROLLED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  At 11:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       S. 496.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Alaska urging Congress to pass legislation to open the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil \n     and gas exploration, development, and production; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                           Senate Resolution\n\n       Whereas, in 16 U.S.C. 3142 (sec. 1002 of the Alaska \n     National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA)), the \n     United States Congress reserved the right to permit further \n     oil and gas exploration, development, and production within \n     the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       Whereas the oil and gas industry, the state, and the United \n     States Department of the Interior consider the Arctic coastal \n     plain to have the highest potential for discovery of very \n     large oil and gas accumulations on the continent of North \n     America, estimated to include as much as 10,000,000,000 \n     barrels of recoverable oil and significant amounts of natural \n     gas; and\n       Whereas, while new oil and natural gas field developments \n     on the North Slope of Alaska, such as Alpine, Northstar, and \n     West Sak, may temporarily slow the decline in production, \n     only giant coastal plain fields have the theoretical \n     capability of increasing the production volume of Alaska oil \n     and gas to a significant degree; and\n       Whereas the state's future energy independence would be \n     enhanced with additional natural gas production from the \n     North Slope of Alaska, including what are expected to be \n     significant gas reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, and the development of those reserves would enhance \n     the economic viability of the proposed Alaska Natural Gas \n     Pipeline; and\n       Whereas the proposed Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline and the \n     Trans Alaska Pipeline System are transportation facilities \n     that will be and are national assets that are integral to \n     satisfying the present and future needs of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas the ``1002 study area'' is part of the coastal \n     plain located within the North Slope Borough, and many of the \n     residents of the North Slope Borough, who are predominantly \n     Inupiat Eskimo, are supportive of development in the ``1002 \n     study area''; and\n       Whereas enhancements in technology can be used in a manner \n     that minimizes the area within the refuge that is used for \n     exploration and development, while providing the nation with \n     a needed supply of oil and gas; and\n       Whereas the oil and gas industry is using innovative \n     technology and environmental practices in the new field \n     developments at Alpine and Northstar, and those techniques \n     are directly applicable to operating on the coastal plain and \n     would enhance environmental protection beyond traditionally \n     high standards; and\n       Whereas the oil and gas industry has shown at Prudhoe Bay, \n     as well as at other locations along the Arctic coastal plain, \n     that it is capable of conducting oil and gas activity without \n     adversely affecting the environment or wildlife populations; \n     and\n       Whereas opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge now allows sufficient time for planning \n     environmental safeguards, development, and national security \n     review; and\n       Whereas the state will ensure the continued health and \n     productivity of the Porcupine caribou herd and the protection \n     of land, water, and wildlife resources during the exploration \n     and development of the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge; and\n       Whereas 8,900,000 of the 19,000,000 acres of the refuge \n     have already been set aside as wilderness; and\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\n       Whereas the 1,500,000-acre coastal plain of the refuge \n     makes up only eight percent of the 19,000,000-acre refuge, \n     and the development of the oil and gas reserves in the \n     refuge's coastal plain would affect an area of only 2,000 to \n     7,000 acres, which is less than one-half of one percent of \n     the area of the coastal plain; and\n       Whereas the continued competitiveness and stability of the \n     state and its economy require that the Senate consider \n     national trends toward renewable energy development; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages the use of revenue from any \n     development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the \n     development of renewable energy resources in the state; be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the United States Congress \n     to pass legislation to open the coastal plain of the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, \n     development, and production, and that the Senate is adamantly \n     opposed to further wilderness or other restrictive \n     designation in the area of the coastal plain of the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the oil and gas exploration, development, \n     and production be conducted in a manner that protects the \n     environment and the naturally occurring population levels of \n     the Porcupine caribou herd on which the Gwich'in and other \n     local residents depend, that uses directional drilling and \n     other advances in technology to minimize the development \n     footprint in the ``1002 study area,'' and that uses the \n     state's workforce to the maximum extent possible; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the United States Congress \n     to pass legislation opening the ``1002 study area'' for oil \n     and gas development while continuing to work on measures for \n     increasing the development and use of renewable energy \n     technologies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate opposes any unilateral reduction \n     in royalty revenue from exploration and development of the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and any \n     attempt to coerce the State of Alaska into accepting less \n     than the 90 percent of the oil, gas, and mineral royalties \n     from the federal land in Alaska that was promised to the \n     state at statehood.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-437. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of Colorado concerning state implementation plan \n     credits for remote vehicle emissions testing programs; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution 08-014\n\n       Whereas Colorado's IM 240 enhanced emissions inspection and \n     repair program was enacted to comply with the federal ``Clean \n     Air Act'' program requirements of the federal Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) and is included in the Colorado State \n     Implementation Plan approved by the EPA; and\n       Whereas the use of remote sensing technology has been \n     determined to be effective in identifying automobile tailpipe \n     emissions that are cleaner than necessary to achieve \n     compliance with the IM 240 program, and a remote sensing \n     rapid screen program is currently being implemented in the \n     Denver metropolitan area; and\n       Whereas pursuant to House Bill 06-1302, the Colorado \n     Department of Public Health and Environment is conducting a \n     pilot program to determine whether remote sensing technology \n     can effectively identify high-emitting vehicles in a full-\n     scale program; and\n       Whereas the high-emitter pilot program is anticipated to be \n     completed no later than July 2010; and\n       Whereas the implementation of a remote sensing rapid screen \n     program, coupled with a high-emitter identification and \n     repair program, could result in a more efficient and cost-\n     effective means of achieving greater vehicle emissions \n     reductions than the current IM 240 enhanced emissions \n     inspection and repair program; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-sixth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein: That, at the conclusion of Colorado's \n     high-emitter pilot program, the EPA is urged to quickly \n     complete its evaluation of whether the high-emitter \n     identification and repair program, coupled with the rapid \n     screen program, may receive state implementation plan \n     emission reduction credits equivalent to those received for \n     the IM 240 enhanced emissions inspection and repair program; \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, each member of Colorado's Congressional \n     delegation, and the Administrator of the EPA.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-438. A joint memorial adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of Colorado memorializing Congress to restore funding \n     for the federal Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n     Grant Program; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial 08-001\n\n       Whereas the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \n     Program is the largest justice assistance grant provided to \n     states, and it funds state and local government efforts in a \n     broad range of activities such as drug treatment and \n     enforcement, criminal reentry initiatives, crime prevention, \n     and corrections activities; and\n       Whereas the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \n     Program provides vital criminal justice funding for states \n     because its flexible grant purposes permit states to innovate \n     in a wide variety of criminal justice programs based on \n     shifting community needs; and\n       Whereas forty percent of the moneys from the Edward Byrne \n     Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program are sent to local \n     law enforcement agencies in counties and municipalities and \n     sixty percent of the moneys are distributed through the state \n     governments; and\n       Whereas grants may be used to provide personnel, equipment, \n     training, technical assistance, and rehabilitation of \n     offenders who violate state and local laws; and\n       Whereas grants may also be used to provide assistance, \n     other than compensation, to victims of offenders; and\n       Whereas from 2003-07, Colorado's Edward Byrne Memorial \n     Justice Assistance Grant Program funding has been reduced \n     from a high of $8,013,014 in 2003 to $4,304,517 in 2007, a \n     fifty-five percent reduction; and\n       Whereas in the federal ``Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n     2008'', Pub.

and\n       Whereas the Colorado state budget, like other state \n     budgets, is facing a shortfall for the upcoming fiscal year \n     and cannot fill the funding gap left by the federal cut in \n     programs currently funded by the Edward Byrne Memorial \n     Justice Assistance Grant Program; and\n       Whereas this drastic cut in funding will result in the \n     dissolution or discontinuance of many law enforcement and \n     criminal justice programs; and\n       Whereas programs that are shut down due to lack of funding \n     cannot simply be restarted when the funding returns because \n     there are informants, ties to the community, and personnel \n     that will be lost with the funding shortfall; so as a result, \n     programs must be rebuilt from scratch; and\n       Whereas by law, the federal Department of Justice, which is \n     responsible for distributing the moneys for the Edward Byrne \n     Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, cannot write \n     checks to local law enforcement agencies for less than \n     $10,000; therefore any state or local entity that received \n     less than $30,000 in the federal fiscal year 2007 will \n     receive no moneys in the federal fiscal year 2008; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-sixth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein: (1) That we, the members of the Colorado \n     General Assembly, urge Congress to restore funding for the \n     Edward Bryne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program and \n     thereby continue the financial support that is critical to \n     enabling local law enforcement agencies to continue \n     protecting the lives and property of citizens in their \n     communities; and (2) That we urge Colorado's congressional \n     delegation to support funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial \n     Justice Assistance Grant Program through emergency \n     supplemental spending bill legislation. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of \n     the United States Senate, the Majority Leader and the \n     Minority Leader of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of Colorado's Congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-439. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of Colorado concerning endorsement of the federal \n     ``Post 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007''; to \n     the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution 08-015\n\n       Whereas men and women serving in the United States Armed \n     Forces put their lives on hold in order to serve and protect \n     our country and, as such, deserve a tangible expression of \n     our gratitude; and\n       Whereas the federal ``Post 9/11 Veterans Educational \n     Assistance Act of 2007'' seeks to expand the list of \n     educational benefits offered to United States military \n     service men and women who have served in the Armed Forces \n     since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; and\n       Whereas the proposed legislation amends the GI Bill that \n     was passed in the 1940s after World War II to help Veterans \n     readjust to civilian life and to enable them to pursue \n     education and training upon their return from military \n     service; and\n       Whereas occupational instability is only one of several \n     postwar readjustment problems with which veterans have \n     struggled since their military service, as reported by the \n     National Vietnam Veterans' Readjustment Study; and\n       Whereas it is of paramount importance that the federal \n     government extend provisions of educational assistance to \n     military personnel serving in the post-9/11 era to help \n     offset the postwar readjustment problems endured by so many \n     veterans to this day; and\n       Whereas several military and veterans groups, such as the \n     Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United \n     States (EANGUS), the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), the \n     Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), and the Air Force \n     Sergeants Association (AFSA), have voiced support for the \n     proposed legislation; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-sixth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:  (1) That we, the members of the Colorado \n     General Assembly, support the federal ``Post 9/11 Veterans \n     Educational Assistance Act of 2007''; and (2) That we \n     encourage members of Congress to adopt this legislation in \n     order to enable our country's military service men and women \n     to pursue their educational goals so they can further enrich \n     lives. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to \n     Colorado's Congressional delegation, each member of the \n     United States Senate, the United Veterans Committee of \n     Colorado, and Jim Webb, United States Senator for Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-440.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 3651. A bill to provide for the settlement df certain claims under \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Tlingit and Haida people, the first \npeople of Southeast Alaska, were perhaps the first group of Alaska \nNatives to organize for the purpose of asserting their aboriginal land \nclaims. The Native land claims movement in the rest of Alaska did not \ngain momentum until the 1960s when aboriginal land titles were \nthreatened by the impending construction of the Trans Alaska Pipeline. \nIn southeast Alaska, the taking of Native lands for the Tongass \nNational Forest and Glacier Bay National Monument spurred the Tlingit \nand Haida\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\npeople to fight to recover their lands in the early part of the 20th \nCentury.\n  One of the first steps in this battle came with the formation of the \nAlaska Native Brotherhood in 1912. In 1935, the Jurisdictional Act, \nwhich allowed the Tlingit and Haida Indians to pursue their land claims \nin the U.S. Court of Claims, was enacted by Congress.\n  After decades of litigation, the Native people of southeast Alaska \nreceived a cash settlement in 1968 from the Court of Claims for the \nland previously taken to create the Tongass National Forest and the \nGlacier Bay National Monument. Yes there was a cash settlement of $7.5 \nmillion but the Native people of southeast Alaska have long believed \nthat it did not adequately compensate them for the loss of their lands \nand resources.\n  Beware the law of unintended consequences. When the Native people of \nsoutheast Alaska chose to pursue their land claims in court they could \nnot have foreseen that Congress would ultimately settle the land claims \nof all of Alaska's Native people through the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act of 1971. Nor could they have foreseen that they would be \ndisadvantaged in obtaining the return of their aboriginal lands because \nof their early, and ultimately successful, effort to litigate their \nland claims. Sadly this was the case.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 imposed a series of \nhighly prescriptive limitations on the lands that Sealaska Corporation, \nthe regional Alaska Native Corporation formed for southeast Alaska, \ncould select in satisfaction of the Tlingit and Haida land claim. None \nof the other 11 Alaska based regional Native corporations were subject \nto these limitations. Today, I join with Mr. Stevens, Mr. Akaka and Mr. \nInouye to introduce legislation to right this wrong.\n\n  For the most part, Sealaska Corporation has agreed to live within the \nconstraints imposed by the 1971 legislation. It has taken conveyance to \n290,000 acres from the pool of lands it was allowed to select under the \n1971 act. As Sealaska moves to finalize its land selections it has \nasked the Congress for flexibility to receive title to certain lands \nwhich it was not permitted to select under the prescriptive, and as \nSealaska believes, discriminatory, limitations contained in the 1971 \nlegislation.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would allow Sealaska to \nselect its remaining entitlement from outside of the withdrawal areas \npermitted in the 1971 legislation. It allows the Native corporation to \nselect up to 3,600 acres of its remaining land entitlement from lands \nwith sacred, cultural, traditional or historical significance. \nSubstantial restrictions will be placed on the use of these lands.\n  Up to 5,000 acres of land could be selected for non-timber related \neconomic development. These lands are called ``Native Futures'' lands \nin the bill. Other lands referred to as ``economic development lands'' \nin the bill could be used for timber related and nontimber related \neconomic development. These lands are on Prince of Wales Island.\n  Sealaska observes that if it were required to take title to lands \nwithin the constraints prescribed by the 1971 legislation it would take \ntitle to large swaths of roadless acres in pristine portions of the \nTongass National Forest. The lands it proposes to take for economic \nuses under this legislation are predominantly in roaded and less \nsensitive areas of the Tongass National Forest.\n  The pools of lands which would be available to Sealaska under this \nlegislation are depicted on a series of maps referred to in the bill. \nIt must be emphasized that not all of the lands depicted on these maps \nwill end up in Sealaska's ownership. Sealaska cannot receive title to \nlands in excess of its remaining acreage entitlement under the 1971 \nlegislation and this legislation does not change that entitlement.\n  Earlier in the 110th Congress, several of our friends in the other \nbody introduced H.R. 3560 to address these issues. Over the past year, \nSealaska and the communities of southeast Alaska have worked \ncollaboratively in good faith to identify issues that may arise from \nthe transfer of lands on which those communities have relied for \nsubsistence and recreation out of the Tongass National Forest and into \nNative corporation ownership. My colleagues in the Alaska congressional \ndelegation and I have devoted a great deal of time in reaching out and \nencouraging comment from southeast Alaska on H.R. 3560. Sealaska has \nitself conducted numerous public meetings on the bill in southeast \nAlaska. I believe that these efforts have helped us to formulate a bill \nthat addresses the concerns we most frequently heard.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is different from H.R. 3560 \nin numerous respects. In some cases, the lands open to Sealaska \nselection have changed from those which were referred to in H.R. 3560 \nto accommodate community concerns. Our conversations have led to \nprecedent setting commitments by the Sealaska Corporation to maintain \npublic access to the economic development lands it receives on Prince \nof Wales Island for subsistence uses and recreational access. These \ncommitments are laid out in Section 4(d) of our bill.\n  Sealaska has also offered a series of commitments to ensure that the \nbenefits of this legislation flow to the broader southeast Alaska \neconomy and not just to the corporation and its Native shareholders. \nThese commitments are memorialized in a letter from Sealaska's \nchairman, Alaska State Senator Albert Kookesh, and its president and \nchief executive officer, Chris E. McNeil, Jr.\n  It comes as no secret to anyone that this legislation is introduced \nas we enter what may be the final hours of the 110th Congress. There \nwill not be sufficient opportunity in the remaining hours of this \nCongress to consider the legislation. It will need to be reintroduced \nin January 2009. We hope that we can move on it in the early part of \nthe 111th Congress.\n  In the meantime, we encourage and welcome comments from the people \nand communities of southeast Alaska on the revised legislation and hope \nthat we will be able to productively use the next few months to \nidentify and resolve any issues or concerns that remain before the \n111th Congress begins.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3651\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Southeast Alaska Native Land \n     Entitlement Finalization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) in 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) to recognize and \n     settle the aboriginal claims of Alaska Natives to land \n     historically used by Alaska Natives for traditional, \n     cultural, and spiritual purposes; and\n       (B) that Act declared that the land settlement ``should be \n     accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in conformity with the \n     real economic and social needs of Natives'';\n       (2) the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 \n     et seq.)--\n       (A) authorized the distribution of approximately \n     $1,000,000,000 and 44,000,000 acres of land to Alaska \n     Natives; and\n       (B) provided for the establishment of Native Corporations \n     to receive and manage the funds and that land to meet the \n     cultural, social, and economic needs of Native shareholders;\n       (3) under section 12 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n     Act (43 U.S.C. 1611), each Regional Corporation, other than \n     Sealaska Corporation (the Regional Corporation for southeast \n     Alaska) (referred to in this Act as ``Sealaska''), was \n     authorized to receive a share of land based on the proportion \n     that the number of Alaska Native shareholders residing in the \n     region of the Regional Corporation bore to the total number \n     of Alaska Native shareholders, or the relative size of the \n     area to which the Regional Corporation had an aboriginal land \n     claim bore to the size of the area to which all Regional \n     Corporations had aboriginal land claims;\n       (4)(A) Sealaska, the Regional Corporation for Southeast \n     Alaska, 1 of the Regional Corporations with the largest \n     number of Alaska Native shareholders, with more than 21 \n     percent of all original Alaska Native shareholders, did not \n     receive land under section 12 of the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1611);\n       (B) the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska was 1 of \n     the entities representing the Alaska Natives of southeast \n     Alaska before the date of enactment of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); and\n       (C) Sealaska did not receive land in proportion to the \n     number of Alaska Native shareholders, or in proportion to the \n     size of the\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\n     area to which Sealaska had an aboriginal land claim, in part \n     because of a United States Court of Claims cash settlement to \n     the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska in 1968 for \n     land previously taken to create the Tongass National Forest \n     and Glacier Bay National Monument;\n       (5) the Court of Claims cash settlement of $7,500,000 did \n     not--\n       (A) adequately compensate the Alaska Natives of southeast \n     Alaska for the significant quantity of land and resources \n     lost as a result of the creation of the Tongass National \n     Forest and Glacier Bay National Monument or other losses of \n     land and resources; or\n       (B) justify the significant disparate treatment of Sealaska \n     under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. \n     1611);\n       (6)(A) while each other Regional Corporation received a \n     significant quantity of land under sections 12 and 14 of the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1611, 1613), \n     Sealaska only received land under section 14(h) of that Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)), which provided a 2,000,000-acre land \n     pool from which Alaska Native selections could be made for \n     historic sites, cemetery sites, Urban Corporation land, \n     Native group land, and Native Allotments;\n       (B) under section 14(h)(8) of that Act (43 U.S.C. \n     1613(h)(8)), after selections are made under paragraphs (1) \n     through (7) of that section, the land remaining in the \n     2,000,000-acre land pool is allocated based on the proportion \n     that the original Alaska Native shareholder population of a \n     Regional Corporation bore to the original Alaska Native \n     shareholder population of all Regional Corporations; and\n       (C) the only land entitlement of Sealaska derives from a \n     proportion of leftover land remaining from the 2,000,000-acre \n     land pool, estimated as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     at approximately 1,700,000 acres;\n       (7) despite the small land base of Sealaska as compared to \n     other Regional Corporations (less than 1 percent of the total \n     quantity of land allocated pursuant to the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)), Sealaska \n     has--\n       (A) provided considerable benefits to shareholders; and\n       (B) been a significant economic force in southeast Alaska;\n       (8) pursuant to the revenue sharing provisions of section \n     7(i) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. \n     1606(i)), Sealaska has distributed more than $300,000,000 \n     during the period beginning on January 1, 1971, and ending on \n     December 31, 2005, to Native Corporations throughout the \n     State of Alaska from the development of natural resources, \n     which accounts for 42 percent of the total revenues shared \n     under that section during that period;\n       (9) as a result of the small land entitlement of Sealaska, \n     it is critical that the remaining land entitlement \n     conveyances to Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) are fulfilled to \n     continue to meet the economic, social, and cultural needs of \n     the Alaska Native shareholders of southeast Alaska and the \n     Alaska Native community throughout Alaska;\n       (10)(A) the conveyance requirements of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) for southeast \n     Alaska limit the land eligible for conveyance to Sealaska to \n     the original withdrawal areas surrounding 10 Alaska Native \n     villages in southeast Alaska, which precludes Sealaska from \n     selecting land located--\n       (i) in any withdrawal area established for the Urban \n     Corporations for Sitka and Juneau, Alaska; or\n       (ii) outside the 10 Alaska Native village withdrawal areas; \n     and\n       (B) unlike other Regional Corporations, Sealaska was not \n     authorized to request land located outside the withdrawal \n     areas described in subparagraph (A) if the withdrawal areas \n     were insufficient to complete the land entitlement of \n     Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n       (11) 44 percent (820,000 acres) of the 10 Alaska Native \n     village withdrawal areas established under the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) described in \n     paragraph (10) are composed of salt water and not available \n     for selection;\n       (12) of land subject to the selection rights of Sealaska, \n     110,000 acres are encumbered by gubernatorial consent \n     requirements under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n       (13) the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management \n     grossly underestimated the land entitlement of Sealaska under \n     the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et \n     seq.), resulting in an insufficient area from which Sealaska \n     could select land suitable for traditional, cultural, and \n     socioeconomic purposes to accomplish a settlement ``in \n     conformity with the real economic and social needs of \n     Natives'', as required under that Act;\n       (14) the 10 Alaska Native village withdrawal areas in \n     southeast Alaska surround the Alaska Native communities of \n     Yakutat, Hoonah, Angoon, Kake, Kasaan, Klawock, Craig, \n     Hydaburg, Klukwan, and Saxman;\n       (15) in each withdrawal area, there exist factors that \n     limit the ability of Sealaska to select sufficient land, and, \n     in particular, economically viable land, to fulfill the land \n     entitlement of Sealaska, including factors such as--\n       (A) with respect to the Yakutat withdrawal area--\n       (i) 46 percent of the area is salt water;\n       (ii) 10 sections (6,400 acres) around the Situk Lake were \n     restricted from selection, with no consideration provided for \n     the restriction; and\n       (iii)(I) 70,000 acres are subject to a gubernatorial \n     consent requirement before selection; and\n       (II) Sealaska received no consideration with respect to the \n     consent restriction;\n       (B) with respect to the Hoonah withdrawal area, 51 percent \n     of the area is salt water;\n       (C) with respect to the Angoon withdrawal area--\n       (i) 120,000 acres of the area is salt water;\n       (ii) Sealaska received no consideration regarding the \n     prohibition on selecting land from the 80,000 acres located \n     within the Admiralty Island National Monument; and\n       (iii)(I) the Village Corporation for Angoon was allowed to \n     select land located outside the withdrawal area on Prince of \n     Wales Island, subject to the condition that the Village \n     Corporation shall not select land located on Admiralty \n     Island; but\n       (II) no alternative land adjacent to the out-of-withdrawal \n     land of the Village Corporation was made available for \n     selection by Sealaska;\n       (D) with respect to the Kake withdrawal area--\n       (i) 64 percent of the area is salt water; and\n       (ii) extensive timber harvesting by the Forest Service \n     occurred in the area before 1971 that significantly reduced \n     the value of land available for selection by, and conveyance \n     to, Sealaska;\n       (E) with respect to the Kasaan withdrawal area--\n       (i) 54 percent of the area is salt water; and\n       (ii) the Forest Service previously harvested in the area;\n       (F) with respect to the Klawock withdrawal area--\n       (i) the area consists of only 5 townships, as compared to \n     the usual withdrawal area of 9 townships, because of the \n     proximity of the Klawock withdrawal area to the Village of \n     Craig, which reduces the selection area by 92,160 acres; and\n       (ii) the Klawock and Craig withdrawal areas are 35 percent \n     salt water;\n       (G) with respect to the Craig withdrawal area, the \n     withdrawal area consists of only 6 townships, as compared to \n     the usual withdrawal area of 9 townships, because of the \n     proximity of the Craig withdrawal area to the Village of \n     Klawock, which reduces the selection area by 69,120 acres;\n       (H) with respect to the Hydaburg withdrawal area--\n       (i) 36 percent of the area is salt water; and\n       (ii) Sealaska received no consideration under the Haida \n     Land Exchange Act of 1986 (Public Law No. 99-664; 100 Stat. \n     4303) for relinquishing selection rights to land within the \n     withdrawal area that the Haida Corporation exchanged to the \n     Forest Service;\n       (I) with respect to the Klukwan withdrawal area--\n       (i) 27 percent of the area is salt water; and\n       (ii) the withdrawal area is only 70,000 acres, as compared \n     to the usual withdrawal area of 207,360 acres, which reduces \n     the selection area by 137,360 acres; and\n       (J) with respect to the Saxman withdrawal area--\n       (i) 29 percent of the area is salt water;\n       (ii) Sealaska received no consideration for the 50,576 \n     acres within the withdrawal area adjacent to the first-class \n     city of Ketchikan that were excluded from selection;\n       (iii) Sealaska received no consideration with respect to \n     the 1977 amendment to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) requiring gubernatorial consent for \n     selection of 58,000 acres in that area; and\n       (iv) 23,888 acres are located within the Annette Island \n     Indian Reservation for the Metlakatla Indian Tribe and are \n     not available for selection;\n       (16) the selection limitations and guidelines applicable to \n     Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)--\n       (A) are inequitable and inconsistent with the purposes of \n     that Act because there is insufficient land remaining in the \n     withdrawal areas to meet the traditional, cultural, and \n     socioeconomic needs of the shareholders of Sealaska; and\n       (B) make it difficult for Sealaska to select--\n       (i) places of sacred, cultural, traditional, and historical \n     significance; and\n       (ii) Alaska Native futures sites located outside the \n     withdrawal areas of Sealaska;\n       (17)(A) the deadline for applications for selection of \n     cemetery sites and historic places on land outside withdrawal \n     areas established under section 14 of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1613) was July 1, 1976;\n       (B)(i) as of that date, the Bureau of Land Management \n     notified Sealaska that the total entitlement of Sealaska \n     would be approximately 200,000 acres; and\n       (ii) Sealaska made entitlement allocation decisions for \n     cultural sites and economic development sites based on that \n     original estimate;\n       (C) as a result of the Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration \n     Act (Public Law 108-452; 118 Stat. 3575) and subsequent \n     related determinations and actions of the Bureau of Land \n     Management, Sealaska will receive significantly more than \n     200,000 acres pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n     Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n\n[[Page S10072]]\n\n       (D) Sealaska would prefer to allocate more of the \n     entitlement of Sealaska to the acquisition of places of \n     sacred, cultural, traditional, and historical significance; \n     and\n       (E)(i) pursuant to section 11(a)(1) of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(1)), Sealaska was \n     not authorized to select under section 14(h)(1) of that Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)(1)) any site within Glacier Bay National \n     Park, despite the abundance of cultural sites within that \n     Park; and\n       (ii) Sealaska seeks cooperative agreements to ensure that \n     sites within Glacier Bay National Park are subject to \n     cooperative management by Sealaska, Village and Urban \n     Corporations, and federally recognized tribes with ties to \n     the cultural sites and history of the Park;\n       (18)(A) the cemetery sites and historic places conveyed to \n     Sealaska pursuant to section 14(h)(1) of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)(1)) are subject to a \n     restrictive covenant not required by law that does not allow \n     any type of management or use that would in any way alter the \n     historic nature of a site, even for cultural education or \n     research purposes;\n       (B) historic sites managed by the Forest Service are not \n     subject to the limitations referred to in subparagraph (A); \n     and\n       (C) those limitations hinder the ability of Sealaska to use \n     the sites for cultural, educational, or research purposes for \n     Alaska Natives and others;\n       (19) unless Sealaska is allowed to select land outside \n     designated withdrawal areas in southeast Alaska, Sealaska \n     will not be able--\n       (A) to complete the land entitlement selections of Sealaska \n     under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 \n     et seq.);\n       (B) to secure ownership of places of sacred, cultural, \n     traditional, and historical importance to the Alaska Natives \n     of Southeast Alaska;\n       (C) to maintain the existing resource development and \n     management operations of Sealaska; or\n       (D) to provide continued economic opportunities for Alaska \n     Natives in southeast Alaska;\n       (20) in order to realize cultural preservation goals while \n     also diversifying economic opportunities, Sealaska should be \n     authorized to select and receive conveyance of--\n       (A) sacred, cultural, traditional, and historic sites and \n     other places of traditional cultural significance, including \n     traditional and customary trade and migration routes, to \n     facilitate the perpetuation and preservation of Alaska Native \n     culture and history;

Lisa Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: On behalf of Sealaska Corporation \n     (Sealaska), I would like to express our appreciation to you \n     for your assistance on legislation to complete Sealaska's \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) land entitlement. \n     This legislation would complete Sealaska's land entitlement \n     by allowing Sealaska to select, and receive conveyance of, \n     lands located outside of the original Southeast Alaska ANCSA \n     land withdrawals. Under this proposal. Sealaska would receive \n     land for timber development, the creation of a more \n     diversified (non-timber) economic portfolio, and the \n     protection and perpetuation of Southeast Alaska's Native \n     culture. The land entitlement proposal affects many interests \n     in Southeast Alaska, and has required a significant amount of \n     communication. collaboration, and negotiation to finalize the \n     legislative language. We believe that we now have a \n     compromise bill that will benefit all of Southeast Alaska.\n       As you pursue introduction and legislative action on \n     Sealaska land entitlement legislation, we would like to \n     reiterate to you Sealaska's ongoing commitment to the \n     economic. cultural, social, and environmental health of \n     Southeast Alaska. In particular, you have expressed \n     significant concern regarding the economic and energy needs \n     of the region, and Sealaska's role in meeting those needs. We \n     can assure you that Sealaska has those same concerns. This \n     letter is our commitment to you that Sealaska will continue \n     to maintain its commitment to: the creation of economic and \n     employment opportunities for Sealaska shareholders and \n     residents of Southeast Alaska; collaboration with other \n     participants in the Southeast Alaska timber industry on \n     efforts to preserve the economic viability of locally owned \n     sawmills in Southeast Alaska; continued sale of timber at \n     fair market value to local mills and local producers of wood \n     products; addressing high rural energy costs, including \n     through the development of wood biomass alternative fuels; \n     and coordination and collaboration with Indian tribes, \n     Village Corporations, Urban Corporations, local small \n     businesses. and Federal, State, and local agencies regarding \n     economic and energy matters, among other things. We hope that \n     this commitment will provide you with some assurance that the \n     economic health of Southeast Alaska is a shared aspiration of \n     both you and Sealaska.\n       If we can be of assistance to you, as you pursue \n     legislative action on the Sealaska land entitlement \n     legislation, please do not hesitate to contact me. Again, \n     thank you for your guidance and leadership on this important \n     piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Albert M. Kookesh,\n       Chairman of the Board.\n     Chris E. McNeil, Jr.\n       President and CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 3654. A bill to improve research on health hazards in housing, to \nenhance the capacity of programs to reduce such hazards, to require \noutreach, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I introduce today the Research, Hazard \nIntervention, and National Outreach for Healthier Homes Act. I am \nintroducing this legislation because decent and safe housing is \npossibly one of the most critical determinants of our overall health \nand well-being. Indeed, where we live greatly affects how we live.\n  A June 2006 report from the World Health Organization entitled \n``Preventing Disease Through Healthy Environments,'' found that \nenvironmental exposures contribute to almost one-quarter of the disease \nburden worldwide, resulting in millions of preventable deaths each \nyear. Through scientific research, we know that an individual's \nenvironment can lead to cardiovascular disease, asthma, and lead \npoisoning, as well as many other diseases and conditions.\n  The connection between housing and health is not a new idea. Many of \nour nation's earliest housing standards resulted from the concentrated \nslum housing around factories and in big cities during the Industrial \nRevolution. And, after World War II, a national housing policy was \ndeclared in the National Housing Act of 1949, stating that there should \nbe: ``a decent home and a suitable living environment for every \nAmerican family.'' These early housing standards regarding ventilation, \nsanitation, occupancy, structural soundness, lighting, and other \nhabitability criteria greatly advanced our nation's public health.\n  I would also be remiss if I did not mention the passage of the Lead-\nBased Paint Poisoning Prevention Act in 1991, which has helped \ndramatically decrease lead poisoning in children over the past 15 \nyears. This law required the Secretary of the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development to establish and implement procedures to eliminate \nlead hazards from public housing.\n  In 1992, controls on lead-based paint and lead exposure were further \nenhanced by Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act. Title \nX defined ``hazard'' in such a way that it included deteriorating lead \npaint, and lead-contaminated dust and soil that the lead paint \ngenerates. It also mandated the creation of an infrastructure that \nwould help reduce lead paint hazards in our nation's housing.\n  Federal efforts regarding lead poisoning are a wonderful example of a \nfederal investment in housing that has produced significant benefits to \nour society while minimizing cost.\n  Unfortunately, the conditions of today's worst-case housing looks \nonly modestly better than it did a century ago. Now, we must determine \nthe role that the government can and should play in stimulating the \ncreation of truly decent and safe housing nationwide in the 21st \nCentury.\n  We can learn from some of our state and local governments about how \nto proceed. In my own state of Rhode Island, the State Department of \nHealth and the City of Providence code enforcement division offers \nquarterly training on the identification of housing hazards. Trainees \nwalk through homes with a standard assessment survey and evaluate them \nfor different environmental hazards, what has been fixed and what needs \nto be repaired or improved.\n  The Rhode Island Department of Health Family Outreach Program works \nin conjunction with the state's universal screening program to target \nRhode Island children, from birth to age three, who are at-risk for \npoor developmental outcomes. Families with children identified as ``at-\nrisk'' are contacted by a provider in their area and are offered a home \nvisit by a multidisciplinary team of nurses, social workers, and \nparaprofessionals. Home visitors also serve as the neighborhood follow-\nup for services.\n  We need to take advantage of some of the best ideas that are \ncurrently underway to make our homes and communities healthier. It is \nfor this reason that I am introducing, the Research, Hazard \nIntervention and National Outreach for Healthier Homes Act, which seeks \nto encourage and develop healthy housing initiatives in the public and \nprivate spheres.\n  The major purpose of this bill is to enhance and coordinate federal \nhealthy housing initiatives. Such coordination should reduce \nduplication in federal efforts and ensure sufficient data collection \nregarding both the housing conditions and the health problems in our \ncountry's housing stock.\n  Specifically, the bill would provide statutory authority for HUD's \nHealthy Homes program, expand the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention's current lead program to also address healthy housing \nissues, where appropriate, and establish the Environmental Protection \nAgency's Office of Children's Health Protection as the center for the \nEPA's healthy housing efforts.\n  It would also create a new Health Hazard Reduction competitive grant \nprogram at the EPA and HUD. Applicants must already be recipients of a \nfederal grant through an existing federal program such as the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant, CDBG, the HOME Investment Partnerships \nProgram, weatherization assistance, low-income home energy assistance, \nor the rural housing assistance programs. After the first three years, \nthe EPA and HUD would evaluate the grant program's effectiveness by \ntaking into account the aggregate health, safety, energy savings, and \ndurability benefits resulting from the program. The CDC and the United \nStates Department of Agriculture's (USDA) current coordinated training \nactivities on housing-related hazards would also be expanded and \nevaluated.\n  In addition, the bill would expand national outreach about housing \nhazards through a combination of market-based incentives, the expansion \nof existing initiatives, and educational media campaigns. For example, \nthe EPA would evaluate and promote health protective products, \nmaterials,\n\n[[Page S10075]]\n\nand criteria for new and existing housing and create a voluntary \nlabeling program that would provide these items with a ``Healthy Home \nSeal of Approval''. The CDC, the EPA, and HUD would pool their \nresources to establish a national media campaign to raise public \nawareness about hazards in housing.\n  While our nation and nations around the world grapple with important \nsocial, economic, and international policy questions, we must keep in \nmind the important role healthy housing plays in all of these issues.\n  Scientific research has begun to unlock some of the connections \nbetween housing, community development, and health outcomes. The \nResearch, Hazard Intervention, and National, Outreach for Healthier \nHomes Act will help us start working to a time when every family has an \naffordable, decent, and healthy home. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin supporting this bill and other healthy housing efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3654\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Research, \n     Hazard Intervention, and National Outreach for Healthier \n     Homes Act of 2008''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Americans spend approximately 90 percent of their time \n     indoors, where 6,000,000 households live with moderate or \n     severe housing conditions, including heating, plumbing, and \n     electrical problems, and 24,000,000 households face \n     significant lead-based paint hazards.\n       (2) Housing-related health hazards can often be traced back \n     to shared causes, including moisture, ventilation, comfort, \n     pest, contaminant, and structural issues, but further \n     research is necessary in order to definitively understand key \n     relationships between the shared causes, housing-related \n     health hazards, and resident health.\n       (3) Since many hazards have interrelated causes and share \n     common solutions, the traditional approach of identifying and \n     remedying housing-related health hazards one-by-one is likely \n     not cost effective or sufficiently health-protective.\n       (4) Evidence-based, cost-effective, practical, and widely \n     accessible methods for the assessment and control of housing-\n     related health hazards are necessary in order to prevent \n     housing-related injuries and illnesses, including cancer, \n     carbon monoxide poisoning, burns, falls, rodent bites, \n     childhood lead poisoning, and asthma.\n       (5) Sustainable building features, including energy \n     efficiency measures, are increasingly popular, and are \n     generally presumed to have beneficial effects on occupant \n     health. However, the health effects of such features need to \n     be evaluated in a comprehensive and timely manner, lest the \n     housing in this country unintentionally revert to the \n     conditions of excessive building tightness and lack of \n     sufficient ventilation characteristic of the 1970s.\n       (6) Data collection on housing conditions that could affect \n     occupant health, and on health outcomes that could be related \n     to housing conditions, is scattered and insufficient to meet \n     current and future research needs for affordable, healthy \n     housing. A coordinated, multidata source system is necessary \n     to reduce duplication of Federal efforts, and to ensure \n     sufficient data collection of both the housing conditions and \n     the health problems that persist in the existing housing \n     stock of the Nation.\n       (7) Responsibilities related to health hazards in housing \n     are not clearly delineated among Federal agencies. \n     Categorical housing, health, energy assistance, and \n     environmental programs are narrowly defined and often ignore \n     opportunities to address multiple hazards simultaneously. \n     Enabling Federal programs to embrace a comprehensive healthy \n     housing approach will require removing unnecessary Federal \n     statutory and regulatory barriers, and creating incentives to \n     advance the complementary goals of environmental health, \n     energy conservation, and housing availability in relevant \n     programs.\n       (8) Personnel who visit homes to provide services or \n     perform other work (such as inspectors, emergency medical \n     technicians, home visitors, housing rehabilitation, \n     construction and maintenance workers, and others) can \n     contribute to occupant health by presenting and applying \n     healthy housing practices. Cost-effective training and \n     outreach is needed to equip such personnel with current \n     knowledge about delivering and maintaining healthy housing.\n       (9) Housing-related health hazards are often complex, with \n     causes and solutions often not readily or immediately \n     recognized by residents, property owners, or the general \n     public. In the 2005 American Housing Survey, significant \n     numbers of residents expressed the highest level of \n     satisfaction with their homes, including 20 percent of \n     residents in homes with severe physical problems and 18 \n     percent of residents in homes with moderate physical \n     problems. National awareness and local outreach programs are \n     needed to encourage the public to seek and expect healthy \n     housing, to think about housing hazards more comprehensively, \n     to recognize problems, and to address them in a preventative, \n     effective, and low-cost manner.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 626), expressing the sense of the Senate that \nthe Supreme Court of the United States erroneously decided Kennedy v. \nLouisiana, No. 07-343 (2008), and that the eighth amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States allows the imposition of the death \npenalty for the rape of a child, dated July 25, 2008, for the following \nreasons:\n  The Supreme Court has already shown its intention to revisit the \nKennedy v. Louisiana decision. The Court has petitioned the parties in \nthe case, as well as the United States Solicitor General, to submit \nsupplemental briefs in response to the standing Petition for Rehearing. \nDue to these pending proceedings I believe the United States Senate \nshould not take action at this time as it would be inappropriately \npremature.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY, pursuant to the provisions of section 512 of Public Law \n110-81, submitted his notice of intent to object to proceed to consider \nthe bill (H.R. 7083) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nenhance charitable giving and improve disclosure and tax \nadministration, dated September 26, 2008, for the following reasons:\n  I wrote a series of charitable reforms that became law in the Pension \nProtection Act of 2006. The reforms grew out of my oversight of tax-\nexempt organizations and laws, which had not been updated substantially \nsince 1969. This legislation would unwind some of the 2006 reforms as \nthey apply to certain supporting organizations.\n  Private foundations and supporting organizations enjoy tax-exempt \nstatus on their money. In exchange for that special status, they have \nto comply with a few requirements. One is that they pay out 5 percent \nof their assets each year. This pay-out requirement is meant to make \nsure the organization offers some public benefit in exchange for tax \nexemption and doesn't exist simply to invest its money and pay a staff \nand a board of directors--often family members--in perpetuity. Another \nrequirement is that private foundations and certain supporting \norganizations are subject to a tax on excess business holdings. In \ngeneral, the tax applies to substantial interests these\n\n[[Page S10082]]\n\norganizations may hold in corporations and other businesses. The tax is \ndesigned to make sure tax-exempt organizations don't shelter oil \nrefineries and yacht clubs from paying taxes.\n  A handful of organizations argue that these requirements are onerous \nor that they should be exempt because they were created before 1969. \nThere may be legitimate reasons to look at some of these issues, but \nthis legislation as written is much too broad. Thousands of \norganizations could be carved out of the payout requirement and \nbusiness holdings prohibition. The bill would unwind regulations \nimplementing the 2006 reforms before the regulations are even finished. \nIt contains several provisions that need much more study before being \nenacted. For all of these reasons, the legislation needs more work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/29/senate-section/article/S10082-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
