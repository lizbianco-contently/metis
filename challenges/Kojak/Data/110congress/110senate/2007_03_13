Mr. President, by now, most Americans have heard about \nthe appalling conditions at Walter Reed, as exposed by the Washington \nPost articles. Those stories detailed conditions which not one of us \nshould\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\nhave to endure, especially our injured troops who have sacrificed so \nmuch for this country.\n  The Washington Post uncovered rooms with mice infestation, moldy \nwalls, and holes in the ceilings. Their series also showed the \nadministration is failing to provide adequate medical care for our \ninjured troops who face inexcusably long waits for the most basic care. \nIf squalid living conditions and lack of adequate medical care are not \nbad enough, troops face a daunting maze of paperwork for the simplest \nthings.\n  One serviceman had to show his Purple Heart to even prove he had \nserved in Iraq. Others told us that when they returned from Iraq, their \nuniforms were caked in dirt and blood, and they were forced to spend \nendless hours trying to secure new, clean uniforms. A severe shortage \nof caseworkers means patients endlessly search for answers to routine \nquestions.\n  Mr. President, our service men and women are not the only ones facing \nbureaucratic nightmares. We also learned of problems their families \nface when they try to visit their loved ones at Walter Reed. From a \nlack of translators for families of Hispanic soldiers, to complicated \nand outdated forms for hotel reimbursement, relatives find themselves \nspending countless hours on paperwork--time which could be spent with \ntheir injured sons, daughters, husbands, wives, fathers or mothers.\n\n  Despite White House efforts, it was eventually revealed that members \nof this administration had known for years of the problems that plagued \nWalter Reed.\n  The President's response to Walter Reed has been slow and more media \nstrategy than substance. Unfortunately for our troops, the \nadministration has tried for weeks to paper over problems instead of \noffering us real solutions. Days after the first reports, \nadministration officials repeatedly attempted to play down the \nproblems. They painted walls and held press conferences and told \nAmerica that the problems were overblown. But the press and the \nAmerican public didn't buy it; they have been misled too many times by \nthis administration. Stories on the President's failure to care for our \ninjured troops continue to appear.\n  After 2 weeks of endless news on the horrible conditions at Walter \nReed, the administration decided fall guys were needed.\n  First to go was MG George W. Weightman, the head of the hospital. The \nsecond--a bit higher on the food chain--was Army Secretary Francis J. \nHarvey. Finally, yesterday, the administration fired Lieutenant General \nKiley, the Army Surgeon General and former head of Walter Reed.\n  On top of the fall guys, the administration has created numerous \ncommissions to review the care of our injured troops and veterans.\n  Mr. President, while firing people who were involved in failures and \ncreating panels to review problems are usually positive steps in the \nright direction, in my view, the administration's history, \nunfortunately, leads me to be fairly skeptical. For one, while Army \nSecretary Harvey, Lieutenant General Kiley, and Major General Weightman \nignored for years the problems at Walter Reed, the buck stops with the \nPresident. As the White House spokesperson said a few weeks ago, the \nadministration has been aware of this for some time.\n  Real accountability is not just finding fall guys; it is publicly \nowning up to failures and, even more important, changing course. \nMoreover, it is unlikely the panels are the solutions they seem to be. \nIn the past 7 years, we have seen many recommendations from many \ncommissions--including those from the 9/11 Commission and the Iraq \nStudy Group--simply be ignored by the White House.\n  What good are fall guys and commissions if they produce no real \nchange?\n  It is now undeniable that the administration has failed our troops \nand veterans. What is needed, and what these men and women deserve, are \nreal solutions that will meet the needs from the battlefield to the VA \nand everywhere in between. Our forces in battle deserve adequate body \nand humvee armor, communications gear, and equipment to jam IEDs. What \nthey don't need is another day in the field without those items.\n  Our injured heroes returning from Iraq deserve adequate mental care, \ntreatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain \ninjury, and they deserve less bureaucratic redtape. What they don't \nneed is another report of the administration's failure to care for them \nor a White House media strategy to cover those failures.\n  Our veterans of Iraq deserve benefit checks to be mailed on time so \nthey can provide for their families and are not forced into \nhomelessness. What they don't need is another day without the benefits \nthey deserve.\n  In the end, what all of our brave men and women need is an end to \nthis administration's excuses. Democrats know what our troops deserve. \nWe know they deserve a Congress that will not hide this \nadministration's mistakes and will, instead, provide solutions. Lastly, \nDemocrats took steps toward that goal.\n  The HEROES, Honoring and Ensuring Respect for Our Exceptional \nSoldiers, plan will ensure that our service members no longer fall \nthrough the cracks and fail to receive the treatment they deserve. It \ncalls for increased oversight and coordination between the various \ncommittees overseeing our troops and our veterans. This effort is \nespecially important because so many of us know the problems at Walter \nReed are not unique. Instead, I fear much of the health care system for \nour troops is broken because we failed to do our job. From poor \nfacilities to long waiting lines to overwhelming redtape, the system is \nfailing our troops.\n  We need a comprehensive look at this problem and we need \ncomprehensive solutions. Our troops and our families deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I was stunned over the weekend to see that some of \nthese brave men and women who have been injured in Iraq are now facing \nthe indignity of being sent back before being cleared for duty.\n  According to a Salon.com article from March 11, several dozen injured \nsoldiers at Fort Benning, GA, are being sent back to Iraq as part of \nthe President's escalation plan. Those soldiers, the article tells us, \nhave various medical problems that should prevent them from returning \nto battle. But the President is sending them anyway.\n  Let me quote directly from the article:\n\n       As the military scrambles to pour more soldiers into Iraq, \n     a unit of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Benning, \n     GA, is deploying troops with serious injuries and other \n     medical problems, including GIs who doctors have said are \n     medically unfit for battle. Some are too injured to wear \n     their body armor, according to medical records.\n       On February 15, Master Sgt. Jenkins and 74 other soldiers \n     with medical conditions from the 3rd Division's 3rd Brigade \n     were summoned to a meeting with the division surgeon and \n     brigade surgeon. These are the men responsible for handling \n     each soldier's ``physical profile,'' an Army document that \n     lists for commanders an injured soldier's physical \n     limitations because of medical problems--from being unable to \n     fire a weapon to the inability to move and dive in three-to-\n     five second increments to avoid enemy fire. Jenkins and other \n     soldiers claim that the division and brigade surgeons \n     summarily downgraded soldiers' profiles, without even a \n     medical exam, in order to deploy them to Iraq. It is a claim \n     division officials deny.\n\n  Mr. President, that report is very disconcerting. If it is true, it \nrepresents a new outrage and yet another example of how the \nadministration's failure to plan for the war is being taken out on our \nbrave women and men. MSG Ronald Jenkins, who is one of the soldiers who \ntold Salon he was ordered to Iraq even though he has a spine problem \nthat doctors say would be damaged by Army protective gear, said:\n\n       This is not right. This whole thing is about taking care of \n     soldiers. If you are fit to fight, you are fit to fight. If \n     you are not fit to fight, then you are not fit to fight.\n\n  I could not agree with Master Sergeant Jenkins more. This whole \nthing--the war, the buildup, the aftermath--must be about taking care \nof our soldiers.\n  Mr. President, far too frequently, taking care of our soldiers has \nbeen little more than an afterthought for this administration. \nUnfortunately, the list of failures we see goes on and on. Stories \nemerge every single day and, still, with this war, set to enter on \nMonday its fifth year, this administration has failed to make caring \nfor our troops a top priority.\n  There has been more than enough time to address problems facing our \ntroops. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the administration has \nfailed our Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\n  Mr. President, the administration and Republicans in Congress owe our \ntroops, their families, and our veterans a lot more.\n  I am not going to sit idly by and wait for them to act, and I am not \ngoing to wait for another commission. I am going to continue to be out \nhere on almost a daily basis to talk about it, to fight for our troops, \nfor our veterans, and their families. They deserve nothing less.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wanted to talk a little bit about the \nbill that we are on, the State homeland security formula and the \nsecurity bill. Certainly, I am hopeful that we will be able to complete \nthat soon. I hope that we can continue to move forward at a little \nfaster pace, perhaps, and do some of the things that need to be done. I \nunderstand the complication of many of these bills and the importance \nof them, but I think we do need to consider some of the things that are \nahead of us--immigration, for example, and health care, and some of \nthose kinds of issues that are before us.\n  This morning, I would like to spend a few minutes on one concern I \nhave in the pending bill which has to do with rural America. During \nlast week's debate, the Senate effectively voted a significant cut for \nrural States. Now, of course, I understand we have to consider the \nimpact of homeland security, but the idea that rural States are not \nimpacted I certainly don't think is completely true. Under the bill, my \nState stands to receive roughly $10 million out of $3 billion--$10 \nmillion in Wyoming. Some people think all we have is cows and sheep and \nmaybe an oil well or two, but the fact is that we do have a base of \nenergy. As a matter of fact, in some ways that may be one of the most \nsusceptible risks to security. So I do think there needs to be a little \nmore discussion in that respect.\n  For years now, the States of New York and California have used \nWyoming as a poster child for wasteful homeland security because \nWyoming receives a per capita amount. The per capita amount is \nrelatively high. Why? Because we have a very small population, half a \nmillion compared to 30 or 35 million. So the per capita formula is not \nan indication of the need for the State. It is easy for New York and \nCalifornia to play with the numbers and sort of mislead the audience by \nleaving ouy the actual amount of money that Wyoming generally receives. \nWe also rarely hear mentioned that their States, these large States, \nreceive hundreds of millions of dollars through the same program, the \nhomeland security grant program. But that is not even half the story. \nThese same large States conveniently fail to disclose the fact that \ntheir States also qualify for funding from the urban grant program, a \nprogram that excludes my State and other rural States.\n  So this is one of those times when you have to take a look at all the \nStates and realize this idea just of population does not work. As we \ncan see on the floor of the Senate, population is not the only \ncondition for having two Senators here, fortunately. In any event, from \nfiscal year 2003 through 2006, homeland security funding for California \nhas been $1.1 billion and New York received $932 million, compared to \nWyoming receiving approximately $20 million its first year. In 4 years \nthat figure has fallen to $10 million.\n  At any rate, as I am suggesting, there is a certain amount of \ninequity in terms of the funding formula in this bill. When we do \nreceive Federal assistance, that money goes a long way, of course. \nUnlike many of our urban counterparts, we make the best use of it and \nalways have, but that doesn't mean that rural areas are not at risk. In \nfact, as I said, in many ways you can say it might be easier to attack \nthe rural areas than some of the others.\n  Most people don't know that Wyoming is the largest net exporter of \nenergy in the United States. Our energy powers the Nation and is \ncritical to maintaining our strong national security. So rail lines and \ntransmission lines and refineries are very important not only to our \nState but to the Nation.\n  There is no question that the economy favors dense areas. We have \ndebated this, as a system, and I suppose we will continue to do that. \nAs a matter of fact, we had a vote where I think we lost by only one in \nterms of increasing the basic amount States would receive. Hopefully, \nwe can take another look at this as we go about working with the House.\n  I would like to also comment on a pending amendment which is \ninconsistent with the majority's will to prohibit nongermane \namendments. I don't recall the 9/11 Commission making this \nrecommendation, but we have an amendment pending that would reroute \nhazardous materials through our Nation's small towns instead of through \nbig cities. I don't in any way want to infer that it is the intention \nof this amendment to put small towns in harm's way. Unfortunately, the \namendment has been filed and, indeed, will put individuals in rural \nareas at more risk than those in urban areas.\n  There is no question that we need to secure the rails. Coming from a \nState where the economy relies to a large extent on railroads, I know \nall too well that security is critical to this infrastructure. It \ncertainly is important to us, and we are making significant progress in \nthat regard. The Federal Government and the railroads have agreements \ntargeted at reducing the risk of hazardous materials that are in high-\nthreat urban areas around the Nation, and these arguments didn't happen \novernight. I understand that, and that is proper. They are well thought \nout, with the input from security and industry professionals and all of \nthe experts in Congress. Mandatory rerouting would not eliminate the \nrisks. Instead, it shifts them from one population to another.\n  Forced rerouting could also foreclose routes that are top performers \nin terms of overall safety and security and result in increased risk in \nexposure and reduced safety and security. If we force these trains to \nreroute, imagine the cost of the goods that will be passed along to the \nconsumer. Railroads are required by the Federal Government to transport \nhazardous materials. They cannot pick up and abandon a line that is not \nprofitable.\n  Under this measure, railroads are going to have to build a new track \nand acquire a lot of land that bypasses major metropolitan areas. \nImagine the demand for the use of eminent domain, which is one of the \ndifficulties that we have, of course, and is necessary when you talk \nabout this kind of infrastructure.\n  Finally, I would like to respond a little bit to some of the \narguments that the other side has made with respect to keeping this \nbill clear of extraneous and nongermane amendments.\n  Last week, the minority leader requested that the Senate vote on a \npackage of security-related amendments. The majority declined and \ndecided to filibuster the package instead and block consideration. \nInstead of having these honest debates on amendments to improve the \nbill, the majority sent out a conflicting message. On the one hand, \nthey argued the amendment to strengthen the security of the country was \nnongermane and partisan. On the other hand, they argued that a union-\nbacked elective bargaining provision was relevant to our Nation's \nsecurity and wasn't partisan.\n\n  Mr. President, I am very troubled by the inconsistency, particularly \non this bill. I know many Members feel the same way. In fact, I would \nlike to reference the comments made on the floor of the Senate last \nweek by the Senator from Michigan, who came to the floor expressing \nfrustration with the lack of progress on the bill. The Senator was \nconcerned about amendments being offered by the Republicans that would \nstrengthen our national security but were not relevant to the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. It was stated, and I quote:\n\n       I find myself needing to express concern about the place in \n     which we find ourselves at this point--unable to move forward \n     with the final bill and the relevant 9/11 Commission \n     amendments that have been offered because\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\n     of an effort by the Senate Republican leader to offer a wide-\n     ranging number of unrelated amendments to the bill.\n\n  Unfortunately, this frustration was directed at the wrong side of the \naisle. Union collective bargaining is not an issue recommended by the \n9/11 Commission and should not be in this bill. It seems to me we are \nhearing mixed messages from the other side. It appears that they are \nwilling to include provisions backed by the unions but not willing to \ndebate and vote on tough security-related measures such as those \ncontained in the Cornyn amendment.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas would do so much more \nto strengthen our national security than the labor measure, but Members \non the other side have aggressively defended that amendment of last \nweek. Of these two measures, there can be no debate as to which \nprovision does more to protect our Nation. The other side of the aisle \nhas it wrong.\n  I generally agree with what the Senator from Michigan said last week, \nbut you cannot have it both ways when it comes to securing our Nation. \nIf we want to limit this bill to debating and implementing the 9/11 \nrecommendations, let's not compromise national security at the same \ntime by allowing collective bargaining of the TSA screeners. Setting \nthis policy would greatly hinder TSA's flexibility to respond to \nterrorism threats, flesh intelligence, and emergencies as they arise. \nTSA needs to have the ability to move the screeners around as schedules \nand threats change.\n  TSA was created to be a nimble agency. Let me give some examples of \nhow TSA has proven its ability to quickly respond.\n  During the August 2006 United Kingdom air bombing threat, TSA \nscreeners were briefed and deployed where they were needed to respond \nto the threat.\n  TSA has employed its flexibility to evacuate patients at the Texas VA \nHospital in the path of Hurricane Rita and helped with the evacuation \nof people in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina.\n  Last year, when Lebanon erupted into violence and fighting broke out, \nTSA was able to rapidly respond to expedite the evacuation of thousands \nof Americans in Lebanon and thousands of legitimate refugees.\n  TSA deployed 27 of its officers to Cyprus when fighting broke out. \nTSA was able to quickly respond, assisting airport authorities with \nverifying passenger identification documents and screening the large \nvolume of evacuees.\n  This labor-backed provision has nothing to do with enhancing our \nhomeland security, and the President has repeatedly said he will veto \nthe bill if collective bargaining is included. If we are going to be \nsincere in improving homeland security, that is one thing, but moving \nforward with collective bargaining for TSA is unexplainable. The 9/11 \nCommission made a lot of recommendations, most of which I support, but \na collective bargaining provision didn't even make the list.\n  I can only hope that when the bill passes and it goes to conference \nthat conferees will do the right thing and drop the provision. Failure \nto do so will only delay our effort to strengthen this Nation's \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remainder \nof the time be controlled by this side of the aisle, that I be \npermitted to speak for 8 minutes, that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nObama, be permitted to speak for 8 minutes, and then we will see how \nmuch time we have remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 9 months ago, 13 Senators cast their vote \nfor a 1-year deadline for redeployment of most U.S. troops from Iraq. \nOur country has been waiting impatiently for Washington to find the \nright way forward for Iraq and the right policy for our troops. It \nseemed then, when those 13 votes were cast, as it does now, that was \nthe only way to help Iraq and the Middle East to emerge from a \nnightmarish war that has delivered chaos where it sought order, fear \nwhere it promised freedom, and open-ended escalation where the \nPresident promised us mission accomplished. This is a war which has \ncost us dearly in just about every possible measure of American \ninterest and power.\n  Today, Democrats stand nearly united behind a strategy for success, a \nstrategy for success that includes a deadline needed to force the \nIraqis to stand up for Iraq. A lot has changed in the last 9 months, \nbut I am more convinced than ever that a combination of serious, \nsustained diplomacy, real diplomacy, leveraged by a 1-year deadline for \nthe redeployment of U.S. troops, is the best way to achieve our goal of \nstability in Iraq and security in the region.\n  I listened to administration spokespeople in the last few days as \nthey went on television blasting the Democratic proposal. It is \ninteresting how they continue their habit of just setting up a straw \nman, putting something out there that has nothing to do with the \nreality of the program, and then knocking it down. They are fond of \nsaying: a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq would be just terrible to \nour interests in the region. Let's make it clear. A 1-year date from \nnow, with discretion to the President to leave troops there to finish \nthe training, with discretion to the President to leave troops there to \nchase al-Qaida, with discretion to the President to leave troops there \nto protect American facilities and forces, with the ability to have an \nover-the-horizon presence--a 1-year deadline from today, which would be \nentering the 6th year of this war, is not a precipitous withdrawal of \nany kind whatsoever. In fact, there are many people in the country who \nthink that is not soon enough.\n  The fact is, this administration wants to sow fear in Americans, so \nthey choose to debate something that is not the proposal of those of us \nwho have put this proposal forward. What we propose to do is change the \nstrategy of our mission so we can achieve success.\n  What we have seen is that this open-endedness you just kind of say we \nneed to do this and we need to do that and we want the Iraqis to stand \nup and we want the police to do better and Prime Minister Maliki said \nhe is going to deliver--none of that delivers anything. The Iraqi \npoliticians know that as long as there is no deadline, they can take as \nlong as they want to work out whatever power struggles and differences \nthey have. So they are using the presence of American forces as cover \nfor their own goals, for their own desires, until we in the United \nStates say to them: Hey, folks, get serious. Our young people are \nprepared--obviously, because we have been doing it for 4 years--to put \ntheir lives on the line in order to help you have democracy, but you \nhave to grab that democracy, you have to make decisions, and you have \nto go in and police your neighborhoods.\n  The only way you are going to change that is by being responsible and \ndemanding something.\n  It provides the President the discretion to be able to complete the \ntraining. What else, after 5 years, would we want to be in Iraq for \nbesides finishing the training and standing up the Iraqi forces and \nchasing al-Qaida and fighting the legitimate war on terror?\n  This 1-year deadline is sound policy. It is based on the Iraq Study \nGroup's goal of redeploying U.S. combat forces from Iraq by the first \nquarter of 2008. It is consistent with the timeframe for transferring \ncontrol to the Iraqis that was set forth by General Casey and the \nschedule agreed upon by the Iraqi Government itself.\n  Even the President has said, under his new strategy, responsibility \nfor security would be transferred to Iraqis before the end of this \nyear. If the President is telling us that responsibility for security \ncan be transferred to the Iraqis by the end of this year, don't we have \na right to hold the President accountable for that goal? Don't we have \na right to hold the Iraqis accountable for that goal? If the goal is to \ntransfer security to them by the end of this\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\nyear, how can you resist the notion that you are going to leave troops \nthere to complete the training, chase al-Qaida, protect American \nforces, but bring the bulk of our combat forces home so they, indeed, \nwill be standing up for their own security?\n  The President has said it. The Iraq Study Group has said it. The \ngenerals have said it. Now it is time for the Senate to put it on \nrecord as part of our effort to support this objective. It is long \nsince time for the Iraqis to assume responsibility for their country. \nWe need this deadline to leverage the Iraqis into making the hard \ncompromises that are necessary.\n  I might add, no young soldier from the United States or Great Britain \nought to be dying so that Iraqi politicians can get more time to \nsquabble, more time to try to strike a better deal for themselves. We \nought to be working overtime in order to bring about a compromise that \nis ultimately the only solution to what is happening in Iraq today.\n  Even now, we keep hearing the Iraqis are close to a deal on sharing \noil revenues. But we still have not seen the final agreement ratified. \nWithout a real deadline to force a deal, there is no telling how long \nit will take. But we do know that as long as there is no deadline, the \nIraqis will believe they can take as long as they want.\n  We also know American soldiers and Iraqi civilians will continue to \ndie and be maimed while those politicians continue to use the presence \nof American forces as a cover for their other objectives. We saw that \nagain last weekend, when Iraq's neighbors and key players from the \ninternational community finally got together at a conference in \nBaghdad. The conference was a welcome development. We have been calling \nfor it for several years. It was long overdue. But nothing tangible \ncame out of it because, of course, no preparations and no diplomacy had \nbeen carried out leading up to it in order to get something substantive \nto come out of it. That is precisely why a deadline is so critical and \nessential, to force everyone to focus on the urgent need to reach a \npolitical solution.\n\n  The debate--this debate, a debate the Senate needs to have--offers a \nvery clear choice, a choice between a new way forward and the old way \nthat has taken us backward.\n  I might add, yesterday we saw a little more of that old way as the \nrhetoric escalated. The Vice President said yesterday, ``When Members \nspeak not of victory but of time limits, deadlines, and other arbitrary \nmeasures, they are telling the enemy simply to watch the clock and wait \nus out.''\n  First of all, there is nothing arbitrary about a date for next year. \nThe Iraq Study Group put it forward, the President said security \nresponsibility could be transferred by the end of this year, and the \ngenerals put it forward. But more importantly, the Vice President of \nthe United States must be the last person in America who believes the \nenemy is waiting or watching the clock. It is Iraqi politicians who are \nwatching the clock. They are the ones who are delaying and squabbling. \nThe enemy is busy doing what the enemy has been doing.\n  Moreover, the Vice President lumps things together in the word \n``enemy'' here in a very strange way. Yes, the enemy is al-Qaida, and \nwe are focused on al-Qaida. But the fact is that this war in Iraq is \nfundamentally a civil war now. It is a struggle between Sunni and Shia, \nand the last I knew, they are Iraqis and they are not our enemy. They \nare fighting amongst each other for the power and the future of Iraq.\n  With each day, this administration becomes more detached from the \nrealities.\n  I believe if you look at the figures, this is not a temporary surge. \nThis weekend, we learned that the President's escalation is going to \ninvolve nearly 5,000 more troops than the 21,500 that was initially \nannounced and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the total \ncould eventually reach 48,000 additional troops total. The original \ncost estimate was about $5.6 billion but the CBO tell us the final \namount could reach nearly five times that much. And it looks more and \nmore like the troop increase could last well into next year.\n  We also see that most people understand that when the Vice President \ntalks about undermining the troops, there is not one of us here who is \nnot outraged by what has happened to the troops with respect to the \nlack of adequate armor, the lack of adequate humvees, the lack of \nadequate support, numbers of personnel and planning, and, most \nimportantly, the treatment of those soldiers when they have come home--\na VA budget that is inadequate, a disability system that is \ndysfunctional, and obviously the treatment we saw recently at Walter \nReed.\n  The Vice President needs to focus on how you really support the \ntroops. The way you really support the troops is to get the policy in \nIraq right. We have a policy for success. They have had a 4-year policy \nof failure that has made Iran stronger, North Korea stronger, Hamas \nstronger, Hezbollah stronger, weakened our relations in the region, and \nhas certainly not served the interests of our national security.\n  It is time for the Senate to do what this administration has \nstubbornly refused to do to recognize that we should honor lives lost \nwith lives saved. That starts by putting aside the hollow rhetoric and \nstraw men that have undermined a real debate for far too long and \nsupport a strategy that preserves our core interests in Iraq, in the \nregion, and throughout the world. That is how we support the troops.\n  Mr. President, we can do better. This resolution we have submitted is \na way to do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise, first, to offer strong words of \nsupport for the statement that was just offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts. I also rise today to speak in support of \nthe Iraq resolution the Senate will consider tomorrow.\n  The news from Iraq is very bad. Last week, a suicide bomber stood \noutside a bookstore and killed 20 people. Other attacks killed 118 Shia \npilgrims. On Sunday, a car bomb went off in central Baghdad, and more \nthan 30 people died. The road from the airport into Baghdad is littered \nwith smoldering debris, craters from improvised explosive devices, and \nthe memories of our sons and daughters.\n  The civil war in Iraq rages on. The insurgents have started to change \ntheir tactics. They hide in buildings and along the streets and wait \nfor our helicopters. They have shot down at least 8 U.S. helicopters in \nthe last month. More of our soldiers are dying or coming home with \ntheir bodies broken and their nerves shattered to a VA system \ncompletely unprepared for what they need to rebuild their lives.\n  It is not enough for the President to tell us victory in this war is \nsimply a matter of American resolve. The American people have been \nextraordinarily resolved. They have seen their sons and daughters \nkilled or wounded in the streets of Fallujah. They have spent hundreds \nof billions of dollars on this effort--money they know could have been \ndevoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive \nstanding as a nation. The failure has not been a failure of resolve. \nThat is not what has led us into chaos. It has been a failure of \nstrategy, and it is time that the strategy change. There is no military \nsolution to the civil war that rages on in Iraq, and it is time for us \nto redeploy so that a political solution becomes possible.\n\n  The news from Iraq is very bad, and it has been that way for at least \n4 years. We all wish the land the President and the Vice President \nspeak of exists. We wish there were an Iraq where the insurgency was in \nits last throes, where the people work with security, where children \nplay outside, where a vibrant new democracy lights up the nighttime \nsky. We wish for those things, but there is no alternative reality to \nwhat we see and read about in the news, to what we have experienced \nthese long 4 years.\n  I repeat, there is no military solution to this war. At this point, \nno amount of soldiers can solve the grievances at the heart of someone \nelse's civil war. The Iraqi people--Shia, Sunni, and Kurd--must come to \nthe table and reach a political settlement themselves. If they want \npeace, they must do the hard work necessary to achieve it.\n  Our failed strategy in Iraq has strengthened Iran's strategic \nposition, reduced U.S. credibility and influence around the world, and \nplaced Israel and other nations in the region that are friendly to the \nUnited States in greater\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\nperil. These are not signs of a well-laid plan. It is time for a \nprofound change.\n  This is what we are trying to do here today. We are saying it is time \nto start making plans to redeploy our troops so they can focus on the \nwider struggle against terrorism, win the war in Afghanistan, \nstrengthen our position in the Middle East, and pressure the Iraqis to \nreach a political settlement. Even if this effort falls short, we will \ncontinue to try to accomplish what the American people asked for last \nNovember.\n  I am glad to see, though, that this new effort is gaining consensus. \nI commend Senator Reid for his efforts. He took the time to listen to \nso many of us from both Chambers of Congress to help develop this plan.\n  The decision in particular to again begin a phased redeployment, with \nthe goal of redeploying all our combat forces by March 30, 2008, is the \nright step. It is a measure the Iraq Study Group spoke of, an idea I \nborrowed from them, an idea that, in a bill I introduced, now has more \nthan 60 cosponsors from the House and Senate and from both sides of the \naisle. They have supported this plan since I announced a similar plan \nin January.\n  The decision to allow some U.S. forces to remain in Iraq with a clear \nmission to protect U.S. and coalition personnel, conduct \ncounterterrorism operations, and to train and equip Iraqi forces is a \nsmart decision. President al-Maliki spoke at a conference and warned \nthat the violence in Iraq could spread throughout the region if it goes \nunchecked. By maintaining a strong presence in Iraq and the Middle \nEast, as both my bill and the leadership bill does, we can ensure that \nthe chaos does not spread.\n  I should also add that the decision to begin this phased redeployment \nwithin 120 days is a practical one. Our military options have been \nexhausted. It is time to seek a political solution to this war, and \nwith this decision we send a clear signal to the parties involved that \nthey need to arrive at an accommodation.\n  While I strongly believe this war never should have been authorized, \nI believe we must be as careful in ending the war as we were careless \ngetting in. While I prefer my approach as reflected in my bill, I \nbelieve this resolution does begin to point U.S. policy and Iraq in the \nright direction. An end to the war and achieving a political solution \nto Iraq's civil war will not happen unless we demand it. Peace with \nstability does not just happen because we wish for it.\n  It comes when we never give in and never give up and never tire of \nworking toward a life on Earth worthy of our human dignity. The \ndecisions that have been made have led us to this crossroad, in a \nmoment of great peril.\n  We have a choice. We can continue down the road that has weakened our \ncredibility and damaged our strategic interests in the region or we can \nturn toward the future. The road will not be smooth. I have to say \nthere will be risks with any approach, but this approach is our last \nbest hope to end this war so we can begin to bring our troops home and \nbegin the hard work of securing our country and our world from the \nthreats we face.\n  The President has said he will continue down the road toward more \ntroops and more of the same failed policies. The President sought and \nwon authorization from Congress to wage this war from the start. But he \nis now dismissing and ignoring the will of the American people who are \ntired of years of watching the human and financial tolls mount.\n  The news from Iraq is very bad, but it can change if we in this \nChamber say ``enough.'' Let this day be the day we begin the painful \nand difficult work of moving from the crossroad. Let this day be the \nday we begin pulling toward the future with a responsible conclusion to \nthis painful chapter in our Nation's history. Let this be the day when \nwe finally send a message that is so clear and so emphatic that it \ncannot be ignored.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/13/senate-section/article/S3018-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3018-S3019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX GAP\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the subject today is the tax gap. The \ntax gap is the difference between what is paid voluntarily in taxes by \n85 percent of the American people and what is actually owed by people \nwho do not pay all of the taxes that are legally owed.\n  The tax gap does not include things that are in the underground \neconomy, nor does it include illegal earnings. The tax gap is certainly \nnot a new issue. We have discussed it on the floor of the Senate many \ntimes. It has been an issue for previous administrations as well as \nthis administration. In fact, I suspect the tax gap has been an issue \nfor as long as there has been taxes. However, I would say in recent \nyears the Finance Committee, on which I serve, has certainly brought a \nnew focus to the issue of the tax gap. This has been very much a \nbipartisan effort. I believe the level of attention given to the tax \ngap certainly reflects the energy and focus of the new chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Max Baucus from Montana. Chairman Baucus should be \ncommended for his work in this area.\n  I also want to praise the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad of North Dakota, for putting an additional spotlight on the tax \ngap topic. The Finance Committee has been doing the hard work in this \narea, encouraging greater research by the Internal Revenue Service, \nasking for detailed reports and recommendations from the Treasury \nDepartment as well as the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, \ninvestigating specific aspects of the tax gap, holding hearings to \nexplore the details of the tax gap.\n  Finally, the Finance Committee has been doing the most difficult work \nof all, actually passing significant legislation that would reduce the \nmoney that is not coming in because of the tax gap. This has not been \neasy. I find the tax gap is one of those issues here in Congress that \nis a little bit like the weather: Everyone talks about it but no one is \ndoing as much as should be done about it. But the way people talk \naround here, they view the tax gap as somehow a cure-all for all budget \nproblems. The tax gap can be used to pay for the alternative minimum \ntax problem; if we want to expand spending on health care, tap into the \ntax gap; if we want to balance the budget, tap into the tax gap.\n  Given the amount of faith people have put into it, the tax gap has \nsuddenly become one of those magic elixirs the peddlers used to sell in \nthe Old West. You know how they said it will cure all that ails you. \nThat was the slogan used by those slick salesmen 100 years ago. So the \ntax gap has become the elixir for all fiscal problems. I am surprised \nfolks do not think the tax gap would cure baldness, as an example. So \nlet's get behind the dreams and get to the real story of the tax gap.\n  I want to talk about three issues dealing with the tax gap. First, \nwhat is the estimate of the tax gap? Second, what are the elements of \nthe tax gap? Finally, what do we actually do in addition to all of \nthose things we have been doing to reduce the tax gap; in other words, \nto go after that final dollar we know is legally owed but not \ncollected.\n  First, how is it the tax gap is estimated, and what is it? The Senate \nFinance Committee's Subcommittee on Taxation and Internal Revenue \nService Oversight held a hearing 9 months ago, July 2006. It was \nchaired by the then-chairman of that subcommittee, Senator Kyl. We \nheard extensive testimony from senior IRS officials about how the tax \ngap is estimated. The tax gap has been based on reporting compliance \nefforts known as the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program.\n  As many colleague will recall, these efforts were viewed as too \nintrusive into the lives of the taxpayers. So the last taxpayer \ncompliance measurement program that was done was back in 1988. Senator \nBaucus and I recognized the need for the updated research and \nencouraged the Internal Revenue Service to look at research that could \nprovide useful data, useful information, without unduly burdening the \nhonest taxpayer.\n  The Internal Revenue Service then responded with a national research \nprogram. It is important to realize that the national research program \nonly dealt with a portion of the entire tax gap, primarily focusing on \nindividual income taxes and not dealing with corporate tax. There are \nstill significant portions of the tax gap that are then based on that \nvery old material going\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\nback to some studies 20 years ago, particularly in the area of \npassthrough entities.\n  I have a chart here that will make reference to some of these \nportions, significant portions of the tax gap. This is easily brought \nto focus on the Internal Revenue chart we have here. Remember, this is \nfor tax year 2001, the latest available information. You can see it is \nonly those items in bold that have been updated from the recent \nnational research program, primarily in the area of individual income \ntaxes and self-employment taxes; these areas right here.\n  It would be nice to have an update on all of this. But in order to \nget on top of it and get it done quickly, we asked the IRS to focus on \nthese areas. With the colors, you can see it is only the green--\nunderpayment of taxes--that we have high confidence in. The light blue \nhas been recently updated. We have some better sense of what the costs \nare.\n  Unfortunately, it is the yellow--the bigger parts of the chart--that \nis dependent upon the older numbers sometimes going back years and \nyears. That is the yellow portion I have already referred to.\n  In terms many can better understand, think of the yellow estimates as \nbeing the broad side of the barn in terms of accuracy. So there we have \nit. At the end of the day the tax gap, based on many old estimates, is \nthought to be $345 billion for tax year 2001. That reflects a \nnoncompliance rate of 16 percent. So basically, 84 percent of the tax \ndollars are coming in as required by law. We have a tax gap then of a \nremaining 16 percent.\n  Now I will turn to what are the elements of the tax gap. Again the \nchart from the Internal Revenue Service provides a useful blueprint. \nNonfiling is about $27 billion. These are the people who do not even \nfile their taxes. Then there is the underreporting of $285 billion. The \nInternal Revenue Service divides that into four categories: individual \ntaxes at $197 billion; employment taxes, $54 billion; corporate income \ntaxes at $30 billion; and estate tax and excise taxes of $4 billion.\n  Underpayment of taxes, which is the amount people admit they owe on \ntheir tax returns but do not pay on time, happens to be $33 billion.\n  Clearly individuals make up the biggest part, with individuals \nunderreporting nonbusiness income and business income, and overstating \nadjustments, deductions, and exemptions being the elements of the tax \ngap for individuals. A good deal of this is concentrated in the areas \nof self-employment and schedule C of the tax return.\n  Now that we have gone through how we measure the tax gap and what \nmakes up the tax gap, the most important thing people want to know is--\nthey do not want a definition of the problem--what can be done to close \nit? That is what my constituents ask me.\n  I believe the real question is one I would state this way: What steps \ncan be taken that are effective and will not unduly burden taxpayers? \nWe have to bear in mind most taxpayers do comply, and a significant \namount of noncompliance is unintentional. I think all Members recognize \nthat in the zeal to get at the tax gap, we cannot wreck the lives of \nthe honest taxpayers. Most of the taxpayers, 85 percent, are not a \nproblem. We cannot be like the fellow who tears down his house to get \nat the mouse. Members on the other side should be particularly \nsensitive to the mindset of not taking on the honest taxpayer when \ntrying to take care of the problem of the 15 percent, given this was \neffectively what was being promoted in 1994 with the wholesale reform \nof health care. Proponents in 1994 wanted to change the health care \nsystem for 85 percent of the people for whom the system worked to help \nthe 15 percent of the people who did not have health insurance. The \nvoters were right in telling political leaders at that time in 1994 \nthat this did not make any sense. First we need to recognize that the \nInternal Revenue Service is already, through enforcement, doing quite a \nbit to deal with the tax gap.\n  This chart reflects the Internal Revenue Service's testimony before \nthe Budget Committee and estimates the IRS activities will reduce the \ntax gap, the $345 billion total, by nearly $70 billion by the year \n2007. This reflects $17 billion in direct enforcement revenue and the \nrest in direct compliance effects. So we start with that as the base, \nthe work of the Internal Revenue Service, which is already reducing \napproximately 20 percent of the tax gap, with Commissioner Everson's \nstatements last year that the Internal Revenue Service could bring in \nsomewhere between $50 billion and $100 billion a year without \ndramatically changing the relationship between the IRS and \ntaxpayers; in other words, not being more egregious against the honest \ntaxpayer. Well, the IRS is already doing that, according to its \nCommissioner.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Under the previous order, the\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\ntime until 11:45 a.m. shall be for debate on Coburn amendments Nos. 294 \nand 325, and the time shall be equally divided between Senators Coburn \nand Lieberman or their designees.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of our time to \nSenator Brown of Ohio. He has a statement to make as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut and \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of the time on our \nside to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  We heard, a few minutes earlier, from Senator Grassley of Iowa, the \nranking Republican on the Finance Committee. He talked at some length \nabout the tax gap, which some suggest may be costing our Treasury \nroughly $300 billion this year, last year, and next year as well. These \nare moneys which are believed to be owed but not being collected by the \nIRS. When we talk about reducing our Nation's budget deficit--something \nwe all know we need to do--among the ways to do it is to close the tax \ngap.\n  Another way to do it is to address what are called improper payments. \nSenator Coburn and I lead a subcommittee in Governmental Affairs and \nHomeland Security called the Federal Financial Management Subcommittee. \nWe have been exploring the issue of improper payments. We have had for \na number of years an improper payments law that says Federal agencies \nhave to not continue making improper payments.\n  We found out about 2 years ago roughly $50 billion in improper \npayments were made by Federal agencies--mostly overpayments, some \nunderpayments. Unfortunately, that is just the tip of the iceberg. It \nturns out improper payments made for the last year have been down to \nabout $41 billion, but it does not include the Department of Defense, \nit does not include improper payments made by Homeland Security, and it \ndoes not include improper payments that crop up in some other parts of \nour Federal Government.\n  Senator Coburn and I have been holding hearings. Last year, it was \nunder his leadership as chairman. We held one under my leadership as \nchairman earlier this month on improper payments. We are going to \nfocus, early this year, particularly on some of the big agencies--\nHomeland Security, which still does not comply with the law; the \nDepartment of Defense, which still does not comply with the law--to \nprovide a strong impetus for them to begin complying with the law or at \nleast to get on the right track.\n  Senator Coburn has an amendment he has offered, one that is opposed \nby the National Governors Association and by a number of other groups. \nWhat he would attempt to do--and what I think his purpose is; his goal \nis meritorious--is to compel the Department of Homeland Security to \ncomply with the Improper Payments Act. He does so in a way that holds \nat risk State and local governments and their ability to receive \nhomeland security grants, really three out of I think the four major \ngrant programs that are handled by Homeland Security that we are \ndiscussing today with this bill.\n  The reason why the National Governors Association and I think other \nState and local governmental entities are opposing the amendment is \nbecause they could be held at risk of not receiving the grants for a \nlot of fire departments and other first responders and other State and \nlocal agencies, through no fault of their own but because the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is not complying with the Improper \nPayments Act.\n  Senator Coburn was prepared to offer a second-degree amendment, one I \nthink he and his staff worked on with OMB that I think was a far better \napproach to getting the attention of Homeland Security to comply with \nthe Improper Payments Act. He is not going to be able to offer the \nsecond-degree amendment. As a result, we have no choice but to debate \nand vote on his initial amendment, which we took up in committee. I \nasked him not to offer it in committee during the markup. He did not, \nand today his only choice is to offer that same amendment. \nUnfortunately, I cannot support it.\n  He is onto a good idea. The idea is we need to put not just Homeland \nSecurity but the Department of Defense--and a bunch of other Federal \nagencies that are not complying with this law--we need to put them \nunder the gun and say: You have to start complying--and to provide \npressure, incentives, sticks, carrots to get them in compliance with \nthe law.\n  I think we will be holding our second hearing later this month on \nfurther looking at the Improper Payments Act. We are going to be \nbringing before us the Department of Homeland Security to find out what \nis their problem, why are they unable to comply with the law. Do we \nneed to make changes in the law or do they just need to get on the \nball? It may be a combination of the two.\n  To that end, I look forward to working with my colleague, Senator \nCoburn. I must reluctantly oppose the amendment--not the amendment he \nwanted to offer. The amendment he wanted to offer, he is not going to \nhave a chance to offer. But the amendment he is offering, I have to \noppose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask the Presiding Officer to notify me \nwhen I have 5 minutes remaining of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is a curious thing that when we have \nhearings in the Senate, we find out problems and then offer real \nsolutions that have teeth--as Senator Carper just said, to put them \nunder the gun. Nobody wants to put them under the gun.\n  This amendment on improper payments gives the Department of Homeland \nSecurity 18 months to comply before any State will see any harm from \nthis. The fact is, the States are not without some responsibility \nbecause some of the improper payments go to some grants that go in the \nState.\n  The American people need to ask: Is the Congress really serious about \ncontrolling spending? They are not. This amendment is not going to \npass. All we are saying is: Here is a law they were supposed to be in \ncompliance with in 2004. It says: If you are not going to be in \ncompliance with it--they have not, they have not, they have not--we are \nsaying, to be accountable, you have to be transparent, you have to have \nresults. The results are complying with the Improper Payments Act.\n  We also think there ought to be competition for some of the grants. \nThere is not in this bill. There ought to be a priority set. There \nought to be responsiveness. There ought to be spending discipline.\n  As this amendment goes down--and it will--the Senators are going to \nreject the very idea of having accountability, the very thing they talk \nabout with earmarks. The reason they cannot give up earmarks is because \nthey cannot let the administration and the agencies manage the money.\n  But here is a tool to force Homeland Security to manage its money, to \nhold them accountable and say in 18 months from now, if you have not \ndone the work every other agency of this Government is supposed to have \ndone, then we are going to hold you accountable by cutting off the \nmoney. That is tough love. It is putting them under the gun. That is \nexactly what we need to do.\n  Do you know what will happen if my amendment is accepted and it comes \nthrough? Homeland Security will report its improper payments. But if we \ndo not, I want you to think about what happens when you reject this \namendment. What is the consequence for every other agency of the \nFederal Government to now not comply with the Improper Payments Act? \nThere is no cost in not complying with the Improper Payments Act.\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\n  According to the GAO, the following portions of Homeland Security do \nnot meet anywhere close the Improper Payments Act. That is the Customs \nand Border Protection, that is the Office of Grants and Training. They \nhave not done a thing to be in compliance with this money.\n  Now, we can look the other way and we can say we are not going to \nenforce the law, but the next thing I am going to do, as a Senator--if \nwe are not going to enforce the improper payments law, then let's get \nrid of it. The American people deserve to have the law enforced. It is \na good law. It helps us hold the agencies accountable, the very thing \nthat the $26 to $27 billion worth of earmarks says we cannot do.\n  Now we have an opportunity to do it, and we are going to vote against \nit. Why? Because we may put something at risk. Well, quality and \nresults depend on us putting this at risk, to force this agency, FEMA, \nto come into compliance with a law that is on the books with which they \nhave refused to comply.\n  Senator Carper mentioned the $40 billion of improper payments. That \nonly represents 40 percent of the Federal Government. There is at least \n$100 billion of our money--the taxpayers' money--which is being paid \nout which should not be paid out, and probably $20 billion of it is in \nthe Pentagon. We know the Department of Health and Human Services has \nnot complied with the Improper Payments Act on Medicaid, and that is \nestimated somewhere between $20 billion and $30 billion. So we know of \nat least $100 billion.\n  I want you to think for a minute when you vote against this amendment \nwhat you tell every other agency in the Federal Government: There is no \nconsequence whatsoever to not meeting the Improper Payments Act of \n2002. There will be no consequence even though we are going to say you \nhave not done it. Here is a way to do it, to force Homeland Security to \nbe accountable and to recognize they have an obligation under the law \nto report and look at the risk factors.\n  Now, what does the Improper Payments Act ask agencies to do? \nEverything we would want done with our own money:\n  Perform a risk assessment. Is there a risk for improper payments? \nHomeland Security hasn't even done that.\n  Develop a statistically valid estimate of improper payments. In other \nwords, go look at it and do a study to see is there potential that \nmoney is going out the door that should not go out the door.\n  Develop a corrective action plan.\n  Report the results of these activities to us, the Congress, the \npeople's representatives.\n  By voting against this amendment, you are telling Homeland Security \nthey don't have to comply, that there is no teeth; it will never be \ndone. Why would the Governors Association oppose this? Because they are \nthe monied interest groups that are going to get the money. In fact, \nsome of the problems with the money is the responsibility of the \nGovernors. If I were a Governor, I would not want you checking on my \nmoney. It is natural for them to oppose it. But it is normal for us to \nprotect the taxpayers by saying that every agency ought to apply and \nrespond to the law under improper payments. It is simple. We should ask \nthat Homeland Security follow the law.\n  When you vote against this amendment, what you are telling Homeland \nSecurity, the Defense Department, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, and all of the other departments is that they don't have to \ncomply because now we are going to be toothless and say there are no \nconsequences whatsoever.\n  Some will say this puts these grants at risk. There are no grants at \nrisk. There is $4.8 billion sitting in the queue right now that won't \nbe spent for 18 months. This bill authorizes another $3.2 billion to \nfollow after that.\n  If they cannot comply in 18 months, we need to stop and take a \ntimeout and ask: Why can't you tell us where you are spending money \nthat you should not be spending? Why can't you comply with the very \nsimple things this act asks? Why can't they do a risk assessment in 18 \nmonths, develop a statistically valid estimate of where the problems \nare? They cannot do that in 18 months, develop a corrective action \nplan? They cannot do that in 18 months? They cannot report to us in 18 \nmonths?\n  To oppose this amendment says we don't care about improper payments. \nIt is going to be like a lot of other laws on the books: we don't have \nstanding; I, as a Senator, don't have any standing to sue the Federal \nGovernment to make it comply. The reason we won't have standing is \nbecause we don't have the courage to do what is right for the American \ntaxpayers.\n  The last election had a lot to do with spending. This is going to be \na vote to say whether we really meant what we said when we said we were \ngoing to start taking better care of the American taxpayers' dollars; \nthat we were going to make the Government more accountable, more \ntransparent and efficient. We are going to see a vote against this \namendment, and the American people are going to get shortchanged once \nagain because we don't have the courage to go up against the monied \ninterests that get the grants and say we ought to at least have \ntransparency.\n  There is another tool coming back called the Transparency and \nAccountability Act of 2006, and the American taxpayers are going to \nknow whether improper payments are made. We are not going to do our \njob.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by my good friend from Oklahoma that would sunset the \nprovisions of this bill after 5 years.\n  In general, I think this is a very good bill. But I have serious \nreservations about the method by which this bill allocates State \nhomeland security grants.\n  Last week, I came to the floor to offer an amendment to make this \nfunding allocation more based on risk. My amendment was an attempt to \nmeet the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that ``[h]omeland security \nassistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and \nvulnerabilities [and] federal homeland security assistance should not \nremain a program for general revenue sharing.''\n  That is why my amendment sought to send the most dollars to those \nareas at the greatest risk of an attack. As compared to the funding \nformula in the underlying bill, my amendment would have better \nprotected our borders, our ports, our railroads, our subways, our \nchemical plants, our nuclear power plants, our food supply, and our \nfirefighters, police officers and EMTs.\n  Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated, as was a similar amendment \noffered by Senators Feinstein and Cornyn. I think this was an \nunfortunate mistake by the Senate, and I am hopeful that this mistake \nwill be corrected in conference.\n  If the funding formula is not fixed, however, I believe it is \nperfectly appropriate for us to reexamine this issue 5 years from now \nto ensure that the allocation of homeland security funding provides the \nnecessary resources to communities most at risk.\n  For this reason, I will support the amendment offered by my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, may I ask how much time we have on our \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 5 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield 2 minutes of that time to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very sympathetic to the frustration \nexpressed by the Senator from Oklahoma. Our committee, last year, had \nextensive hearings looking at waste, fraud, and abuse in the spending \nof funds in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. We documented over a billion \ndollars of waste or fraudulent spending. So the Senator has put his \nfinger on a very important problem.\n  I am very concerned about the practical impact of the Senator's \namendment. The Senator, at one point, had a second-degree amendment, \nwhich he has decided not to offer, which addressed part of my concern. \nThe Senator has said this morning that the Department would have 18 \nmonths to comply with the provisions of the Improper Payments Act. But, \nin fact, the\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\nplain language of his amendment says the Secretary shall not award any \ngrants or distribute any grant funds under any grant program under this \nact until the certification, risk assessment, and estimates that his \namendment calls for have been completed. The result of that, because \nour legislation includes some grant money for interoperability under \nthe Commerce Committee provisions in the bill, for this year, is that \nit halts those funding programs, those grant programs. The result is to \npenalize first responders, State and local governments, for the faults \nthat are largely from the Department of Homeland Security. I don't \nthink that is fair. That is why the National Governors Association and \nthe National Emergency Managers Association strongly oppose this \namendment.\n  In addition, the Department has expressed great concern about this \namendment. In fact, the Department's Office of General Counsel has \nwritten to me that they ``strongly oppose the amendment prohibiting the \nSecretary from awarding any grant, or distributing any grant funds, \nuntil the Secretary has submitted the certifications and other analyses \nin response to Senator Coburn's amendment.'' So it is not just the \nGovernors and the emergency managers. It is also the Department of \nHomeland Security that strongly opposes the Coburn amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak very briefly on what I \nbelieve is the first of two amendments offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma, amendment No. 294, the sunset of the entire text of the \nunderlying bill, S. 4.\n  This would sunset all of the provisions of this legislation in 5 \nyears. Obviously, the terrorism threat in the legislation that we have \npassed since 9/11, particularly in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 \nand the 9/11 legislation of 2004, will not go away in 5 years. Many \nparts of this bill amend existing underlying provisions that do not \nsunset. Thus, if we pass the Coburn amendment No. 294, we would be \namending provisions for homeland security grants, information sharing, \ninteroperability. Then in 5 years these homeland security programs \nwould revert back to earlier rules and realities, which we have found \nin this bill to be inadequate. I think that would be a disruptive and, \nin many ways, a bizarre result.\n  If this called for reauthorization, as other legislation does, not \nimmediate sunset, I would say it would be more reasonable to consider. \nBut that is why I oppose Coburn amendment No. 294.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. For the opposition?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Forty-six seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me address Senator Lieberman for a \nminute. The very thing he says he doesn't want to do now, we did \nexactly on the PATRIOT Act. Why would I want to sunset that? The \nAmerican people would like to see every piece of legislation that we do \nthat has to do with authorization and spending sunsetted. There are \ngood reasons for that. We don't know what the terrorism situation will \nbe in 5 years. We don't know all of the aspects of what we are dealing \nwith. What we know is that 4 years from now, if this is sunsetted, we \nwill be working on a new bill that is based on the realities of the \nworld at that time.\n  Instead, what the opposition to this sunset amendment says is what we \nare doing now we know, without a doubt, is exactly what we need to do \nin 5 years from now in every area. I would put it to you that none of \nus knows exactly what we need to do 5 years from now. A sunset won't \ncause this to lapse. It will cause the Congress to act in year 4 to \nreauthorize the bill when it expires.\n  I have 5 minutes left. Let me talk about this. We should get reports \non what we have done. We should report and react in a very commonsense \nway to what this bill has done over the next 4 or 5 years. We should \nreview that. We should then reform what we are doing now so that it has \nbetter application and wiser use of resources, and then we should \nreauthorize.\n  To oppose sunsetting this speaks of an arrogance that is unbelievable \nof this body. We cannot know what we need to do 5 years from now in \nterms of homeland security. We don't know. It is an ever-changing \nsituation. To imply that this will lapse--everybody here knows that is \nnot the fact. We are not about to let it lapse. We are going to do what \nis necessary for our country.\n\n  This amendment tells us that we ought to relook at it because we \ndon't have that kind of wisdom. If we think we do, we should not be \nhere because that means we are going to be making a lot of mistakes. So \nI will go back to that. Let me go back.\n  Why would Homeland Security oppose the Improper Payments Act, as read \nby Senator Collins? Because they have not complied. They have no \nintention of ever complying. The one thing that the 9/11 Commission \nsaid that this Congress has not done is to have one committee \nresponsible for oversight of Homeland Security. Senator Carper and I \nspent a lot of time last year, as did Senator Lieberman and Senator \nCollins in full committee, and we in our subcommittee, on Oversight of \nHomeland Security. We found a billion dollars wasted in Katrina. We \nfound tons of improper payments in Homeland Security. We found that, in \nfact, there is no accountability. There is no accountability in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The American public deserves to have the two amendments I have \noffered today. They deserve to force them to do what the law says on \nimproper payments, and they deserve for us to make a reevaluation 4 \nyears from now on what ought to be different. We ought to reassess what \nwe are doing and reevaluate how we do it, and we ought to say we need \nto apply more resources to that problem. The American people deserve to \nknow they are getting value for their money. Right now, they are not \ngetting that in homeland security and in multiple areas because we \ncannot even find out.\n  So here we are crying that we cannot have earmarks because the \nagencies are going to run what they want to run. We have an opportunity \nto not let them run, and we are going to run against it. It is \ncounterintuitive to me that we would be on both sides of this issue.\n  The fact is, the Federal Government is unaccountable in many ways, \nand the American people know that. On these two amendments, the \nAmerican people are going to ask: How did they vote? And they are going \nto say, once again: What are they thinking? They are protecting the \ninterests they have there now and putting at risk the interests of the \nnext generation--because we don't do something simple like sunset a \nbill or make an agency comply with improper payments.\n  What would happen if there was a 1-month delay in grants? Nothing. \nBut what would happen if we got the improper payment data from Homeland \nSecurity? Plenty. Then we could act on it and hold them accountable in \nthe appropriations bills. Then we can do our jobs and do something \nabout it.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, our friend is making some points I \nagree with, as does Senator Collins and most Members. Our problem is \nthat in each of the two amendments, the instrument he has chosen is \nvery blunt. I wish we had more time to work on these. If they don't \nsurvive the two votes today, I look forward to going back in committee \nto work on these generally.\n  Why do I say they are blunt? The National Governors Association \nexplained why they thought the improper payments would lead to the \ntermination of homeland security grant funding to the States. There are \nsome estimates by the administration that it would threaten Medicare \npayments. Doing something about this is good, but why have the ultimate \npunishment be on the beneficiaries?\n  The same is true of the sunset provision. Incidentally, the money \nauthorizations in this bill are sunsetted. It is different from the \nPATRIOT Act, where the provisions with the sunset were very \ncontroversial. In this bill, I don't think there is any controversy \nabout the underlying proposals.\n  I still respectfully oppose these two amendments, and I hope that if \nthey don't succeed, my colleague and I can work in the committee to \nbring forth a\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\nversion of both that we can both support.\n  Mr. COBURN. I inquire of the Chair how much time is remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 \nminute 17 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I hope the American people will look at \nthese commonsense amendments and look at how their Senators vote. The \none way to get things done is to put somebody in a bind. The fact is, \nthis is the law. It is already the law, and we are saying we are going \nto put some teeth behind the law and make you do it.\n  I raise one final point. If my colleagues vote against this, what \nthey are saying to every other agency is: There is no consequence to \nnot reporting and doing what you are supposed to do under the Improper \nPayments Act of 2002. That is the signal we will be sending.\n  The American people want the signal the other way. With $100 billion \nof their tax money paid out the door, that is improper, most of it \noverpayments, and we are saying we are letting one of the biggest \nagencies of the Federal Government off the hook.\n  If my colleagues want to vote for that, that is fine, but I hope we \nare held accountable for that vote in the next election cycle when we \nclaim we want the Government to be efficient, we claim we want it \nsmaller, we claim we want to get good value for the American taxpayer \nvalue.

Under the previous order, there will now be a \n2-minute debate equally divided on the Coburn amendment No. 325.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a real simple amendment. The \nimproper payments law was passed in 2002. By 2004, all Government \nagencies were supposed to come under it. The Homeland Security \nDepartment has never filed, under the six major agencies, an improper \npayments report.\n  People will say: Well, this will cut off funding. No. 1, it would not \ncut off any funding for 18 months. No. 2, if you vote against this, you \nare sending a signal to every other agency that they do not have to \ncomply with the improper payments law.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I intend to move to table this Coburn \namendment, and, obviously, I look forward to working with the Senator \nin our committee.\n  Basically, the funding on this bill is subjected to the improper \npayments law. As a letter from the National Governors Association makes \nclear, the Coburn amendment would effectively, and I quote, ``stop all \nState homeland security grant expenditures.''\n  That is unfair, unnecessary, and that is why I will move to table.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all remaining time on both sides, and I \nmove to table the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, on the pending \nlegislation, S. 4, the Senate has now used up all the time postcloture \nso that what stands--if I could put it in a more negative light than I \nshould--before the Senate and the vote on final passage of this \nimportant legislation is disposition of the remaining germane \namendments and any other matters that can be passed by consent.\n  We are working on a managers' amendment which would contain the \nmatters about which there is unanimous consent.

Mr. President, I have spoken to the manager of the bill, \nand I am--with his permission and their permission--going to speak. But \nas soon as they are ready to reclaim the floor, to close this down, I \nam prepared to stop at that point, or before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 383\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know there is not a lot of time, but the \namendment that is at the desk, No. 383, that I have--I ask it be called \nup and be considered.\n  This is all about rail safety. The Federal Government currently has \nno say on where 90-ton rail tankers, filled with chlorine or other \nhazardous chemicals, are shipped around the Nation. The Naval Research \nLaboratory, at my request, some months ago, issued a report. The \ncontext of my inquiry with them was: What would happen if one of these \n90-ton chlorine gas tanker cars exploded--for example, where a \nterrorist put C-2 underneath there in a populated area and blew it up?\n  What made me think of it was, you may remember almost 2 years ago \nnow, out in North Dakota, one of these tankers leaked, and the end \nresult was a number of adjoining towns, small towns, had to be \nevacuated because it was so deadly.\n  So I asked the question of the Naval Research Center. As you know, \nsome of our best scientists in the world are there. I asked: What would \nhappen? What would happen if a 90-ton tanker containing chlorine were \nto be blown up in a major metropolitan area?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report submitted to \nme be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Advanced simulation technology gives us a practical \n     breakthrough for analyzing and treating urban contaminant \n     accidents, pollutant incidents, and in combating Chemical, \n     Biological, and Radiological (CBR) terrorism. Today the \n     nation is striving to develop plans and corresponding \n     procedures to prepare for these contingencies. The ability to \n     construct accurate, easy-to-understand analyses of dangerous \n     contaminant release incidents is an absolutely crucial \n     component of civil defense planning and execution. When \n     decisions have to be made during an actual crisis, \n     essentially infinite speed is required of the predictions and \n     yet the analyses must be performed with high accuracy. When \n     responding to a CBR crisis, waiting even one minute to \n     perform simplified support computations can be far too long \n     for timely situation assessment. State-of-the-art, \n     engineering-quality three-dimensional predictions that one \n     might be more inclined to believe can take hours or days. The \n     answer to this dilemma is to do the most accurate \n     computations possible well ahead of time and then to capture \n     their salient results in a highly compressed database that \n     can be recalled, manipulated, and displayed instantly during \n     a crisis. Dispersion Nomograph TM technology was \n     invented at NRL to provide this capability.\n       This presentation is based on a portable software tool \n     called CT-Analyst TM that uses dispersion \n     nomographs to combine information from sensors and eyewitness \n     reports to find contaminant sources in an urban maze of \n     buildings, to track airborne contaminant plumes accurately \n     across the city, and to plan evacuation routes. In a crisis, \n     real time users don't have to wait for any of these results \n     because personnel defense plans and strategies can be adapted \n     to current situation assessments with no delay for computing. \n     This presentation uses CT-Analyst to show the evolution of a \n     large contaminant plume caused by the rupture of a railroad \n     tank car adjacent to the Blathersburg Mall.\n       Detailed, three-dimensional FAST3D-CT simulations (such as \n     shown at left) are compressed by more than a factor of 10,000 \n     to produce compact data structures called Dispersion \n     Nomographs TM. These ``nomographs'' allow CT-\n     Analyst TM to make accurate, instantaneous \n     predictions including the effects of buildings (as shown at \n     right). This example shows the situation twenty minutes after \n     a contaminant release occurred at the location marked by the \n     blue star with the wind from 295 degrees at 3 m/s. This CT-\n     Analyst display shows the instantaneous plume at 20 minutes \n     (light red) superimposed on the footprint of the likely \n     contamination region (light gray). The footprint can \n     eventually become contaminated beyond tolerable limits \n     sometime during the scenario. The plume region displayed \n     surrounds the instantaneous plume--with a safety buffer zone. \n     CT-Analyst is in use at a number of locations (see figure), \n     was extended for Operation Iraqi Freedom, and is being \n     modified as a CBR Emergency Assessment System for \n     installation in Navy bases over seas.\n       Also overlaid on the CT-Analyst display are the results of \n     the backtrack function (sensor readings and observations \n     determining a probable source location as shown in blue and \n     purple). CT-Analyst performs multi-sensor fusion operations \n     based on the very limited information about the contaminant \n     density. A number of sensors are active and operating in \n     automatic (triangles) and manual (circles) modes to register \n     the presence or absence of the agent plume at their location. \n     Red indicates a ``hot'' sensor (something considered \n     dangerous) and blue indicates a ``cold'' reading where the \n     contaminant agent density is below the threshold for \n     detection. Please note that the ``Escape'' function has also \n     been activated in this composite display, projecting optimal \n     evacuation routes. These recommended evacuation routes \n     suggest walking paths for rapid egress from the path of the \n     advancing plume and continue out to the edges of the \n     contamination footprint. This entire assessment takes about \n     50 milliseconds on a typical windows laptop computer.\n       The figure above shows the contaminant concentration just \n     three minutes after a railroad tank car accident has occurred \n     along the indicated section of track where the right-of-way \n     turns toward the east as shown by the yellow arrow. A large \n     quantity of contaminant has been released in a couple of \n     minutes. The time is late evening and the brisk breeze, from \n     the southeast in this scenario, blows the cloud up toward a \n     quarter of a million people celebrating Fourth of July on the \n     Mall near the Blatherburg Monument.\n       The large gray area is the contamination footprint \n     predicted by CT-Analyst TM; this area can become \n     highly contaminated in the first half an hour. It is a good \n     idea to get to outside the footprint and stay outside of it \n     until an ``all clear'' is given. The bands of color downwind \n     of the source, originating at the bright blue stars along the \n     track, indicate the contaminant concentration in the cloud \n     moving with the wind toward the upper left. The table tells \n     how to interpret the colors in easily understood terms. The \n     actual numbers, of course, can only be made specific and \n     quantitative when the absolute size of the source is known. \n     Each color marks approximately a factor of two range of \n     concentration values. People breathing yellow green and \n     ``hotter'' colors are in a very deadly situation. Not all \n     colors appear on each figure because the contaminant \n     concentration drops as the plume (cloud) spreads.\n       The diagonal purple lines in this and the following figures \n     mark general suggested evacuation routes. The gaps in these \n     lines show a kind of ``no man's land'' where the plume will \n     go first and in highest concentration. People should walk \n     briskly away from the center of the advancing plume along the \n     general direction of these evacuation paths skirting around \n     buildings and keeping to reasonable walking routes as \n     required. Don't run and don't get in or stay in a car.\n       These two figures show the advancing plume at five minutes \n     (left) and ten minutes (right) after the release occurred. \n     Three adjacent blue stars are used to mark the extended \n     region over which this release has occurred from a moving \n     railroad tank car. The yellow arrow indicates the direction \n     of motion along the track and the pink arrow is the \n     prevailing wind direction in each figure. The brisk breeze \n     here is a worst case because slower winds allow much easier \n     evacuation from the affected area and much faster winds \n     dissipate the cloud so quickly that fewer people at any one \n     spot receive critical dosages.\n       Almost everywhere in the plume after five minutes has \n     elapsed (colored region)\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\n      there is a high probability that the contamination will be \n     lethal and almost all of the plume is still lethal at ten \n     minutes. At ten minutes the lethal plume area is spreading at \n     about its maximum rate. If 100,000 people receive critical \n     (lethal) doses in the absence of any defensive action, they \n     are crossing this critical dose threshold at the rate of a \n     hundred people per second. Thus there is an enormous benefit \n     to immediate warning delay and speedy defensive response.\n       Based on a number of other simulations not shown here and a \n     consistent analytic theory, a warning issued within 3 minutes \n     is possible with an automated sensor network and near \n     complete situation assessment and response should be possible \n     within five minutes. Though many procedural and communication \n     problems remain to be solved, these times should be adopted \n     as goals because so many lives will depend on making these \n     response times as short as possible. Between five minutes and \n     the current goal of issuing a warning in 15 minutes, 60,000 \n     people or more could be critically dosed.\n       These two figures show the advancing plume in the previous \n     scenario at 15 minutes (left) and 30 minutes (right) after \n     the release has occurred. By 30 minutes the plume has spread \n     laterally about as much as it will but it is still quite \n     toxic and still expanding downwind off the edge of the \n     nomograph. At 30 minutes the plume extends three to four \n     miles downwind, is about 1.5 miles wide at its widest, and is \n     still dangerously toxic as indicated by the large yellow-\n     green region above right. If people are standing or sitting \n     as much as 15 feet apart in all directions at an event on the \n     Mall, there would be well over 100,000 people per square \n     mile. Furthermore, the contaminant plume in this scenario \n     will be dangerous over several square miles. Therefore, in \n     the absence of an early warning and concerted action (rapid \n     evacuation away from the centerline of the plume) over \n     100,000 people could be seriously harmed or even killed in \n     the first half an hour.\n       Although this is a dire scenario, the people several miles \n     downwind from the source, in this example a couple miles off \n     the upper left corner of the figures, have plenty of time to \n     walk out of the way of the plume given a warning in five \n     minutes or less. They would have to walk only about \\3/4\\ of \n     a mile at most to get completely out of the plume and would \n     have 20 to 25 minutes to do this. Walking is recommended in \n     urban areas since the roadways should be kept open for \n     emergency traffic and will gridlock instantly if everyone \n     tries to leave in their cars at the same time.\n       The message is clear, walking perpendicular to the wind \n     away from the centerline of the plume is the only effective \n     direction to walk, as indicated automatically by CT-Analyst. \n     There is a wide range of angles, plus or minus 30 degrees, \n     for which this strategy is effective but the effectiveness \n     declines the longer the delay in receiving a warning. For \n     large contaminant sources, simple theory and detailed \n     computer simulations both suggest that 85 to 95% of the \n     people who would otherwise be exposed can avoid exposure, \n     regardless of what the agent is, when the appropriate warning \n     is issued without delay.\n       What also becomes apparent is that solid information, as \n     well as prompt warning and action, reduces exposure. Knowing \n     the location of the contaminant source, the wind speed, and \n     its direction can save tens of thousands of lives. Combining \n     an integrated city sensor net with accurate models \n     incorporating the unique building/terrain features is the key \n     to defining the centerline of the plume based on source \n     location and thus determining effective escape routes. A CBR \n     Emergency Assessment System must be instantaneous and capable \n     of incorporating changing wind and sensor data as they become \n     available. Only centralized analysis and prompt communication \n     can define the safe routes away from an invisible cloud.\n       These CBR emergency assessment tools have been used to \n     evaluate and compare a number of possible CBR defense \n     strategies. The model on which this graph is based follows \n     hundreds of thousands of people who begin walking \n     (evacuating) in a specified direction relative to the wind \n     once a warning is issued. The computed contaminant density is \n     integrated to determine each persons dose. This ``warning \n     delay'' is varied to measure the reduced effectiveness of \n     evacuation as the warning delay gets too long. Zero (0) \n     degrees is walking downwind, 90 degrees is across the wind \n     (perpendicular) to the plume centerline, and 180 degrees is \n     walking upwind.\n       We have shown that plausible accidents or terrorist attacks \n     in an urban environment can put 100,000 people or more at \n     risk in a 15 to 30-minute time span. During this interval \n     several square miles of city can become lethally exposed and \n     people can die at the rate of 100 per second. Clearly there \n     is a very great premium or fast effective response.\n       The point is--we already have accurate, fast tools based on \n     tested scientific models for computing the detailed airflow \n     and converting these data sets directly to critical civil \n     defense information. An urban CBR Emergency Assessment System \n     (CBREAS) based on this new technology can instantly combine \n     information from eyewitness reports and CBR sensors to locate \n     hidden sources, can estimate regions about to become \n     contaminated, and can predict effective evacuation paths. \n     This new technology faithfully incorporates the 3D structure \n     of urban building mazes and has reasonable sun, wind, and \n     information-display options. The challenge is to harness \n     these tools effectively in the current political climate. If \n     police, fire department personnel, and emergency first \n     responders use this technology to obtain a minute-by-minute \n     situation assessment and implement an action plan, they can \n     reduce exposures, even of large crowds in the open, by 85 to \n     95% provided that an early warning is issued.\n       Sales Pitch: The CT-Analyst contaminant transport system is \n     ACCURATE. Plume envelopes are 80-90% as accurate as state-of-\n     the-art 3D computational fluid dynamics. CT-Analyst is VERY \n     FAST with performance 1000 to 10000 times faster than real \n     time. This can make the difference in saving tens of \n     thousands of lives in a real attack. It is also very EASY TO \n     USE. Two hours of training should be adequate. CT-Analyst can \n     also be used for war games, virtual reality training, site \n     defense planning and execution, and sensor network \n     optimization. The CT-Analyst software has stabilized and is \n     very rugged. The software also allows the user to displace \n     plumes by dragging the source across the screen, and can \n     ``backtrack'' to find hidden sources. CT-Analyst will also \n     project optimal evacuation routes.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me summarize the report.\n  The answer was ``over 100,000 people could be seriously harmed or \neven killed in the first half an hour.'' Let me say that again. One of \nthese tankers filled with chlorine gas--and there are hundreds, up and \ndown the road, going through major metropolitan areas, from Los Angeles \nto New York and everywhere in between--what would happen if a terrorist \nwere to explode one of those in a major metropolitan area? The answer \nwas: ``over 100,000 people could be seriously harmed or even killed in \nthe first half an hour.''\n  Said another way: What happens if one of these is blown up in a \nfreight yard in Philadelphia, PA, right along the Schuylkill River, 10 \nblocks, 15 blocks from City Hall, the University of Pennsylvania, \nDrexel University--a very populated area? Within one-half hour, 100,000 \npeople could be seriously harmed or even killed.\n  How long would it take to evacuate that area? Imagine evacuating \ndowntown New York City, Baltimore, Miami, Seattle--you name the city.\n  So what is the problem? Well, the problem is--and we have seen in \nrecent reports--insurgents in Iraq are using chlorine in their attacks \non civilians. There is little doubt terrorists who are targeting us \nhere at home are paying attention. In these roadside bombs, they are--\nthank God they have not gotten it down very well yet--but they are \ninjecting chlorine into that carnage they cause because they know the \nconsequence of the dissemination of the highly toxic substance in a \npopulated area.\n  Nevertheless, we continue to allow these 90-ton--that is a standard: \n90-ton--rail tanks containing chlorine and other hazardous chemicals to \nroll unprotected through the hearts of our largest cities in high-\nthreat areas. We know the rail industry has adamantly opposed any \nattempt to allow local officials, in conjunction with the Department of \nHomeland Security and security people, to reroute these tankers.\n  Now, again, look where this tanker is sitting, as shown in this \npicture. Do these buildings look familiar to you? This is an actual \nphotograph of a 90-ton chlorine gas tanker car sitting in the direct \nview--if you look over the top of it, you can see the Hart Building, \nyou can see the Dirksen Building, and you can see the U.S. Capitol.\n  By the way, I know my friend, the Presiding Officer, a former board \nmember of Amtrak, a guy who has fought very hard to protect Amtrak--we \ntake the train almost every day together back and forth to and from \nDelaware--I say to my colleagues, go on down to the station this \nafternoon and follow us down whenever we finish and get on the train. \nIf it is not an Acela, stand in the back car of an Amfleet train. You \ncan look out the back window. Watch as we pull out of the station. Tell \nme how many cops you see. Tell me how many cameras you see. Tell me how \nmuch protection exists there.\n  Look at this tanker car, shown in this picture, sitting right out \nthere--in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of everywhere.\n  So, folks, the idea we do not even have as an option the ability of \nour security people and the mayors and local\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\nofficials to suggest these tankers bypass their cities so, God forbid, \nif something happens, they are not as high a prize of a target--by the \nway, the less sensational damage able to be done, the less likelihood \nit will be picked as a target.\n  Because someone could legitimately argue: Biden, you are taking this \nout of the route--and we have other maps showing the routes of the \nvarious alternative routes that could be used to avoid the major \ncities. Now, they could say: You are going to be going through more \nrural areas. Yes, serious damage could be done in rural areas, but the \nprize for the terrorist is much lower. The likelihood of them \nconcluding that instead of coming down from, for example, Newark, NJ, \nall the way down into Augusta--you can, in fact, reroute these on \nNorfolk Southern, which goes through much less populated areas.\n  People legitimately say: Aren't you putting those folks at risk? No \nmatter where these cars are, we are at risk. But again, where is the \nlikely target? Where are terrorists going to risk their lives to be \nable to go in and do damage? They will do it where the most people are.\n  So I know the rail industry, as I said, is adamantly opposed to \namendment No. 306, and is likely opposed to the updated version we will \nvote on today. But in the face of such risks, I do not know how we can \nlet their opposition determine whether we go forward.\n  This amendment is very limited. It simply states the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, not the rail industry--the rail industry is not the \nbad guy--should determine the most secure routes for the shipments of \nthe most dangerous chemicals, and that ownership of the track is not to \nbe considered in making this risk-based determination; meaning, if you \nhave something going down on a CSX track that is owned by CSX, they \nshould be able to use and be diverted to a Norfolk Southern track. I \ncould give you examples all across the country, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows.\n  Again, all I am saying is, let the Department of Homeland Security \ndetermine whether the most dangerous chemicals are able to be diverted \naround the most populated areas in our country. And do not--do not--in \nfact, use as an impediment the idea the track upon which it is being \ncarried is not owned by the company whose car is on that track.\n  That is all we are doing, Mr. President. The amendment would apply to \nonly .36 percent--less than a third of a percent--of all the shipments \nthat occur on our rail system. It only applies to through-shipments; it \ndoes not apply to the destination city. Some of this stuff goes into \nlarge populations, where that is the end point. It doesn't say it \ncannot go there, but it does say we should reduce the probability of \ncatastrophic damage by allowing them to be rerouted, if that is the \njudgment of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  A similar amendment was passed by voice vote in the House Homeland \nSecurity Committee today. Not one Republican or Democrat spoke in \nopposition to this measure. This amendment will ensure that the Senate \nis on the right side of the issue as well.\n  Mr. President, I was asked by my colleague from Connecticut, one of \nthe two managers, that he be added as a cosponsor. I ask unanimous \nconsent his name be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand that a man with whom I hardly \ndisagree, Senator Inouye, has reservations. I hope he will reconsider \nthose reservations. Again, all we are doing is letting the Department \nof Homeland Security, in conjunction with local officials, make the \njudgment whether the risk is so high that it warrants it being \nrerouted. Of all the cargo on all of the tracks in America, we are \ntalking about .36 of 1 percent, all that is transported on rail. So we \nare not asking much. The downside of us being mistaken is significant.\n  I close by quoting from the rail industry's letter opposing this \namendment. They say:\n\n       Rerouting would not eliminate the risk, but instead shift \n     it from one population to another.\n\n  That is true, but this amendment says the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, not the rail industry, should determine how to weigh and \nrespond to this known potentially catastrophic risk. What did we just \ndebate last week on the floor? The allocation of resources for Homeland \nSecurity should be going toward the danger lines. There is nothing that \nis risk free--nothing. It is a little like my friend from Delaware and \nI have heard so much every time we come up with rail security \nlegislation. We are told we cannot secure every mile of track. That is \ntrue, we can't, but there is a big difference with a terrorist taking a \nsingle train off a track somewhere in rural America and a terrorist \ntaking a train at 140 miles an hour into the most visited area in \nWashington, DC, Union Station, at a high speed.\n  There is a difference between blowing up a tunnel underneath the \nChesapeake Bay or the Hudson River and blowing up a tunnel in the \nmiddle of some rural area. Terrorists pick targets for the greatest \neffect. So the idea that we would not reroute--if the Department of \nHomeland Security determined it made sense--a series of chlorine gas \ntankers from a major metropolitan area to a more rural area seems to me \nto be such a silly argument to make.\n  The idea is, how do we reduce the risk for the most people of the \nUnited States of America? Again, I will end where I began. When this \nwas called to my attention some years ago, I went to the Naval Research \nLaboratory and I asked them--and I have included this in my statement--\nto tell me what would happen--and, again, it doesn't take much for \nterrorists to figure out a way to puncture a hole in the bottom or the \nside of one of these tanks by use of explosives or other devices. The \nanswer was that if that were to occur in a highly populated area, \n``over 100,000 could be seriously harmed or even killed in the first \nhalf hour.''\n  Imagine how many people we get to evacuate reasonably so that there \nis essentially no one left in a half hour. If the gun goes off right \nnow, how long does it take downtown Manhattan or downtown Washington, \nDC, or Capitol Hill to evacuate people so they are not around? If you \ndon't evacuate--to say it another way--within a half hour, a whole lot \nmore than 100,000 people will be seriously injured or will die.\n  I know the Senator from Connecticut supports this amendment. I don't \nknow what the view of our colleague from Maine is. I hope they \nunderstand how limited this amendment is, how consequential it is. I \nhope my colleagues, when it comes time to vote, will vote in favor of \nthis amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the managers. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the senior \nSenator from Delaware is actually more under the jurisdiction of the \nCommerce Committee than the Homeland Security Committee. Nevertheless, \nin the absence of a member of the Commerce Committee on the Senate \nfloor, I want to express my concern about the amendment.\n  As I understand it, the effect of the amendment would be to require \nthat hazardous materials on rail cars be routed around high-threat \nareas, with some exceptions.\n  The problem is that the Commerce Committee title on rail security \nalready has a section that addresses hazardous materials by requiring a \nmitigation plan that can include rerouting but only when the homeland \nsecurity advisory system is at a high or severe level of threat or when \nspecific intelligence indicates that there is a specific or imminent \nthreat.\n  I think this amendment, while well-intentioned, creates all sorts of \npractical problems. The Chamber of Commerce, which is rating this as a \nkey vote, lists some of those that I want to read from a letter that we \nreceived from the Chamber today. The letter reads:\n\n       The Biden amendment, which would require mandatory \n     rerouting of shipments of hazardous materials around high \n     threat corridors, would not reduce risk to homeland security. \n     It would only reallocate risk among population centers. In \n     fact, the amendment would actually increase risk by either \n     eliminating routes that provide optimal overall safety and \n     security, or by adding hundreds of miles and additional \n     days to the journeys of shipments of hazardous materials \n     via less direct routes.\n\n  In other words, if we are causing this hazardous material to be on \nits journey far longer because it is not going by\n\n[[Page S3027]]\n\nthe more direct route, that could in fact increase the problems or the \nchances of the hazardous material being attacked. The letter goes on to \npoint out that the railroads have been working with the Federal \nGovernment, with chemical manufacturers, and with consumers to explore \nthe use of coordinated routing arrangements to reduce mileage and time \nin the transit of highly hazardous materials.\n  This amendment seems to be going in the opposite direction. Another \none of my colleagues has raised the issue of chlorine shipments to \nwastewater treatment plants. Those shipments need to be made. It raises \na lot of practical questions about how to move this material. Another \ncolleague raised the issue to me of whether this would result in more \ntrucks on our highways carrying hazardous materials.\n  So I think that while I agree with the overall intent of the \namendment, I am much more comfortable with the approach taken by the \nCommerce Committee--a committee which, unfortunately, I don't serve on, \nso I don't have the level of expertise that its members have in talking \nabout this issue. I do expect some members of the Commerce Committee to \ncome to the floor and debate this issue.\n  I do want my colleagues to know that the distinguished Senator's \namendment is controversial, that it may have unintended consequences. \nBased on my knowledge of the issue, I hope it will be defeated.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Maine. She may have misunderstood two aspects of the amendment. \nOne, it doesn't mandatorily require rerouting at all. It says the \nDepartment of Homeland Security can reroute, if they determine it \nshould be rerouted.\n  No. 2, the freight industry, where they made the judgment on how much \nfurther in distance it would travel if, in fact, you were to reroute, \nfactored in only that it had to be rerouted on their own tracks. So the \nidea being that they would not be able to--this happens all the time, \nwhere other tracks are used; for example, the Chesapeake using Norfolk \nSouthern track.\n  No. 3, the Chamber of Commerce is opposed because it costs more \nmoney. A lot of these things cost more money. Will it cost more money \nto be able to reroute up to one-third of 1 percent of the freight on \nrail? Yes. But I ask the rhetorical question: What will it cost if one \nof these tankers goes off in a populated area? What will the cost then \nbe to the very businesses that are most concerned about it?\n  Fourth, this doesn't affect destination. If the chlorine gas tanker \ncar is going to a water treatment facility, it still goes to that \nfacility. Nothing changes. What we could have changed is what we did in \nDelaware, not use chlorine. There are other means by which water can be \npurified. We have done it in our home State. That is what you should \ndo. But that doesn't stop this car, or any other car, from going to \nsuch a facility.\n  Let me emphasize again that there is no prohibition on end point \ndistribution. If the car is designed to go to a facility in the center \nof a city, it goes to the center of the city. There is nothing you can \ndo about that. That is very different than--I am making up these \nnumbers for illustration--you may have one of these tankers going in \nonce a month versus 50 going through the same city in a month or 100 in \na month. This is all about percentages. You play the percentages. \nAgain, it is true, rerouting may render cities in North Dakota--well, \nthey would not be rerouted in North Dakota, but I referenced the small \ntowns. There was a chlorine gas tanker car going across the top of the \nNation and, thank God, what happened was it went off in a rural part of \nthe world. You were able to evacuate the three cities and nobody died. \nHad that same thing occurred in the middle of Chicago, you would not be \nable to evacuate the city. We would not have had time.\n  So, yes, it is true. Are you going to put a different population at \nrisk? Yes, about one-tenth, one-twentieth, one one-hundredth or one \none-thousandth of the population, depending on where it is rerouted. So \nit is a little bit like saying: Why do we spend so much money worrying \nabout the Sears Tower? It is there, it is big, and it is a target. Is \nit possible that a terrorist would go into a building that is two \nstories and blow it up? Yes. Can they fly an aircraft into a rural town \ngrain elevator? Yes. But that is not what we are worried about. They \nare not likely to do that. They are likely to fly a plane, plant a \nbomb, do something devastating where the most people are.\n  So I find it to be a totally disingenuous argument. This is about the \nbottom line. I measure the bottom line--as I suspect all of us would if \nwe thought about it--in human life.\n  The bottom line, in terms of the dollars, the impact that would occur \nin a catastrophic circumstance is if there is a town of 1,000 people \nand a town of 6 million people, there is a phenomenal difference \nwhether that chlorine gas tanker car gets exploded.\n  Let me summarize. It is indicated by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity again that an explosion of a rail tanker carrying chlorine \nwould kill 17,500 individuals, require the hospitalization of another \n100,000--and only then if we evacuate within a half an hour. We can \nevacuate a city of 1,000 people in half an hour. We cannot evacuate a \ncity of 4 million people in half an hour. So it matters.\n  If this rail tanker goes off in New York City, my friend from New \nYork is going to be on the floor again pointing out the catastrophic \nimpact. If it goes off in rural Delaware, it will be a tragedy for me \nand my constituency, but there will be a significant magnitude of \ndifference.\n  So everything we do in terms of allocation of resources goes in this \nplace to deal with protecting the most people who can be protected: The \nshipment originates or the point of destination is in the high-threat \ncorridor; no practical alternative routes exist. If they don't exist, \nit doesn't get rerouted. Rerouting would not increase the likelihood of \nan attack. It would decrease the likelihood of an attack because people \nattack targets that have the maximum impact. This would not increase \nthe total number of cars on the track. It would allow the potential for \nhomeland security to reroute them away from the places that would do \nthe most damage.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I do expect additional Members on my side \nof the aisle to come and debate this issue.\n  I wish to clarify that the language, as I read it, in the Senator's \namendment, is not discretionary, it is mandatory. It does allow for \nsome certain significant exceptions for the Department to make findings \non, but it clearly says:\n\n       The regulations issued under this section shall--\n       (1) except as provided in--\n\n  The subsections part--\n\n     provide that any rail shipment containing high hazard \n     materials be rerouted around any high threat corridor.\n\n  So I don't see it as giving the Department great discretion if that \ndetermination is made because of the word ``shall,'' which is not \npermissive, it is mandatory. There are some exceptions later which the \nSenator has referred to, such as the origination point or point of \ndestination being within the high-threat corridor. But as I read the \namendment, it pretty clearly calls for rerouting.\n  I wanted to clarify that issue. Maybe I misunderstood the Senator \nfrom Delaware, but I thought he was saying it did not require \nrerouting.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, she is correct, \nbut it only requires the Secretary to do it if he or she concludes that \nthere is a safer way to reroute the shipment. If the conclusion made by \nthe Secretary is that in a high-risk corridor the rerouting would not \nresult in an increased safety margin for the shipment, then he or she \nneed not reroute it. But it is correct, the presumption is, in a high-\nrisk corridor we reroute if it is not a point of destination or origin \nbut only if the determination by the Secretary is that the shipment, in \nfact, would be safer to be rerouted. It is on page 4 of the amendment. \nIt is section 2, subparagraph E, ``Transportation and Storage of High \nHazard Materials through High Threat Corridor'' areas. It says:\n\n       In General.--The standards for the Secretary to grant \n     exceptions under section\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\n     (d)(4) shall require a finding by the Secretary that--\n       (A) the shipment originates or the point of destination is \n     in the high threat corridor;\n       (B) there is no practical alternative route;\n       (C) there is an unanticipated, temporary emergency that \n     threatens the lives of persons or property in the high threat \n     corridor;\n       (D) there would be no harm to persons or property beyond \n     the owners or operator of the railroad in the event of a \n     successful terrorist attack on shipment; or\n       (E) rerouting would increase the likelihood of a terrorist \n     attack on the shipment.\n\n  The bottom line is that it should be left to the discretion of the \nSecretary to decide not to reroute rather than the privately owned \nrailroad. I thank the Senator for her clarification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will speak briefly because I know the \nfloor leader for the minority side has people coming to speak to \nrespond to the amendment. I am not speaking on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                             U.S. Attorneys\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise because I heard Attorney General \nGonzales speak about the growing, disheartening, and alarming scandal \nwith the U.S. attorneys. I wish to say, first, that this is a serious \nissue. In every district in America, the U.S. attorney represents the \nenforcer of the Federal law without fear or favor. U.S. attorneys over \ndecades have built up a reputation of being not part of politics but, \nrather, enforcing the law, as they say, without fear or favor.\n  Over every Justice Department office in every corner of the land is \nthe eagle perched on a branch, with her claw holding a bunch of arrows. \nWhen you see that symbol, it denotes strength, but it denotes fairness \nand impartiality. That fairness, that impartiality has received a \nserious blow--maybe not a mortal blow because of the resilience of our \ncountry, but a serious blow--over what has happened in the Justice \nDepartment over the last several months.\n  What we have had in the past is misstatement after misstatement about \nwhat has happened. The story has kept changing, we can't get the truth, \nand that is why we had no choice but to undertake our own \ninvestigation.\n  Let me say that time and time again we have heard falsehoods. We were \ntold that all seven of the eight U.S. attorneys were fired for \nperformance reasons. It now turns out this was false, as their glowing \nperformance evaluations attest.\n  We were told by the Attorney General he would ``never, ever make a \nchange for political reasons.'' It now turns out all this was false, as \nthe evidence makes clear this approach was based purely on politics to \npunish prosecutors who were perceived to be too light on Democrats or \ntoo tough on Republicans.\n  We were told by the Attorney General this was ``an overblown \npersonnel matter.'' It now turns out, however, that far from being a \nlow-level personnel matter, this was a longstanding plan to exact \npolitical vendettas or make political payoffs.\n  We were told the White House was not involved in the plan to fire \nthese U.S. attorneys. It now turns out this was a complete falsehood. \nHarriet Miers was one of the masterminds of this plan, as demonstrated \nby numerous e-mails made public today. She communicated extensively \nwith Kyle Sampson about firing of U.S. attorneys. In fact, she \noriginally wanted to fire and replace the top prosecutors in all 93 \ndistricts in the country.\n  We were told that Karl Rove had no involvement in getting his protege \nappointed U.S. attorney in Arkansas. In fact, there is a letter from \nthe Department of Justice:\n\n       The Department is not aware of Karl Rove playing any role \n     in the decision to appoint Mr. Griffin.\n\n  Mr. Griffin was the attorney whom they appointed. It now turns out \nthis was a falsehood, as demonstrated by Mr. Sampson's e-mail:\n\n       Getting him--\n\n  Griffin--\n\n     was important to Harriet, Karl, et cetera.\n\n  We were told the change to the PATRIOT Act was an innocent attempt to \nfix a legal loophole, to help the war on terrorism, not a cynical \nstrategy to bypass the Senate's role in serving as a check and balance. \nIt now turns out this, too, was a falsehood--another one--as \ndemonstrated by an e-mail from Mr. Sampson:\n\n       I strongly recommend that as a matter of administration, we \n     utilize the new statutory provisions that authorize the AG to \n     make USA appointments.\n\n  Mr. Sampson specifically argued that by using these provisions, the \nadministration ``can give far less deference to home State Senators and \nthereby get (1) our preferred person appointed and (2) do it faster and \nmore efficiently at less political cost to the White House.''\n  So it has been misstatement after misstatement. To put it delicately, \nprevarication after prevarication, changes in stories, coverups in \nstories. And the only reason, frankly, we are getting to the truth is \nwe have the majority, and we have the ability to subpoena and have \nhearings and investigate.\n  A few minutes ago, Attorney General Gonzales spoke. I have to say I \nhave no animus toward Attorney General Gonzales. In fact, I like the \nman. He seems to me to be a genuinely nice man. He doesn't seem to me \nto be one of these hard popular warriors who populate the \nadministration in such large numbers and, frankly, we have seen in \nJustice Department appointees throughout the Justice Department in far \ntoo great a number. But simply being a nice person, being a ``nice \nguy'' is not enough, particularly when you are not performing your job.\n  The Attorney General got up and said:\n\n       I am ultimately responsible, but simply claiming \n     responsibility is not enough.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I was not involved in any memos or discussions of what was \n     going on.\n\n  That is his quote.\n  He said:\n\n       Many decisions are delegated.\n\n  Mr. President, did the Attorney General not know that eight U.S. \nattorneys were to be fired? If he didn't know, he shouldn't be Attorney \nGeneral, plain and simple. That is not a minor personnel decision. That \nis a major act that has now shaken the integrity of the U.S. Attorney's \nOffices--not only those in question but all of them--to the core.\n  To simply say decisions were delegated, that is a sorry excuse. And \nthen, of course, if the Attorney General knew, that one doesn't work \neither.\n  The Attorney General has said:\n\n       I will do the best I can to maintain the confidence of the \n     American people.\n\n  Mr. Attorney General, you have already lost that confidence. It has \nnot simply been on this issue, although this is the straw that has \nbroken the camel's back, and when you sat in a room with Senator Leahy \nand Senator Feinstein and Senator Specter and myself last Thursday and \nseemed to give this crisis, most considered crisis, the back of your \nhand and say it is not terribly important and don't worry, we will fix \nit without caring about it, my total confidence was shaken, and I \nbelieve the others in the room felt the same.\n  This was, as I said, the straw that broke the camel's back. It was \nhardly the only decision. On issue after issue, the Attorney General \nhas not stood up for the rule of law, which is his foremost duty. On \nissue after issue, whether it be wiretaps, whether it be national \nsecurity letters, whether it be the unitary theory of the Executive, \nallowing the Executive to do everything with no checks and balances, \nthis Secretary has been a rubberstamp for policies that the courts have \nfound repeatedly unconstitutional.\n  The Attorney General, unfortunately, in my judgment, misconceives his \nrole. The Attorney General misconceives his role because he still sees \nhimself as counsel to the President, his previous job, where he \nrubberstamped everything the President did. But when you are the \nPresident's counsel, your job is to serve the President, period. When \nyou become Attorney General, you have a higher\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\nduty. That duty is the rule of law--to preserve it, to protect it, to \ndefend it. For whatever reason, the Attorney General doesn't see that \nas his role. His time in office should be over.\n  The U.S. attorneys scandal and all the other instances where the \nAttorney General did not protect the rule of law are just too great a \nweight for the office to bear. To simply say ``I am responsible'' and \nnot tell people what it is all about makes no sense. We just saw \nScooter Libby be convicted. Many said he was a fall guy. We are not \ngoing to have another Scooter Libby, another fall guy. Kyle Sampson did \nmany wrong things, and it is very possible he broke the criminal law, \nbut, as Harry Truman said, the buck stops at the top. The buck stops \nwith the Attorney General. It defies belief that his chief of staff was \nmaking all these major decisions without his knowledge, particularly \nwhen it is clear that at least on a few instances he admits he had \nphone calls from the President and from others about this issue.\n  I want to say one other thing, because this issue is not going to go \naway. This issue is going to stay with us until we find out everything \nthat has happened, for the sake of punishing those who did wrong but \nalso, more importantly, to clear the air and restore the good name of \nthe U.S. attorneys who were fired incorrectly and of the U.S. \nattorneys--a more numerous group--who were not involved in this issue \nbut whose reputations have been called into question. Tomorrow, if \nsomeone is indicted by a U.S. attorney who had no involvement in this \nscandal and their defense attorney says politics was involved, the \npublic may believe it, given what we have seen happen thus far. So it \nis our obligation, it is our moral imperative to get to the bottom of \nthis, to clear the air, and to restore the reputation of U.S. \nAttorney's Offices now and into the future, and that is just what we \nwill do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 441, 357, 448, 337, 389, and 299, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, we are making progress in disposing \nof the final amendments pending as we head toward final passage of S. \n4. So at this time, I would like to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest that there are a number of pending amendments which I \nunderstand can be considered and agreed to without the necessity of a \nrollcall vote, and two of these amendments will have second-degree \namendments.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Senate to \nproceed en bloc to the consideration of the following amendments, that \nthey be agreed to en bloc, and that the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table:\n  First, the Kyl amendment, No. 357, with a Feingold second-degree \namendment, No. 441.\n  Second, a Schumer amendment, No. 337, with a modification that is at \nthe desk, and with an Ensign second-degree amendment, No. 448.\n  Third, a Bond amendment, No. 389, with a modification at the desk.\n  Fourth, and finally, a Stevens amendment, No. 299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A REPORT ON THE 9/11 \n                   COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO \n                   INTELLIGENCE REFORM AND CONGRESSIONAL \n                   INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States (referred to in this section as the ``9/11 \n     Commission'') conducted a lengthy review of the facts and \n     circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, including those relating to the intelligence \n     community, law enforcement agencies, and the role of \n     congressional oversight and resource allocation.\n       (2) In its final report, the 9/11 Commission found that--\n       (A) congressional oversight of the intelligence activities \n     of the United States is dysfunctional;\n       (B) under the rules of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives in effect at the time the report was \n     completed, the committees of Congress charged with oversight \n     of the intelligence activities lacked the power, influence, \n     and sustained capability to meet the daunting challenges \n     faced by the intelligence community of the United States;\n       (C) as long as such oversight is governed by such rules of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives, the people of \n     the United States will not get the security they want and \n     need;\n       (D) a strong, stable, and capable congressional committee \n     structure is needed to give the intelligence community of the \n     United States appropriate oversight, support, and leadership; \n     and\n       (E) the reforms recommended by the 9/11 Commission in its \n     final report will not succeed if congressional oversight of \n     the intelligence community in the United States is not \n     changed.\n       (3) The 9/11 Commission recommended structural changes to \n     Congress to improve the oversight of intelligence activities.\n       (4) Congress has enacted some of the recommendations made \n     by the 9/11 Commission and is considering implementing \n     additional recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n       (5) The Senate adopted Senate Resolution 445 in the 108th \n     Congress to address some of the intelligence oversight \n     recommendations of the 9/11 Commission by abolishing term \n     limits for the members of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, clarifying jurisdiction for intelligence-\n     related nominations, and streamlining procedures for the \n     referral of intelligence-related legislation, but other \n     aspects of the 9/11 Commission recommendations regarding \n     intelligence oversight have not been implemented.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate each, or jointly, should--\n       (1) undertake a review of the recommendations made in the \n     final report of the 9/11 Commission with respect to \n     intelligence reform and congressional intelligence oversight \n     reform;\n       (2) review and consider any other suggestions, options, or \n     recommendations for improving intelligence oversight; and\n       (3) not later than December 21, 2007, submit to the Senate \n     a report that includes the recommendations of the Committee, \n     if any, for carrying out such reforms.\n\n  The amendment (No. 299) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 448\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I speak today about my amendment to \ncreate the law enforcement assistance force. This amendment is a \ncommon-sense idea and I hope my colleagues would adopt this amendment.\n  My amendment proposes the creation of a law enforcement assistance \nforce which is a system for retired law enforcement personnel to apply \nto DHS, and complete the necessary paperwork and training, before a \ndisaster occurs. Then, when disaster happens, DHS would have a pool of \nqualified first responders who could be called into action. These \nvolunteers would be detailed to a Federal, State, or local law \nenforcement agency to work side by side with law enforcement located in \naffected communities. The amendment also provides that DHS would \nreimburse volunteers for their costs.\n  The need for properly trained first responders was never greater than \nit was immediately after Hurricane Katrina. In the wake of this \ndisaster, I toured the gulf region and saw the devastation firsthand. A \nsituation caused by natural disaster was made worse by the way Federal, \nState and local government responded. I say this not to criticize \nanyone but to propose a way to improve how America will respond in the \nfuture.\n  In the aftermath of any disaster, there is an acute need for trained \nrescue and recovery personnel. These needs are often met by volunteers \nwho, having seen their fellow Americans in need, travel across country \nto answer the call for help. In the aftermath of Katrina, there was no \nshortage of volunteers who answered this call. Their willingness to \nhelp is a testament to the American spirit. Unfortunately, these \nvolunteers were not used in a way that was equal to their spirit or the \nneeds of the people affected by this storm.\n  As the media reported, FEMA diverted many volunteer first responders \nto places outside of the disaster area. Some highly skilled emergency \nresponse volunteers were sent to Arkansas to prepare paperwork. Others \nwere\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\ndiverted to Atlanta to hand out fliers and still others were forced to \nattend ``sensitivity training'' seminars. Meanwhile, in the hardest hit \nareas of the gulf region, people suffered. Many needed basic medical \ncare and supplies. The resources of local first responders and \ngovernment officials were strained. The local responders needed \nreinforcements, especially when lawlessness broke out. Responding to a \ndisaster is always a difficult job. But like we advise at-risk \ncommunities to take steps to prepare for potential disasters, the \nFederal Government also has an obligation to prepare in advance as \nwell.\n  My amendment creates a process to enable FEMA and DHS to put \nqualified first responders in place in the immediate aftermath of \ndisaster. It will ensure a better Federal response by providing State \nand local communities with the reinforcements they need. I believe \nthere is a willingness on the part of retired law enforcement to \nvolunteer their experience and expertise in times of crisis. In fact, \nthe idea for this amendment was given to me by a friend of mine, Tom \nPage, who is a retired Las Vegas Metro Police officer. I thank him for \nthis suggestion and I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 389\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I would like to commend Senators Lieberman \nand Collins for all their hard work on S. 4 and I would especially like \nto thank them for their support of my amendment calling for further \ncongressional review and action with regard to the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission.\n  The 9/11 Commission identified many shortfalls, some in the \nintelligence community and some in congressional oversight.\n  We can never ease the pain and anguish of the 9/11 families resulting \nfrom the deaths of their loved ones. It is possible, however, to do \neverything within our power to ensure more American families are not \nsubjected to a similar nightmare.\n  We owe it to the 9/11 families as well as the American people to \nadopt reforms that will improve intelligence collection and \ndissemination, as well as will improve congressional oversight.\n  Putting our own house in order may not be popular, but it is the \nright thing to do.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member, as \nwell as the members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to continue to improve U.S. intelligence and congressional \noversight of U.S. intelligence.\n  In closing, I would also like to thank Ms. Holly Idelson of Senator \nLieberman's staff and Mr. Brandon Milhorn of Senator Collins's staff \nfor their assistance to me and my staff. Both of these young people \nwent out of their way to assist us, and I am grateful to them for their \ncourteous demeanor and their professional conduct.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today in support of Senate \namendment No. 389 offered by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond. \nIt is appropriate that this amendment be offered to the 9/11 bill as it \nis a first step in implementing one of the few outstanding \nrecommendations made by the 9/11 Commission--to reform congressional \noversight of the intelligence community. I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof this important amendment and thank Senator Bond for his leadership \non this issue.\n  The 9/11 Commission suggested that the rules of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate lack the power, influence and sustained \ncapability to effectuate oversight of the intelligence community. As \nsuch, they recommended that Congress establish one committee in each \nHouse of Congress with both authorizing and appropriation authority for \nthe intelligence community or create a joint committee based on the \nmodel of the old Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.\n  Just this year, the House of Representatives amended their rules to \ncreate a new panel on the Appropriations Committee with members of both \nthe Intelligence Committee and the Appropriations Committee. While the \nHouse provision does not meet the 9/11 Commission recommendation in \nfull, the Senate has not acted at all. As every Member of this body \nknows, reforming Congress, especially the Senate, can be difficult and \nwill face much resistance. However, the Senate should not be an \nexception to government reform after September 11, 2001. We should lead \nby example. We owe the American public and the families of those lost \non September 11, 2001 to continue to improve intelligence collection \nand coordination as well as to improve congressional oversight.\n  I know many have ideas on reform in the Senate, and we should explore \nthose. We need to find the most effective way to conduct vital, and \noften difficult, intelligence oversight. That is why this amendment is \nso important--it asks the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to each review \nthe 9/11 Commission's recommendation. Members of the Senate with \nexpertise in reform and intelligence will review the oversight process \nand develop recommendations on the most valuable reforms.\n  In conclusion, I hope all my colleagues will support this amendment \nand work with the committees in the Senate to improve the congressional \noversight process.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, we certainly know how complicated and \neven vexing the process of reforming the intelligence community is. On \nthe one hand, we now have in place a new structure, with an overarching \noffice of the Director of National Intelligence, that is responsible \nfor addressing many of the institutional and structural impediments \nthat led to our intelligence community's underperformance in the last \nyears of the 20th century, leaving us more vulnerable to the attacks of \nSeptember 11. The second and recently confirmed Director of the Office \nof National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, assumes leadership in a \nstructure that is up and running, if still on its shakedown cruise. In \nMike McConnell we have a leader that will take the DNI to the levels of \nauthority and accomplishment we in Congress who created the Office of \nthe DNI intended.\n  Throughout the IC we have seen many promising developments. Agencies \nare infused with resources and focus, and they are addressing our \npriority and hard targets like no other time during my 30 years in the \nSenate. Mike Hayden at CIA is providing leadership to an organization \nthat is truly beginning to reach out of its petrified structures and \nmindset of the past to bravely and creatively take on the intelligence \nchallenges of today and tomorrow. As a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, I make every effort to commend and encourage all of these \npositive developments, and I know I am joined by most of my colleagues.\n  That is the good news. The bad news is that intelligence reform has \nmany unfinished aspects. There are still deep cultural problems with \nthe way certain IC organizations, particularly the CIA, work. We still \nhave far to go and addressing the challenge of hard targets, like North \nKorea and Iran. All of these challenges will take time and leadership \nto address.\n  The 9/11 Commission's report on the intelligence failures leading to \nSeptember 11 also focused how Congress needed to change. The report \nstated:\n\n       Under the terms of existing rules and resolutions the House \n     and Senate intelligence committees lack the power, influence, \n     and sustained capability to meet this challenge.\n\n  The Commission recommended:\n\n       Either Congress should create a joint committee for \n     intelligence . . . or it should create House and Senate \n     committees with combined authorizing and appropriations \n     powers.\n\n  We began to improve congressional oversight with S. Res. 445, passed \nimmediately after the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act \nof 2004. We removed term limits, raised the stature of the committee to \nan A Committee, and returned to the use of designated staff. But this \nwas tinkering in comparison to the 9/11 Commission's recommendation.\n  I recognize this is a difficult question, for all of the reasons of \ncongressional resistance and established prerogatives. But I think that \nwe should not abandon addressing the very substantive question of the \ncurrent structure that greatly limits intelligence committee control \nover intelligence community appropriations.\n  Therefore, I am pleased that amendment No. 389 has been accepted to \nS. 4, and I commend the author of this amendment, the vice chairman of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Bond. I am pleased \nto\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\nnote that this amendment has the cosponsorship of the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Rockefeller. This amendment requests a joint review \nof this question be conducted by both the Intelligence and the Homeland \nSecurity Committees, and be presented by year's end. This is not a \nradical proposal, in and of itself, but keeps the Senate focused on an \nunresolved question, a question whose importance to the question of \ncongressional oversight of our intelligence community cannot be \nunderestimated.\n  Intelligence reform is an ongoing process. I happen to believe that, \nwhen our institutional will flags or is diverted, we should remind \nourselves of the costs of intelligence failure, and steel ourselves to \nthe fact that intelligence will play a larger role in our national \ndefense for the foreseeable future. And we should never abandon our \noversight of intelligence reform, our dedication to supporting the most \ndynamic intelligence community, and our responsibility to conducting \nthis oversight in the most effective manner possible.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank the Chair and my friend from \nMaine, and I notify our colleagues that we are working very hard to \neliminate the remaining objections on components of the managers' \namendment. We anticipate at least one more rollcall vote on one of the \npending amendments and then final passage, and hopefully that will \nhappen soon.\n  Pending that, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, while we are waiting here to line up a \nvote on this amendment and this bill, I will speak briefly relative to \nmy thoughts on how this bill is evolving. Like everyone, I was very \nimpressed with the work of the 9/11 Commission. I think they did a \nsuperb job of pointing out what were, unfortunately, very significant \nproblems which we have as a nation relative to our preparedness to \nfight terrorism. I had the good fortune to chair the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee for the last 2 years and \nspent a considerable time before that working on the accounts of the \nFBI. We worked hard, honestly, to try to address some of the issues \nwhich were raised by the 9/11 Commission and, as a practical matter, \nthe great majority of the issues raised by the 9/11 Commission have \nbeen addressed and are moving forward, hopefully, to a constructive \nresolution.\n  This bill, although it has the 9/11 Commission imprimatur on it as \nits name, is more of a clutter--a collection of various ideas, some of \nwhich the 9/11 Commission agrees with, some of which I suspect they \nnever even thought of discussing and, as a practical matter, the bill \nas a whole, in my humble opinion, in its present form would actually \nend up undermining rather than improving our safety as a nation. There \nare a number of reasons for that, but at the moment the most \nsignificant reason is the unionization language in this bill which \nessentially says the TSA will become a unionized organization.\n  When we originally set up the TSA, which was a matter of considerable \ndebate on this floor, that issue was at the essence, at the center, of \nthe discussion as to why and how we were going to set up the TSA. The \nbelief was at the time we set up the TSA and the commitment was at that \ntime that we would not create a unionized organization.\n  Why was that? It is not that unions do not do good work. Unions do \nextraordinary work. They have been one of the great forces in American \nculture for producing and mainstreaming many Americans, from the \nstandpoint of income and social activity, having a group to participate \nwith. They have been an extraordinarily positive force. But the belief \nwas--and it is an accurate belief arrived at after considerable thought \nand a great deal of debate--that unionizing TSA would be like \nunionizing the military, to give an example.\n  The TSA is the front line of our defense relative to protecting \nairplanes that fly in America today. We know air traffic is the No. 1 \nsource for attack from the al-Qaida interests. We know that they, in \ntheir handbooks and their training manuals, constantly come back to the \nuse of aircraft as a weapon, and unfortunately we saw them use it on 9/\n11.\n  Having a secure transportation industry, especially in the aircraft \narea, is absolutely critical to our protecting our Nation from acts of \nterrorism. That is why we put in place the TSA. They are the front line \nof securing our air transportation system in this country. They are \nlike a military force. Their purpose is to be moved around quickly to \nareas of weakness. Their purpose is to make sure they execute \nefficiently the review of people getting on aircraft to make sure those \npeople are appropriately screened.\n  You cannot have incompetence. You can't have inefficiency. You can't \nhave poorly trained people or people who do not sort of get with the \nprogram. You must have a very disciplined, focused group of individuals \nmanaging the security at our airports. That is the goal we were hoping \nto accomplish with the TSA.\n  It was fully understood, because I was involved in the debate, that \nwhen we set up the TSA it would not be unionized because union rules \ninherently create delay and they create stricture and straitjackets and \nmake it very difficult to manage different issues that have to be \nmanaged aggressively and with fluidity by the leadership of the TSA and \nthe TSA teams on the ground.\n  To create a unionized TSA will take away that flexibility, that \nefficiency. It will take away the ability to assure the people who are \ndoing the screening will be the best we can get and they are doing it \nin the most effective way that can be done. In my opinion, putting this \nlanguage in this bill, if it were to pass, would undermine security \ngenerally.\n  There are other issues with this bill which I can assure you, in my \nreading of the 9/11 Commission report, they did not think of in the \nterms this bill is structured: specifically, the formula for the \ndistribution of funds. I chaired the Appropriations subcommittee which \nhad responsibility for distributing funds relative to terrorist \nactivity in this country. We do have this pool of funds which is \ndistributed to all the States and all the regions in this country under \na formula. My opinion is if you want to effectively use that money, it \nshould be threat based. That should be the No. 1 priority and the No. 1 \ncriterion. Is the money going where the threat is highest?\n  We know there are certain targets in this country which are high-\nthreat areas: New York City, the subway system specifically, but a lot \nof parts of New York City; Los Angeles; Washington, DC. These are \nclearly high-priority targets when you are talking about terrorists. \nTerrorists have goals. One of their goals is to destroy our culture and \nkill as many Americans as they can, according to al-Qaida, but another \nis to make a statement internationally. That is why they picked the \nWorld Trade Center. That was a recognized international symbol.\n  I know there are places in New Hampshire that are probably \nsusceptible to terrorist attack. I am sure they are. But the fact is, \nit is unlikely, if you are ordering priorities, that most of them are \ngoing to be very high on a priority list for terror attack--certainly \none structured by an al-Qaida type organization. They may be from \ndomestic terrorism; that is different--domestic terrorism such as hit \nOklahoma City. But if there were a structured terrorist attack from an \nIslamic fundamentalist group, we can prioritize what is the terrorist \nthreat and what is not the terrorist threat.\n  The money should go to the threat. Now how does that affect New \nHampshire? It means New Hampshire would get less money. As the chairman \nof an Appropriations subcommittee, I had responsibility for this area \nup until this year, when I switched over to foreign affairs accounts. I \nstrongly promoted the program of putting the money where the threat \nwas, to the disadvantage of New Hampshire, because I felt that was the \nway it should be done.\n  Now this bill comes along and tries to reorder that in a way that \nessentially says every State, every community will get, for lack of a \nbetter word,\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\n``walking around money'' for purposes of buying security, to the \ndetriment of the high-threat areas. We only have so much money.\n  Once we have secured the high-threat areas and we are fairly \ncomfortable, then we can start distributing it maybe more broadly and \nwithout any accountability for threat. But initially the distribution \nshould be based on threat.\n  Yes, every State should get some, but it should not be under the \nformula that is in this bill. It should be a much lower absolute \ncommitment of dollars and a much higher commitment of dollars in the \nthreat area. This is what bothers me about this bill.\n  In addition, there is the ability of people to get access to \nclassified intelligence briefings and materials. This is playing with \nfire when we start significantly expanding access to this type of \nmaterial. Because it is this material falling into the wrong hands by \naccident, which it might be, or just oversight, because it is in so \nmany hands, because it is expanded by this bill and going into so many \nhands, that if it falls into the wrong places, people can trace the \nsource, and protecting these sources of where we get intelligence is \nabsolutely the most critical thing we have to do. If we have a good \nsource of intelligence on how people want to attack us, protecting that \nsource is absolutely essential.\n  Some of the intelligence material that will be released under this \nbill--with good intentions, but, unfortunately, the Congress tends to \nbe a sieve, and no matter how aggressively people try to protect that \ninformation, it seems to get out--could easily expand the number of \npeople available who have access to this information to a point where \nthe security of the administration will come into question.\n  So these are very serious issues relative to this bill. The most \nserious is the unionization of a nonunion, lean, effective organization \nwhich would protect our transportation system, especially air traffic; \nthe failure to put the money on the target which is threatened; and the \nissue of expanding the availability of very sensitive intelligence \ninformation in a way that might undermine the sources of that \ninformation.\n  Those are the reservations I have about this bill. That is why I will \nnot be able to support the bill when it comes up for final passage \nshould it be in its present form.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, we are coming to the moment when we \nadopt the managers' amendment and proceed to final passage. I want to \nrespond to some of the things said by my friend from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In response to my friend from New Hampshire, two \nthings: One is, S. 4 is a direct response not just to the original 9/11 \nCommission in 2004, which was the basis of the Intelligence Reform \nTerrorism Prevention Act of that year, but it is a response directly to \nthe appeal the 9/11 Commission issued in December of 2005 that there \nwas unfinished business.\n  That appeal was not only seconded but echoed and amplified by the \nvarious organizations representing families who lost loved ones on 9/11 \nin the terrorist attack of that day.\n  So this legislation before the Senate now, about to go to final \namendment consideration and adoption, includes improvements in \ninformation sharing--the critical question of connecting the dots \nbefore the terrorists can strike us so we can stop them from doing so. \nIt creates a new dedicated grant fund to support interoperable \ncommunications equipment--complicated words which simply mean whether \nin a crisis, a potential terrorist attack, or a natural disaster such \nas Katrina, our firefighters, our police officers, our emergency \nresponders can talk to each other as they were not able to do on \n9/11.\n  This is a balanced, progressive recommendation to solve once and for \nall by legislation the ongoing dispute about how to distribute homeland \nsecurity grant funding. We have improved the security requirements of \nthe so-called visa waiver program. We have strengthened the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Board and done much else. There is a lot constructive \nhere. One of the parts of this legislation that I believe still should \nbe the least controversial and, frankly, not the most important but an \nact of fairness consistent with our effort to improve homeland \nsecurity, was simply to give the transportation security officers at \nthe Transportation Security Agency, who now can join a union but cannot \ncollectively bargain, the same right to collectively bargain in very \nlimited areas without the right to strike, the same rights that most \nother employees at the Department of Homeland Security, including law \nenforcement personnel, have and continue to have, without impeding \ntheir carrying out of their law enforcement public safety functions. \nThat includes the Border Patrol, obviously at the Capitol that includes \nour Capitol Police, and throughout America it includes firefighters and \npolice officers.\n  It is unfortunate that is so much the focus of discussion about this \nbill because this bill is a direct response to the appeals of the 9/11 \nCommissioners and the 9/11 families to take constructive action to \nrespond to the statements that the Commission itself made in 2004 and \nagain in 2005: America is safer than it was on 9/11/01 but not yet safe \nenough.\n  This bill, which is not controversial and ought to receive \nnonpartisan support, will make the people of America, in an age of \nterrorism, safer yet than they have been before. It is why I strongly \nurge my colleagues across party lines to support final passage of the \nlegislation.\n  I hope soon to be able to propound a series of unanimous consent \nagreements. I am waiting for final clearance from my ranking member. As \nsoon as that happens I will rise to do so.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 448\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding its adoption, the Ensign \namendment No. 448 be considered a first-degree amendment, agreed to, \nand that it be inserted at the appropriate place in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n        Requested Resignations of Seven United States Attorneys\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the events in the Department of Justice over the course of the \npast 10 days, with respect to the request for the resignations of seven \nUnited States attorneys and the disclosures that the FBI was improperly \nusing national security letters.\n  With respect to the matter about the request for resignations of the \nUnited States attorneys, I believe it is important for the Judiciary \nCommittee to proceed with its inquiry to find out exactly what \nhappened. There is no doubt--I think it is undisputed--that the \nAttorney General has the authority to replace United States attorneys. \nThere is a serious question if they are replaced for improper motives.\n  We know when President Clinton was elected, one of his first acts in \nearly 1993, when he took office, was to replace all 93 of the United \nStates attorneys. I had the occasion recently to discuss this with the \nAttorney General of Pennsylvania, Tom Corbett, who was a U.S. attorney \nat that time for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In 1993, he had \nthe position in the United States attorneys organization to make those \ntelephone calls. That was handled in due course, and nobody challenged \nthe President's authority to replace United States attorneys.\n  Now, questions have arisen as to whether United States attorneys were \nreplaced improperly--for example, the question has been raised as to \nU.S. Attorney Lam in the Southern District of California, in San Diego, \nand whether she was replaced because of her conviction of former \nCongressman Duke Cunningham, now serving an 8-year sentence, and \nwhether she was about to investigate other people who were politically \npowerful.\n  Ms. Lam was questioned about that. I asked her whether she considered \nthe\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\nrequest for her resignation to be inappropriate. She said she was \nsurprised by it. I pressed her for her own conclusion. I think we may \nneed more by way of inquiry to examine what her performance ratings \nwere to see if there was a basis for her being asked to resign.\n  We had a situation with Mr. Cummins, who was a U.S. attorney in the \nEastern District of Arkansas. He received a telephone call, which he \nthen relayed to other dismissed United States attorneys, and he did it \nby e-mail very shortly after the telephone call. The question I had for \nMr. Cummins was, what was said? The e-mail did not contain the language \nof the caller from the Department of Justice. It had Mr. Cummins' \nsense, or feelings, that it was a warning. After little discussion, one \nlawyer to another, he said it may have been friendly advice. Well, that \nperhaps requires a little more analysis, if not a little more inquiry.\n  Then we have the situation with the U.S. attorney from New Mexico, \nwhere, according to the news reports--and we have to find this out from \nthe actual witnesses--there had been concerns expressed by people in \nNew Mexico as to whether he was doing his job properly. On those \nconcerns--at least according to the press--we have to find this out \nfrom the witnesses. Those calls, according to members of the press, or \naccording to what has been reported in the press, were relayed to White \nHouse officials, and they passed them on to the Department of Justice.\n  We have to look at that and ask ourselves the question of whether \nthere is impropriety in that. If the Department of Justice is to \nevaluate whether a United States attorney ought to be retained, is it \nrelevant as to what people think about him or her? The comments may \nrequire that we look at whether he was doing the job. Those are matters \nwe have yet to determine. So when we have declarations made on the \nSenate floor that are conclusory, condemning the Department of Justice \nfor what it has done, I say that is premature.\n  When the issue came up about the hearing that was a week ago today, \nin my capacity as ranking member of the committee, I was asked to waive \nthe 7-day rule, and I agreed to do so. I agreed to do so because I \nthought it was important to move ahead promptly. When Senator Leahy has \nraised the issue about other witnesses coming in, I think he is correct \non that. The issue was raised about bringing in former White House \nCounsel Harriet Miers, issues were raised about bringing in people from \nthe Department of Justice and other people in the office of the White \nHouse Counsel. I think that ought to be done. I do not think it is \nnecessary to subpoena them. We will see.\n  Before subpoenas ought to be issued, or before there even ought to be \nan issue raised about subpoenas, we ought to make a determination as to \nwhether people are willing to come in voluntarily. When you talk about \nsubpoenas, the first public reaction is: Why do they have to be \nsubpoenaed? Why don't they come in voluntarily? Do they have something \nto hide? The next inference or question is: Are they guilty of \nsomething that they have to be subpoenaed?\n  So let us proceed in the regular course of business. I was a district \nattorney for some 8 years and an assistant DA before that, and I have \nbeen on the Judiciary Committee for 27 years. The regular way to do \nbusiness is to ask people to come in. If they refuse, then you can talk \nabout subpoenas and you can get tough if it is necessary to do that.\n  I regret I could not be here when Senator Schumer was on the floor \nearlier today. He has made public statements about the Attorney General \npoliticizing the office. Well, that may be Senator Schumer's opinion, \nhis judgment. But let's get down to specific facts as to what is \ninvolved in the politicization. We are all working here in a political \nfield. I, frankly, have a concern to see Senator Pete Domenici on the \nWeb site of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. I have a little \nconcern about some of the statements that have been made by Members of \nthis body, rushing to judgment, before we have had these witnesses in.\n\n  There has been a request for witnesses from the administration, from \nthe White House. Well, why condemn the parties and condemn the \nDepartment until we have found out what the facts are? My view, as I \nexpressed last Thursday in the Judiciary Committee's executive session, \nhas been to tone down the rhetoric. We are now on the heels of the \nissue of the request for resignations of the United States attorneys.\n  We have the disclosures that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had \nmisused the national security letters. We gave them broader powers in \nthe PATRIOT Act. We broadened the powers from cases involving foreign \npowers to national security matters generally. We put in a provision as \nto exigent circumstances, which means an emergency. Until we find, at \nleast preliminarily, that the FBI used the exigent category more \nbroadly--in some situations, they were to get statements on probable \ncause for the judicial authorization. In giving the FBI these broader \npowers under the--Madam President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We gave the FBI these broader powers under the PATRIOT \nAct because of the importance of fighting terrorism, and that is a \nmajor problem of the United States today, an enormous problem \nworldwide. We are concerned that where the FBI exercises these greater \npowers there has to be an appropriate regard for civil liberties and \nfor constitutional rights. If it weren't for the fact we inserted in \nthe reauthorization the authority of the inspector general to make \nthese audits, we would not have found out what was going on.\n  So then in evaluating what the Department of Justice has done, I \nthink it is important to look thoroughly at the issues raised by the \ninspector general. It is a thick volume. We are going to need oversight \nhearings. Senator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, already \nannounced that. I think we may have to go further and consider changing \nthe authority of the FBI under the PATRIOT Act. If they do not use the \npowers within the confines the Congress has prescribed and the \nPresident authorized, then we may have to limit their power.\n  There are serious issues that confront the Department of Justice at \nthis time and the Judiciary Committee, in its oversight capacity and \ninvestigative capacity, has the full authority of power to find out \nwhat the facts are, and we will speak plainly. I will have no \nhesitation in making a factually based judgment if they have acted \nimproperly.\n  Let us see the background of the firing of these U.S. attorneys, and \nlet us see what the details are on the national security letters and \nwhat the Department of Justice does to correct the situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``The American National Red \n     Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Substantive changes to the Congressional Charter of The \n     American National Red Cross have not been made since 1947.\n       (2) In February 2006, the board of governors of The \n     American National Red Cross (the ``Board of Governors'') \n     commissioned an independent review and analysis of the Board \n     of Governors' role, composition, size, relationship with \n     management, governance relationship with chartered units of \n     The American National Red Cross, and whistleblower and audit \n     functions.\n       (3) In an October 2006 report of the Board of Governors, \n     entitled ``American Red Cross Governance for the 21st \n     Century'' (the ``Governance Report''), the Board of Governors \n     recommended changes to the Congressional Charter, bylaws, and \n     other governing documents of The American National Red Cross \n     to modernize and enhance the effectiveness of the Board of \n     Governors and governance structure of The American National \n     Red Cross.\n       (4) It is in the national interest to create a more \n     efficient governance structure of The American National Red \n     Cross and to enhance the Board of Governors' ability to \n     support the critical mission of The American National Red \n     Cross in the 21st century.\n       (5) It is in the national interest to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors as a governance and strategic \n     oversight board and for The American National Red Cross to \n     amend its bylaws, consistent with the recommendations \n     described in the Governance Report, to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors and to outline the areas of its \n     responsibility, including--\n       (A) reviewing and approving the mission statement for The \n     American National Red Cross;\n       (B) approving and overseeing the corporation's strategic \n     plan and maintaining strategic oversight of operational \n     matters;\n       (C) selecting, evaluating, and determining the level of \n     compensation of the corporation's chief executive officer;\n       (D) evaluating the performance and establishing the \n     compensation of the senior leadership team and providing for \n     management succession;\n       (E) overseeing the financial reporting and audit process, \n     internal controls, and legal compliance;\n       (F) holding management accountable for performance;\n       (G) providing oversight of the financial stability of the \n     corporation;\n       (H) ensuring the inclusiveness and diversity of the \n     corporation;\n       (I) providing oversight of the protection of the brand of \n     the corporation; and\n       (J) assisting with fundraising on behalf of the \n     corporation.\n       (6)(A) The selection of members of the Board of Governors \n     is a critical component of effective governance for The \n     American National Red Cross, and, as such, it is in the \n     national interest that The American National Red Cross amend \n     its bylaws to provide a method of selection consistent with \n     that described in the Governance Report.\n       (B) The new method of selection should replace the current \n     process by which--\n       (i) 30 chartered unit-elected members of the Board of \n     Governors are selected by a non-Board committee which \n     includes 2 members of the Board of Governors and other \n     individuals elected by the chartered units themselves;\n       (ii) 12 at-large members of the Board of Governors are \n     nominated by a Board committee and elected by the Board of \n     Governors; and\n       (iii) 8 members of the Board of Governors are appointed by \n     the President of the United States.\n       (C) The new method of selection described in the Governance \n     Report reflects the single category of members of the Board \n     of Governors that will result from the implementation of this \n     title:\n       (i) All Board members (except for the chairman of the Board \n     of Governors) would be nominated by a single committee of the \n     Board of Governors taking into account the criteria outlined \n     in the Governance Report to assure the expertise, skills, and \n     experience of a governing board.\n       (ii) The nominated members would be considered for approval \n     by the full Board of Governors and then submitted to The \n     American National Red Cross annual meeting of delegates for \n     election, in keeping with the standard corporate practice \n     whereby shareholders of a corporation elect members of a \n     board of directors at its annual meeting.\n       (7) The United States Supreme Court held The American \n     National Red Cross to be an instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it is in the national interest that the \n     Congressional Charter confirm that status and that any \n     changes to the Congressional Charter do not affect the rights \n     and obligations of The American National Red Cross to carry \n     out its purposes.\n       (8) Given the role of The American National Red Cross in \n     carrying out its services, programs, and activities, and \n     meeting its various obligations, the effectiveness of The \n     American National Red Cross will be promoted by the creation \n     of an organizational ombudsman who--\n       (A) will be a neutral or impartial dispute resolution \n     practitioner whose major function will be to provide \n     confidential and informal assistance to the many internal and \n     external stakeholders of The American National Red Cross;\n       (B) will report to the chief executive officer and the \n     audit committee of the Board of Governors; and\n       (C) will have access to anyone and any documents in The \n     American National Red Cross.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) charitable organizations are an indispensable part of \n     American society, but these organizations can only fulfill \n     their important roles by maintaining the trust of the \n     American public;\n       (2) trust is fostered by effective governance and \n     transparency, which are the principal goals of the \n     recommendations of the Board of Governors in the Governance \n     Report and this title;\n       (3) Federal and State action play an important role in \n     ensuring effective governance and transparency by setting \n     standards, rooting out violations, and informing the public; \n     and\n       (4) while The American National Red Cross is and will \n     remain a Federally chartered instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it has the rights and obligations consistent with \n     that status, The American National Red Cross nevertheless \n     should maintain appropriate communications with State \n     regulators of charitable organizations and should cooperate \n     with them as appropriate in specific matters as they arise \n     from time to time.\n\n     SEC. _03. ORGANIZATION.\n\n       Section 300101 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``a Federally chartered \n     instrumentality of the United States and'' before ``a body \n     corporate and politic''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by inserting at the end the \n     following new sentence: ``The corporation may conduct its \n     business and affairs, and otherwise hold itself out, as the \n     `American Red Cross' in any jurisdiction.''.\n\n     SEC. _04.

Madam President, I note that the underlying legislation \ncontains a sense of the Senate resolution that the Senate should \nimplement the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission to ``create a \nsingle, principal point of oversight and review for homeland \nsecurity.'' This provision was added during committee markup by the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. I would ask my \ncolleague, hasn't the Senate already implemented this recommendation?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Indeed, we have. Near the end of the 108th Congress we \npassed S. Res. 445, which created the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs as the principal point of oversight and review \nfor homeland security in the Senate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the Senator's recollection. S. Res. 445 \nestablished the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs. It also provided that the newly established committee would \nhave referral and oversight of all matters relating to the Department \nof Homeland Security, with certain exceptions. One of those exceptions \nwas with respect to functional oversight of customs revenue or \ncommercial functions performed by any personnel of the Department of \nHomeland Security. Does the Senator recall the basis for that \nexception?\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Indeed, I do. This is an issue that goes back to the \ncreation of the Department of Homeland Security and passage of the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002. The Finance Committee held a hearing in \nJuly 2002, followed by a letter to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. We stressed the importance of \npreserving the revenue collection and trade facilitation functions of \nthe U.S. Customs Service, even as that agency moved into the Department \nof Homeland Security with an added national security focus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the Senator's recollection of our efforts on \nthis issue. I would add that following that hearing and our letter, we \nworked closely with the Committee on Governmental Affairs to develop \ntext that would keep intact the commercial functions of the Customs \nService. Under the final legislation, authorities vested in the \nSecretary of the Treasury relating to customs revenue functions \nremained with the Secretary of the Treasury unless delegated to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. By order of the Secretary, dated May \n15, 2003, Treasury Order 100-16, the Secretary of the Treasury \ndelegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security general authority over \ncustoms revenue functions, subject to certain exceptions that preserved \nTreasury's oversight of the Customs Service with respect to policy \nmatters and the authority to issue regulations and determinations. That \ndelegation of authority remains in place to this day.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. And I believe we can both agree that our efforts \nwere successful in preserving the revenue functions, commercial \nfunctions, and commercial operations of the Customs Service within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, including oversight of those functions \nand commercial operations within the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I concur entirely. And those efforts served as the \ncontext for the retention of Finance Committee oversight of customs \nrevenue functions and commercial operations in S. Res. 445. The Finance \nCommittee has exercised oversight of those functions for almost 200 \nyears, and we as a nation continue to benefit from that accumulated \nexpertise.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is right. In fact, we can point to the enactment \nof the Security and Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006, \notherwise known as the SAFE Port Act, as an example of that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree. The SAFE Port Act demonstrated that the Finance \nCommittee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \ntogether with the Commerce Committee, could work together to enact \nstrong legislation to secure our borders and protect the trade-based \neconomic security of our country. That legislation is strong precisely \nbecause it was the product of the Finance Committee's focus on customs \nfunctions and commercial operations, coupled with the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee's focus on border security and the \nCommerce Committee's expertise relating to our Nation's seaports.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Indeed. The enactment of that legislation demonstrates \nthat the retention of Finance Committee jurisdiction over customs \nrevenue functions and commercial operations does not in any way \ndiminish the effective oversight of other functions within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security by the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs, nor does it detract from the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee as the principal point of \noversight and review for homeland security matters in the U.S. Senate. \nIn fact, by drawing on the focus and expertise of both committees, we \nimprove overall Senate oversight of the homeland security interests and \neconomic security interests of the United States.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree entirely. Consequently, I must note for the \nrecord that I don't see any need to include the sense of the Senate \nresolution that has been added to the underlying legislation by the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with my colleague and note the same. However, \nsince it is merely a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and is not binding \nin any way, I think it is sufficient to note our objections for the \nrecord at this time. The provision is not worth objecting to any more \nthan that. We have already established a principal point of oversight \nand review for homeland security in the U.S. Senate. The current \nbalance reflected in S. Res. 445 has been proven to work and need not \nbe disturbed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree.\n\n\n                   cargo security on passenger planes\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased that in this new Congress, \nwe are able to take up and pass a bill that implements the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. Even though aviation security has improved \ngreatly in the last 5 years, there are still holes in the system--as we \ndiscovered last summer with the aviation terrorist plot uncovered by \nthe British authorities. Therefore, implementing these recommendations \nis crucial.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with the Senator from California that \nimplementing these recommendations is crucial to continuing to increase \naviation security, to prevent our Nation from experiencing a tragedy \nlike 9/11 again.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, one hole in aviation security is the \ncargo that is carried on passenger planes. The bill does strengthen \nsecurity for cargo on passenger planes. First, the bill requires \nscreening of all of the cargo going on passenger aircraft. Second, the \nbill requires the Transportation Security Administration to implement a \nprogram--either random or risked-based--to place blast-resistant \ncontainers on passenger planes. However, the program does not implement \nthe 9/11 Commission recommendation to require one blast-resistant cargo \ncontainer on every plane.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended, ``TSA should require that every \npassenger aircraft carrying cargo deploy at least one hardened \ncontainer to carry any suspect cargo.'' Therefore, all passenger planes \nshould have at least one blast-resistant container for cargo.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I expect that TSA would examine this recommendation when \ndeveloping a plan to deploy blast-resistant cargo containers on \nairplanes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his support. We owe this to the \nAmerican people. We cannot allow terrorists to exploit holes in our \naviation security system.\n\n\n                               oversight\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam Pesident, the expertise exhibited under the \nCommerce Committee's jurisdiction is reflected in the substitute \namendment to S. 4, before us today, which incorporates three Commerce \nCommittee reported bills: S. 184, the Surface Transportation and Rail \nSecurity Act of 2007; S. 509, the Aviation Security Improvement Act; \nand S. 385, the Interoperable Emergency Communications Act. Prior to \nthe reorgnization of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committees, HSGAC, and thereafter, the Commerce Committee's \njurisdiction under the Senate rules over all aspects of transportation \nsafety and security issues encompassing maritime, Coast Guard, \naviation, rail, pipeline, and trucking, and telecommunications matters, \nremain untouched.\n  Some unfairly claim that problems we are having improving our \nnational security result from an outdated committee system. I \nrespectfully disagree. This claim is simply a sound bite that ignores \nthe truth and short changes the potential for real solutions. The real \nproblem is the result of creating a new department from scratch by \nmerging 22 Federal agencies with varying missions, without any true \nrealignment for non-security related missions, into one mammoth Federal \ndepartment and then refusing to fully fund the necessary initiatives.\n  I am surprised that a few of my colleagues would suggest that through \noversight through several committees of the Department, its Agencies, \nand the $34.8 billion in programs weakens DHS. To the contrary, using \nthe several committees, each with its own significant expertise, \nactually improves the quality and scope of congressional oversight, and \ntherefore, the effectiveness and accountability of the Department \nitself. It is the failure to conduct agency oversight that causes the \nmost harm, as we have seen at DHS over the past few years. Well \ncoordinated and responsible engagement with DHS by\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\ncommittees will only further the Senate's oversight responsibilities \nfor and the public's understanding of the critical work now being done \nby the Department and of the numerous challenges that remain.\n  S. Res. 445 embraced that approach, and S. 4 which will pass the \nSenate today demonstrates the success of that approach. In fact, the \nSAFE Ports Act, Public Law 109-347, and S. 4 are a reflection of the \npositive progress Congress can make when committees work together in \nour respective fields of expertise to conduct oversight and craft \nlegislation to address identified vulnerabilities.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur with my chairman, Senator Inouye. The Commerce \nCommittee has worked for over a decade to improve transportation \nsecurity and has had to deal with the inertia of the Federal Government \nas well as fight entrenched interests to change the way we secure our \ntransportation system. As far back as 1996 we began discussing the \nsecurity advantages of transferring security functions from the airline \nindustry to the Federal Government. Similarly, we initiated action on \nthe Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 prior to 9/11 in order \nto address a broad range of criminal activity at our ports. The attacks \nof 9/11 created sufficient public pressure for Congress to \nfundamentally change the way the Federal Government secures our \naviation system and ports.\n\n  In particular, Aviation and Transportation Security Act, ATSA, Public \nLaw 107-71, established the Transportation Security Administration, \nTSA, within the Department of Transportation to be ``responsible for \nsecurity in all modes of transportation, including: carrying out \nchapter 449, relating to civil aviation security, and related research \nand development activities; and security responsibilities over other \nmodes of transportation that are exercised by the Department of \nTransportation.''\n  The creation of the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, and the \nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, HSGAC, did \nnot alter TSA's authority or the Commerce Committee's subject matter \njurisdiction. The Senate engaged in a healthy debate on the floor and \nmade clear that the authority being transferred to the HSGAC under S. \nRes. 445 did not affect the Commerce Committee's jurisdictional \nauthority over transportation security programs, the Coast Guard and \ncommunications matters conducted through the Federal Communications \nCommission, FCC, and the Department of Commerce. In large part, the \ndebate focused on the difficulty of separating transportation safety \nissues from transportation security issues. It is difficult, if not \nimpossible, to separate safety and security issues from general \ntransportation policy. To consider security without understanding the \nimpacts of the safety and market position of a mode of transportation \ncould lead to unrealistic, contradictory, and counterproductive \npolicies. Those tasked with the responsibilities of securing our \ntransportation system need to understand the complexity of the systems \noperations from safety standards to market place realities. The two \ncannot be separated and the Senate vote effectively affirmed those \narguments.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree. Without such context, security decisions will be \nmade in a vacuum that, at best, might produce misguided or extraneous \nefforts, and, at worst, could cripple the transportation modes that \nensure the free flow of commerce and travel that our Nation has been \nbuilt upon. The Commerce Committee has passed three of the most \nsignificant transportation security bills considered since 9/11 and has \nbeen successful because of its understanding of the industry and past \nwork on safety and security issues. The distinguished majority leader \nand Senator McConnell recognized this when crafting S. Res 445 and the \nSenate approved.\n  Mr. REID. My colleagues from the Senate Commerce Committee are \ncorrect. S. Res. 445, as introduced by me and Senator McConnell and as \npassed by the Senate, proposed continued oversight of transportation \nsecurity by the Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Department consists of 22 separate agencies. These \nagencies are responsible for everything from international trade to \nanimal health inspection. It would be unwise for the Senate to suggest \nthat a single committee should manage oversight of those 22 agencies \nand each of their multiple missions just because the Secretary does not \nlike to travel to the Hill and testify. The Senate cannot abdicated its \noversight responsibilities because the Department thinks it takes up \ntoo much time.\n  And so, I respectfully but deeply disagree with the nonbinding \nmeasure in the underlying bill suggesting that this Senate should \nneglect its oversight duty--and put aside much of its long-standing \nexpertise--because the Department is too busy to come tell us what they \nare doing. While I and many of my colleagues discussed striking this \nprovision from the underlying bill, the majority leader noted that it \nwas simply the work product of one committee. I would like to ask the \nmajority leader if it is intention to continue to operate under S. Res. \n445 given the recent success of legislation like Public Law 109-347 and \nS. 4.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct. S. Res. 445 determines Senate \noversight and jurisdictional authorities.\n\n\n                            TRANSIT SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for this \ncolloquy and for his work with the chairmen and ranking members of many \nof the committees who have been involved in putting together the \nlegislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. \nThe Banking Committee took this task very seriously. I am pleased to \nreport that the committee unanimously reported S. 763, the Public \nTransportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007, which has been \nincorporated into the 9/11 legislation as title XIV. Transit security \nhas long been a focus of the Banking Committee, where we have held \nseveral hearings and reported similar legislation in each of the last \ntwo Congresses. While the Banking Committee's previous legislation also \npassed the Senate, once as a freestanding bill and as title VII of the \nSAFE Port Act, it has yet to become law. I will continue to work very \nclosely with Senator Shelby, who was a leader on this issue as chairman \nof the Banking Committee, to work through the conference process with \nour counterparts in the House of Representatives to make this provision \nlaw. I appreciate the leader's support and commitment to having the \nBanking Committee continue to take responsibility on this title.\n  Transportation security was also addressed more broadly in title VIII \nof this legislation. As title VIII called for national transportation \nsecurity and information plans, I worked very closely with my fellow \nchairmen and ranking members from the Commerce Committee, Senators \nInouye and Stevens, who have jurisdiction over other modes of \ntransportation security besides public transportation. Together we \nreached an agreement, represented in the Inouye amendment, No. 423, \nbetween the Commerce, Banking, and Homeland Security Committees. I am \nvery pleased that this amendment was agreed to, and it is my intention \nto continue our close working relationship on these issues throughout \nthe conference process.\n  The Banking Committee was also very engaged in other areas of the \nbill that involved the committee's jurisdiction. Since 9/11, we have \nworked with and overseen the Federal financial regulators as they have \nimplemented sophisticated preparedness requirements for the \ninstitutions under their jurisdiction. Title VII, as proposed, \nauthorized the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to \ncreate another series of requirements. Although these requirements are \nvoluntary, Federal financial regulators and the financial services \nindustry have expressed concerns about the impact of these \nrequirements, and I share their concerns. A letter from the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System staff dated March 1, 2007 \nexplains that the ``voluntary standards [of Title VII are] not \nappropriate to meet the objective of greater preparedness and \nresiliency.'' The letter states that it would ``be desirable that Title \nVII reflect the unique relationships that already exist within the \nbanking and finance sector and not impose any new requirements that \nduplicate actions that have already been\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\ntaken by the Federal financial institutions regulators.'' The American \nBankers Association in a letter dated February 28, 2007, stated ``ABA \nis concerned that this program would be redundant to and potential \nconflict with the existing process by which the banking industry \ndevelops business continuity standards, as well as with existing \nbusiness continuity regulatory requirements.'' Also, the Office of \nManagement and Budget issued a Statement of Administration Policy on \nFebruary 28, 2007, that stated, ``These standards may increase the \nregulatory burden.''\n\n  I have proposed amendments intended to address these concerns, \nworking with Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins. The final \nlegislation will include an amendment to clarify that institutions in a \nsector, such as financial services, must obey their sector regulators \nand to emphasize that this program is voluntary and does not supersede \nthe institutions' responsibilities to maintain the high standards \nrequired by their regulators.\n  Another amendment that I authored pertains to title X of the \nunderlying bill. I commend Senators Lieberman and Collins for their \nefforts in addressing an important issue under this title--to ensure \nthat the Department of Homeland Security thoroughly discerns the risks \nto America's critical infrastructure. As originally drafted, however, I \nwas concerned that the bill would not ensure that DHS adequately \nconsults with the Federal agencies best equipped to assess and \nprioritize risks in specific sectors of the economy. From the \nperspective of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, I can \ntell you, for example, that no one has greater expertise or technical \nresources for assessing the vulnerabilities of our financial \ninfrastructure than our Federal financial regulators. It is for that \nreason that my amendment effectively removed language that would place \nlimits on the DHS' use of information from sector-specific agencies in \nthe formulation of their risk assessments and prioritized lists. It is \nmy belief that we need to encourage greater coordination between these \nspecialized agencies and the Department of Homeland Security, not \nrestrict it. This is true in areas outside of the financial services \nsector. In matters of public health, DHS should consult the Department \nof Health and Human Services. In manners of farming and food \ndevelopment, the Department of Agriculture should be consulted. In \nmatters related to drinking water and water treatment systems, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency should be consulted. That is why my \namendment endeavors to better integrate our efforts to understand \ncritical infrastructure vulnerabilities and hopefully develop \nprotections in all of these areas. In addition, my amendment ensures \nthat the agencies most familiar with the sensitive data shared with DHS \nand Congress determine the relative classification levels of this \ninformation. Without this provision, I am afraid someone at DHS or \nelsewhere, who is unfamiliar with the sensitivities of a specific \nsector of the economy, might unintentionally divulge critical \ninformation that could be harmful to U.S. infrastructure.\n  Finally, although it pertains to the assessment of U.S. critical \ninfrastructure, title X does not include any reporting requirement on \nthe government's ability to ensure that U.S. industry reduces \ninterruption of critical infrastructure operations during a national \nemergency and minimizes the impact of such a catastrophe. My amendment \nrequires reports to the Committees on Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs as well as to Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, along \nwith their House committee counterparts, on compliance with subsections \n(a) and (c) of section 101 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 to \nmeet this requirement. As chairman of the Committee with jurisdiction \nover this law, it is important to me that we oversee appropriate U.S. \nindustrial preparedness to meet critical infrastructure needs in times \nof national emergency. I appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues in \nthe development of all of these important provisions.\n  Once again, I thank the majority leader for his excellent work in \nbringing all of these committees together and fashioning an excellent \nbill. This demonstrates that the jurisdictional lines established in S. \nRes. 445 continue to work.\n  Mr. REID I thank the Senator from Connecticut. The Senator is correct \nthat S. Res. 445 determines Senate oversight and jurisdictional \nauthorities, and I acknowledge the important role that the Banking \nCommittee has played and will continue to play on this legislation.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President I rise today in opposition to this \nfinal bill because I believe one of the provisions included will \ngreatly undermine our homeland security efforts. Specifically, the \nprovision would mandate that the Transportation Security Administration \nhave the ability to collectively bargain with Government unions \nrepresenting airport security screeners. This will create unnecessary \nred tape and bureaucracy and tie the hands of our security personnel. \nWhile this provision may be beneficial to the union bosses, it is not \nbeneficial to Georgians and the American people.\n  TSA must have the flexibility to respond when our security is \nthreatened. In this current era of unpredictable threats, TSA must be \nable to continually change its systems to meet the changing security \nenvironment. If we mandate that TSA must negotiate with the unions for \nevery change in circumstance, it will negate the agency's ability to \nrespond quickly to terrorist threats and other emergencies. I just \ndon't think that is common sense.\n  In fact, when TSA was created, the agency was given the authority to \ndecide whether to engage in collective bargaining with airport baggage \nscreeners, and TSA concluded that such negotiations would weaken its \nability to protect the American people. This authority was not \nrecommended in the 9/11 Commission Report.\n  Now let's be clear--the issue here is not whether TSA employees \nshould be allowed to join a union but whether TSA must collectively \nbargain with Government unions before it changes personnel and \npolicies. At the present time, airport screeners may voluntarily join a \nunion and TSA will withhold union dues at an employee's request. The \nunion, however, has no standing to negotiate with TSA on behalf of \ntheir members.\n  I would just note that this restriction is not unique to TSA. Other \nFederal agencies that collect and respond to intelligence in an effort \nto address homeland security, such as the FBI, CIA, and Secret Service, \nall have the same restriction. This is done as an acknowledgement that \nhighly sensitive security information should only be released on a \nneed-to-know basis. Collective bargaining, conversely, would require \nthe release of sensitive information to external negotiators and \narbitrators, which would increase the risk of sensitive information \ngetting in the wrong hands.\n  TSA must be able to quickly shift employees based on intelligence and \nairport traffic demands while modifying procedures at a moment's \nnotice. For example, this past August, following an attempted United \nKingdom airline bombing, TSA overhauled its procedures in less than 12 \nhours to prevent terrorists from smuggling liquid explosives onto any \nU.S. flights. Not only did this flexibility ensure that no U.S. flights \nwere cancelled due to the change, most importantly, it ensured the \nsafety and security of the United States. This past December, during a \nmajor snowstorm in Denver, local TSA employees were unable to get to \nthe airport. However, due to the current policies, TSA was able to \ndeploy officers from Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Colorado Springs to \nthe Denver airport. This deployment allowed TSA to open every security \nlane in Denver around the clock at the airport until they were back to \nnormal operations. So in circumstances like these, TSA cannot spend \ndays, weeks, or months negotiating over officer assignments and new \nschedules before implementing them.\n  We should remember that TSA exists to protect American lives, and its \nfocus must remain on homeland security and not on labor negotiations. I \nam extremely concerned that the provision included in this bill will \nlead to a change in culture within the agency, and I just don't think \nour hard-working TSA employees gain much from this.\n  I am proud of our dedicated TSA employees in Georgia, and we already \nhave a ``pay for performance'' system in place that weeds out \nnonperformers.\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\nThe system is based upon technical competence, readiness for duty, and \noperational performance. But under the proposed changes, the most \neffective security employees will be punished by the change in pay \npractices.\n  Finally, we should be concerned about what this means to passengers \nand the American taxpayers. The collective bargaining system would not \nreward good screening performance or customer service. Additionally, \nimplementing the infrastructure for collective bargaining would cost \nhundreds of millions of dollars and TSA would be forced to relocate \nthousands of personnel. For Georgians, fewer personnel means fewer \nscreening lanes and longer lines at airports like Hartsfield-Jackson \nInternational Airport in Atlanta.\n  Our national security is too important to risk. It is no accident \nthat we have not had a terrorist attack on domestic soil since \nSeptember 11, 2001. But that is not to say that it can't happen again. \nThe terrorists only have to get it right once. But we have to get it \nright every time. So let's not hinder our ability to do that. Our \nhomeland security infrastructure must be able to operate in real time. \nWe should not tie the very hands we rely upon to protect us here at \nhome. It is disappointing that this provision is included in this bill, \nand I urge my colleagues to oppose final passage.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to discuss three proposed \namendments to S. 4, Improving America's Security by Implementing \nUnfinished Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act. I thank Senators \nLieberman, Collins, Dodd and Shelby for working with me and my staff on \nprovisions to protect seniors in the event of an emergency. \nUnfortunately, two important provisions were pulled at the behest of \nRepublicans to limit the number of amendments offered by Democrats.\n  It has been almost 2 years since our Nation reeled from the tragic \nand shameful images of seniors abandoned during the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina. Sadly, we now know that 71 percent of the people who \ndied were older than 60. Last year, as the ranking member of the \nSpecial Committee on Aging, we held a hearing to examine how prepared \nthe Nation is to care for our seniors in the event of a national \nemergency. What we learned was disheartening.\n  We learned that our Nation is woefully unprepared to meet the unique \nneeds of our seniors in the event of a terrorist attack, natural \ndisaster, or other emergency. Cookie cutter emergency plans are of \nlittle use to seniors, especially those who depend on others for \nassistance in their daily lives. We need specific plans, programs, and \ninformation for all seniors facing emergencies.\n  That is why Senators Wyden, Coleman and I offered several amendments \nto the 9/11 legislation to ensure that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity place seniors on the forefront of its emergency planning \nagenda. The first amendment, which is supported by the American Public \nHealth Association, is an important step towards ensuring that seniors \nare protected when the next national emergency occurs.\n  This amendment would ensure that any recipient of a homeland security \ngrant, under title II, will include in its State, local, or tribal \nhomeland security plan the evacuation, transportation, and health care \nneeds of the elderly.\n  It would also require that the needs of the elderly are incorporated \ninto any preparedness exercises or trainings for emergency responders \nto ensure they are adequately prepared to safeguard our seniors in the \nevent of an emergency.\n  This amendment would have sent a strong signal to States and \ncommunities that are engaged in emergency planning that seniors must be \na priority. Unfortunately, this is one of the amendments pulled from a \nmanager's package of approved amendments at the last minute.\n  I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator Wyden's \namendment to establish a Special Needs Registry Pilot Project, which is \nsupported by the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. One of \nthe most useful recommendations from our Aging Committee hearing last \nyear was to follow the lead of counties like Miami-Dade in Florida. \nThey have successfully set up a voluntary registry where seniors can \nlist where they live, their transportation limitations, their health \nneeds, and whether they may need help getting food and other supplies \nduring an emergency.\n  It's clear that more cities and counties could benefit from these \nkinds of special needs registries. That's why this amendment would have \ncreated a pilot project for local emergency management agencies to set \nup and test these registries, allowing first responders to locate and \ncare for seniors before and during emergencies. It was our hope that \nthis pilot project would have helped spark a nationwide effort to \nestablish special needs registries; unfortunately this amendment was \nalso pulled at the last minute.\n  On a brighter note, I thank Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby \nagain for working with me and Senator Coleman to successfully include a \nprovision, supported by the American Public Health Association, in \ntitle XIV that would ensure that public transportation workers are \ntrained to meet the evacuation needs of seniors in the event of a \ncrisis. This is particularly important since so many of our seniors \nutilize public transportation for access to their everyday needs. \nFurthermore, only public transportation has the capacity to move \nmillions of people and provide first responders with critical support \nin major evacuations of urban areas.\n  This provision will go a long way to ensure that our seniors are \ntaken care of if we have another emergency or disaster. Unfortunately, \ntwo crucial provisions intended to safeguard the needs of seniors were \nnot included in the final bill due to partisan efforts to limit \nDemocratic amendments. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita taught us many \npainful lessons that should never be forgotten. I will not forget and I \nintend to pursue legislation aimed at explicitly safeguarding the needs \nof America's seniors in the event of an emergency. The time to act to \nprotect our seniors is now.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, today the Senate will vote on a matter of \nutmost importance--enacting the remaining 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations. Since their publication 2\\1/2\\ years ago, roughly half \nof the recommendations have been left unaddressed, while many that have \nbeen adopted into law have not been effectively implemented. S. 4, the \nImproving America's Security Act, is a critical step to ensuring our \nNation's safety.\n  This bill includes an important new interoperability grant program. \nTragedies such as September 11, the Station Fire in my home State of \nRhode Island, and Hurricane Katrina have demonstrated the need for \ninteroperable communications equipment among first responders. More \ncommunities require access to funding to create interoperable \ncommunications networks, and I have long supported increasing \naccessibility for interoperability grants to local and state \ngovernments.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes a transit security program \nthat I helped author as a member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee. The committee has been well aware of the need for \nthis legislation since the tragic events of 9/11, spending significant \ntime and effort to improve our Nation's transit security system. The \nSenate has passed transit security legislation in the last two \nCongresses, only to have them each stall prior to enactment. While our \nNation acted quickly after 9/11 to secure airports and airplanes \nagainst terrorists, major vulnerabilities remain in surface \ntransportation. As the 9/11 Commission concluded, ``opportunities to do \nharm are as great, or greater, in maritime and surface transportation'' \nas in commercial aviation. The time to act is now.\n  Transit is vital to providing mobility for millions of Americans and \noffers tremendous economic benefits to our Nation. In the United \nStates, people use public transportation over 32 million times each \nweekday compared to 2 million passengers who fly daily. Paradoxically, \nit is the very openness of the system that makes it vulnerable to \nterrorism. When one considers this and the fact that roughly $7 per \npassenger is invested in aviation security, but less than one cent is \ninvested in the security of each transit passenger, the need for an \nauthorized transit security program is clear.\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\n  In addition, the bill provides important protections for \nTransportation Security Officers at the Transportation Security \nAdministration that have been long absent, including whistleblower \nprotections, the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, \nand certain collective bargaining rights.\n  Lastly, while Providence is now 1 of 39 urban areas eligible for the \nUrban Area Security Initiative grants, something that I have long \nsought, believing the city faces risks from terrorism, I was \ndisappointed that Senator Leahy's amendment to restore the minimum \nallocation to 0.75 percent for States under the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program failed. With this funding, Rhode Island has been able to \nmake critical improvements, but adequate funding is still needed, and \nit is my hope that the highest minimum funding level will prevail in \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Implementing the final recommendations of the 9/11 Commission builds \nand improves on the work that has been done since the attacks of \nSeptember 11, and I am pleased to support this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I want to add my thoughts to the \ndebate on the Improving America's Security Act of 2007.\n  First, I preface my remarks by applauding the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for \ntheir work on this important bill. This bill makes crucial and long \noverdue improvements in transportation security, critical \ninfrastructure protection, and emergency response capabilities. There \nis no higher priority than protecting homeland security, and this bill \nis a key component in that effort.\n  Nearly 6 years since the horrific attacks of September 11, we are \nstill struggling to give our first responders, law enforcement \nofficers, and the employees of the Department of Homeland Security the \nresources they need to keep us safe. I thank these brave men and women \nwho work daily to protect this Nation. They are on the front lines of \nthe fight against terrorism. They are the ones who are called on to \nstop and respond to any future attack upon our Nation. This bill \nincludes important resources these brave men and women need to perform \ntheir critical tasks.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has increased funding for State homeland \nsecurity grants, emergency management performance grants, emergency \ncommunications and the Urban Area Security Initiative. I have long \nadvocated for greater funding of emergency management grants because \nthey are crucial in assisting State and local officials in preparing \nfor all-hazards emergencies. These grants provide emergency managers \nwith the resources they need to increase coordination and planning so \nthat if an emergency occurs, State and local officials will respond \nmuch more efficiently and effectively.\n  It is my hope that this bill represents a lasting shift in \npriorities, a shift towards an enhanced focus on the most pressing \nthreats facing our country. We are still spending almost twice as much \non Iraq as is allocated for homeland security, diplomacy, and \ninternational assistance combined. The billions we spend each month in \nIraq could be invested in the protection of critical infrastructure and \nour system of national preparedness and response that failed in the \nwake of Hurricane Katrina. As we consider the budget resolution and the \ndefense and homeland security appropriations bills this year, I \nencourage my colleagues to take a broader view when it comes to our \nnational security priorities and make the tradeoffs that must be made.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Federal Agency Data Mining \nReporting Act is included in this bill as section 504. I have been \nworking on this legislation for a number of years with Senator Sununu, \nSenator Leahy, and Senator Akaka. I am glad that Senator Sununu and \nSenator Akaka successfully offered the legislation as an amendment to \nS. 4 when it was before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Many law-abiding Americans are understandably concerned about the \nspecter of secret government programs analyzing vast quantities of \npublic and private data about their pursuits, in search of patterns of \nsuspicious activity. Four years after we first learned about the \nDefense Department's program called Total Information Awareness, there \nis still much Congress does not know about the Federal Government's \nwork on data mining. This bill is an important step in allowing \nCongress to conduct oversight of any such programs or related research \ndevelopment efforts.\n  The Federal Agency Data Mining Reporting Act would require Federal \nagencies to report annually on their development and use of data mining \ntechnologies to discover predictive or anomalous patterns indicating \ncriminal or terrorist activity the types of pattern-based data analysis \nthat raise the most serious privacy concerns. As amended on the floor, \nit would also allow classified information, law enforcement sensitive \ninformation, trade secrets, and proprietary business information to be \nprovided to the relevant committees separately, in a nonpublic form, \nunder appropriate security measures.\n  Intelligence and law enforcement agencies would not be doing their \njob if they did not take advantage of new technologies. But when it \ncomes to pattern-based data mining, Congress needs to understand \nwhether it can be effective in identifying terrorists, and Congress \nneeds to consider the privacy and civil liberties implications of \ndeploying such technology domestically. I hope these reports will help \nCongress--and to the extent possible, the public--finally understand \nwhat is going on behind the closed doors of the executive branch, so \nthat we can start to have the policy discussion about data mining that \nis long overdue.\n  I am concerned about the ongoing development of the Information \nSharing Environment without adequate privacy and civil liberties \nguidelines. In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2004, Congress mandated that the President create an Information \nSharing Environment, ISE, for the sharing of terrorism information \namong Federal agencies, State and local governments, and the private \nsector. This is a critical goal in our counterterrorism efforts. But \nthat legislation also required that the President issue privacy \nguidelines for the ISE, in recognition of the serious privacy and civil \nliberties implications of facilitating more sharing of information \namong these entities. Those privacy guidelines were issued in December, \nbut in my view are wholly inadequate. They touch on the most \nsignificant privacy issues and provide a framework for agencies to \nthink about the privacy issues that might arise, but they do not \ninclude specific guidelines and rules for protecting privacy. That is \nwhy I filed an amendment to S. 4 that would have provided more \ndirection to the ISE program manager about what should be included in \nthese privacy guidelines and the need for more specific government-wide \nrules for the ISE. I was disappointed that my amendment was not \nincluded, but will continue to work to ensure that the guidelines for \nimplementation of the ISE are sufficient to protect the privacy of \nAmericans.\n  The bill mandates the declassification of the aggregate amount of the \nintelligence budget. This reform has a long history going back to the \nChurch and Pike Commissions. It is supported by the current Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. It was also one of the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission, which stated that ``when even \naggregate categorical numbers remain hidden it is hard to judge \npriorities and foster accountability.'' I concur with the Commission, \nthat aggregate budget figures ``provid[e] little insight into U.S. \nintelligence sources and methods.'' Sharing this information with the \nAmerican people will, however, provide a greater level of transparency \nand accountability and in the end make us more secure.\n  I was pleased to support Senator McCaskill's amendment to ensure that \nworkers at the Transportation Security Administration are afforded the \nsame workplace protections as other DHS employees. The low retention \nrate at TSA resulting in part from lack of workers' rights threatens \nour security. This amendment will address this concern while giving \nadministrators the flexibility they need to respond to imminent \nthreats.\n  I am pleased that this bill includes provisions to ensure proper \noversight of homeland security grants. I am deeply troubled by reports \nof improper\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\noversight of expenditures at DHS, including an article in the \nWashington Post last November stating that the Department was unable to \nlocate one-third of the files needed to perform an audit of its \ncontracts. I therefore supported Senator Coburn's amendment to require \nDHS to perform audits on homeland security grants. While I understand \nconcerns that this requirement could have led to delays in the issuance \nof grants in fiscal year 2008, I did not think it was unreasonable to \nrequire DHS to conduct the audits required in a timely manner. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues to improve oversight of homeland \nsecurity funding.\n  I supported several amendments that would have added funding for \ncritical security needs not fully addressed in this bill. I do not take \nlightly a decision to vote in favor of spending more money. Fiscal \nresponsibility is one of my highest priorities, but it is imperative \nthat we provide the resources needed to combat terrorism.\n  I voted for this bill because it makes key changes to address \nsecurity needs. However, our Nation's vulnerabilities demand more and I \nwill continue to work to ensure that our vital homeland security needs \nare met.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I support the Improving America's \nSecurity Act of 2007 because it takes a giant step in implementing the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Keeping America safe requires \nmore than expensive weapons and war funding; it also requires a \ncommitment to homeland security. This legislation shows that \ncommitment.\n  We learned on September 11 and during Hurricane Katrina how important \nit is for our first responders to be able to communicate with each \nother. For years, I have been urging the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to establish a dedicated funding source for interoperable \ncommunications equipment. I am pleased that this legislation creates a \ngrant program dedicated to improving operability and interoperability \nat local, regional, State and Federal levels.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation moves us closer to the \nequitable distribution of homeland security grant funding. For 5 years, \nthe largest homeland security grant programs have distributed funds \nusing a formula that arbitrarily sets aside a large portion of funds to \nbe divided equally among the States, regardless of size or need. The \ncurrent ``small State formula'' has severely disadvantaged States such \nas Michigan with high populations. In addition, it reduces the amount \nof funding that can be allocated to States with highest risks. Although \nI am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass two amendments that I \nsupported that would have lowered the minimum funding level even \nfurther, the .45 percent minimum in the underlying bill is an \nimprovement from the current .75 percent base funding amount.\n  The legislation also includes language that I authored that directs \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to establish international border \ncommunity interoperable communications demonstration projects on the \nnorthern and southern borders to improve collaboration and help \nidentify common frequencies for cross border communications. These \ninteroperable communications demonstration projects will address the \ninteroperable communications needs of police officers, firefighters, \nemergency medical technicians, National Guard, and other emergency \nresponse providers at our borders by identifying common international \ncross-border frequencies for communications equipment; fostering the \nstandardization of interoperable communications equipment; identifying \nsolutions that will expeditiously facilitate communications \ninteroperability across national borders; ensuring that emergency \nresponse providers can communicate with one another and the public at \ndisaster sites or in the event of a terrorist attack or other \ncatastrophic event; and providing training and equipment for relevant \npersonnel to enable those units to deal with threats and contingencies \nin a variety of environments.\n  Also included in the legislation is language that I authored that \nwill require the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a cost-\nbenefit analysis of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, WHTI, \nbefore publishing the final rule. The WHTI will require individuals \nfrom the United States, Canada, and Mexico to present a passport or \nother document proving citizenship before entering the United States. \nAlthough we all share the goals of the Western Hemisphere Travel \nInitiative to make our borders as secure as they can be, we need to \nmake sure that we are achieving that goal in a way that will not cause \neconomic harm to our States. I am also pleased that language was \nincluded in the bill that I worked with Senator Coleman on to require \nthe Department of Homeland Security to sign a memorandum of \nunderstanding with one or more States to conduct a pilot project to see \nwhether secure driver's licenses could be used as a form of \ndocumentation for travel between the U.S. and Canada under the WHTI. \nThe amendment also provides that DHS must evaluate the pilot project \nand map out next steps, including an expansion if appropriate.\n  This legislation also takes important steps to shore up rail, transit \nand cargo security in the United States. The legislation establishes a \ngrant fund for system wide Amtrak security improvements and much needed \ninfrastructure upgrades as well as authorizes an existing grant program \nfor improving intercity bus and bus terminal security. It establishes a \ngrant program for freight and passenger rail security upgrades and \nrequires railroads shipping high-hazard materials to create threat \nmitigation plans. It authorizes studies to find ways to improve \npassenger and baggage security screening on passenger rail service \nbetween the U.S. and Canada. The bill will hopefully move us closer to \naddressing something I have been trying to get implemented at our \nnorthern car and truck border crossings for years: establishing a \npreclearance system. The study is required to identify what exactly is \nneeded to perform prescreening of rail passengers on the northern \nborder.\n  I am pleased that the Senate retained language that will require that \nTSA screeners finally come under an unambiguous personnel system. A \nfurther amendment that I supported will finally give Transportation \nSecurity Administration screeners the whistleblower protections \nafforded to most other Federal workers, including law enforcement \nofficers. It also gives them the right to appeal suspensions and to \ncollectively bargain, just like their counterparts in the Border \nControl, FEMA and the Capitol Police.\n  The bill also requires studies on how to improve the safety of \ntransporting radioactive and hazardous materials and shipments of \nexplosives and radioactive materials on our highways. I am pleased that \nthis legislation requires the screening of all cargo carried on \npassenger airplanes within 3 years.\n  The intelligence failures before the Iraq war were, to a significant \ndegree, the result of the CIA shaping intelligence to support \nadministration policy. The CIA's errors were all in one direction, \nmaking the Iraqi threat clearer, sharper and more imminent, thereby \npromoting the decision to remove Saddam from power. Nuances, \nqualifications and caveats were dropped. ``Slam dunk'' was the \nassessment.\n  Among the most important things we can do to keep this from happening \nagain is to strengthen congressional oversight to ensure that \nintelligence community assessments are objective and uninfluenced by \nthe policy judgments of whatever administration is in power. The 9/11 \nCommission agreed, stating in its report that ``Of all our \nrecommendations, strengthening congressional oversight may be among the \nmost difficult and important.'' Section 1102 of S. 4 bill is directed \nat that goal.\n\n  Too often Congress is stonewalled or slow-walked by the executive \nbranch in accessing intelligence information necessary to make policy \nand conduct oversight of the intelligence community. Section 1102 of \nthis bill adds a new section 508 to the National Security Act that will \nensure Congress has access to intelligence information critical to do \nits job.\n  Section 508 requires elements of the intelligence community to \nprovide, upon request from congressional committees of jurisdiction, \ntimely access to intelligence information. The requirement would apply \nunless the President certified that the requested documents were not \nbeing provided because the President was asserting a constitutional \nprivilege. Requiring the\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\nintelligence community to respond to requests for information from the \nvice chairman and ranking member of the Senate and House intelligence \ncommittees, respectively, will encourage rigorous oversight regardless \nof which party controls the Congress.\n  In addition to providing information in a timely manner, we expect \nthe intelligence community to provide Congress its assessment of \nintelligence matters uninfluenced by the policy goals of the \nadministration. However, an Office of Management and Budget--OMB--\nmemorandum directs executive branch agencies to clear, through OMB, \nlegislative proposals, agency reports, and testimony on pending \nlegislation. The memo also states that ``If agencies are asked by \nCongressional Committees to report or testify on pending legislation or \nwish to volunteer a report, similar clearance procedures are \nfollowed.''\n  Our intelligence agencies should not have to get permission from the \nOMB, or any other executive branch official to share their views with \nthe Congress. Section 1102 of the bill adds a new section 508 (d) to \nthe National Security Act that says no executive branch official can \nrequire the intelligence community to get permission to testify or to \nsubmit testimony, legislative recommendations or comments to the \nCongress. Section 508 (d) is based on authority that exists for \nnumerous other executive branch agencies, including the Securities and \nExchange Commission, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency, \nthe Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Housing \nFinance Board, and the National Credit Union Administration.\n  A CRS legal review of direct reporting requirements like the one \ncreated by section 508 (d) states that ``direct reporting provisions \nare well within the Congress's constitutional authority to inform \nitself in order to perform its legislative function which has been \nconsistently acknowledged by Supreme Court decisions, and dates back to \nthe early enactments of the First Congress in 1789.'' The CRS review \ncalls Department of Justice objections to direct reporting requirements \n``without substantial merit.''\n  Finally, it is important for whistleblowers to know that they can \ncome directly to Congress if they have evidence that someone has made a \nfalse statement to the Congress. And the Congress has a right to that \ninformation--even if it is classified.\n  Section 1102 of the bill adds a new section 509 to the National \nSecurity Act making it clear that intelligence community employees and \ncontractors can report classified information directly to appropriate \nMembers of Congress and cleared staff if the employee reasonably \nbelieves that the information provides direct and specific evidence of \na false or inaccurate statement to Congress contained in an \nintelligence assessment, report or estimate.\n  Section 509 is substantively the same as section 225 of the Senate-\npassed version of the intelligence reform legislation. Section 225 was \nstripped from the intelligence reform bill in conference. Section 509 \nis also similar to a provision that passed the Senate twice previously. \nOnce as part of the fiscal year 1998 Intelligence Authorization Act and \nonce as a stand alone measure S. 1668, in the 105th Congress. S. 1668 \npassed the Senate 93-1.\n  Section 509 is also consistent with congressional findings passed in \nthe 105th Congress as part of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower \nProtection Act of 1998 and incorporated by reference into the \nintelligence reform bill. Those findings state among other things that:\n\n       Congress, as a co-equal branch of Government, is empowered \n     by the Constitution to serve as a check on the executive \n     branch; in that capacity, it has a ``need to know'' of \n     allegations of wrongdoing within the executive branch, \n     including allegations of wrongdoing in the Intelligence \n     Community; . . .\n       (N)o basis in law exists for requiring prior authorization \n     of disclosures to the intelligence committees of Congress by \n     employees of the executive branch of classified information \n     about wrongdoing within the Intelligence Community . . .\n\n  I am pleased that the Senate will soon pass this legislation, for the \nfamilies and friends of those we lost on September 11, 2001, and for \nthe safety and security of our Nation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will vote today in favor of final \npassage of the Improving America's Security by Implementing Unfinished \nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, S. 4, but I do so \nwith a heavy heart.\n  I am truly disappointed that the chairman and ranking member of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Senators \nLieberman and Collins, decided to arbitrarily lower the minimum \nallocation for States under the State Homeland Security Grant Program \nand the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program from the 0.75 \npercent that has existed for the past 5 years to 0.45 percent. Not only \nwould this change to the formula result in the loss of millions in \nhomeland security funding for the fire, police, and rescue departments \nin small- and medium-sized States, like Vermont, Connecticut, and \nMaine, it also would deal a crippling blow to their efforts to launch \nfederally mandated multiyear plans to build and sustain their terrorism \npreparedness.\n  During the Senate floor debate on S. 4, I offered with Senators \nThomas, Stevens, Roberts, Pryor, Sanders, Enzi, Hatch, Whitehouse, and \nLincoln an amendment to restore the minimum allocation for States under \nthe State Homeland Security Grant Program from 0.45 percent, which is \nproposed by the underlying bill, to 0.75 percent, which is current law. \nAs with current law, the State minimum under our amendment would have \ncontinued to apply only to 40 percent of the overall funding under this \nprogram. The majority of the funds would continue to be allocated based \non risk assessment criteria, as are the funds under the several \nseparate discretionary programs that Congress has established for \nsolely urban and high-risk areas, which also are governed by risk \nassessment calculations.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment lost by a vote of 49 yeas to 50 nays. \nThis is a marked change from just last year, when the 0.75 percent \nminimum allocation was overwhelmingly defended when 64 Senators voted \nagainst an amendment that would have lowered the minimum to 0.25 \npercent. Fifteen Senators changed their votes from last year, including \nHSGAC Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins, whose States stand \nto lose the most from the decreased minimum.\n  The bill that passed the Senate today would reduce the all-State \nminimum for SHSGP and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program \nto 0.45 percent. The House bill reduces it even further to 0.25 \npercent. Due to the formula differences, there is no guarantee that the \nminimum will not be even further reduced during conference \nnegotiations. Small- and medium-sized States face the loss of millions \nof dollars for our first responders if the minimum is lowered.\n  By reducing the all-State minimum to 0.45 percent, the underlying \nbill would reduce the guaranteed dollar amount for each State by 40 \npercent. With appropriations for formula grants having been cut by 60 \npercent since 2003--from $2.3 billion in 2003, to $900 million in \nfiscal year 2007--further reductions in first responder funding would \nhamper even more each State's efforts to prevent and deal with \npotential terrorist attacks.\n  In fiscal year 2007, State Homeland Security and Law Enforcement \nTerrorism grants were funded at $525 million and $375 million, \nrespectively, for a total of $900 million. Under the current all-State \nminimum of 0.75 percent, the base amount States receive is $6.75 \nmillion. Based on fiscal year 2007 levels, each State would face a loss \nof an estimated $2.7 million, or 40 percent, under the new 0.45 percent \nformula, which would be a real blow to our first responders.\n  And the cuts will be even deeper should the President's budget \nrequest for next year be approved. The President has requested only \n$250 million for these two important first responder grant programs.\n  My colleagues from our largest States--and apparently some small- and \nmedium-sized States--seem to forget that the terrorist attacks of 9/11 \nadded to the responsibilities and risks of first responders nationwide. \nI wrote the current all-State minimum formula as part of the USA \nPATRIOT Act\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\nof 2001 to guarantee that each State receives at least 0.75 percent of \nthe national allotment to help meet their national domestic security \nneeds.\n  Every State--rural or urban, small or large--has basic domestic \nsecurity needs and deserves to receive Federal funds under this \npartnership to meet both those needs and the new homeland security \nresponsibilities the Federal Government demands. Of course, high-\ndensity urban areas and high-risk centers have even greater needs, \nwhich is why this year alone we provided $1.3 billion for homeland \nsecurity programs for which only a small number of urban areas are \neligible to apply. All of these needs deserve and need to be met. I \nhave worked hard over the years to help address the needs of larger \nStates and high-density areas, and I have opposed the Bush \nAdministration's efforts to pit our States against each other, as they \nhave tried to mask their efforts to cut overall funding for first \nresponders.\n  Smaller States, especially, would never be able to fulfill those \nessential duties on top of their daily responsibilities without Federal \nsupport, especially given that DHS is currently suggesting that States \nwill pay for REAL ID implementation, an estimated $16 billion, with \nfirst responder grants. My colleagues should be warned that if the \nminimum drops further--compounded by substantial drops in overall first \nresponder funding--then small- and medium-sized States will not be able \nto meet those Federal mandates for terrorism prevention, preparedness, \nand response.\n  Some from urban States argue that Federal money to fight terrorism is \nbeing sent to areas that do not need it and is ``wasted'' in small \ntowns. They claim the formula is highly politicized and insists on the \nredirection of funds to urban areas that they believe face heightened \nthreat of terrorist attacks.\n  What critics of the all-State minimum seem to forget since the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks, the Federal Government has asked all \nState and local first responders to defend us as never before on the \nfront lines in the war against terrorism. Emergency responders in one \nState have been given the same obligation as those in any other State \nto provide enhanced protection, preparedness, and response against \nterrorists.\n  The attacks of 9/11 added to the responsibilities and risks of first \nresponders across the country. In recent years, due to the 0.75 percent \nall-State minimum allocation for formula grants that has existed in \nlaw, first responders have received resources to help them meet their \nnew responsibilities and have made our neighborhoods safer and our \ncommunities better prepared.\n  There is much left undone in securing our Nation. I hope that the \nSenate's conferees will resist calls for further needless reductions to \nthe all-State minimum base and risk the preparedness efforts in small \nStates like their own. I trust they will do all they can during \nconference negotiations to ensure continued support and resources for \nour police, fire, and EMS services in every State if we expect them to \ncontinue protecting us from terrorist or responding to terrorist \nattacks, as well as carrying out their ongoing responsibilities in \nhelping to keep our communities safe and prepared.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, now is the time to implement the \nunfinished recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  I commend Senators Lieberman and Collins for their leadership and the \nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for its \nwork on this important legislation. More than 5 years after 9/11 \ndespite tens of billions of dollars spent America's ports, rails, \nairports, borders, nuclear powerplants and chemical plants still are \nnot completely safe. It has been more than 2 years since the 9/11 \nCommission issued its final recommendations, and here we are, today, \nstill debating the same issues.\n  This legislation builds upon previous efforts to enhance homeland \nsecurity and includes several critical provisions to allocate homeland \nsecurity resources based on risk, ensure that first responders have \ninteroperable communications equipment, and improve government-wide \ninformation sharing.\n  I especially am pleased to note three provisions included in this \nbill that I have championed for some time. This legislation specifies \nthat States can use Federal grants to design, conduct, and evaluate \nmass evacuation plans and exercises. While most cities and States have \nevacuation plans, the lack of training drills and exercises makes it \ndifficult to address problems and work out solutions before lives are \nat risk in a real emergency. As we learned from Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, there is no substitute for being prepared. We may only have one \nchance to get it right.\n  In addition, this legislation makes important structural changes to \nstrengthen the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. Again, I \ncommend Senators Lieberman and Collins for including a broad statutory \nmandate and subpoena power for the Board. This bill also would require \nSenate confirmation for the chair and the vice-chair of the Board, as \nwell as mandatory public reporting by the Board and reports for \nCongress. These provisions are key to ensuring the integrity of the \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n  Finally, this bill improves intelligence and information sharing \nwithin the Federal Government and with State and local governments. I \nam pleased that the bill we consider today would make the program \nmanager for the Information Sharing Environment, ISE, permanent and \nauthorize additional funds and staff to accomplish the ISE mission. The \nbill also requires additional reports to Congress on the status of ISE \ndevelopment. These comprehensive new requirements would improve and \nstrengthen government information sharing structures, which will mean a \nmore integrated intelligence network and a more secure Nation.\n  The 9/11 Commission gave Congress a critically important job by \ncharging us with making structural changes to close the gaps in \nAmerica's homeland security defenses. This legislation responds to that \nchallenge, and I support its final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes of debate divided between the managers and the leaders.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I first want to thank our colleagues \nfor their cooperation in moving forward this very important piece of \nlegislation. When the 9/11 Commission completed its report and made its \nfindings to Congress, the Homeland Security Committee, which I chaired \nat the time, worked very hard to produce a major overhaul of our \nintelligence community--in fact, the most sweeping changes in more than \n50 years.\n  That legislation, for example, created the Director of National \nIntelligence and also established the National Counterterrorism Center, \nwhich brings together analysts from the 15 agencies involved in \nintelligence gathering and analysis. We took a major step forward.\n  Now we are on the verge of finishing the job. I salute the chairman \nof the committee, Senator Lieberman, for making this legislation the \ntop priority of our committee under his chairmanship. The legislation \nis going to help implement the unfinished recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission. As I said, most of the recommendations were included in the \n2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. But there were \nsome significant ones that were not completed. Thus, this legislation \nimproves intelligence and information sharing, and it authorizes the \nHomeland Security Grant Program, which has been so important in \nimproving the capabilities of our communities and States which are, \nafter all, our partners in improving homeland security.\n  We worked very hard, the chairman and I and the rest of the committee \nmembers, to devise a formula that would be fair to all States, that \nwould allocate the majority of the funding based on an analysis of \nrisk, vulnerability, and consequences but also ensure that each and \nevery State receive a predictable, steady level of funding so that each \nState can be improved and have a basic preparedness level.\n  I think we struck the right balance in that area. This bill would \nauthorize a bit over $3 billion for each of the next 3 years for this \nnew Homeland Security Grant Program. Included in that program is an \nemphasis on prevention. We\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\nall are very focused on recovery and response in the event of a \nterrorist attack, but we believe it is very important to also focus on \npreventing attacks from happening in the first place. Our legislation \nwould do that by providing that at least 25 percent of the overall \nfunding for the urban areas and State Homeland Security Grant Programs \nmust be used for law enforcement terrorism prevention activities.\n  Another important section of this bill creates a program to deal with \ncommunications equipment interoperability. We know that lives were lost \non 9/11 because the various first responders could not communicate with \none another. As a result, firefighters, police officers, and emergency \nmedical personnel lost their lives and suffered injuries. Much to our \ndismay, we also found as part of our investigation into the failed \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina that exactly those same interoperability \nproblems were occurring in Louisiana, in particular. We simply must \ntackle this problem. It is too big a problem and too expensive a \nproblem for States and communities to do on their own. That is why we \nhave a partnership, a grant program that would be administered by FEMA \nand dedicated to improving the survivability and the interoperability \nof communications equipment used by our courageous first responders and \nemergency managers.\n  Again, that program would authorize $3.3 billion over the next 5 \nyears.\n  The bill also makes a number of important improvements to prevent \nterrorists from traveling to our country; to strengthen the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board; to improve private sector \npreparedness, since we know that 85 percent of critical infrastructure \nis in the private sector; and to improve transportation security \nplanning and overall security of our transportation system.\n  It has been a great pleasure to work with the chairman and the \nmembers of our committee, as well as the Commerce Committee and other \nMembers who have been interested, to bring this bill to the floor, and \nI believe it will help make our Nation safer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, first, let me thank my ranking \nmember, the Senator from Maine. I was thinking, as she was speaking, \nthat when the transition occurred at the beginning of this 110th \nsession of Congress I said to her, all that would change in our working \nrelationship was our title, the title that each of us had. As I look \nback on our work together on this bill, S. 4, I am pleased to say that \nwe worked with the same spirit of cooperation that we did under her \nchairmanship in 2004 when we had our first legislative response to the \n9/11 Commission and we adopted the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist \nPrevention Act of 2004. So I thank Senator Collins.\n  I thank her staff for their work, and I thank my staff as well.\n  Madam President, I note the presence on the floor of the majority \nleader. I thank him for making adoption of this legislation a priority \nfor this Congress. Here is why. This bill will strengthen our ability \nnot just to respond to terrorist attacks but also to prepare our \nFederal, State, and local governments to respond to natural disasters. \nIn that sense, S. 4 is not only a response to finish the mission given \nus by the 9/11 Commission that learns from the lessons of the first \nmonths of implementation of that Commission report, but it also applies \nto lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. We are trying to create an \nall-hazards approach in our Government that increases our homeland \nsecurity against the threat of a terrorist attack and also prepares our \nGovernment to respond better to natural disasters. I do not want to \nrepeat some of the points in this legislation that Senator Collins \nfocused on. I will just pick a few additionally.\n  One is that S. 4 recognizes that 85 percent of the critical \ninfrastructure in our country that is potentially a target for \nterrorist attack in our great open society is privately owned. For the \nfirst time, we establish a voluntary program where the private sector \ncan come in and have their facilities certified as, I would use the \nterm ``terrorist resistant.''\n  In another section we declassify the bottom line of the intelligence \nbudget. That was a specific recommendation of the 9/11 Commission in \nthe interests of transparency and accountability.\n  We also greatly improve the provisions that in our law and policy are \naimed at disrupting terrorist infiltration of our borders. This bill \nrequires the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of \nState to strengthen the security provisions of the so-called visa \nwaiver program. It also authorizes an electronic travel system that \nwould require travelers to apply in advance for authorization to visit \nthe United States, thus allowing their names to be checked against \nterrorist watch lists.\n  I am very proud of the bill we present after almost 2 weeks of debate \nto our colleagues in the Senate for final consideration. I know it will \nstrengthen the homeland security of the American people. It enjoyed \nstrong nonpartisan support in our committee, coming out with a vote of \n16 to 0 with one abstention.\n  I gather there will be a significant number of ``no'' votes on the \nfinal passage because of one section, and I regret that. I wish our \ncolleagues would vote favorably because I know they support almost all \nof this bill because it is good for the security of the American people \nat home.\n  The one section, obviously, is the one that deals with the collective \nbargaining rights of transportation security officers. I sure hope we \ncan continue to discuss this section: why we think it is fair, why we \nare totally convinced its implementation will have no adverse effect on \npublic safety--no more than the collective bargaining rights of Capitol \nPolice officers or local firefighters or police officers or members of \nthe Border Patrol or other law enforcement agencies in the Department \nof Homeland Security in any way adversely affects the carrying out of \nthe duties to protect the American people.\n  Madam President, I also want to thank the chairman and ranking member \nof the Commerce Committee, Senators Inouye and Stevens, for producing \nthe rail and aviation security portions of this bill, and the chairman \nand ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senators Dodd and Shelby, \nwho contributed important mass transit security provisions.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't also thank the majority leader, Senator \nReid, for working with all of the committees involved to bring this \ncomprehensive measure before tbe Senate. We have had 2 weeks of often \nspirited debate, and votes on some important amendments. Now, I believe \nwe are ready to pass this bill, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to conference this measure with the House, and moving the \nlegislation onto the President's desk for signature.\n  September 11, 2001, was a tragedy of unspeakable proportions, and it \nis for the men and women who died in the terrorist attacks that we work \nto enact this legislation. The attacks changed the course of history \nfor our Nation and marked our nascent century as a new and dangerous \nera. Overnight, we became aware of our vulnerability to an enemy that \ndoesn't wear uniforms nor follows any traditional laws of combat. \nRather, they move silently among us, probing for weaknesses while \nplotting attacks on innocent civilians.\n  The families of those we lost on 9/11 have worked with us for years \nto get the 9/11 Commission recommendations implemented. I must thank \nthem as well for their steadfast and courageous advocacy often in the \nface of seemingly insurmountable odds. They worked with us to pass the \nbill that Senator McCain and I introduced to create the 9/11 \nCommission. They monitored the work of the 9/11 Commission, and \ntestified before its members. And then they helped us win the fight to \nimplement the Commission's recommendations in the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004.\n  In January, Senator Collins and I held a hearing on this legislation \nand heard from three family members who urged us to complete the job of \nenacting and implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. When \nwe pass this bill today, they will be watching. And they will know that \nthey had a hand in its success.\n  Senator Reid made adoption of this legislation a priority for this \nCongress. Here is why: This bill will strengthen our ability not just \nto respond to terrorist attacks but also to prepare our\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nFederal, State, and local governments to better respond to natural \ndisasters.\n  We are trying to create an ``all hazards'' approach that increases \nour homeland security against the threat of terrorist attack, but also \nprepares our government to respond better to natural disasters since it \nfailed to prepare or respond adequately to Hurricane Katrina.\n  How do we do this? Let me briefly describe a few of the provisions in \nthis bill.\n  First, we would improve information and intelligence sharing among \nFederal, State, and local officials. We know that before 9/11, \ndifferent agencies had different pieces of information that, had they \nbeen put together, should have aroused suspicion about the attack that \nwas to come. One of the most important innovations since 9/11 has been \nthe establishment of fusion centers to share information within and \nbetween States. This legislation would create standards for the fusion \ncenters, require the Department of Homeland Security to provide support \nand coordination, and authorize the assignment of homeland security \nintelligence analysts to the fusion centers to serve as conduits for \nsharing information. The legislation also encourages the elimination of \nthe ``need to know'' standard, which allows the information holder in a \ngiven Federal agency to control dissemination, and instead, encourages \na ``need to share'' standard--obviously with appropriate safeguards.\n  Second, this legislation provides support and resources to first \nresponders through a balanced and better funded Homeland Security Grant \nProgram. We would authorize over $3.1 billion for each of the next 3 \nyears for key grants to reverse a precipitous decline in funding for \nhomeland security over the past 4 years. We believe we have achieved a \nbalanced proposal that gives the vast majority of the money out based \non risk but still recognizes that risk is an art, not a science, and \nterrorists could strike anywhere. In an all-hazards approach, first \nresponders everywhere need assistance to protect not just against a \npotential terrorist attack but also against natural disasters.\n\n  Third, we will help first responders attain the interoperable \ncommunications we know they need to save lives. We have known of this \nproblem for decades, and on 9/11, when fire fighters and police \nofficers could not communicate with one another inside the World Trade \nCenter, hundreds of first responders lost their lives. So, we have \ncreated a grant program--authorized at $3.3 billion over 5 years--that \nwill require States to spend their grant money consistent with their \nstatewide communications interoperability plans and the National \nEmergency Communications Plan. In other words, their spending must be \npart of a statewide plan connected to the national plan.\n  Fourth, this legislation contains provisions to improve our ability \nto disrupt terrorist infiltration of our borders. It requires the \nDepartments of Homeland Security and State to strengthen the security \nof the visa waiver program, by requiring better reporting by foreign \ncountries in the visa waiver program of lost or stolen passports, \nrequiring countries to share information about prospective visitors who \nmay pose a threat to the U.S., and authorizing an electronic travel \nsystem that would require travelers to apply in advance for \nauthorization to visit the U.S., thus allowing their names to be \nchecked against terrorist watch lists.\n  Fifth, this bill moves to ensure that as we fight terrorism, we do \nnot trample on the rights of Americans we are pledged to defend. \nIncluded here are provisions to strengthen the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board by requiring its members to be confirmed by \nthe Senate and by giving the Board subpoena power through the Attorney \nGeneral.\n  This legislation also includes a provision similar to one I was \npleased to cosponsor in committee with Senator McCaskill that will \nensure Transportation Security Administration screeners--known as \nTransportation Security Officers--have the same employment rights as \nothers in TSA and throughout the Department of Homeland Security. There \nis no good reason to deny TSOs these rights. Other law enforcement \nofficers at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border \nProtection have these rights, with no negative effect on their \nperformance of their security mission. In fact, Capitol Police also \nenjoy these rights and protections. This is simply a question of \nequality.\n  So this is a comprehensive bill. There are many other worthy aspects \nthat I have not described. But I am convinced that, as a package, if \nthis legislation passes and becomes law, the American people will be \nsafer from the consequences of natural disasters, such as Hurricane \nKatrina, than they are today. And we will have done everything possible \nto make sure no other Americans suffer the loss that so many \nexperienced after the brutal terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n  In the preface to the 9/11 Report, Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman \nHamilton wrote, quoting here, ``We hope our report will encourage our \nfellow citizens to study, reflect--and act.''\n  We have studied. We have reflected. Now is the time to act to build a \nsafer and more secure America for the generations to come.\n  Finally, I would like to pay tribute to my dedicated and exceptional \nstaff, who have sacrificed nights, weekends, family time in the name of \na safer America.\n  I particularly want to thank my Homeland Security Committee staff \ndirector Mike Alexander for his leadership in expertly guiding this \nlegislation through drafting, markup, floor amendments, and onto final \npassage. I also want to thank the committee's deputy chief counsel \nKevin Landy, whose drive and attention to detail resulted in superior \nlegislation. Thanks also to Eric Anderson, Christian Beckner, Janet \nBurrell, Scott Campbell, Troy Cribb, Aaron Firoved, Elyse Greenwald, \nBeth Grossman, Seamus Hughes, Holly Idelson, Kristine Lam, Nate Lesser, \nJim Mcgee, Sheila Menz, Larry Novey, Deborah Parkinson, Leslie \nPhillips, Alistair Reader, Patricia Rojas, Laurie Rubenstein, Mary Beth \nSchultz, Adam Sedgewick, Todd Stein, Donny Williams, Jason Yanussi, and \nWes Young--all on my committee staff. And thanks to Purva Rawal, Vance \nSerchuk, and Cherrie Daniels on my personal office staff.\n  I must also thank Senator Collins' staff director Brandon Milhorn and \nthe Senator's entire staff for working with us to move this very \nimportant legislation.\n  But bottom line, thank you to our colleagues, thanks to the 9/11 \nCommission, thanks to the 9/11 families who have stuck with this \nmission to protect the American people from ever having to suffer the \ngrievous loss they did at the hands of terrorists on 9/11.\n  I hope our colleagues will join together across party lines to \nsupport this very nonpartisan homeland security measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me congratulate Chairman \nLieberman and Ranking Member Collins on their Herculean effort on this \nlegislation. I particularly commend our ranking member, Senator \nCollins, for fighting the good fight when there were some reservations \non our side about a major portion of this bill which will compel me to \nvote against the bill. I know Senator Collins made every effort to \nstrip the provision that I and others find so offensive, but \nregretfully the provision was not stripped.\n  In a few minutes the Senate will vote on final passage of Improving \nAmerica's Security Act of 2007. It has, as I indicated, some good \nfeatures. At its core, it seeks to improve America's security, but on \nbalance it would also do much to weaken it. I plan to vote against the \nbill, and I urge my Senate colleagues to do the same.\n  But, before I cast my vote, a little background. Many of our \nDemocratic friends spent last year campaigning on the claim that \nRepublicans ignored the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We \ndidn't. Of the Commission's 39 recommendations, we implemented 37. Nor \nare the remaining two recommendations at issue today. Both parties \nagree they should not be in the bill, so the two provisions that we did \nnot adopt of the 9/11 Commission, both sides agreed we should not \nadopt. So I will oppose this bill on the basis of my answer to a simple \nquestion: Does it weaken America's security or strengthen it? The \nanswer that I and many of\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\nmy colleagues have come with is, regretfully, the former.\n  This bill would weaken America's security because of a single \ndangerous provision, and that at the insistence of big labor that \nDemocrats include collective bargaining rights for airport security \nscreeners, rights that Congress has refused to give them in the past \nbecause of the impact it would have on our ability to react to \nterrorist threats.\n  Congress would not grant screeners collective bargaining rights back \nin 2002. We have had this debate before. We had it at the time of the \ncreation of the Department of Homeland Security--if it has a familiar \nring to it, to many of my colleagues, we chose not to adopt that \nprovision then, and we hopefully will not, ultimately, this time.\n\n  The difference is the Democrats are letting the fight play out. They \nare stretching it out based on a political calculation. They already \nknow how this showdown is going to end. The President threatened to \nveto any bill that makes airport security more like the department of \nmotor vehicles. So they are delaying passage knowing it won't be \naccepted, for an applause line down the road.\n  Republicans tried to inject meaning into this bill to include \nprovisions that would improve security. For example, we proposed an \namendment that would make it a crime to recruit terrorists, that would \nauthorize the deportation of suspected terrorists, that would make it \neasier to detain dangerous illegal aliens and would increase penalties \nfor people who cruelly call families of soldiers overseas and falsely \nreport their loved one has died. But our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle rejected all of those provisions, opting instead to pump \nfor big labor. They are turning their backs on their own campaign \npromises in the process by ignoring a key recommendation of the 9/11 \nCommission that the United States do everything in its power to \nconstrain terrorists' mobility.\n  TSA workers showed that mobility after the United Kingdom bombing \nthreat in August when they showed up for work that morning at 4 a.m. \nand they were briefed on the situation overseas and they immediately \nimplemented new protocols. Anyone who traveled to or from an American \nairport that day would not even have known anything had happened. The \nexecution was seamless. It was a different story in Great Britain, \nwhere collective bargaining is the norm. Dozens of flights were \ncanceled while new procedures were instituted. The Democrats know \nAmericans will not stand for that approach to terrorism in our country, \nbut they are counting on the President and the Republicans to stop it \nfor them. That way, they can call us obstructionists and get another \napplause line in the bargain and maybe even a headline or two. It is a \nshame because there are some good things in the bill, such as new \nperformance standards and auditing requirements for DHS grants. But we \nwill let them have their applause line.\n  Republicans have never played games with national security, and we \nare not going to start now. Therefore, I will vote against the bill, \nand for the sake of the American people and their continued security, I \nwould strongly urge my other colleagues to do the same, while saying \nonce again how much I commend the Senator from Maine for her efforts to \nget this bill in the proper form, and there are provisions in the bill \nnot as a result of any of the efforts of the ranking member of the \ncommittee. I commend her for her efforts but, regretfully, must oppose \nfinal passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this should be a time of celebration, not \na time of finger-pointing. In fact, the fact is, it is true that a \nnumber of recommendations the 9/11 Commission recommended we did do. \nBut, as you know, the Commissioners themselves graded the \nadministration on what needed to be done to implement the Commission's \nrecommendations. That is where we get into the Es, Fs, and incompletes. \nSo there is no question this legislation absolutely is totally \nnecessary.\n  Following the terrible attacks on September 11, our country turned to \na respected group of Democrats and Republicans, the 9/11 Commission, an \nindependent bipartisan Commission, to review the lessons of that tragic \nday and to find a better way to protect the homeland fight on the war \non terrorism. Under difficult circumstances, including a lack of \ncooperation, in instances, from the White House, the Commission did an \noutstanding job.\n  In July of 2004, it made a number of recommendations to Congress and \nthe administration about how best to secure America from al-Qaida and \nother terrorist groups. Their recommendations were commonsense \nsolutions. These commonsense solutions were designed to keep America \nsafe. But, unfortunately, over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, many of the \nCommission's recommendations have been ignored, and too many of our \ncommunities remain dangerously unprepared to prevent or respond to a \nterrorist attack.\n  Today, in a few minutes, the Senate will correct that mistake. We \nwill enhance the security of our transportation system at our ports. We \nwill provide America's first responders with the technology they need \nto communicate with each other when a Katrina or another terrorist \nattack strikes, and we will put new security requirements in place to \nkeep terrorists from traveling to the United States.\n  This is an important piece of legislation we are going to pass. We \nare going to pass it, as I said, in a short time. I thank Chairman \nLieberman and his ranking member, Senator Collins, for their efforts on \nthis bill.\n  I said before this legislation was taken up on the floor that we have \ntwo people who set the example for how you should legislate. They got \nalong well in their committee. When she was chairman, Senator Lieberman \nworked well with her, and it has worked the same way. I commend and \napplaud both of these legislators. They have done a tremendous job \ntrying to work through this issue. Anything that has been slowed down \nin this legislation has not been their fault--in fact, quite to the \ncontrary. They have worked tirelessly to bring this legislation here \ntoday so we can have this vote. They reported a strong bill out of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It has only been \nstrengthened by the amendment process before the full Senate over the \npast several days.\n  Now, we do not need to redebate the issue regarding collective \nbargaining. Collective bargaining has been in this country for a long \ntime, and it is here to stay. There is nothing in this piece of \nlegislation that is in any way going to impair the security of this \nNation.\n  I wish to thank the entire 9/11 Commission for their service, but \nespecially I wish to thank 9/11 Commissioner Tim Roemer and the 9/11 \nfamily, but especially Carol Ashley, Beverly Eckert, Mary Fetchet, and \nCarie Lemack, members of Families of September 11 and VOICES of \nSeptember 11th. Their input in this legislation has been essential. \nFormer Congressman Roemer spent time here on the Senate floor. No one \ncould ever accuse Congressman Roemer of being some wild-eyed liberal. \nHe is a moderate, and he is from the State of Indiana. He has worked \nvery hard on the Commission and to move this legislation forward. I \nunderline and underscore my appreciation for his input and also for the \nfamilies and the two letters they wrote during the debate. Their \nletters served as a reminder of what this legislation is about: \nprotecting America against terrorism. Our country will be safer, \nstronger, and more secure as a result of their efforts.\n\n  The first responsibility of Government is to protect our people--the \npeople of Colorado, the people of Nevada, the people of Maine, the \npeople of Connecticut, Alabama, Nebraska, and Missouri. The Senators \nare here assembled, everyone in their seats. Our No. 1 job is to \nprotect our people. By passing the legislation today, we will help \nensure the Senate meets its obligation, and we will, once and for all, \nwrite the lesson of that terrible September 11 day into law.\n  In their report to the Nation, the 9/11 Commission wrote, ``The men \nand women of the World War II generation rose to the challenges of the \n1940s and the 1950s. They restructured the government so it could \nprotect the country. That is now the job of the generations that \nexperienced 9/11.''\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\n  That is what the legislation is all about.\n  Again, I applaud and commend the two managers of the bill, those who \noffered amendments and debated the issue. This is good legislation, \ngood for the country. It makes America a better place. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this legislation so we can take another step to \nfulfilling the directives we were given by the 9/11 Commission.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that a list of the homeland \nsecurity staffers on the Republican side who worked so hard on this \nbill be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Brandon Milhorn, Andy Weis, Rob Strayer, Amy Hall, Allison \n     Boyd, Kate Alford, John Grant, Amanda Wood, Jennifer Tarr, \n     Asha Mathew, Brooke Hayes, Priscilla Henley, Jane Alonso, Jay \n     Meroney, Melvin Albritton, Mark LeDuc, Tom Bishop, Doug \n     Campbell, Emily Meeks, and Neil Cutter.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I also wish to add my voice in thanks to the families of \nthe victims of 9/11. They have truly been the committee's inspiration \nas we worked on these issues for the last 4 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of all Members, we are working--Senator \nMcConnell and I--on a consent agreement to deal with the Iraq debate \ntomorrow. Hopefully, we will be able to resolve the Iraq debate. \nThursday, we will be able to deal with the U.S. attorneys bill and some \njudicial nominees. We do not have that worked out yet, so everyone stay \ntuned.\n  This will be the last vote today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The bill having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to finish the discussion I \nstarted earlier today about the tax gap and efforts to close it. As I \nsaid this morning, the tax gap is the difference between what is paid \nin taxes and what is actually owed. While more reliable and timely data \non the tax gap is greatly needed, the tax gap was thought to be $345 \nbillion for the tax year 2001, which seemed to be the year that the IRS \nhad the latest information where they could put together something that \nwas fairly solid for that year.\n  I also pointed out this morning that many of my colleagues in the \nSenate see the tax gap as a sort of magical tonic that can be used to \ncure all sorts of ailments. Some people see $345 billion in AMT relief \nor health care spending or national debt reduction without thinking \nabout what would be involved in actually collecting the money. So I am \nraising the question: Do people think through whether every dollar will \nbe brought into the Federal Treasury?\n  The IRS is already making some progress in closing the tax gap. This \nmorning I mentioned the Internal Revenue Service told the Budget \nCommittee it could reduce the tax gap by nearly $70 billion, of that \n$345 billion, in the year 2007.\n  So where does that leave us? Can we do more in enforcement? The \nadministration has proposed an increase in funding for the Internal \nRevenue Service. That increase looks toward the tax gap with funds \ndirected toward increased data matching, improved research, as well as \nmore auditors--auditors to make sure that more money comes in. I \nsuggest my colleagues might also want to make certain that if we \nconsider adding more Internal Revenue Service employees, we have \ngreater confidence that the Internal Revenue Service is utilizing \ncurrent resources effectively. In other words, before we hire more \npeople, we ought to make sure the existing employees at the Internal \nRevenue Service are being used in the most efficient way to bring in \nthe most money possible.\n  That doesn't preclude more money, but that is a necessary first step \nbefore we automatically think of more money and more employees.\n  For instance, the IRS has hundreds of employees, according to a \nTreasury inspector general for tax administration report, that do part- \nor full-time union work. This is thousands and thousands of work hours \nthat could be spent going after the tax gap. What could we gain if we \ndirected all those union hours to actually working on the tax gap \nbefore we appropriate more money to hire more employees?\n  So we have proposals then for increased enforcement. Let me remind my \ncolleagues, though, that the Joint Committee on Taxation--that is a \ncongressional committee that specializes in watching the Tax Code and \nmaking estimates and studying all ways to make the Tax Code more \nefficient and bring in more money--that committee will not give us a \nscore for additional dollars based on increased enforcement. So we can \ntalk all we want about hiring more people to bring in more revenue, but \nuntil that revenue is in the bank, the Joint Committee on Taxation \nisn't going to give us any credit for it.\n  As we are looking at budget debates over this week and next week, \nkeep that in mind. That isn't going to get Senators anywhere in terms \nof reducing projected deficits or paying for tax cuts or bringing in \nmore money to spend someplace else.\n  It is important to emphasize the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\nService made it clear to the Budget Committee a few days ago at a \nhearing that we cannot audit our way out of the tax gap. The \nCommissioner also warned about increasing the IRS budget too quickly if \nwe decide to go the route of hiring more people by giving more money \nbecause he said a big increase in staffing would harm taxpayers' rights \nif the IRS was not able to grow in a managed way to control the \noutcome.\n  We can look at what we can possibly do legislatively beyond greater \nenforcement. The Democratic leadership hasn't proposed anything new, \nbut the administration has put forward some proposals in the budget--in \nits own budget, meaning the budget of the executive branch. Many of the \nadministration's proposals deal with information reporting. Information \nreporting is an important way to improve tax compliance. This is very \nclear from all the work that has been done so far on the tax gap.\n  However, information reporting places additional burdens on \ntaxpayers, and it is very frustrating that we often find the Internal \nRevenue Service is not doing enough to match or review the documents \ntaxpayers are already providing the IRS as a paper trail to make sure \nall taxes are paid. Needless to say, this greatly limits the benefit \ninformation reporting provides.\n  Setting these concerns aside, the administration in their budget has \nproposed, one, information reporting on payment to corporations; two, \nbasis reporting on securities sales; three, broker reporting; four, \nreporting of merchant payment card reimbursement; five, increase \ninformation return penalties; six, taxpayer identification number \nverification for independent contractors; and seven, information \nreporting on certain Government payments.\n\n  The administration has proposed other proposals, including increased \npenalties, expanded IRS access to information, and required electronic \nfiling as some of the other new proposals.\n  This is a very comprehensive list of proposals coming from the \nadministration. Is it everything? No, but it seems to me this is a \nserious start and shows that people within Treasury, within the Office \nof Management and Budget, and maybe even within the White House, are \nvery concerned about closing the tax gap.\n  If Senators who have attacked the Secretary of Treasury and the \nInternal Revenue Service believe more can be done, I suggest they \nshould come forward with their own proposals and add to the multitude I \nread coming from the executive branch of Government.\n  I think Senators will find that while it is easy to complain about \nwhat is coming out of the Treasury's kitchen, it is a lot harder to get \nin there and do it themselves. I think Senators need to be careful--\nvery careful--at putting out pie-in-the-sky numbers for what can be \nachieved by reducing the tax gap without at the same time putting \nforward their own detailed, concrete, Joint Tax Committee-scored \nproposals that show how it can be done.\n  That brings me to a chart. This chart shows there is a lot of smoke \nand mirrors when it comes to the tax gap, in other words, all the \npeople who are saying they are going to use the tax gap to reduce the \ndeficit, to fund tax cuts or even to take the money and spend it on \nsome new program or increase spending on existing programs. There are a \nlot of ideas out there.\n  What I want this chart to demonstrate to us is that there is a lot of \nsmoke and mirrors when it comes to the tax gap. We can't use smoke and \nmirrors to pay for tax cuts or to decrease the deficit; we have to have \nproposals that are in detail, black and white, and are scored by the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, our experts who are on top of the Tax Code \nand how much money will come in or how much money we lose if we cut \ntaxes.\n  Tax gap proposals shouldn't be used for spending. The tax gap is \nappropriately viewed as unfairly placing a heavier burden on compliant \ntaxpayers, 85 percent of the people who pay what they owe and file \naccordingly.\n  If we enact tax-gap closers, they should be used to reduce taxes or \nreduce the deficit, not to increase spending.\n  Let me conclude my discussion of the tax gap by saying you can have a \nblue Moon, you can have blue cheese, you can have blue-suede shoes, but \nwhen it comes to balancing the budget, you can't do it with blue smoke \nand mirrors. That, unfortunately, is what so much of the tax gap is \nright now: blue smoke.\n  I strongly encourage the Budget Committee chairman and other Senators \nnot to use blue smoke during the upcoming budget resolution debates. \nThat is going to happen Wednesday and Thursday in the Budget Committee \nthis week. It is going to happen all next week on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Now I will review some of the issues we must consider as the Senate \nworks on its budget resolution. In an earlier visit with my colleagues \nin the Senate, I discussed the importance of preventing a tax hike on \nthe American people. Anyone who considers themselves a deficit hawk \nneeds to do more than raise taxes. So I challenge the new Democratic \nmajority to also examine the spending side of the ledger; that is, if \nthey are truly serious about deficit reduction.\n  In another visit with my colleagues from the floor of the Senate, I \nhighlighted a study prepared by Goldman Sachs. That study shows that \nthe likely result of letting tax relief expire could lead to a \nrecession. Since tax relief was enacted, Federal revenues have \nincreased, employment has increased, household wealth has increased--in \nfact, household wealth has increased to the highest level it has ever \nbeen in the history of our country--and the S 500 index has \nconsistently moved upward. Again, a failure to extend tax relief or \nmake it permanent puts all this at risk, and at risk for nothing.\n  Anyone serious about deficit reduction needs to also look, then, at \nthe spending side of the ledger. In a third visit that I had with my \ncolleagues from the Senate floor, I pointed out that Democratic revenue \nraisers did not come close to covering new spending contained in \nDemocratic amendments when we had the budget up exactly 12 months ago \nthis month. In many cases, I showed the same offset was used in \nmultiple amendments to pay for multiple projects, just like every \ndollar coming into the Federal Treasury could be spent two, three, four \ntimes, and somehow just multiply and, like blue smoke, solve all of our \nproblems.\n  If the Democratic leadership is serious about pay-go, and that is \nshort for pay as you go, and if they are serious about deficit \nreduction, they need to be realistic about where the money is going to \ncome from to cover any new spending proposals. The budget plan \nadvocated by the other side last year would have either increased the \ndeficit or gutted tax relief that was passed in 2001 and 2003, \nincluding items such as the alternative minimum tax fix that we did, \nand all of these things the other side of the aisle claims to support \nand yet have proposals that would gut them or increase the deficit.\n  I want to state my intention to fully cooperate with my colleagues of \nboth parties to produce a budget that preserves our growing economy \nwhile addressing the needs of our government. I am particularly looking \nforward to exploring ways to use the Tax Code to help more Americans \nacquire health insurance. I am also looking forward to using the budget \nresolution to ensure, on a revenue-neutral basis, that we continue to \npursue tax simplification and tax reform. In order to produce the best \npossible budget, we must be careful not to endanger our growing \neconomy. We must be willing to examine spending. We must not just focus \non revenues, and in the whole process, we have to be intellectually \nhonest about how far we can push revenue raisers and other offsets. In \nother words, avoid the smoke and mirrors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for his remarks \nand would share his concerns that we have to be intellectually honest \nabout the numbers with which we are dealing. We are not going to be \nable to have the kind of revenue collection enhancement that some have \nsuggested is possible. I wish it were so. I pay my taxes. Most people \npay their taxes. It is\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\nnot right for people to cheat on their taxes. It cheats all of us when \nthat occurs. From experience, we know that we can't get that big of an \nenhancement, at least that is what the experts tell us. We cannot get \nthe enhancement from collections that some have suggested that we can. \nThey will use monies projected to be collected--that is, they will say \nwe are going to collect a lot more to justify spending--and then when \nthe revenue doesn't come in, all we have done is increase the debt.\n  So that is a problem and I am pleased Senator Grassley has raised it \nand we might as well deal with it openly.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sessions pertaining to the introduction of S. 863 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it is only Tuesday, and already we have a \nlaundry list this week of reasons why we need a new direction for trade \npolicy in our country.\n  First, we learned that Halliburton, the beneficiary of more than $20 \nbillion in no-bid Government contracts, is going to, in a sense, take \nthe money and run by moving its headquarters out of the United States \nand to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Then we learned the United \nStates is again discussing trade deals with the United Arab Emirates. \nThese trade talks first fell apart last year during the Dubai Ports \nWorld scandal.\n  Because of our fundamentally flawed trade policy, our Government \nnearly sold our port security to state-owned companies in the Middle \nEast, and because of our fundamentally flawed trade policy, our \nGovernment continued to award no-bid contracts to Halliburton despite \nthe fact that its subsidiaries have come under fire for doing business \nwith the Government of Iran and for potential contract fraud in Iraq. \nIt is time for a trade policy that rewards good corporate citizens, not \none that allows our Nation's security assets to be sold to the highest \nbidder.\n  Last November, in my home State of Ohio, voters from Toledo to \nSteubenville, from Chillicothe to Lorain, from Dayton to Youngstown \nspoke out for change in our Nation's trade policy.\n  For too long, our Government has stood idly by as U.S. companies that \nbenefit from our tax policy, that get Government contracts, that \nbenefit from community support move their operations overseas. For too \nlong, our Government has pursued fundamentally flawed trade agreements \nthat fail to secure labor and other standards, fail to establish a \npolicy to support business development at home, and fail to provide for \nnational security reviews.\n  But in this Congress, a new direction has begun. Thirty Members, last \nweek, of a fair trade coalition, that began with the Central American \nFree Trade Agreement, gathered on Capitol Hill to reaffirm that we need \na new direction for trade. Senator Dorgan, Senator Graham, and I have \nintroduced legislation that would ban sweatshop imports and address \nconcerns with China.\n  What is more distressing than Halliburton's news to abandon the \nUnited States for the Mideast is that it owes the Government at least \n$2.7 billion as a result of bad, possibly even illegal business \npractices in Iraq--practices which allowed for contaminated water to be \nserved to our troops, which hired unauthorized security forces, and \nwhich shamelessly overcharged our Government. Will Halliburton pay \ntheir debt before leaving town or will they try to leave American \ntaxpayers--who have already afforded them billions in profits--holding \nthe bag? Congress must do all it can to assess the debt and ensure that \nHalliburton, before they leave town, pays their debt to our country.\n  It is unclear whether the administration will take any action to \nsafeguard our Nation's interests when it comes to Halliburton, but it \nis clear they are not yet ready for a new direction on trade. The \nlatest attempt at another flawed trade agreement is not even inked, and \nthe first corporation is moving offshore.\n  That is why we need a new direction for trade. That is why we need a \ntrade policy that rewards companies that keep production, and \nheadquarters, in the United States, investing at home as well as in \nopportunities abroad. That is why, as we learned during the Dubai Ports \nscandal, we need a national security review of all future trade \nagreements.\n  Halliburton's decision to relocate its headquarters also underscores \nthe critical importance of freeing our Nation from its addiction to \noil.\n  Government should foster a climate where companies are rewarded for \nbeing good patriot corporations. It is time our Government stop \nrewarding the Halliburtons of the world and start investing in those \nbusinesses that want to help build our Nation, not cheat us and then \nleave us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/13/senate-section/article/S3060-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3060-S3061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF VACLAV HAVEL\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, 30 years ago, the Charter 77 movement was \nestablished with the simple goal of ensuring that the citizens of \nCzechoslovakia could ``live and work as free human beings.'' Today, as \ncochairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I \njoin with my colleagues in celebrating the founding of Charter 77 and \nhonoring those men and women who, through their personal acts of \ncourage, helped bring freedom to their country.\n  When the Charter 77 manifesto was issued, three men were chosen to be \nthe first spokespersons of this newly formed movement: a renowned \nEuropean philosopher, Jan Patocka; Jiri Hajek, who had been \nCzechoslovakia's Foreign Minister during the Prague Spring; and the \nplaywright, Vaclav Havel. They had the authority to speak for the \nmovement and to issue documents on behalf of signatories.\n  Tragically, Jan Patocka paid with his life for his act of bravery and \ncourage. After signing the charter and meeting with Dutch Ambassador \nMax van der Stoel, he was subjected to prolonged interrogation by the \nsecret police. It is widely believed this interrogation triggered a \nheart attack, resulting in his death on March 13, 1977.\n  In spite of the chilling message from the regime, Jiri Hajek and \nVaclav Havel continued to work with other chartists, at tremendous \npersonal cost. Two-hundred and thirty signatories were called in for \ninterrogation; 50 houses were subjected to searches. Many supporters \nlost their jobs or faced other forms of persecution; many were sent to \nprison. In fact, the harsh treatment of the Charter 77 signatories led \nto the creation of another human rights group, the Committee for the \nDefense of the Unjustly Persecuted, known by its Czech acronym, VONS. \nIn October 1979, six VONS leaders including Vaclav Havel, were tried \nfor subversion and sentenced to prison terms of up to 5 years.\n  Perhaps the regime's harsh tactics reflected its knowledge that, \nultimately, it could only retain control through force and coercion. \nCertainly, there was no perestroika or glasnost in Husak's \nCzechoslovakia, no goulash communism as in neighboring Hungary. And so, \nthe regime was threatened by groups that might have seemed \ninconsequential elsewhere: by the psychedelic band, ``Plastic People of \nthe Universe;'' by a musical appreciation group known as the Jazz \nSection; by environmentalists, historians, philosophers and, of course, \nplaywrights.\n  Mr. President, 1989 was an extraordinary year--a year in which the \nregime sought to control everything and, in the end, could control \nnothing. In May, Hungary opened its borders. In June, free elections \nwere held for parliamentary seats in Poland for the first time in \ndecades. By August, 5,000 East Germans were fleeing to Austria through \nHungary every single week.\n\n[[Page S3061]]\n\nDemonstrations in East Germany continued to rise, forcing Eric Honecker \nto resign in October. On November 9, the Berlin Wall was breached.\n  But while Communist leaders in other countries saw the writing on the \nwall, authorities in Prague continued to believe they could somehow \ncling to power. Ironically, the regime's repressive tactics were part \nof its final undoing.\n  On November 17, 1989, significant student demonstrations were held in \nPrague. Human rights groups released videotapes of police and militia \nviciously beating the demonstrators and these tapes were rapidly and \nwidely circulated through the underground. Shortly thereafter, VONS \nreceived credible information that a student demonstrator had been \nbeaten to death. The alleged death so outraged Czechoslovak society \nthat it triggered massive demonstrations. Within days, Czechoslovakia's \nCommunist regime collapsed like a house of cards.\n  As it turned out, no one had actually been killed during the November \n17 protests; the story of the student death had been concocted by the \nsecret police to discredit VONS but was all too believable. As \nconcisely stated by Mary Battiata, a reporter for the Washington Post, \n``. . . a half-baked secret police plan to discredit a couple of \ndissidents apparently boomeranged and turned a sputtering student \nprotest into a national rebellion.'' On December 29, Vaclav Havel--who \nhad been in prison just a few months earlier--was elected President of \nCzechoslovakia by the Federal Parliament.\n  Jan Patocka once wrote, ``The real test of a man is not how well he \nplays the role he has invented for himself but how well he plays the \nrole that destiny assigned to him.'' It seems that destiny had a \nparticular role for Vaclav Havel, not one that he invented or \nenvisioned for himself, but one that he has played with courage and \ngrace, with dignity and honor. Today, we honor Vaclav Havel and the \nCharter 77 movement he helped to found.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/13/senate-section/article/S3061-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       IN MEMORY OF ERNEST GALLO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the memory of the late Ernest Gallo, a true American \nsuccess story who came from a humble beginning to head the world's \nlargest winemaking company. Mr. Gallo passed away in the peaceful \ncompany of his family and loved ones at his home in Modesto, California \non March 6, 2007. He was 97 years old.\n  The first son of Joseph and Susie Gallo, immigrants who hailed from \nItaly's renowned winemaking region of Piedmont, Ernest Gallo was born \nin Jackson, in the Sierra Nevada foothills region of California. Ernest \nand his younger brothers, Julio and Joe, gained important insight into \nthe winemaking business by working alongside their father in the family \nvineyard. As a precocious and driven 17-year-old boy, Ernest sold a \nrailcar full of family grapes during a trip to Chicago for $17,000, a \nconsiderable sum of money during those days. From that point forward, \nit was apparent that Ernest was a gifted and determined entrepreneur \nwho was destined for great success in the winemaking business.\n  After his parents unexpectedly passed away, Ernest accepted the \nmantle of the head of the business and the family at the age of 24 and \nfounded E. and J. Gallo Winery in 1933 using a $5,000 loan from \nErnest's mother-in-law and his brother Julio's entire savings of less \nthan $1,000. Throughout his stewardship of the winery that would become \none of the world's most prolific and recognized winemaking companies, \nErnest consistently demonstrated an unparalleled ability to produce \naffordable, popular, and high quality products.\n  A wine connoisseur in the truest sense of the word, Ernest was a \nperfectionist who left his imprint on nearly every aspect of the \nwinemaking process; from overseeing production, to devising brilliant \nmarketing plans, to regularly traveling across the country to make sure \nthat wine displays were properly presented in markets. Simply put, \nErnest was a consummate winemaker who was absolutely dedicated to \nhoning and perfecting his craft.\n  Ernest Gallo has left behind a legacy of success and the well-\ndeserved recognition as one of the leading figures of American \nwinemaking. This son of California's Central Valley will be greatly \nmissed.\n  Ernest Gallo was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 62 years, \nAmelia, and son, David. He is survived by his son, Joseph, and four \ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/13/senate-section/article/S3061-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING LARRY NELSON\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor in the \nRecord of the Senate the induction of my friend and a wonderful \nGeorgian, Larry Nelson of Marietta, to the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n  Larry was born on September 10, 1947, in Ft. Payne, AL, and was \nraised in Acworth, GA. Growing up, he preferred baseball and \nbasketball. It wasn't until after he returned from military service in \nVietnam that he actually swung a golf club. The first time he played he \nbroke 100. Within 9 months of taking up the game in earnest, Larry \nbroke 70.\n  In 1973, Larry successfully went through the PGA Tour Qualifying \nSchool, and his breakthrough came in 1979 when he won twice on the tour \nand finished second on the money list. In 1981, Larry won the PGA \nChampionship at the Atlantic Athletic Club by four strokes over Fuzzy \nZoeller. In 1983, he won his second major, the U.S. Open, at one of the \ntoughest championship courses in the world, Oakmont Country Club just \noutside of Pittsburgh. And in 1987, Larry repeated his victory in the \nPGA Championship with a playoff victory over Lanny Wadkins at PGA \nNational Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. In addition, he played on \nthe U.S. Ryder Cup team in 1979, 1981, and 1987.\n  I have known Larry for almost 40 years. In fact, I sold him a house \nwhen he was first starting out. It is also a huge point of pride that I \nam a member of the Atlanta Country Club where Larry Nelson plays today. \nHowever, Larry is more than a terrific golfer. He is also a wonderful \nhusband and father as well as a devout Christian.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to \nrecognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate the contributions of my \nfriend Larry Nelson. He is an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/13/senate-section/article/S3061-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:48 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 342.

A bill to promote accessibility, accountability, and openness \nin Government by strengthening section 552 of title 5, United States \nCode (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Cornyn in \nreintroducing the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National \nGovernment Act'', the ``OPEN Government Act''. This bill contains \ncommonsense reforms to update and strengthen the Freedom of Information \nAct (FOIA) for all Americans.\n  Last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported an \nessentially identical bill. Sadly, the full Senate did not consider \nthis legislation before it adjourned last year. But, I hope that the \nSenate will do its part to reinvigorate FOIA this year, by promptly \npassing this bill.\n  During my three decades in the Senate, I have devoted a considerable \nportion of my work to improving government openness, to make our \ngovernment work better for the American people. At times, this has been \na lonely effort. But, for the past 4 years, I have been delighted to \nhave Senator Cornyn as a partner on this important issue. I thank him \nfor his leadership on preserving and strengthening FOIA.\n  Now in its fourth decade, the Freedom of Information Act remains an \nindispensable tool in shedding light on bad policies and government \nabuses. But, today, FOIA also faces challenges like never before. \nDuring the past 6 years, the Bush administration has allowed lax FOIA \nenforcement and a near obsession with secrecy to undercut the public's \nright to know. As we celebrate Sunshine Week this week, there is urgent \nneed to update and strengthen our FOIA law.\n  Chief among the problems with FOIA is the major delays encountered by \nFOIA requestors. According to a report by the National Security \nArchive, an independent nongovernmental research institute, the oldest \noutstanding FOIA requests date back to 1989--before the collapse of the \nSoviet Union. And, while the number of FOIA requests submitted each \nyear continues to rise, our Federal agencies remain unable--or \nunwilling--to keep up with the demand. Just recently, the Government \nAccountability Office found that Federal agencies had 43 percent more \nFOIA requests pending and outstanding in 2006, than they had in 2002.\n  Although the Bush administration has taken modest steps to address \nthe growing problem with FOIA delays, that effort has not done nearly \nenough to correct lax FOIA enforcement by Federal agencies. More than a \nyear after the President's directive to Government agencies to improve \ntheir FOIA services, Americans who seek information under FOIA remain \nless likely to obtain it. For example, a recent study by the Coalition \nof Journalists for Open Government found that the percentage of FOIA \nrequestors who obtained at least some of the information that they \nrequested from the Government fell by 31 percent last year. These and \nother shortcomings with the President's FOIA policy demonstrate that \nthe Congress must play an important role in preserving and \nstrengthening FOIA.\n\n  The legislation that Senator Cornyn and I introduce today takes \nseveral important steps to help Americans obtain timely responses to \ntheir FOIA requests and to provide government officials with the tools \nthat they need to ensure that our government remains open and \naccessible. First, our bill restores meaningful deadlines for agency \naction by ensuring that the 20-day statutory clock runs immediately \nupon the receipt of the request and the bill impose real consequences \non Federal agencies for missing statutory deadlines. Our bill also \nclarifies that FOIA applies to agency records that are held by outside \nprivate contractors, no matter where these records are located.\n  In addition, our bill establishes a FOIA hotline service for all \nFederal agencies, either by telephone or on the Internet, to enable \nrequestors to track the status of their FOIA requests. Finally, our \nbill enhances the agency reporting requirements under FOIA and improves \npersonnel policies for FOIA officials to enhance agency FOIA \nperformance.\n  This legislation was drafted after a long and thoughtful process of \nconsultation with individuals and organizations that rely on FOIA to \nobtain information and share it with the public, including the news \nmedia, librarians, and public interest organizations representing all \nfacets of the political spectrum.\n  This legislation also reaffirms the fundamental premise of FOIA--that \ngovernment information belongs to all Americans. Again, I thank Senator \nCornyn for the time and effort that he has devoted to reinvigorating \nFOIA, and I urge all Senators to join us in supporting this important \nopen government legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 852.

A bill to redesignate the project for navigation, Saco River, \nMaine, as an anchorage area; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a series of \nbills that are important to economic development along our long \ncoastline. Most of these bills were either included in the Water \nResources Development Act (WRDA) of 2006 or has passed the Senate as a \nstand-alone bill. Unfortunately, much to my great disappointment, the \nlarger Corps of Engineers reauthorization legislation did not see \naction before the Senate adjourned the 109th Congress. My hope is that \nall of these noncontroversial bills will be included in the WRDA \nlegislation in the 110th Congress.\n  Importantly, all of my bills are supported by the various townspeople \nand their officials, and State officials, who view these harbor \ndeauthorizations and river improvements as engines for economic \ndevelopment. The bills also have the support of the New England \nDistrict of the Corps of Engineers.\n  The first bill pertains to Tenants Harbor, St. George, ME. \nDeauthorizing the Federal Navigation Channel (FNC) would be of great \nhelp to the town in appropriately managing the Harbor to maximize \nmooring areas. Over the years there have been mounting problems with \nthe Army Corps of Engineers' mooring permit process as people seeking \npermits for moorings that have existed for 30 years continue to be \nnotified that the mooring locations are prohibited because they fall \nwithin the federal navigational channel.\n  My second bill concerns Northeast Harbor in Mt. Desert, ME. The \nlanguage will not only allow for more recreational moorages and \ncommercial activities, it will also be an economic boost to Northeast \nHarbor, which is surrounded by Acadia National Park, one of the \nNation's most visited parks--both by land and by water. The removal of \nthe harbor from the FNC will allow the town to adapt to the high demand \nfor moorings and will allow residents to obtain moorings in a more \ntimely manner. The Harbor has now reached capacity for both moorings \nand shoreline facilities and has a waiting list of over sixty people, \nalong with commercial operators who have been waiting for years to \nobtain a mooring for their commercial vessels.\n  My third bill addresses the Union River in Ellsworth, ME. The bill \nsupports the city of Ellsworth's efforts to revitalize the Union River \nnavigation channel, harbor, and shoreline. The modification called for \nin my legislation will redesignate a portion of the Union River as an \nanchorage area. This redesignation will allow for a greater number of \nmoorings in the harbor without interfering with navigation and will \nfurther improve the City's revitalization efforts for the harbor area.\n  My fourth bill, that passed the Senate as a stand-alone bill last \nyear, will make the mooring of an historic windjammer fleet in Rockland \nHarbor a reality. Originally a strong fishing port, Rockland retains \nits rich marine heritage, and it is one of the fastest growing cities \nin the Mid-coast area. Like many of the port cities on the eastern \nseaboard, Rockland has been forced to confront an assortment of \nfinancial and environmental changes, but happily, the city has been \nable to respond to these challenges in positive and productive ways.\n  The City of Rockland has hosted the Windjammer fleet since 1955, \nearning a well-deserved reputation as the Windjammer Capital of the \nWorld. Rockland's Windjammers are now National Historic Landmarks, and \nas such, are vitally important to both the city and the State. The \nimage of The Victory Chimes, one of five vessels slated to be berthed \nat the new wharf and a vessel whose historical designation I supported, \ngraces the Maine quarter. This beautiful fleet of windjammers \nsymbolizes the great seagoing history of Maine as well as the sense of \nadventure that we have come to associate so closely with the American \nexperience.\n  Lermond Cove is perfectly situated in the Rockland Harbor to be the \nnew and permanent home for these cherished vessels. The proposed \nWindjammer Wharf will also provide a safe harbor from storms, as it is \ntucked nicely near the Maine State Ferry and Department of Marine \nResources piers.\n  The State of Maine capitalizes on the visual impact of the \nWindjammers to promote tourism, working waterfronts and the natural \nbeauty that distinguishes our landscape. Over $300,000 is spent yearly \nby the Maine Windjammer Association to advertise and promote these \nbusinesses. Deauthorizing that part of the Federal navigational channel \nwill clearly trigger significant and unrealized economic benefits for \nthe region, providing many beneficial dollars to the local area and the \nState of Maine. According to the Longwood study, which uses a \nmultiplier of 1.5, the economic impact of this spending is 3.8 million \ndollars a year. Conservatively, the Windjammers spend over 2.5 million \ndollars a year in the state.\n  I want to thank the New England Corps of Engineers for their help in \ndrafting the language and working with the Maine Department of \nTransportation, which runs the ferry line, and also the Rockland city \nofficials, the Rockland Port District, and the Captains of the \nWindjammer vessels--Mainers and business people with the vision and \ncommitment needed to complete Windjammer Wharf and create a permanent \nhome for this historic fleet of windjammers in Rockland Harbor.\n  I am reintroducing my fifth bill for the Town of Rockport--this \nrequest came in after the Environment and Public Works Committee passed \nout the WRDA bill in the last Congress. It would deauthorize a part of \nthe Federal Navigation Channel in Rockport Harbor. The town, located on \nthe active Mid-Coast of Maine, has requested that Congress decommission \na 35 foot by 275 foot area directly adjacent to the bulkhead at Marine \nPark. With this deauthorization, the Town will be able to install \npermanent pilings to secure a set of new municipal floats, which would \nreplace the current temporary float system.\n  My sixth bill for reintroduction today is a bill for the City of \nSaco, Maine that concerns the town's ability to allow the mooring of \nboats on the Saco River. The bill changes the turning basin into an \nanchorage while managing a 50-foot channel within the anchorage. The \ntown was not aware that it was in violation because of 21 moorings \nlocated in the Saco River Federal Navigational Project. In an effort to \neliminate this encroachment, city officials have requested a \nmodification or de-authorization of the Federal Navigational Project to \nresolve the issue.\n  The US Army Corps of Engineers suggested language that re-designates \nthe maneuvering basin into an anchorage area that will meet the needs \nof the community. The language will allow for the legal moorage of \nboats, the fairway for which would be maintained by the city of Saco as \nis customary for towns with Federal anchorages. The two mayors of the \ncities involved along with the Saco Yacht Club have agreed to the \nCorps' language.\n  It is my hope that all of these non-controversial provisions will be \nincluded in the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 and I am \nwriting Senator Boxer, the new Chairwoman of the EPW Committee \nrequesting inclusion of my bills in the upcoming WRDA bill. I am \npleased to hear that she is also anxious for the WRDA bill to move \nforward just as quickly as possible. It has been six long years since \nour last WRDA bill was signed into law--much too long even for the \npatient people in Maine who want to urgently move forward on economic \ndevelopment for their coastal communities.\n  Also, I am pleased to be cosponsoring a bill with Senator Collins \nthat addresses the project for the mitigation of shore damage at Camp \nEllis, ME. The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Army to carry out \nthe project, under the River and Harbor Act of 1968, to mitigate shore \ndamage attributable to the Saco River navigational project, waiving the \nfunding cap requirement for congressional authorization set forth in \nthat Act. The legislation is needed to complete the project as it will \ncost more than authorized under current law, and is the preferred \nproject by non-Federal interests.\n  Studies have shown that the Army Corps jetty, built over 100 years \nago, has contributed to beach erosion and the loss of more than thirty \nhouses to the sea. The houses in danger currently were once six rows \nback from the water. When the mitigation project is completed, it is \nhoped that it will protect the residents, households, and businesses \nalong the shoreline adjacent to the Army Corps jetty in Saco.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        menendez, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Sanders):\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\n  S. 858. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe transportation fringe benefit to bicycle commuters; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, about the most red, white and blue, \npatriotic action our Nation could take is to develop a new energy \npolicy that reduces our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. And the \nbiggest source of our oil dependence is transportation--the cars, \ntrucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) that our citizens drive every \nday.\n  That's why I am pleased to be introducing a bill that will help \ncitizens who want to do their part to reduce oil dependence by \ncommuting to work by bicycle. I am joined in sponsoring the Bicycle \nCommuters Benefits Act of 2007 by Senators Snowe, Collins, Durbin, \nMenendez, Inouye, Enzi and Sanders.\n  I know that many people in our country want to do something concrete \nabout our Nation's dependence on oil and gas. As gas prices continue to \nclimb again this spring, more and more people are going to be looking \nfor actions that they can take to free themselves from this dependency. \nThe bill I am introducing today gives Americans more incentive to give \nup the cars and trucks that they drive to and from work every day and \nget on their bicycles instead.\n  According to recent Census reports, more than 500,000 people \nthroughout the United States commute to work by bicycle. They are \nfreeing themselves from sitting in traffic. They are saving energy and \novercoming their dependence on oil and gas. They are getting exercise; \navoiding obesity and helping us keep our air clean and safe to breathe.\n  Yet, they are commuting by bicycle at their own expense. Their fellow \nemployees who take mass transit to and from work have an incentive \ncreated in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century that \nenables their employers to pay for their bus or subway ride. And those \nwho commute to work by car or truck can receive tax-free parking \nbenefits provided by their employers. These incentives are great for \nmass transit commuters or those who drive to work. But they also create \na financial disincentive for those riding their bikes to and from their \njobs. The Bicycle Commuters Benefits Act of 2007 will eliminate this \nfinancial disincentive and level the commuting field for bicyclists.\n  The bill extends the fringe benefits that employers can offer their \nemployees for commuting by public transit, car or truck to those who \nride their bicycles to and from their jobs. Our bill amends the tax \ncode so that public and private employers can offer their employees a \nmonthly benefit payment that will help them cover the costs of riding \ntheir bikes, instead of driving and parking their cars where they work. \nThe bill also provides employers the flexibility to set their own level \nof benefit payment up to a specified amount. That way, employers and \ntheir employees can decide how much of an incentive they need to stop \ndriving and start riding their bikes. Those who currently ride the bus \nand/or subway to work would also gain an extra incentive to ride their \nbikes. Employers can deduct the cost of their benefit payments from \ntheir taxable income. This reduces the taxes that they pay to the \nFederal Government. And, in turn, employees will receive anywhere from \n$40-$110 per month as a non-taxable benefit, to help them pay for the \ncosts of riding their bikes.\n  This is a fair and modest proposal that will reward employees who \nride their bikes to and from their jobs.\n  Our Senate bill is a companion bill to a bill being introduced by my \nfellow Oregonian, Congressman Earl Blumenauer. He has dozens of co-\nsponsors from both sides of the aisle and every part of the United \nStates eager to offer bicycle commuters the same incentive that I want \nto offer to those who take mass transit or drive.\n  In addition, our bill is supported by many regional and national \nbicycling organizations such as Bikes Belong, Cycle Oregon, the Bicycle \nTransportation Alliance, the League of American Bicyclists, the \nWashington Area Bicyclist Association, Transportation Alternatives and \nhundreds of Capitol Hill employees who commute by bike to work every \nday.\n  When you look around our cities, the taxpayers have paid millions of \ndollars for bike trails in all of America's urban areas and major job \nmarkets. Now, bicycle commuters will have an extra incentive to make \ngreater use of this public investment to commute to and from their \njobs.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues to enact this \nlegislation to reward citizens doing their part to put us on the road \nto oil independence by biking to work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 858\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to award funds to \nstudy the feasibility of constructing dedicated ethanol pipelines to \nincrease the energy, economic, and environmental security of the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Ethanol \nInfrastructure Expansion Act of 2007. This bill directs the Department \nof Energy, DOE, to study and evaluate the feasibility of transporting \nethanol by pipeline. I am pleased that my colleague, Senator Lugar of \nIndiana, is joining me as a cosponsor of this bill.\n  There is broad recognition that we need to reduce our almost-complete \ndependence on oil for energy in our transportation sector. We also \nunderstand that there is not a single, simple solution to this \ndependence. I believe that we need to use energy more efficiently and \npromote alternatives to petroleum-based fuels in transportation.\n  The most promising liquid fuel alternative to conventional gasoline \ntoday is ethanol. Use of ethanol as an additive in gasoline and in the \nform of E85 is expanding rapidly, and for good reasons. First of all, \nas a domestically-produced fuel, ethanol contributes to our national \nenergy security. As a gasoline additive, ethanol provides air quality \nbenefits by reducing auto tailpipe emissions of air pollutants. Because \nethanol is biodegradable, its use poses no threat to surface water or \ngroundwater. Finally, the production of ethanol provides national and \nregional economic and job-growth benefits by using local resources and \nlabor to contribute to critical national transportation energy needs.\n  My Congressional colleagues and I have recognized the benefits and \npotential of ethanol and have promoted its expanded production and use \nin numerous bills, including most recently in the 2005 energy bill. A \nkey provision in that legislation is the renewable fuels standard under \nwhich motor vehicle fuel sold in the United States is required to \ncontain increasing levels of renewable fuels. Several other provisions \npromote the production of ethanol from a broad variety of plentiful and \nlow-cost biomass including corn stover, wheat straw, forest industry \nwastes woody municipal wastes and dedicated energy crops.\n  The viability of ethanol is reflected in the rapid expansion of its \nproduction\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nand use, which has increased by more than 20 percent annually for the \npast several years. Moreover, ethanol's longer-term potential to become \na very significant energy source for transportation is gaining \nattention. A number of studies have concluded that ethanol can \ncontribute 20 to 30 percent or more of our transportation fuel in the \nfuture. Several of my Senate colleagues have joined me to introduce S. \n23, the Biofuels Security Act of 2007, which calls for increased access \nto ethanol at the pump and greatly expanded production of flexible-fuel \nvehicles. The Act also provides a directive for domestic production of \nrenewable fuels to reach 60 billion gallons a year by 2030. I am \nespecially proud of the leadership role that my State of Iowa and \ncommunities across rural America are going to play in this expansion.\n  Given this outlook, it is time for us to consider the full \nimplications of such a transition. One issue that deserves prompt \nattention is that of ethanol transport. The volumes of ethanol to be \nshipped in the future strongly suggest that pipeline transport should \nbe considered due to the potential economic and environmental \nadvantages this alternative might offer as compared to shipment by \nhighway, rail tanker, or barge. As production volumes increase, \nespecially in the Midwest, it is likely to be more economical to pump \nethanol through pipelines than to ship it in containers across the \ncountry. Pipeline shipping could provide for reduced vehicle emissions \nand superior energy efficiency compared to rail or tanker shipment.\n\n  For all of these reasons, we should begin to consider development of \nan ethanol pipeline network. Given the pace of ethanol's growth, it is \nlikely that our Nation could begin to benefit from pipeline transport \nof ethanol as early as 2015. The current state of knowledge regarding \ntransport of ethanol by pipeline is limited. Although it is being done \nin Brazil, a world leader in the production and use of ethanol, \nchallenges remain. The water solubility of ethanol introduces technical \nand operational issues that affect the shipment of ethanol in multi-\nproduct pipelines. Thus, the largest associated research costs will be \nin the planning, siting, design, financing, permitting and construction \nof the first ethanol pipelines. This work may well take as long as a \ndecade, perhaps longer. For that reason, we need to begin now to \ndevelop a solid understanding of this ethanol transport option.\n  This bill initiates that process by directing the Department of \nEnergy to conduct ethanol pipeline feasibility studies. It calls for \nanalyses of the technological, economic, regulatory, financial and \nsiting issues related to transporting ethanol via pipelines. A \nsystematic analysis of these issues will provide the substantive \ninformation necessary to assess the costs and benefits of this \ntransport alternative. The Act would allow DOE the option of funding \nprivate sector studies or conducting the studies on its own. The \nresults of these studies will provide a clearer picture of the benefits \nand challenges of pipeline transport of ethanol. They will provide \ncritical information, both for the ethanol industry as it contemplates \nethanol transport alternatives, and for policy-makers seeking to \nunderstand what policies or programs might be appropriate to promote \nthe most cost-effective and environmentally sound ethanol transport \ninto the future.\n  We have broad agreement on the need to do all that we can to reduce \nour dependence on oil. We are promoting expanding production and use of \nrenewable fuels in many ways, but we need to take into account the full \nrange of infrastructure issues that broader ethanol use entails. The \nrapid growth of ethanol production and use necessitates the very near-\nterm study of transporting ethanol by pipeline. I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to join me in passing this important and timely legislation. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 859\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ethanol Infrastructure \n     Expansion Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the national interest to make greater use of \n     ethanol in transportation fuels;\n       (2) ethanol is a clean, renewable fuel that provides public \n     health benefits in the form of reduced emissions, including \n     reduced greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change;\n       (3) ethanol use provides economic gains to agricultural \n     producers, biofuels producers, and rural areas;\n       (4) ethanol use benefits the national security of the \n     United States by displacing the use of petroleum, much of \n     which is imported from foreign countries that are hostile to \n     the United States;\n       (5) ethanol can reduce prices at the pump for motoring \n     consumers by extending fuel supplies and due to the \n     competitive cost of ethanol relative to conventional \n     gasoline;\n       (6) ethanol faces shipping challenges in pipelines that \n     transport other liquid transportation fuels;\n       (7) currently ethanol is shipped by rail tanker cars, \n     barges, and trucks, all of which could, as ethanol production \n     expands, encounter capacity limits due to competing use \n     demands for the rail tanker cars, barges, and trucks;\n       (8) as the United States ethanol market expands in the \n     coming years there is likely to be a need for dedicated \n     ethanol pipelines to transport ethanol from the Midwest, \n     where ethanol generally is produced, to the Eastern and \n     Western United States;\n       (9) as of the date of enactment of this Act, dedicated \n     ethanol pipelines do not exist in the United States and will \n     be challenging to construct, at least initially;\n       (10) Brazil has already shown that ethanol can be shipped \n     effectively via pipeline; and\n       (11) having an ethanol pipeline study completed in the very \n     near term is important because the construction of 1 or more \n     dedicated ethanol pipelines would take at least several years \n     to complete.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SECRETARY.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Energy.\n\n     SEC. 4. FEASIBILITY STUDIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary, in coordination with the \n     Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Transportation, \n     shall spend up to $1,000,000 to fund feasibility studies for \n     the construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines.\n       (b) Conduct of Studies.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall--\n       (A) through a competitive solicitation process, select 1 or \n     more firms having capabilities in the planning, development, \n     and construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines to carry out \n     the feasibility studies described in subsection (a); or\n       (B) carry out the feasibility studies in conjunction with \n     such firms.\n       (2) Timing.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary elects to select 1 or \n     more firms under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary shall award \n     funding under this section not later than 120 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Studies.--As a condition of receiving funds under this \n     section, a recipient of funding shall agree to submit to the \n     Secretary a completed feasibility study not later than 360 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Study Factors.--Feasibility studies funded under this \n     Act shall include consideration of--\n       (1) existing or potential barriers to dedicated ethanol \n     pipelines, including technical, siting, financing, and \n     regulatory barriers;\n       (2) potential evolutionary pathways for the development of \n     an ethanol pipeline transport system, such as starting with \n     localized gathering networks as compared to major interstate \n     ethanol pipelines to carry larger volumes from the Midwest to \n     the East or West coast;\n       (3) market risk, including throughput risk, and ways of \n     mitigating the risk;\n       (4) regulatory, financing, and siting options that would \n     mitigate risk in these areas and help ensure the construction \n     of dedicated ethanol pipelines;\n       (5) financial incentives that may be necessary for the \n     construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines, including the \n     return on equity that sponsors of the first dedicated ethanol \n     pipelines will require to invest in the pipelines;\n       (6) ethanol production of 20,000,000,000, 30,000,000,000, \n     and 40,000,000,000 gallons per year by 2020; and\n       (7) such other factors that the Secretary considers to be \n     appropriate.\n       (d) Confidentiality.--If a recipient of funding under this \n     section requests confidential treatment for critical energy \n     infrastructure information or commercially-sensitive data \n     contained in a feasibility study submitted by the recipient \n     under subsection (b)(2)(B), the Secretary shall offer to \n     enter into a confidentiality agreement with the recipient to \n     maintain the confidentiality of the submitted information.\n       (e) Review; Report.--The Secretary shall--\n       (1) review the feasibility studies submitted under \n     subsection (b)(2)(B) or carried out under subsection \n     (b)(1)(B); and\n       (2) not later than 15 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, submit to Congress a report that includes--\n       (A) information about the potential benefits of \n     constructing dedicated ethanol pipelines; and\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\n       (B) recommendations for legislation that could help provide \n     for the construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines.\n\n     SEC. 5. FUNDING.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to \n     carry out this Act $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, to remain \n     available until expended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Brown, \n        Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Specter, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Bayh, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 860. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit States the option to provide Medicaid coverage for low-income \nindividuals infected with HIV; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early \nTreatment for HIV Act, or ETHA. I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of this bill, along with the numerous letters of support I have \nreceived from advocacy organizations, be printed in the Record. I am \npleased that Senator Clinton is joining me once again to introduce \nETHA. I thank her for the steadfast support she has shown people living \nwith HIV. This terrible illness knows no party affiliation, and I am \npleased to say that ETHA's 20 cosponsors span both sides of the aisle.\n  ETHA provides States the ability to extend Medicaid coverage to low-\nincome, HIV-positive individuals before they develop full-blown AIDS. \nToday, the unfortunate reality is that most patients must become \ndisabled before they can qualify for Medicaid. Nearly 50 percent of \npeople living with AIDS who know their status lack ongoing access to \ntreatment. In my home State of Oregon, there are approximately 5,700 \npersons living with HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that approximately 40 \npercent of these Oregonians are not receiving care for their HIV \ndisease. I believe it is our moral responsibility to do everything we \ncan to ensure that all people living with HIV--regardless of their \nincome or their insurance status--have access to timely, effective \ntreatment.\n  Unfortunately, safety net programs across the country are running out \nof money, and as a consequence, they are generally unable to cover all \nof the people who need assistance paying for their medical care. For \ninstance, Oregon's Ryan White funded AIDS Drug Assistance Program \n(ADAP) is experiencing significant financial hardship due to years of \ninadequate funding. As a consequence, the program has been forced to \nimpose burdensome cost-sharing requirements and limit the scope of \ndrugs it covers on its formulary. Fortunately, Oregon's ADAP has not \nhad to resort to service waiting lists, a cost control mechanism that \nmany States have been forced to adopt. As safety net programs like ADAP \ncontinue to struggle, ETHA gives States another way to reach out to \nlow-income, HIV-positive individuals.\n  I believe ETHA represents a promising opportunity to turn the tide \nagainst this devastating epidemic. In 2005, there were 220 newly \ninfected HIV cases reported in my home State of Oregon. If we were able \nto provide even a fraction of those individuals access to early \ntreatment, we could prevent the progression of their condition to full-\nblown AIDS. Experience has shown that current HIV treatments are very \nsuccessful in delaying the progression from HIV infection to AIDS, and \nhelp improve the health and quality of life for millions of people \nliving with the disease.\n  Studies conducted by Pricewaterhouse Cooper (PWC) support providing \nearly healthcare to individuals diagnosed with HIV because it has both \nthe potential to save lives and control costs. Specifically, providing \nindividuals coverage through ETHA could reduce the death rate of \npersons living with HIV by more than half. Similarly encouraging is the \npotential cost-savings ETHA could generate in the Medicaid program. Due \nto its preventive aim, ETHA is estimated to begin saving the Medicaid \nprogram $31.7 million each year after the effects of expanded access to \ncare are fully realized.\n  I believe ETHA is a key example of the type of reform Congress needs \nto be implementing to the federal entitlements. The short term \ninvestment required to expand Medicaid coverage will ultimately result \nin significant long-term savings to the program--at no harm to the \nbeneficiary. But most importantly, ETHA takes an important step toward \nensuring that all Americans living with HIV can get the medical care \nthey need to lead healthy, productive lives for as long as possible.\n  One of the strongest features of ETHA is the enhanced Federal \nMedicaid match rate it provides to encourage States to expand coverage \nto individuals diagnosed with HIV. This provision closely models the \nsuccessful Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment and Prevention Act of \n2000, which allows States to provide early Medicaid intervention to \nwomen with breast and cervical cancer. We can build upon this success \nby passing ETHA and extending similar early intervention treatments to \npeople with HIV.\n  HIV/AIDS touches the lives of millions of Americans from a variety of \nbackgrounds. Some get the proper medications they need to keep healthy, \nbut far too many do not. The inability to access life-saving treatment \nliterally creates a ``life and death'' situation for many of our most \nvulnerable citizens. Fortunately, ETHA can give those individuals \naccess to the care they need so they can look forward to a long, \nhealthy life.\n  I again want to thank the strong group of bipartisan Senators that is \njoining me as original cosponsors of ETHA. I also wish to thank all of \nthe organizations around the country that have expressed support for \nthis bill, in particular, Oregon's Cascade AIDS Project. The work they \ndo on behalf of individuals living with HIV/AIDS in my home State is \ntruly commendable, and I appreciate the support they have shown ETHA \nover the years.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 860\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Clinton: I am writing on behalf of \n     the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) to offer our strong \n     support for the Early Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA). HIVMA \n     represents more than 3,500 HIV medical providers from across \n     the United States. Many of our members serve on the front \n     lines of the HIV epidemic providing care and treatment in \n     communities ranging from the rural South to the large urban \n     areas on the east and west coasts of the nation.\n       As you know, ETHA would allow states to expand their \n     Medicaid programs to cover people with HIV disease, before \n     they become disabled and progress to AIDS. This important \n     program change would allow more people with HIV disease to \n     benefit from the remarkable HIV treatment available today--\n     treatment that has reduced mortality due to HIV disease by \n     nearly 80 percent.\n       Many of our members still report high percentages of \n     patients with HIV presenting at their clinics with advanced \n     stage disease. These patients are often sicker; less \n     responsive to treatment and more costly due to the need for \n     more intensive interventions, such as inpatient \n     hospitalization. With earlier access to medical care and \n     treatment through Medicaid, these patients could remain \n     relatively healthy and enjoy longer and more productive \n     lives.\n       Now is the time to help these patients and the many new \n     ones that will enter HIV care systems as a result of the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) new \n     recommendations to make HIV testing a routine component of \n     medical care. While we are strong supporters of routine HIV \n     testing as a tool to promote earlier diagnosis and linkage to \n     care, we are concerned that our current federal and state \n     health care safety-net programs are ill-equipped to care for \n     the influx of patients that we expect to be identified \n     through routine HIV testing. Passage of ETHA would be a \n     critical step forward in the battle to ensure that all low-\n     income Americans with HIV disease have the healthcare \n     coverage that will allow them to benefit from the lifesaving \n     HIV treatment widely available in the U.S. today.\n       Thank you very much for your continued commitment to expand \n     access to care for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS \n     and other vulnerable Americans. Please consider HIVMA a \n     resource as you move forward with the passage of this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Daniel R. Kuritzkes,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        National Alliance of State\n\n\n                                 & Territorial-AIDS Directors,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the National Alliance of \n     State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD), I am writing \n     to offer our support for the ``Early Treatment for HIV Act.'' \n     NASTAD represents the nation's chief state and territorial \n     health agency staff who are responsible for HIV/AIDS \n     prevention, care and treatment programs funded by state and \n     federal governments. This legislation would give states an \n     important option in providing care and treatment services to \n     low-income Americans living with HIV.\n       The Early Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA) would allow states \n     to expand their Medicaid programs to cover HIV positive \n     individuals, before they become disabled, without having to \n     receive a waiver. NASTAD believes this legislation would \n     allow HIV positive individuals to access the medical care \n     that is widely recommended, can postpone or avoid the onset \n     of AIDS, and can enormously increase the quality of life for \n     people living with HIV.\n       State AIDS directors continue to develop innovative and \n     cost-effective HIV/AIDS programs in the face of devastating \n     state budget cuts and federal contributions that fail to keep \n     up with need. ETHA provides a solution to states by \n     increasing health care access for those living with HIV/AIDS.\n       We would also like to commend the hard work of your staff, \n     particularly Matt Canedy who has been extremely helpful on a \n     myriad of HIV/AIDS policy issues. We look forward to working \n     with him to gain support for the legislation.\n       Thank you very much for your continued commitment to \n     persons living with HIV/AIDS.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Julie M. Scofield,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           The Aids Institute,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 2007.\n     Re the Early Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA).\n\n     Senator Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Clinton: The AIDS Institute \n     applauds you for your continued leadership and commitment to \n     people living with HIV/AIDS in our country who are in need of \n     lifesaving healthcare and treatment. While the HIV/AIDS \n     epidemic in sub-Sahara Africa and other parts of the world \n     often overshadow the epidemic in the United States, we must \n     not forget about the approximately 1.1 million people living \n     in the U.S. who have HIV or AIDS.\n       Those infected with HIV are more likely to be low-income, \n     and the disease disproportionately impacts minority \n     communities. In fact, the AIDS case rate per 100,000 for \n     African Americans was 10 times that of whites in 2006. \n     According to a recent Institute of Medicine report titled, \n     ``Public Financing and Delivery of HIV/AIDS Care: Securing \n     the Legacy of the Ryan White CARE Act'', 233,000 of the \n     463,070 people living with HIV in the U.S. who need \n     antiretroviral treatment do not have ongoing access to \n     treatment. This does not include an additional 82,000 people \n     who are infected but unaware of their HIV status and are in \n     need of antiretroviral medications.\n       One reason why there are so many people lacking treatment \n     is because under current law, Medicaid, the single largest \n     public payer of HIV/AIDS care in the U.S., only covers those \n     with full blown AIDS, and not those with HIV. The Early \n     Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA), being re-introduced in this \n     Congress under your leadership, would rectify an archaic \n     mindset in the delivery of public health care. No longer \n     would a Medicaid eligible person with HIV have to become \n     disabled with AIDS to receive access to Medicaid provided \n     care and treatment.\n       Providing coverage to those with HIV can prevent them from \n     developing AIDS, and allow them to live a productive life \n     with their family and be a healthy contributing member of \n     society. ETHA would provide states the option of amending \n     their Medicaid eligibility requirements to include uninsured \n     and under-insured, pre-disabled poor and low-income people \n     living with HIV. No state has to participate if they choose \n     not to. As all states have participated in the Breast and \n     Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act, upon which ETHA \n     is modeled, we believe all States would opt to choose this \n     approach in treating those with HIV. States will opt into \n     this benefit not only because it is the medically and \n     ethically right thing to do, but because it is cost \n     effective, as well.\n       A recent study prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers found \n     that if ETHA was enacted, over 10 years:\n       --the death rate for persons living with HIV on Medicaid \n     would be reduced by 50 percent;\n       --there would be 35,000 more individuals with CD4 levels \n     above 500 under ETHA versus the existing Medicaid system; and \n     it would\n       --result in savings of $31.7 million.\n       The AIDS Institute thanks you for your bipartisan \n     leadership by introducing ``The Early Treatment for HIV Act \n     of 2006''. It is the type of Medicaid reform that is \n     critically needed to update the program to keep current with \n     the Federal Government's guidelines for treating people with \n     HIV.\n       We were very pleased the US Senate passed an ETHA \n     demonstration project during the last Congress. In this \n     Congress, we hope ETHA will finally become a reality. We look \n     forward to working with you and your colleagues as it moves \n     toward enactment.\n       Thank you very much.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Dr. A. Gene Copello,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  American Academy\n\n\n                                              of HIV Medicine,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Jan. 22, 2007.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith and Senator Clinton: The American \n     Academy of HIV Medicine is an independent organization of HIV \n     specialists and others dedicated to promoting excellence in \n     HIV/AIDS care. As the largest independent organization of HIV \n     frontline providers, our 2,000 members provide direct care to \n     more than 340,000 HIV patients--more than two thirds of the \n     patients in active treatment for HIV disease.\n       The Academy would like to thank and commend you for co-\n     sponsoring the Early Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA). We believe \n     this legislation would allow many HIV positive individuals \n     access to the quality medical care vital towards postponing \n     or avoiding the onset of AIDS, and be cost-effective in doing \n     so.\n       ETHA addresses a flawed anomaly in the current Medicaid \n     system--that under current Medicaid rules people must become \n     disabled by AIDS before they can receive access to \n     Medicaidprovided care and treatment that could have prevented \n     them from becoming so ill in the first place. The U.S. Public \n     Health Service guidelines have consistently recommended for \n     several years that the treatment of HIV patients, before \n     their immune systems have been severely damaged by HIV, will \n     greatly or even prevent the disabling effects of HIV disease.\n       ETHA would bring Medicaid eligibility rules in line with \n     the clinical standard of care for treating HIV disease, which \n     has changed dramatically over the last twenty\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\n     years due to the revolutionary and increasingly more \n     simplified life-saving drug regimens. The science of HIV \n     medicine is clear on this point: Today, when appropriately \n     treated, HIV can be managed as a serious chronic illness; \n     however, appropriate treatment requires early and continuous \n     access to highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). \n     Preserving an immune system is much more effective, if even \n     possible, than rebuilding one already destroyed. Patients who \n     do not receive proper treatment until they are diagnosed with \n     AIDS may not fully respond or benefit from treatment once it \n     begins.\n       The benefits of early treatment also extend to the \n     population at large. Good data (Quinn et al.; Porco et al.) \n     now supports what we have long suspected--that successful and \n     consistent treatment of the infected individual decreases a \n     patient's infectivity, further benefiting the health of the \n     American public and reducing the number of individuals \n     ultimately needing costly medical care.\n       Beyond the public's health, the cost-benefits of this \n     bill's implementation are similarly clear. States that adopt \n     this option to their Medicaid program would likely see cost-\n     savings to Medicaid by limiting costly hospital admissions \n     and reducing unnecessary, preventable illness. With reduced \n     morbidity, mortality and inpatient costs as a result of \n     state-of-the-art outpatient treatment, receiving early, \n     quality outpatient care is cost-effective (Valenti, 2001; \n     Freedberg et al. 2001) compared with the alternatives.\n       Passage of the Early Treatment for HIV Act will save lives, \n     increase the length and quality of life for people living \n     with HIV/AIDS, help ensure their medical coverage, and save \n     money over time.\n       We will work in vigorous support of this legislation, and \n     we appreciate your impressive leadership in doing the same.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeff Schouten,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Project Inform,\n\n                             San Francisco, CA, February 28, 2007.\n     Re Support for Early Treatment for HIV Act\n\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of Project Inform, a national \n     HIV/AIDS health care and treatment advocacy organization \n     based in San Francisco, we are writing to express our strong \n     support for the Early Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA). We \n     commend you for your leadership in reintroducing this \n     important bipartisan legislation.\n       ETHA would address a cruel irony in the current Medicaid \n     system. Currently most individuals with HIV must become \n     disabled by AIDS before they can receive access to Medicaid's \n     care and treatment programs that could have prevented them \n     from becoming so ill in the first place.\n       ETHA would modernize this system by allowing states to \n     extend Medicaid coverage to low-income, pre-disabled people \n     living with HIV. It would assure early access to care and \n     treatment for thousands of people living with HIV across the \n     country. It would also help relieve the financial crisis \n     facing many discretionary HIV/AIDS programs, such as the AIDS \n     Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) and other services funded by \n     the Ryan White CARE Act.\n       Access to healthcare and treatment is a high priority for \n     Project Inform as it ranks in the top concerns we hear from \n     people through our treatment hotline and community meetings. \n     We need long-term solutions like ETHA to ensure that people \n     have the care and treatment they need to remain healthy and \n     productive for as long as possible.\n       We greatly appreciate your longtime efforts on behalf of \n     people living with HIV/AIDS. If there is anything we can do \n     to help you with your efforts to pass this legislation, \n     please do not hesitate to let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anne Donnelly,\n       Director, Health Care Advocacy.\n     Ryan Clary,\n       Associate Director, Health Care Advocacy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS. (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \n        Cornyn, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 863. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect to \nfraud in connection with major disaster or emergency funds; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nEmergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty Enhancement Act of \n2007. The bill creates a specific crime of fraud in connection with \nmajor disasters or emergency benefits and increases the penalties \ncurrently available for such acts. I am happy my good friends and \ncolleagues, Senators Landrieu, Vitter, Cornyn, and Grassley have joined \nme in this important effort. I commend them for their leadership on \nthis issue and look forward to working with them to pass this important \npiece of legislation.\n  As a former Federal prosecutor myself for 12 years on the gulf coast \nof Alabama, and one who has been involved in prosecuting fraud in the \naftermath of hurricanes, I can tell you that it goes on, unfortunately, \nand there are some weaknesses in our laws that we can fix.\n  The ideas in my bill have received strong congressional support. In \nfact, the House of Representatives passed this same bill last Congress, \nH.R. 4356. Last March, the House Judiciary Committee approved the \nEmergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty Enhancement Act because \nboth Democrats and Republicans wanted to move as quickly as possible \nagainst disaster assistance fraud. The committee submitted a report \nexpressing its favor for the bill and recommended it be passed without \namendment.\n  Last June, the Department of Justice sent a letter to members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in strong support of the bill, noting that \nit would ``provide important prosecutorial tools in the government's \nefforts to combat fraud associated with natural disasters and other \nemergencies.''\n  The goal of my bill is to protect the real victims of disasters such \nas Hurricane Katrina by specifically making it a crime, under the \nexisting fraud chapter of title 18, USC chapter 47, to fraudulently \nobtain emergency disaster funds.\n  After an emergency or disaster, such as the recent tornadoes that \ndevastated the city of Enterprise in my home State, we should do \neverything we can to make sure 100 percent of the relief funds gets \ninto the hands of real victims. Taxpayers should not sustain a \nfinancial loss at the hands of scam artists, and these wrongdoers \nshould not profit from exploiting the victims of horrific events. \nCommon sense requires that those who deceive the government and obtain \nemergency disaster funds by fraud be subject to criminal punishment.\n  I want to share some thoughts about the scope of the problem. \nHurricane Katrina produced one of the most extraordinary displays of \nloss, pain, and suffering, and of scams and schemes that we have ever \nseen. The scope of the fraud and the audacity of the schemers was \nastonishing.\n  One of the most heinous examples is a woman who tried to collect \nFederal benefits by claiming she watched her two daughters drown in the \nrising New Orleans waters. In truth, she did not even have children and \nshe was living in Illinois at the time of the hurricane. Her outrageous \nclaims are an affront to the many people who actually did lose loved \nones in that terrible storm.\n  Another example of blatant and widespread fraud after Katrina \ninclude, in Texas, a hotel owner who submitted bills for phantom \nvictims who never stayed at his hotel. Across the gulf coast, roughly \n1,100 prison inmates collected more than $10 million in rental and \ndisaster relief assistance by claiming they were displaced by the \nstorm. People in jail were being sent checks.\n  You say: How can that happen? Well, they are trying to get money out \nto people in a hurry. I think they could do a better job, frankly. I \nthink FEMA could do a better job in analyzing these claims. But the \ntruth is, in the rush to make sure that people who have lost everything \nhave money to find a room to stay in so they are not out on the \nstreets, it does require them to take more risk than normally would be \nthe case. People who take advantage of that to defraud the taxpayers \nand to rip off the system ought to go to jail for it.\n  In California, a couple posed as Red Cross workers and fraudulently \nobtained donations, saying they were working for the Red Cross. Also, \nin California, 75 workers at a Red Cross call center were charged in a \nscheme to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Red Cross. \nOne individual received 26 Federal disaster relief payments by using 13 \ndifferent Social Security numbers. In my home State of Alabama, FEMA, \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, paid $2,748 to an individual \nwho listed a P.O. box as his damaged property.\n  As of January 3, the Hurricane Katrina Fraud Task Force has charged \n525 individuals in 445 indictments brought in 35 judicial districts \naround the country. These numbers continue to grow every day. The \nJustice Department is aggressively prosecuting these\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\ncrooks, but they have asked us for this additional tool. They have \nasked us to pass this legislation so that the Federal statute \nadequately addresses and deters fraud in connection with emergency \ndisaster assistance.\n  The fact is, some people think in a disaster they can run in and make \nany kind of bogus claim they desire--that money will be given to them \nand people will be too busy to check. And if they do, nothing is ever \ngoing to happen to them. We need to completely reverse that mentality. \nWe need to create a mindset on the part of everybody that these \ndisaster relief funds are sacred; that they are for the benefit of \npeople who have suffered loss, and only people who have suffered loss \nshould gain benefit of it. We need to make it clear that those who \nsteal that money are going to be prosecuted more vigorously and \npunished more severely than somebody who commits some other kind of \ncrime because I think it is worse to steal from the generosity of the \nAmerican people who intended to help those in need.\n  The total price tag for the fraud committed after Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita is not yet known, but the Government Accountability Office \ninvestigators have testified that it will, at the very least, be in the \nbillions of dollars. I am not talking about millions. This is the GAO \nsaying it will be, at the very least, in the billions of dollars.\n  Now I have seen people, I have been down to Bayou La Batre and Coden \nand areas in my home area of Alabama who were devastated by this storm, \nand it is heartbreaking to see people who have lost everything. The day \nafter the storm, my wife and I were there. The Salvation Army showed up \nand it was the only group there providing meals. There was a long line, \nand we walked down the line and just talked to the people about what \nhad happened to them. Repeatedly, we were told:\n\n       Senator, all I have is what is on my back.\n\n  Now we want to help people like that, but we don't want to help \npeople who are somewhere unaffected in Illinois or somewhere in jail \nclaiming they deserve displaced housing money.\n  So it is an insult to the victims of these natural disasters and an \ninsult to the ultimate victim in this fraud, the American taxpayer. \nNatural disasters and emergency situations often create an opportunity \nfor unscrupulous individuals to take advantage of both the immediate \nvictims of the disaster or emergency, as well as those who offer \nfinancial and other assistance to the victims. The American people are \nextremely generous in responding to disasters, but they should not be \nexpected to tolerate the fraud of those who deceitfully exploit their \ngenerosity.\n  In addition to creating a new Federal crime that specifically \nprohibits fraud in connection with any emergency or disaster benefit--\nincluding Federal assistance or private charitable contributions--my \nbill would also update the current mail and wire fraud statutes found \nin chapter 63 of title 18--title 18 sections 1341, 1343. Those are the \nbread-and-butter criminal statutes for most frauds. My bill, though, \nchanges the Federal mail and wire fraud statutes by adding emergency or \ndisaster benefits fraud to the 30-year maximum penalties that are \ncurrently reserved for cases involving fraud against banks or financial \ninstitutions.\n  My bill is timely. Just this month we have seen tornadoes that killed \nat least 20 people in the Southeast and Midwest and damaged or \ndestroyed hundreds of homes from Minnesota to the gulf coast. I \nrecently toured many of the areas hit by the storms, and I was shocked \nby the devastation. The loss of eight Alabama schoolchildren at \nEnterprise High School was especially heartbreaking.\n  I had the opportunity to be with President Bush on the second day I \nwas there. He came down and met with the families of those eight young \npeople who were killed. He spent almost an hour with them--almost 10 \nminutes a person. It was a moving experience to be a part of that. I \ntalked with each one of those families and felt the pain and loss they \nsuffered.\n  Of course, money is not an answer to their pain. But I would say \nthis: People do want to help. If people take advantage and steal from \nthose who want to help families like that, who are in pain and loss, it \nis a despicable crime, to me.\n  The President has declared Enterprise and several other Alabama \nlocalities Federal disaster areas, including Millers Ferry, AL, in my \nhome county, where one individual was killed. I knew him and his \nfamily, and saw the people there who I knew who suffered a total loss \nof their homes, caused by this incredibly powerful tornado. Being \ndeclared a disaster area means victims will be eligible to receive \nFederal financial aid. It is my responsibility to make sure the money \ngoes to the right people and is not scammed off by criminals posing as \nvictims.\n  I know my colleagues share my deep sympathy for the families who lost \nloved ones and suffered injuries last week, but it is simply not enough \nto have sympathy. We must ensure the full resources of the Federal \nGovernment are quickly deployed to the affected States, and we must \nensure these resources are protected and distributed only to real \nvictims, not individuals seeking to take advantage of the disaster.\n  It is disheartening that there was so much fraud associated with the \nrelief following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but it is not surprising. \nI have been there in the aftermath of hurricanes as a prosecutor. I \nhave seen such fraud and abuse firsthand.\n  Our resources are not unlimited, and it is critical that we ensure \nthat every relief dollar goes to legitimate victims. It is important we \ngive prosecutors the tools they need to protect legitimate victims and \nto protect American taxpayers.\n  By passing this legislation, the Senate will send a strong signal \nthat exploiting the kindness of the American people in times of crisis \nis a serious crime that will be treated with appropriate severity. We \nwill not tolerate criminals stealing from the pockets of disaster \nvictims. A vote for this bill is a vote to ensure that victims and the \ngenerous members of the American public are not preyed upon by \ncriminals attempting to profit from these disasters and emergencies.\n  I think it is a reasonable piece of legislation. We worked hard, on a \nbipartisan basis, with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nthe Department of Justice. Senator Leahy has indicated he will bring \nthe bill up in the Judiciary Committee this week. We are looking \nforward to an analysis of it.\n  We will be glad to listen to any suggestions for improvements that \nmay be made, and I think it is a piece of legislation we should move \nforward with.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 864. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to clarify the \njurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Access to \nCompetitive Power Act of 2007 with my friend and colleague, Senator \nMitch McConnell.\n  I have spent years negotiating and working with the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority. I have long believed we could work together to address the \nproblems facing my customers in Kentucky. But every time I think I see \nthe light at the end of the tunnel, representatives of TVA change their \noffer or make up a new rule.\n  I was optimistic that the expanded Board of Directors of the TVA \nCongress authorized last session would be able to change the problems \nof the past. But after many meetings and negotiations, I am convinced \nthat TVA believes it has monopoly status and does not answer to anyone.\n  Today, I am telling TVA that the people of Kentucky deserve better.\n  For too long the TVA has acted against the best interests of the \npeople of Kentucky. Five electric distributors, Paducah, Princeton, \nWarren County, Glasgow and Monticello, gave their notice to TVA to \nleave the system when they realized they could get cheaper electricity \non the open market--and save their customers millions of dollars.\n  During the past few years, they have negotiated in good faith for \nbasic services that are considered routine in the utility industry. But \nunfortunately, the electric customers of Kentucky are stuck on the TVA \nisland. We forced them onto that island 75 years when we created the \nTennessee Valley Authority. Their options are limited and they\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nare wholly reliant on TVA for generation and transmission service. TVA \nknows this--and that is why they have continued to stall on providing \nreasonable services.\n  But the distributors who still intend to leave will now build \nhundreds of miles of new high voltage power lines to get access to the \nnational electric grid. One may even need to run the city on diesel \ngenerators. Despite these costs, the numbers show that their customers \nwill still save money.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, with Senator Mitch McConnell, \nwill give FERC full jurisdiction in relation to the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority--the same jurisdiction that FERC has over utilities \nthroughout the country.\n  Let me be clear--this legislation does not mandate contract language. \nIt simply requires TVA to negotiate these services in good faith.\n  It defines the rights of two classes of TVA distributors--those who \nprovided notice of termination prior to calendar year 2007 and those \nwho did not provide notice.\n  For distributors in Kentucky and Tennessee who have previously given \nnotice that they would like to leave TVA service, this legislation \nwould put their rights into law.\n  Specifically, it would allow them to negotiate partial requirements \nservices--making sure that TVA is not an all or nothing deal. For some \ncustomers it may make sense to get some power from TVA and some power \nfrom another generator.\n  It also requires TVA to provide transmission service for these \ncustomers. Because of Federal law, TVA is their only access point to \nthe national electric grid. As such, they should provide reasonable \ntransmission service.\n  It prevents TVA from charging these customers for stranded costs or \nimposing a reintegration fee and provides the customers the right to \nrescind their notice of termination if they ultimately decide they \nwould like to stay with TVA.\n  And lastly, it allows everyone who enjoys the benefits of cheap, \nFederal power from the Power Marketing Administrations to retain a \nright to that power regardless of whether or not they choose to be a \ncustomer of TVA.\n  For all those customers who would like to stay in TVA, this \nlegislation would give them the right to get partial requirements \nservice from outside of TVA in an amount equal to TVA load growth.\n  I also believe that it is time the Government looks closely at the \nTennessee Valley Authority. That is why my legislation asks for two \nimportant G.A.O. studies. First, it commissions a comprehensive study \non the privatization the Tennessee Valley Authority. Second, it \nrequests an analysis of the debt level of the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority.\n  All Kentuckians deserve to choose where they receive their power. \nThis bill will not only give them that choice, but it will also create \na more competitive environment among Kentucky distributors and allow \nour businesses and residential consumers to keep more money in their \npockets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 864\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A 2004 hearing determined that 27,000 contractors with the \nDepartment of Defense had a tax debt totaling roughly $3 billion. A \n2005 hearing determined that 33,000 contractors doing business with \ncivilian Federal agencies had unpaid taxes totaling $3.3 billion.\n  In addition to examining contractors for DOD and civilian agencies, \nthe Subcommittee has examined similar misconduct by contractors for the \nGeneral Services Administration (GSA). A Subcommittee hearing in March \n2006 determined that 3,800 GSA contractors collectively owed $1.4 \nbillion in unpaid taxes.\n  The upcoming March 20th hearing will further explore the problem, \nfocusing specifically on Medicare physicians and related suppliers that \nreceive substantial income from the Federal Government but do not pay \nthe taxes that they owe.\n  Witnesses for the upcoming hearing will include representatives from \nthe Government Accountability Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, as well as the Financial \nManagement Service.

LOUIS COUNTY, MO\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to H.R. \n1129, just received from the House and at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1129) to provide for the construction, \n     operation, and maintenance of an arterial road in St. Louis \n     County, Missouri.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1129. This \nimportant legislation is necessary to provide for the construction, \noperation, and maintenance of an arterial road in the Lemay area of St. \nLouis County, MO. This road, the Lemay connector road, is the lynchpin \nof the long-term recovery of that community and will open several \nabandoned industrial sites to new industrial, commercial and retail \ndevelopment and create thousands of new much-needed jobs. The road was \nidentified as the highest priority for redeveloping the area in a \nfederally-funded study conducted by the Missouri Department of \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I join my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Missouri, in supporting this much-needed legislation. Not \nonly will the road revive the economy of the communities around Lemay, \nit will also support the restoration of brownfields sites, improve \npublic safety, create new parks and riding trails, and provide other \nrecreational opportunities. With all of these benefits, it is not \nsurprising then that the bill has broad bipartisan support from every \nrelevant State and local elected official and also here in the \nCongress. It has also been endorsed by the Missouri Department of \nTransportation, the local school district--Hancock Place School \nDistrict and the local fire and police departments.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I vividly recall the devastation that was \ncaused by the the flooding in 1993 and one of the areas that was \nhardest hit was the community of Lemay. In response to that tragedy, \nCongress enacted an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. As a \nnew member of that committee, I worked to appropriate supplemental \nfunds for HUD's community development grants to compensate homeowners \nfor losses and to clear the area. Property acquired with the funds, \nhowever, was required to be maintained for uses consistent with open \nspace, recreation or wetlands management. This was a one-time \nrequirement, and no other property acquired using CDBG funds before or \nsince the 1994 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act has carried \nsimilar deed restrictions. Furthermore, I want to assure my colleagues \nthat we are not establishing any precedent by adopting this legislation \nin part because of the unique situation in which properties became deed \nrestricted and also because exceptions have been made to allow for \nroads and public works development on deed restricted lands.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I also want to assure my colleages that no Federal \nfunds will be used to construct or maintain the Lemay connector road. \nNeither St. Louis County nor the State of Missouri is seeking or will \nseek Federal assistance to build, maintain, or operate the road. In \nfact, the County has sent several letters to FEMA that it will not seek \nFederal funding for the road. Under terms reached by the St. Louis \nCounty and Missouri DOT, private developers will bear 100 percent of \nthe cost of construction of the road, and the road will be maintained \nby St. Louis County as part of its standard maintenance program,\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my colleague from Missouri is correct that \nno Federal funds will be used for either construction or maintenance of \nthis road. Furthermore, this road will become a county road and it will \nnot be part of the Federal-aid system. Under current law, which this \nbill does not amend, the Lemay connector road is not an eligible use of \nFederal funding.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time, \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The bill (H.R. 1129) was ordered to be read a third time, was read \nthe third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/13/senate-section/article/S3076-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MARCH 14, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
