Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 214, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 214) to amend chapter 35 of title 28, United \n     States Code, to preserve the independence of United States \n     attorneys.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Kyl amendment No. 459, to ensure that United States \n     attorneys are promptly nominated by the President, and are \n     appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       Sessions amendment No. 460, to require appropriate \n     qualifications for interim United States attorneys.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 90 minutes of debate, equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise, first of all, to support Senator \nFeinstein's bill, which I proudly have been a cosponsor of, and I urge \nall my colleagues to do the same. I wish to thank Senator Feinstein for \nbeing the first to discover this provision and for asking the right \nquestions, which then set us on this journey about the U.S. attorneys.\n  Second, I wish to thank Senator Leahy, our leader in the Judiciary \nCommittee on this issue, who has been stalwart in making sure we get to \nthe truth.\n  Some have been content to casually dismiss the administration's \nactions relating to the firing of the eight U.S. attorneys as a comedy \nof errors at the Justice Department. Make no mistake about it, this is \nno comedy, this is a tragedy. It is a tragedy for eight public servants \nwhose reputations have been wrongly trashed. It is a tragedy for the \nreputation of the Justice Department, as a whole, and for the Attorney \nGeneral, in particular. Most importantly, however, it is a tragedy for \npublic confidence in our system of justice.\n  How can people have faith when the documents show that in this \nJustice Department allegiance to party is apparently valued over \nloyalty to the rule of law? How can citizens not be cynical when it is \nclear the PATRIOT Act was cynically manipulated to bypass checks and \nbalances?\n  We all know politics plays a role in the Justice Department, but it \nshould be second to rule of law. On too many issues in this Justice \nDepartment, politics came first and rule of law came second.\n  Weeks ago, we suspected the provision we are correcting today was no \nmore than a mechanism to allow end runs around the Senate and the \npeople. The e-mails have proven our worst fears. This provision was \napparently added to the PATRIOT Act not for efficiency or national \nsecurity but to make it easier to install political loyalists. This is \nhow Kyle Sampson, the former Chief of Staff to the Attorney General, \ndescribed how the slipped-in PATRIOT Act should be manipulated:\n\n       By using these provisions we can give far less deference to \n     home State senators and thereby get (1) our preferred court \n     person appointed, and (2) do it far faster and more \n     efficiently at less political cost to the White House.\n\n  That is a memo to Harriet Miers.\n  That scheme was, of course, followed to install Karl Rove's former \ndeputy in the Eastern District of Arkansas.\n  Here is another e-mail from Mr. Sampson:\n\n       My thoughts: 1. I think we should gum this to death: Ask \n     the Senators to give Tim a chance, meet with them, give him \n     some time in office to see how he performs. If they \n     ultimately say ``no, never,''--and the longer we can \n     forestall that the better--then we can tell them we will look \n     for other candidates, ask them for recommendations, evaluate \n     the recommendations, interview their candidates, and \n     otherwise run out the clock. All of this should be done in \n     ``good faith,'' of course.\n\n  That is an astonishing breach of trust. That shows that, at least \naccording to Mr. Sampson, this provision could be used to keep \npolitical appointees in office for a long time.\n  So there is no doubt we must pass this legislation, which provides--\nand has always provided--for checks and balances on a runaway Justice \nDepartment. If there is proof that it was ever needed, it is the \nactions of the Justice Department in the last several months. I am \nespecially amazed, given the proof that this secret midnight provision \nwas willfully abused at the highest levels of the Justice Department, \nhow anybody could not vote for Senator Feinstein's legislation. This is \nthe latest example of an executive branch run amuck, the most recent \nevidence of a Justice Department almost drunk with its own power and \nwith little regard for checks and balances.\n\n  That is why our work will not be done when we pass this bill in a few \nhours. It is not enough to reform the law, we must repair the Justice \nDepartment.\n  Finally, last night we received 3,000 pages of documents. Some in the \nadministration have started to spin this: See, they were fired for \ncause. But if you look at these documents, that is not the case. They \nread like an ``Alice in Wonderland'' tale. There are thousands of pages \nof stock documents, and we still have no real idea why many of these \nfine men and women were fired.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the documents leave us scratching our \nheads in wonderment as to why they were fired. One e-mail shows that \ndays before the purge, the Deputy Attorney General was uncertain about \nthe reasons why Nevada U.S. attorney Daniel Bogden was fired: ``I'm \nstill a little skittish about Bogden.''\n  The documents show that far from exhibiting performance problems, New \nMexico U.S. attorney David Iglesias is highly praised by officials in \nWashington and even considered for promotion. Similarly, Washington \nU.S. attorney John McKay is also praised 3 months before he was fired. \nSan Diego U.S. attorney Carol Lam was strongly defended by the \nDepartment on her pursuit of immigration cases months before she was \nfired. Finally, another U.S. attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, widely \nconsidered to be one of the finest and most apolitical prosecutors in \nthe country, was ranked in the middle tier and described as \n``undistinguished.'' Meanwhile, two of the fired prosecutors were only \na short time ago ranked in the top tier.\n  The more we dig, the deeper the hole it seems the Justice Department \nis in, with still no clear explanation as to why these fine prosecutors \nwere fired. Make no mistake about it, we will get to the bottom of \nthis.\n  This legislation is an early step, but we cannot rest until we have \nreformed the Department's ways and restored confidence, so that when \npeople enter Justice Department buildings and see the eagle perched \nwith arrows in her claws, it means justice and the rule of law, without \nfear or favor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, every American needs to have confidence \nin our system of justice, but in the last few weeks that confidence \nhas, frankly, been deeply shaken. Each day, we get new evidence that \nthe Bush administration injected partisan politics into a process that \nrequires independence, and each day we get more proof this \nadministration has not been telling the truth.\n  I am here today on this floor to support the bill to restore the \nSenate's constitutional advise and consent in confirming nominees to \nserve as U.S. attorneys. I am deeply troubled by the many ways the Bush \nadministration has politicized the administration of justice because it \nthreatens all Americans.\n  Recently, we learned that the administration's political meddling \nreached into my own home State of Washington, and it led to the firing \nof a U.S. attorney who had received an excellent job performance review \nonly months, months before he was fired. When I asked for answers, the \nJustice Department told me things that were not true. Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Paul McNulty assured me the firing of John McKay was \nperformance related. I didn't believe it at the time, and, \nunfortunately, the past few weeks have only confirmed my suspicions.\n  As the facts come out, the administration's untruths are coming to \nlight. First we were told the White House had no role in the firing. \nNow we learn this whole scheme originated in the White\n\n[[Page S3293]]\n\nHouse. At first we were told the firings were performance related. Now \ndocuments have disclosed that the Justice Department was evaluating \nU.S. attorneys based on their loyalty to the administration. We were \nalso told a significant change in the PATRIOT Act was needed for \nnational security and would not be abused. That also was not true. \nEvery day, this story gets worse and worse and climbs higher up the \npolitical ladder. Now we have learned that senior officials in the \nWhite House, including the President's former counsel, Harriet Miers, \nand his top political adviser, Karl Rove, were key players in these \nfirings.\n  Why should folks at home care if the White House and Justice \nDepartment are politicizing the Office of the U.S. Attorney? It \nmatters, and it matters for two reasons.\n  First, any American can become the subject of a civil or criminal \ninvestigation by a U.S. attorney, an investigation that could upend \ntheir life or ruin their reputation, destroy their business, and \nultimately cause the Government to take their life or their liberty. \nThat is a tremendous amount of power, and we need to make sure the \npeople who wield that power are launching investigations based on the \nfacts and based on the law--not based on political pressure.\n  Second, after all the ways the Bush administration has undermined the \nrights and liberties of our citizens, we need to vigorously stand up \nand fight back whenever new abuses come to light.\n  I believe we could have gotten the facts sooner if we had gotten \nstraight answers from the Attorney General from the start. \nUnfortunately, Mr. Gonzales can't seem to get his stories straight. At \na press conference last week, he said he didn't know about it, but he \nis responsible for it. He said mistakes were made, but the firings were \nappropriate. He said he believes the U.S. attorneys should be \nindependent, but they can be fired for any reason.\n  Two years ago, I voted against confirming Alberto Gonzales as the \nNation's top law enforcement officer. As I said in February of 2005, he \n``lacks the independence and honesty to be Attorney General.'' I also \nsaid his troubling record would not assure public confidence in the \nfair administration of justice. I take no joy in saying that my fears \nhave been borne out.\n  How did we get here? Last year, when Congress updated the PATRIOT \nAct, a change was inserted at the request of the White House. This \nchange was not debated. It was made without the knowledge of many of us \nhere in the Senate. Today, we know that change to the PATRIOT Act \nplayed an important role in this entire scheme. It significantly \nlowered the difficulty of removing any U.S. attorney and replacing him \nor her without consulting anybody.\n  We need to end these abuses. I support the bill that is before the \nSenate today because it will restore the Senate's role in confirming \nU.S. attorneys, and it will also restore a critical check on the \nadministration's power.\n  Traditionally, when there has been a vacancy for a U.S. attorney, the \nWhite House has sent a nomination over here to the Senate. Last year, \nthe White House changed that procedure.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Last year, the White House changed that procedure by \nslipping a change into the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. With that \nchange, the White House was then able to install interim U.S. attorneys \nindefinitely without going through the normal Senate approval process.\n  This bill which is before us now restores the role of the Senate in \nconfirming interim nominees. This legislation will force the White \nHouse to work with the Senate and home State Senators. This bill is an \nimportant step to protecting the U.S. Attorney's Office from the \npoliticization it has suffered.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a step forward for justice and pass this \ncritical reform today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask to proceed for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is granted that right.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as a former prosecutor, I am here to \nspeak in behalf of S. 214. I would first like to thank the members of \nthe Judiciary Committee for introducing and reporting out this \nimportant bill, and I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  I returned from Iraq yesterday, and I look forward to reflecting on \nlessons learned from that trip later on this week. But I will say that \nmy Senate colleagues and I had extensive discussions with Iraqi \npolitical leaders as well as the American military about the need to \nrestore the rule of law in Iraq. I have always been proud that our \njudicial process has been the gold standard for the rest of the world. \nIt is ironic, then, that even as I spoke with Iraqi leaders about their \nchallenges, we Americans were learning a very public lesson about how \nthe rule of law can be undermined in even the most advanced \ndemocracies.\n  We have learned this past month that our Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer, our leading guardian of the rule of law in this \ncountry, has allowed politics to creep too close to the core of our \nlegal system. This administration has determined that Washington \npoliticians, not prosecutors out in the field--and perhaps, in some \ncases, not even the facts--will dictate how prosecutions should \nproceed. The consequences are unacceptable.\n  Good prosecutors, by all accounts doing their jobs, upholding their \noaths, following the principles of their profession, basing their \ndecisions on the facts before them, were pressured and/or fired and/or \nunfairly slandered by this administration. All of this, it would seem, \nwas motivated by rank politics. That is simply not how we do things in \nthis country. That is why, last week, I called for the Attorney General \nto resign.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I was a prosecutor. I managed an office \nof nearly 400 people, and we always said in our office: If you do the \nright thing, if you do your job without fear or favor, at the end of \nthe day, you have no regrets. It may not be easy; whatever your \ndecision is, it may not make everyone happy, you may have to explain \nit, but if you do your job without fear or favor, you have no regrets. \nThat was true, even though I was elected through the political process. \nI checked politics at the door when I came to my job.\n  I remember when I first came to my office there were two prosecutors \nin the office who supported my opponent. I went and met with them the \nday after I was elected, and I said: I heard nothing but good things \nabout you two, I heard you are great prosecutors, and I would like to \nknow what are the jobs you want in the office. One of them wanted to be \nhead of the drug team, the other wanted to be head of the gang team, \nand I put them in those jobs and never regretted it. They did \nincredible jobs, got along well with the police, and they worked well \nwith the community. That is because we knew, when it came to \nprosecutions, there were boundaries. Those boundaries, this month in \nWashington, we found out were crossed.\n  Another case I will always remember is a case where we prosecuted a \njudge who had stolen $400,000 from a mentally disabled woman he was \nsupposed to protect. This young woman lived in a world of stuffed \nanimals and dolls. She needed people to take care of her. He was the \nperson who was in charge of her money in her accounts, and he \nsystematically stole all $400,000 in those accounts. He was a \npolitically connected judge. He was a Democrat. When that case came \ninto our office, I got so many calls, dozens of calls, from people in \nthe community, political people, saying: You know, he messed up, but he \nis a good guy. He should not go to jail.\n  He went to jail. We asked for a 4-year sentence, and we got that \nsentence. I still remember that courtroom packed with all of his \nfriends, all of his pals, but we did the right thing, and at the end of \nthe day we had no regrets.\n  This is a tradition in our country, a simple and deeply rooted \ntradition that our party affiliation should not get in the middle of \ndecisions about whom we prosecute and how we enforce the law.\n\n[[Page S3294]]\n\nThat tradition is as true--perhaps even more true--in our Federal \nprosecutor's office as it is in the local DA's office. This tradition \nemerged because our justice system is ultimately built on a foundation \nof trust. Without that trust, the system does not work.\n  When our leaders play politics with the judicial process, we lose \nthat trust. When people get fired for political reasons, we lose that \ntrust. When good prosecutors are removed to make room for political \ncronies, we lose that trust. In losing that trust, the very lifeblood \nof our justice system comes under threat.\n  The legislation we are considering will not undo the damage this \nadministration and this Attorney General have caused, but it will \nprevent this Attorney General and future Attorneys General from ever \ndoing something like this again.\n  It is time once again to allow Federal prosecutors to do their jobs \nwithout fear or favor. It is time to place much needed limits on an \nadministration that has far too often and far too flagrantly exceeded \nits authority and abused the public trust. Today, by passing this bill, \nwe seek to curb that abuse and to give trust back to those who gave it \nto us--the people of this country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask that the \ntime be charged equally to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to rise in support of S. \n214, Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007. This \nlegislation would restore the appointment of our interim U.S. attorneys \nto how it was prior to the passage of the PATRIOT Act.\n  The PATRIOT Act included a provision many of us did not know was in \nthat legislation. It was a provision that affected the appointment of \ninterim U.S. attorneys.\n  Prior to the passage of that provision, the Department of Justice had \nthe ability to appoint interim U.S. attorneys for up to 120 days, \nwithout the confirmation of this body. This legislation will restore \nthat provision, which will establish the right balance between the \nexecutive and legislative branches of Government. It will encourage the \nDepartment of Justice to work with this body so that interim U.S. \nattorneys and permanent appointments can be considered timely and the \nconfirmation process can move forward. Most importantly, this \nlegislation is necessary because of the recent actions of the \nDepartment of Justice in removing several U.S. attorneys, which is \ncurrently under investigation by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I serve on the Judiciary Committee. On March 6, we had a hearing that \nI think was remarkable. It was unfortunate because we had former U.S. \nattorneys who appeared before our committee and talked about being \nintimidated and pressured by the Department of Justice and by the White \nHouse. They were fired despite the fact that they had received \nexcellent performance evaluations by the Department of Justice. In \nseveral of these cases, the office was involved in high-profile \npolitical investigations, some of which the administration was not \nhappy about.\n  The U.S. attorney is the chief Federal law enforcement officer in our \nStates. The U.S. attorneys must work independently. The Attorney \nGeneral must carry out his responsibility for the entire country. He is \nnot the attorney for the President. The Department of Justice must \nmaintain that independence. A U.S. attorney has enormous power to \ndetermine who should be investigated, who should be prosecuted, and \nwhat type of punishment should be recommended. It is a tremendous \namount of power which must be exercised with total independence.\n  The manner in which these eight U.S. attorneys were removed from \noffice raised many concerns that all of us should be concerned about. \nThis raises concerns about the independence of the U.S. attorney and \nwhether these investigations will be conducted with the public interest \nin mind or to further a political agenda. It raises concerns as to \nwhether the Department of Justice or the White House was trying to \ninfluence the independent judgments of the U.S. attorney in a specific \ninvestigation. It raises concerns as to how Congress was kept informed \nas to how these removals were being handled. Information that was made \navailable to us was inconsistent and certainly raises questions as to \nwhether Congress itself was being misled by the Department of Justice. \nThis raises concerns about the morale within the U.S. Attorney's \nOffices throughout the country and whether they will be able to attract \nthe best possible people in order to prosecute these activities and get \nthe best people in the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n  The work of this body is continuing as it relates to the U.S. \nattorneys. The Judiciary Committee is continuing its work. I must tell \nyou that I know there were a lot of documents made available last night \nto the Judiciary Committee, but what we need to have is the personal \nappearance of those who were directly involved--Ms. Miers, Mr. Rove, \nMr. Sampson. Those testimonies need to take place in the Judiciary \nCommittee, open testimony, so we can get the information as to what \nexactly happened in regard to the dismissal of these U.S. attorneys and \nwhether it was improper activity, trying to influence the judgment of \nour U.S. attorneys.\n  It starts with the passage of S. 214. It starts with our restoring \nthe proper balance between the executive and legislative branches of \nGovernment as it relates to the use of interim U.S. attorneys and the \nconfirmation process by this body.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 214 and to support the work of the \nJudiciary Committee as we continue our investigation as to the \ndismissal of U.S. attorneys.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to all of my \ncolleagues who have made a case for changing the law, but I have yet to \nhear any of them discuss the specific proposal they presumably intend \nto support. The disconnect is that it does not solve the problem they \nhave identified. It doesn't even begin to solve the problem.\n  I urge my colleagues, before simply voting on a partisan basis for a \nbill which is allegedly designed to solve a problem, that they at least \nask the question whether it solves the problem they have identified. It \ndoes not.\n  That is why I proposed an amendment that does solve the problem. I \nurge my colleagues, before they vote in 45 minutes, to read the \nunderlying bill--it is only 2\\1/2\\ pages--to read my amendment--it is \nabout the same length--and perhaps to listen to 5 minutes of what I \nhave to say.\n  This is not partisan. We are going to have Republicans and Democrats \nas President and a Republican- and Democratic-controlled Senate. We \nwant the U.S. attorneys to be nominated by the President, and we want \nthe Senate to be able to act on the nominees. The underlying bill does \nnot guarantee that. In fact, it does not even provide for it. My \namendment ensures that happens.\n  So I urge my colleagues, you have stated the case for a change. \nPlease listen to what I have to say because I think you will see that \nthe bill, the underlying bill, was drafted in great haste; it does not \nsolve the problem. My amendment does. I made several arguments \nyesterday on behalf of this amendment. I argued that it corrects the \nflaws in the underlying bill that all of us should want to correct.\n  Briefly, yesterday, I noted that the committee-reported bill does not \nensure the President will nominate a U.S. attorney. That is the first \nthing we want to happen. Secondly, as a result, therefore, it certainly \ndoes not solve this problem my colleagues have been trying to identify \nhere this morning about being accountable for Federal criminal \nprosecutions.\n\n  Secondly, the Senate would have no say in the selection of a U.S. \nattorney who is appointed by a Federal judge, which the committee-\nreported bill allows to happen.\n  Third, I noted that even the district judges themselves do not want \nto be\n\n[[Page S3295]]\n\nplaced in the position of selecting the U.S. attorneys. They have found \nthis to be a conflict of interest, and they have refused in some cases \nto appoint a U.S. attorney.\n  Fourth, I have argued that the district judges are ill-equipped in \nselecting U.S. attorneys. By the way, to my knowledge, no one has \nsought to dispute what I have been saying here.\n  Fifth--I think this would be of interest to my Democratic \ncolleagues--the committee-reported bill does not even end the practice \nof allowing an individual to serve as a U.S. attorney without Senate \nconfirmation and without a nomination even being sent to the Senate. \nThe committee-reported bill restores the 1986 to 2006 statutory \nlanguage, and that language allowed consecutive appointments of interim \nU.S. attorneys by the Attorney General--the exact practice my \nDemocratic colleagues are criticizing here today. So they permit the \ncontinuation of exactly what they object to. It would allow an \nadministration to stack the terms of acting U.S. attorneys and interim \nU.S. attorneys, which would allow an individual to serve as U.S. \nattorney for nearly a year without confirmation ever being submitted to \nthe Senate, and perhaps beyond that.\n  I made these same arguments in a ``Dear Colleague'' I circulated \nMonday morning. I am going to try to have that letter distributed to \nthe desks of all Senators, so when they arrive, they can at least take \na look at it and evaluate what I am saying.\n  Yesterday, I had expected that opponents of my amendment would come \nto the floor and respond as to why they disagreed with my amendment. A \nsignificant number of Democratic Senators did come to the floor \nyesterday and today to speak to the bill. All of them urged passage of \nthe bill. Not one of them even mentioned my amendment, an amendment the \nSenate will be voting on in about 45 minutes.\n  My staff ran a computer search this morning to see if someone at \nleast had the decency to submit a statement for the record explaining \nwhy they opposed my amendment. No such statement exists. I listened \ncarefully to the speeches this morning. All made a case for a change. \nNot one referred to the underlying bill or showed how it solves the \nproblem, because it does not, and not one referred to my amendment, \nwhich, as I said, does solve the problem they have identified.\n  I understand this issue has become very political. I understand there \nis great pressure within the Democratic caucus to vote down any \namendments to preserve an undiluted victory over the administration. \nBut this has nothing to do with the political issue that is raging out \nthere; it has to do with solving a specific problem we have all agreed \nexists with the existing law, a problem not solved by the underlying \nbill.\n  I would urge my colleagues to think before they jump over this cliff. \nWe are all elected to a 6-year term for a reason: We are given this \nmuch time so we can stop and think about things and not be rushed into \ndecisions that in retrospect do not appear to be a very good idea. That \nis how the legislation got into the PATRIOT Act that everybody is \ncomplaining about today. We are going to be compounding one mistake, I \nexpect, with another.\n  Allow me, therefore, to make one final pitch to my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side who presumably simply will follow the leader and vote \nagainst my amendment without having read it or the underlying bill. If \nyou think about the long term, I think you will agree that my proposal \nis the one that makes sense. But let us think about the short term and \ncompare how the committee-reported bill and my amendment would operate \nover the remaining 2 years of this administration. Let's see how they \nwork.\n  Under the committee-reported bill, which presumably would be signed \ninto law maybe in April, all interim U.S. attorneys would continue to \nserve for another 120 days until sometime in July. What would happen \nthen, after that 120 days? One of three things could happen.\n  A district judge could pick a U.S. attorney. Well, the Senate has no \nsay in that. Most judges who do so are very likely to reappoint the \ncurrent interim U.S. attorney. If the judge does so, that interim U.S. \nattorney could serve through the remainder of this administration \nwithout a nomination ever having been sent to the Senate.\n  The second alternative is that if the district judge does not choose \nto appoint an interim U.S. attorney, the Attorney General could then \nreappoint the current one to one or more consecutive terms--the very \nthing all of my colleagues on the Democratic side have objected to \nhere, that the Attorney General could appoint an interim U.S. attorney. \nThat judicial district would have a U.S. attorney, likely for the \nremainder of the administration, who was not submitted to or confirmed \nby the Senate.\n  The third possibility under the committee-reported bill is that after \nthe 120 days are up, sometime in July, the administration could simply \ndesignate the interim U.S. attorney as the acting U.S. attorney--a \ndesignation that could last until March of 2008 without a nomination \nhaving ever been submitted the Senate. By March of 2008, it is likely \nthat no nomination would ever be submitted to the Senate and that the \nacting or interim U.S. attorney would simply be recess-appointed for \nthe remainder of the President's term.\n  In all three scenarios, no Presidential nomination, no Senate \nconfirmation or consideration of the nominee--the very thing the \nDemocrats here are objecting to would continue to exist under the bill \nso many of them have spoken in support of.\n  The bottom line is, if the Senate blindly votes down my amendment and \npasses the committee-reported bill without fixing any of its flaws, the \njudicial districts that have no Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney today \nwill stand an excellent change of having no Senate-confirmed U.S. \nattorney for the remainder of this administration.\n  Compare this to the result that would happen if my amendment were \nadopted. Under my amendment, the interim authority is repealed in its \nentirety. In other words, the main thing my Democratic colleagues have \ncomplained about--that Attorney General Gonzales can make an interim \nU.S. attorney appointment--would be gone. He would not be able to do \nthat anymore. Not so under the bill.\n  Under my amendment the President would be required to nominate a U.S. \nattorney candidate within 120 days; obviously, by the middle of summer. \nUnder my amendment, even if the President doesn't comply with this \ndeadline because acting authority expires after 210 days if no \nnomination is submitted, the President would be forced to nominate a \nU.S. attorney before the end of the year. The bottom line is, if my \namendment is adopted, all judicial districts in the country will have a \nSenate-confirmed U.S. attorney or at least a nomination pending in the \nSenate for most of the remainder of the administration.\n  Just in case my colleagues think I am kidding, lets look at the \nunderlying bill. This is all there is to it. There is not a whole lot \nhere. Let's read what it says. First, it says:\n\n       The Act may be cited as the ``Preserving United States \n     Attorney Independence Act of 2007.''\n\n  That is a misnomer if I ever heard one. Why? The code is amended by \nstriking the provision above and inserting the following:\n\n       A person appointed as United States Attorney under this \n     section may serve until the earlier of--\n       (1) the qualification of a United States attorney appointed \n     by the President--\n\n  That is the normal process--\n\n     or\n       (2) the expiration of 120 days after appointment by the \n     Attorney General under this section.\n\n  Wait. I thought the object was not to have the Attorney General \nappoint U.S. attorneys. Let's read this again:\n\n       Or . . . the expiration of 120 days after appointment by \n     the Attorney General under this section.\n\n  So under the underlying bill, the Attorney General still gets to \nappoint interim U.S. attorneys. Not so under my amendment. That section \nis repealed. Or, third:\n\n       If an appointment expires under subsection (c)(2), the \n     district court for such district may appoint a United States \n     attorney until the vacancy is filled.\n\n  The district court, for all the reasons we have discussed, is not the \nbest entity to be appointing a U.S. attorney. All of us would agree it \nwould be preferable not to have the district court do that. In any \nevent, if the object is to preserve the Senate's ability to evaluate a\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\nnominee and to act on that nomination and reject it or confirm the \nindividual, we have no such authority if the district judge appoints \nthe U.S. attorney.\n  So there are three possibilities. That the President would nominate \nis one; but if he does not, there is no penalty. For those who argue \nthat the President is trying to get by with something by having his \nAttorney General appoint interim U.S. attorneys who never have to be \nconfirmed by the Senate, under this first point the President can \nsimply do nothing, and then his Attorney General can appoint an interim \nU.S. attorney. I thought that was what we were trying to avoid. If the \nAttorney General doesn't do it, then a Federal court judge can do it. \nIn none of those cases does the Senate have anything to say about it.\n  Clearly, the bill doesn't solve the problem that everybody has \nidentified. My amendment, on the other hand, does. It does so in three \nspecific ways. This is all of one page and three lines. It is not hard \nto read. What we say is that under the new law, if my amendment is \nadopted, section 546 of title 28 is repealed. That is the interim \nappointment authority of the Attorney General, the thing that everybody \nis objecting to: Alberto Gonzales is going to appoint an interim, and \nthe Senate will never have a chance to act on that nominee. My \namendment eliminates his ability to do that or any subsequent Attorney \nGeneral, unlike the underlying bill.\n  So how would we fill the vacancy?\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date on which a vacancy \n     occurs in the office of United States attorney for a judicial \n     district, the President shall submit an appointment for that \n     office to the Senate.\n\n  My amendment, unlike the underlying bill, requires the President to \nmake a nomination within 120 days. Why? A, the President should be \nmaking these nominations--as we all agree--B, the Senate would then \nhave the ability to act on that nomination. How do we know? Because we \nalso say that 120 days after the date of submission of an appointment \nunder paragraph 1, ``the Senate shall vote on that appointment.'' So we \nhave ensured that the President will make a nomination and that the \nSenate will act on that nominee.\n  People have said: But you can't sue the President for not actually \nnominating someone. So we have a final provision that creates a very \nstrong incentive for the President to nominate to fill the vacancy:\n\n       If the President fails to comply with paragraph (1) with \n     regard to the submission of any appointment for the office of \n     United States attorney, paragraph (2) of this subsection \n     shall have no force or effect with regard to any appointment \n     to the office of U.S. Attorney during the remainder of the \n     term of that President.\n\n  What that means is that the President has a very strong incentive to \nnominate people to fill the vacancy so that the Senate can act on that \nnomination because, if he fails to do so, the requirement that the \nSenate act on his nominations for U.S. attorney is vitiated for the \nremainder of his term. He no longer has any assurance that his nominees \nwill be acted upon by the Senate.\n  This is about as simple--it is all on one page--a way of solving the \nproblem that I can imagine. Let me summarize. The problem my colleagues \nhave suggested is that in the PATRIOT Act we put a provision that \nallows the Attorney General to fill vacancies with an interim U.S. \nattorney, and the Senate has no say-so. Under the bill, that exact \nprocess continues. It is not changed. We haven't solved a thing in that \nregard.\n  What we have said is, if he doesn't do that, a district judge could \nfill the vacancy. That is a great solution. Actually, it is not great. \nDistrict judges don't want the authority. They haven't exercised it \nwell in the past. They are not the best people; in fact, they have an \ninherent conflict of interest to be appointing prosecutors who are \ngoing to appear before them. In any event, the Senate has no ability to \nact on the nominee. It is not even a nominee, it is an appointment. The \nAttorney General can appoint or a Federal district judge can appoint. \nIn neither case does the Senate get an opportunity to confirm or reject \nthe nominee.\n  The underlying bill does not solve the problem that everybody is \ntalking about. Only my amendment solves the problem which says, first, \nthe ability of the U.S. Attorney General to fill these vacancies with \nan interim U.S. attorney is now gone. He cannot do that anymore. The \nvery thing we don't like can't happen under my amendment.\n\n  Secondly, instead of having a Federal district judge appoint a \nprosecutor with no Senate confirmation, we require the President to \nmake his nomination, that the Senate will act within 120 days of \nreceiving that nomination, and if the President fails to do so, the \nSenate no longer has to act on any of his U.S. attorney nominations for \nthe remainder of his Presidency.\n  Those who have argued that there is a problem have an obligation to \nexplain how their proposed solution solves the problem. I issue this \nchallenge to any of my Democratic colleagues who plan to vote for the \nunderlying legislation, S. 214.\n  Please come to the floor within the next 40 minutes and explain to me \nwhat it is in these two pages that solves the problem. Can they point \nto where the Attorney General can no longer appoint a U.S. attorney? \nNo, they cannot. It says right here that the Attorney General can \nappoint an interim U.S. attorney, and the Senate can't do anything \nabout it.\n  Can they show how the Senate would be able to act on the appointment \nby a Federal district judge? No. It says that a Federal district judge \nmay appoint the U.S. attorney. Not nominate, appoint. Again, the Senate \nhas nothing to say about it.\n  I challenge my Democratic colleagues--they have done a great job of \nsaying we have a problem--to show me how their bill solves the problem. \nHave enough humility to come to the Senate floor and say: We made the \ncase for a change. We are willing to acknowledge that actually your \nsolution is a better solution than ours, and we are willing to say we \nwill support your solution.\n  That would solve the problem. For the future we would all be happy. \nWe wouldn't have politics dictate the solution that in the end doesn't \nwork to anybody's satisfaction.\n  I urge colleagues, vote yea on the Kyl amendment to solve the problem \nthat has been presented.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We have people pointing out a flaw in the current bill \nthat we did pass, that the Senator acknowledges is there, and I \nacknowledge is there. People cite potential abuses from the system. But \nas the Senator was speaking yesterday on his amendment, a hypothetical \ncame to mind. He has been in the Senate a long time. He is one of the \ngreat lawyers in the Senate. He has been on the Judiciary Committee for \nmany years.\n  Let's assume this hypothetical: A President of the United States \nbelieves strongly that the Federal gun laws should be enforced, that \nthe Federal immigration laws should be enforced, that the Federal death \npenalty should be enforced. He or she nominates a person who shares \nthose general philosophies to be U.S. attorney. Under the Feinstein \namendment, if this Senate were a liberal Democratic Senate that didn't \nshare those views and did not confirm that U.S. attorney within 120 \ndays, it would then fall to a district judge in some district to make \nthat appointment. Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there are two alternatives in that situation. \nEither the President's Attorney General could appoint an interim U.S. \nattorney with no Senate confirmation or a district judge could appoint \nthat U.S. attorney with no Senate confirmation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Feinstein legislation would have the judge make \nthat appointment.\n  Mr. KYL. Actually, there are two alternatives. Let me read them. I am \nreading from the bill. I urge my colleagues to read the bill. It really \nhelps.\n  There are two options if the President does not submit a nomination. \nThis is No. 2, if the President hasn't nominated someone, ``the \nexpiration of 120 days after appointment by the Attorney General under \nthis section.''\n  The first option is that the President could try to submit another \nnomination. But if he chose not to do so, his Attorney General could \nappoint the U.S. attorney. Or the third possibility is, if an \nappointment expires under this section, the district court for such \ndistrict may appoint a U.S. attorney. So\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nthere are two options if the President doesn't nominate another \ncandidate. His Attorney General can appoint the U.S. attorney, with no \nSenate confirmation, or a Federal district judge can appoint the U.S. \nattorney with no Senate confirmation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Federal judges I have practiced before had \nphilosophical views. Some of them have been pretty activist Federal \njudges. Some of them think there are too many gun prosecutions in \nFederal court, too many drug prosecutions, maybe too many immigration \nprosecutions. They could, under that power, appoint someone who would \nnot follow the policies of the President who was elected to set \nprosecutorial policy; is that not correct?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is exactly correct. Let's go to the \nother side of the coin. The President's own Attorney General could \nappoint someone who very aggressively followed his policies, and the \nSenate would have nothing to say about it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct also. I suggest this is an odd thing we \nare doing. This is an executive branch appointment. That is what has \nbeen contemplated since the founding of the Republic, and that is what \nwe have done since the founding of the Republic.\n  I was a U.S. Attorney for 12 years. It was always considered an \noddity, if some vacancy occurred and the confirmation did not occur \nwithin the required time, that a Federal judge would be involved in \nappointing an executive branch appointment. But that is what the \nstatute was. It worked to some degree, and we went on with it over the \nyears.\n\n  But it was never a thoughtful, principled approach to how the \nexecutive branch of the Government should be operated because I am not \naware of any other appointment in the executive branch of Government \nfor which if it is not filled in a timely basis, the Senate--a coequal \nbranch--can up and fill that appointment, nominate and fill it; nor am \nI aware of any other office in the entire Government where a Federal \njudge would fill it if the Senate did not act properly or the President \ndid not nominate and follow through properly.\n  I want to say I think Senator Kyl's solution to this problem is \nthoughtful. The more I considered it, the more I believed he was on the \nright track. Truthfully, if our colleagues who are concerned about the \ndifficulty in the statute would pay attention to what he has said, you \nwould want to support the Kyl amendment because it goes beyond \nPresident Bush. He has less than 2 years left in his term. There will \nbe another President, and this law could be in effect for hundreds of \nyears.\n  So what is the right, principled approach to the appointment of U.S. \nattorneys? The right approach is that it should be done by the \nexecutive branch because it is an executive branch function. I was the \nattorney general of Alabama. The court did not appoint me. I was \nelected by the people in a political race. Most attorneys general are \nelected in political races around the country.\n  Prosecutors are accountable to policies. They are responsible for \neffectively utilizing limited resources to effect appropriate and just \npolicies of the United States. Presidents and the people of States who \nelect them elect them to execute certain policies. They usually \nunderstand that and make commitments to that as a political candidate, \nor the President asks if they will support his policies before he \nappoints them.\n  Now, I want to say this very clearly. Every U.S. attorney who is \nworth 2 cents understands they did get their office through some sort \nof political process. Confirmation in the Senate is a political \nprocess. A lot of the talk we have had about U.S. attorneys has been \nmore politics than substance in the last few days. It is a political \nprocess.\n  But what is absolutely critical is that U.S. attorneys remember the \noath they took. That oath is to faithfully enforce the law, whether it \ninvolves a Republican, a Democrat, a rich person, or a poor person; \nthat no matter what their station in life, they treat everyone fairly \nand objectively. They must comply with that. They have been given the \nchance to do the job, like any attorney general is who runs and gets \nelected. But their oath, their responsibility, their duty is to do it \ncorrectly.\n  You get pressure all the time. They say: Well, somebody tried to \npressure a U.S. attorney. It should not happen from Congress, in my \nview. I do not believe that. I would not call a prosecutor to suggest \nthat I know more than they know about a case that is before them. But \nsometimes newspapers write editorials: You are not prosecuting this \ncase. Sometimes local mayors and politicians say: You should not be \ninvestigating this case. You are under pressure all the time. If a \nperson is not strong and is not committed to integrity and the right \nprinciples and doing the right thing, they are going to be a sorry U.S. \nattorney. That is the bottom line. It is not a job for the cringing or \nthe weak, I will tell you. I had to make some tough calls. In one case \nwhere I prosecuted against two judges, I remember one of the legal aid \nlawyers who testified on my behalf--his client did--he told me during \nthe trial: Jeff, if these guys are acquitted, both of us are going to \nhave to go to Alaska. It is tough business. You have to do what you \nthink is right and proceed with the case.\n  Now, if Senator Kyl's amendment is not accepted, I have an amendment \nI think would help. I hope Senator Feinstein would not be maybe even \nopposed to it, although I am not sure she is comfortable with it at \nthis point. But I would point out to my colleagues and ask them to \nconsider this amendment as an appropriate step.\n  My amendment would make a very limited modification to the underlying \nFeinstein bill, if it moves forward without the Kyl amendment, to \nensure that only qualified candidates will be appointed by judges to \nserve as interim U.S. attorneys. The amendment allows district judges, \nunder this statute, if it becomes law, to appoint only those \nindividuals who are qualified and have proper background checks and \nsecurity clearances.\n  Under my amendment, a district court can only appoint an interim \nattorney if they are a current DOJ, Department of Justice, employee or \na Federal law enforcement officer, employee, who is already authorized \nby law or by a Government agency to engage in or supervise the \nprevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation \nof Federal criminal law.\n  This effectively places the same limitations in effect to which the \nDepartment of Justice adheres when making interim appointments on \ndistrict judges. According to the Department of Justice, in addition to \nthe full field investigation, background check conducted by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation--when you are appointed to be U.S. attorney, \nthey conduct a full field investigation by the FBI to see if you have \nany skeletons in your closet, to see if you are worthy of the office \nand if you can be trusted. That is done for every interim U.S. \nattorney, too.\n\n  Further, the Department of Justice reviews matters under the \njurisdiction of the Department's Office of the Inspector General, \nOffice of Professional Responsibility, and the General Counsel's Office \nat the Executive Office for United States Attorneys to see if this \nDepartment of Justice employee has problems, to see if there are \ncomplaints, deficiencies, ethical complaints about the person. That can \nalso keep them from being appointed.\n  So even if the candidate is a qualified DOJ employee or Federal law \nenforcement officer, a district court would not be allowed to appoint \nthem if the court learns they are under investigation or have been \ndisciplined by the DOJ or other Federal agencies such as the inspector \ngeneral or the Office of Professional Responsibility.\n  Finally, the amendment requires a district judge to confidentially \ninform the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, of the identity \nof the person they expect to name 7 days before the appointment so \nthese checks can be made.\n  I think this has two saving graces. It will eliminate some examples \nwe have had of judges appointing people who should not have been \nappointed, who were not qualified to examine the cases in the office \nbecause those cases required security clearances, as all grand jury \ntestimony does, for that matter. They did not have those security \nclearances. That is important. Also, since the prosecution of criminal \ncases is an executive branch function, the appointment being from the \nDepartment of Justice would at least be making it an\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\nappointment from the executive branch of the United States.\n  Both of those, I think, are healthy policies. I join with Senator Kyl \nin saying, let's do this thing right, if we are going to do it. It is \ngoing to be there maybe for 100 or more years. Let's set a policy that \nwould be principled and consistent with the separation of powers that \nhas served us so well and we can be proud of, and not focusing on this \nspecific set of events that led us to these ideas.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the use of \ncalculators be permitted on the floor of the Senate during \nconsideration of the budget resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from California on the \nfloor, and I am about to yield to her. Could I ask, Mr. President, how \nmuch time is available to the Senator from Vermont or his designees?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Eight minutes.\n  The Senator from California has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont has 8 minutes; the \nSenator from California has 5?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, thank you. And I thank the chairman of \nthe committee as well.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. 214. As we all \nknow, that is a bill to reinstate the Senate's role in the confirmation \nprocess of U.S. attorneys. I thank both Senators Leahy and Specter for \nsupporting this bill. I wish to say right upfront I believe we should \npass a clean bill today. I have had the privilege of working with both \nSenators Kyl and Sessions. I understand their amendments, but \nessentially what I have been trying to do is put the law back to the \nway it was before the PATRIOT Act reauthorization.\n  Now, at that time--March of last year--unbeknownst to Democratic and \nRepublican Senators a provision was included in the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization that essentially allows the Attorney General to appoint \nan interim U.S. attorney for an indefinite period of time without \nSenate confirmation.\n  Surprisingly, less than 1 year after receiving this new authority, \nserious allegations and abuse of the process have come to light. We now \nknow that at least eight U.S. attorneys were forced from office, and \nthat despite shifting rationales for why, it has become clear that \npolitics has played a considerable role.\n  We know that six of the U.S. attorneys who were fired were involved \nwith public corruption cases. Unfortunately, it is now clear that the \nbigger issue is what we do not know. Despite last night's production of \nsome 3,000 pages related to the firing process, we are now faced with a \ngrowing list of unanswered questions, including:\n  What was the White House's role in these decisions?\n  In one e-mail produced last night, there is a conversation about \ninvolving the President in the process, and asking who decides what his \nlevel of involvement should be. But there are no subsequent documents \nshowing the answers. Obviously, the question is: Who did decide and \nwhat was his role?\n  Who made these determinations about who to fire, and who was involved \nin the loyalty evaluation? Again, the documents produced last night do \nnot answer this question, and we are still faced with several lists of \ntargeted U.S. attorneys that beg the question: Who else was a target \nand what happened?\n  We also need to know what role, if any, did open public corruption \ncases play in determining who would be fired? What was the Attorney \nGeneral's role in the process? Was the change to the law in March of \n2006 done in order to facilitate the wholesale replacement of all or a \nlarge number of U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation?\n  While I believe the Senate and the House will exercise our due \ndiligence investigating these questions, we have an opportunity right \nnow to ensure this politicization of U.S. attorneys does not happen \nagain.\n  The bill before the Senate would return the law to what it was before \nthe change that was made in March of 2006. It would still give the \nAttorney General the authority to appoint interim U.S. attorneys, but \nit would limit that authority to 120 days. If after that time, the \nPresident had not nominated a new U.S. attorney or the Senate had not \nconfirmed a nominee, then the district courts would appoint an interim \nU.S. attorney. This is the process that was developed under the Reagan \nadministration and it worked from 1986 to 2006. That is 20 years. It \nworked with virtually no problems for 20 years.\n\n  I think it is important we reinstate these important checks and \nbalances and ensure that Senate confirmation is required. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill and to vote against all amendments.\n  I think it is necessary we pass this bill today, and I hope it is by \na very substantial margin. I am so distressed at the politicization of \nthe Department of Justice. I am so distressed that there is not an \narm's length between politics and the law today in this country. I \nbelieve it is a very serious situation. I believe strongly that once \nthe U.S. attorney takes that oath of office, they must be independent, \nobjective, and follow facts wherever they lead them in the pursuit of \njustice. I believe that is what both political parties want and I \nbelieve that is what the American people want. There is only one way we \nare going to get back there with U.S. attorneys, and that is by simply \nreturning the law to what it was before.\n  I also wish to point out the administration's interest in saying this \nis a political appointment has a limit, and I have expressed what that \nlimit is. The only way we are going to effect the necessary changes is \nto pass this law this morning, and I very much hope it will be passed \nand passed without amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for her \nstatement and her leadership. She has been so forthright in her \ncomments right from the beginning of this scandal, and I appreciate it. \nI will have more to say about her efforts at the end of my statement.\n  In a few minutes, the Senate will have an opportunity to begin \nrestoring accountability and checks and balances to what is our \nGovernment, the Government that belongs to all Americans. We should \npass the Preserving U.S. Attorneys Independence Act. We have to close a \nloophole that has been exploited by the Department of Justice and the \nWhite House--a loophole that led to the mass firings of U.S. attorneys.\n  When we roll back this excessive authority given the Attorney General \nby the PATRIOT Act reauthorization, we can restore--or at least take a \nstep toward restoring--the independence of our Federal law enforcement \nsystem. We will be acting to reverse one more incident of overstepping \nby an earlier ``rubberstamp'' Congress, which was all too often willing \nto dance to the tune of a power-hungry White House.\n  The Attorney General--and I will agree with the Attorney General on \nthis--he is right that mistakes were made. Mistakes were made, all \nright. It was a mistake to conduct the mass firings to send the message \nto our U.S. attorneys that they had better act like ``loyal Bushies''--\ntheir words, the Administration's words--rather than act as objective \nlaw enforcement officers. Mistakes were made, absolutely.\n  It was a mistake to malign the reputations of these officials by \ncontending that the firings were prompted by their badly performing \ntheir law enforcement responsibilities.\n  It was a mistake to mislead the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nhearings and Senators during phone calls and in meetings about the \nfirings.\n  It was a mistake to give the Attorney General the unlimited authority \nto fill these critical posts with his selections or the selections of \nthe White\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nHouse without the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate.\n  But most of all, it was a mistake to inject crassly partisan \nobjectives into the selection, evaluation, firing, and replacement of \nthe top Federal law enforcement officers in our country.\n  I still have no sense that the administration or the Attorney General \nunderstand the seriousness of this matter. The apparent effort to \ncorrupt the Federal law enforcement function for partisan political \npurposes has cast a cloud over all U.S. attorneys. Now every U.S. \nattorney is under a cloud. People are asking about those who were \nretained as ``loyal Bushies.'' People are wondering what prosecutorial \njudgments were affected. These mass firings have served to undermine \nthe confidence of the American people in the Department of Justice and \nthe local U.S. attorneys.\n  In the same way that any employer has the power to hire, we \nunderstand that people cannot be fired because they are Catholic or \nbecause of their race or because they are a whistleblower. The power of \nemployment is not without limit. It can be abused. When it is abused in \nconnection with political influence over Federal law enforcement the \nAmerican people and their representatives in Congress have a right to \nbe concerned. We need to get to the bottom of this situation. We need \nthe facts, not more spin, not another concocted cover story.\n  The U.S. Department of Justice must be above politics. The Attorney \nGeneral of the United States has to ensure the independence of Federal \nlaw enforcement from political influence. The Department of Justice \nshould serve the American people by making sure the law is enforced \nwithout fear or favor. It should not be a political arm of the White \nHouse.\n  The Attorney General is not the President's lawyer. The President has \na lawyer. The Attorney General is the Attorney General for the people \nof the United States of America--all of us--Republicans, Democrats and \nIndependents.\n  The advice and consent check on the appointment power is a critical \nfunction of the Senate. That is what this administration insisted be \neliminated by the provision it had inserted in the reauthorization of \nthe PATRIOT Act. That measure struck the time limit on the ability of \nthe Attorney General to name a so-called interim U.S. attorney. And \nthat is what this bill, the Preserving United States Attorney \nIndependence Act of 2007, is intended to restore. It is vital that \nthose holding these critical positions be free from any \ninappropriate influence.\n\n  We are finding out more and more abuses by this administration. We \nlearned for the first time earlier this month in testimony by a \nCongressional Research Service attorney before the House Judiciary \nCommittee about another loophole this administration has tried to \ncreate and exploit. In 2003, the Department's Office of Legal Counsel \nissued a secret legal opinion to try to create an end run around the \nSenate's role. This administration is the first I am aware that is \nemploying the Vacancies Act in addition to the interim U.S. attorney \nappointment authority sequentially. The horror that Senator Kyl speaks \nabout is one that this administration created and has apparently been \nemploying. That is not what Congress intended.\n  With the passage of S. 214 today we should put an end to that \nuntoward practice, too. As one of the authors of S. 214 and chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, I say it is not our intent to allow such an \nabuse by having the Vacancies Act provisions and those of S. 214 used \nin sequence. We do not intend for the Attorney General to use such a \nmisguided approach and seek to install a choice for 330 days without \nthe advice and consent of the Senate. Nor do we intend for the Attorney \nGeneral to make Senator Kyl's other suggestion a reality by seeking to \nuse the 120-day appointment authority more than once. It is not \ndesigned or intended to be used repeatedly for the same vacancy. These \ndouble dipping approaches run afoul of congressional intent, the law \nand our bill. Our bill should put a stop to that, too. Instead, the \nPresident should fulfill his responsibilities, work with home State \nSenators and nominate qualified people to serve as U.S. attorneys so \nthat they can be considered by the Senate and confirmed. If he does not \nthe district court will be restored the stopgap authority they \npreviously had.\n  I was pleased that Senator Feinstein worked so hard with Senator \nSpecter to craft the consensus measure we consider today to reinstate \nvital limits on the Attorney General's authority and bring back \nincentives for the administration to fill vacancies with Senate-\nconfirmed nominees. We reported out this measure with bipartisan \nsupport 13-6 after debating and voting down several amendments, \nincluding amendments similar to those offered today by Senators Kyl and \nSessions. We should again vote down these amendments and pass the \nbipartisan bill without delay.\n  Senator Sessions' amendment would attach certain conditions to a \ndistrict court's authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney after \n120 days, but none to the Attorney General's interim appointment \nauthority. Our bill is meant to roll back a change in law that allowed \nan abuse of power by the administration and the Department of Justice. \nThere is no record of problems with the appointment of interim \nappointments by the district court. In fact, for almost a hundred years \nuntil the law was changed in 1986 during the Reagan administration, \ndistrict courts were the sole means of appointing interim U.S. \nattorneys. There are many criteria that we want U.S. attorneys to \npossess--chief among them the ability to enforce the laws independently \nwithout fear or favor. But both the prerogatives of the administration \nin putting in place the people it wants and the home State Senators in \nensuring fairness and independence in their States are protected when \nthe President nominates and the Senate considers and confirms U.S. \nattorneys.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment provides unjustified limitations on the \nSenate's role in confirming U.S. attorneys that could short-circuit the \nSenate's ability to undertake a thorough consideration of a nominee's \nqualifications and wholly disregards the role of the home State \nSenators.\n  It is true that this President has been slow in nominating U.S. \nattorneys. There are currently 22 vacancies and only three nominees. \nBuilding incentives for this President to fulfill his responsibilities \nand work with home State Senators would be a good thing. That is not \nwhat Senator Kyl's amendment does. Instead, in the guise of setting a \ntime limit on the Senate, what it actually does is override the \ntraditional deference paid to home State Senators and the Judiciary \nCommittee itself. In fact, no time limit is needed to require the \ncommittee or the Senate to act on qualified nominees.\n  During this President's term, U.S. attorneys have been confirmed \nquickly, taking an average of 68 days from nomination to confirmation. \nOnly three people nominated to be U.S. attorneys have not been \nconfirmed and two of those withdrawn by the President. In fact, when I \nfirst chaired the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first \nterm, we confirmed 84 of President Bush's U.S. attorney nominations in \na little more than a year.\n  Some critics of the district court's role in filling vacancies beyond \n120 days claim it to be inconsistent with sound separation of powers \nprinciples. That is contrary to the Constitution, our history, our \npractices, and recent court rulings. In 2000, in United States v. \nHilario, the First Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the prior \nlaw on interim appointments, including the district court's role. In \nfact, the practice of judicial officers appointing officers of the \ncourt is well established in our history and from the earliest days.\n  Morrison v. Olson should have laid to rest the so-called separation \nof powers concern now being trumpeted to justify these political \nmaneuvers within the Justice Department. Certainly no Republicans now \ndefending this administration voiced concern when a panel of judges \nappointed Ken Starr to spend millions in taxpayer dollars going after \nPresident Clinton as a court-appointed prosecutor.\n  During committee consideration we heard from some who had not read \nwhat the Constitution says. The Constitution provides congressional \npower to direct the appointment power. In article II, the part of the \nConstitution that this administration reads as if it says that all \npower resides with the President, the President's appointment power is \nlimited by the power of Congress. Indeed, between its provisions\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\ncalling for appointments with the advice and consent of the Senate and \nfor the President's limited power to make recess appointments, the \nConstitution provides:\n\n       But the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such \n     inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President \n     alone, in the courts of law, or in the Heads of Departments.\n\n  Just last week, the Eastern District of Arkansas joined at least two \nother courts addressing the interim appointment of U.S. attorneys, the \nFirst Circuit in Hilario, and the Ninth Circuit in United States v. \nGantt, in concluding that U.S attorneys are ``inferior officers.'' \nThus, the Constitution contemplates exactly what our statutes and \npractices had previously provided and what our bill will restore. \nCongress is well within its authority when it vests in the courts a \nshare of the appointment power for those who appear before them.\n\n  One of the finest Attorneys General of the United States ever to \nserve was Robert H. Jackson. He also served as one of our most admired \nJustices on the U.S. Supreme Court. He was a principal prosecutor at \nthe International Military Tribunal for German war criminals in \nNuremberg after World War II.\n  The day after I was born, on April 1, 1940, as a new Attorney \nGeneral, he spoke to the U.S. attorneys from across the country. They \nwere assembled in the Great Hall at the Department of Justice in \nWashington. He told them about the responsibilities of being a Federal \nprosecutor. I think it is appropriate today to recall his guidance. His \nwords serve to show the Senate and the American people how wrong this \nAdministration's practices are and how far off the mark.\n  This is what then-Attorney General Jackson said and they are words \nthat serve today. He said:\n\n       The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and \n     reputation than any other person in America. His discretion \n     is tremendous. While the prosecutor at his best is one of the \n     most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from \n     malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.\n       Because of this immense power to strike at citizens, not \n     with mere individual strength, but with all of the force of \n     government itself, the post of Federal District Attorney from \n     the very beginning has been safeguarded by presidential \n     appointment, requiring confirmation of the Senate of the \n     United States.\n       Your responsibility in your several districts for law \n     enforcement and for its methods cannot be wholly surrendered \n     to Washington.\n\n  Robert H. Jackson continued:\n\n       If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his cases, it \n     follows that he can choose his defendants. Therein is the \n     most dangerous power of the prosecutor: That he will pick \n     people that he thinks he should get, rather than pick cases \n     that need to be prosecuted.\n       It is in this realm in which the prosecutor picks some \n     person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects \n     some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an \n     offense, that the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting \n     power lies. It is here that law enforcement becomes personal, \n     and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the \n     predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong \n     political views, or being personally obnoxious to or in the \n     way of the prosecutor himself.\n       In times of fear or hysteria political, racial, religious, \n     social, and economic groups, often for the best of motives, \n     cry for the scalps of individuals or groups because they do \n     not like their views. Those who are in office or apt to \n     regard as ``subversive'' the activities of any of those who \n     would bring about a change of administration.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Attorney \nGeneral Jackson's full statement be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have said many times on this floor that \none of the greatest opportunities I have ever had in my public life was \nto serve for 8 years as a prosecutor. Prosecutors have to be \nindependent. Prosecutors have to prosecute without fear of favor. \nProsecutors can never not prosecute someone because they are a \nRepublican or Democrat; they have to do it because they have to uphold \nthe law.\n  Let us restore the situation where our Federal prosecutors, whether \nwe have a Democratic President or a Republican President, serve the law \nand not a political purpose. That is what prosecutors have to do. Many \nof us in this Chamber have served as prosecutors and know that is what \nwe meant when we took our oath of office. Let's not have a system that \nat the outset subverts that oath of office.\n  I wish to commend Senator Feinstein for leading this effort and \nSenator Specter, the ranking Republican on our committee, for joining \nher. We have all cosponsored the substitute to restore the statutory \nchecks that existed. I commend the many Senators who contributed to \nthis debate, including the majority leader, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nDurbin, both Senators from Arkansas, Senator Whitehouse, Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator Schumer, Senator Murray, Senator Cardin, and Senator \nKlobuchar.\n  Many speak from their own experiences as former prosecutors.\n  Let's pass this bill without amendments. We have a piece of \nlegislation to protect the integrity of prosecutors and law \nenforcement. Let's pass it without amendment, pass it as it is, and \nstrike a blow for the integrity of our Federal prosecutors and strike a \nblow for law enforcement. Because if you politicize a prosecutor, you \npoliticize everybody in the whole chain of law enforcement. We should \nnever do that. Let's pass this bill and restore integrity to Federal \nlaw enforcement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         The Federal Prosecutor\n\n(By Robert H. Jackson, Attorney General of the United States, April 1, \n                                 1940)\n\n       It would probably be within the range of that exaggeration \n     permitted in Washington to say that assembled in this room is \n     one of the most powerful peace-time forces known to our \n     country. The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, \n     and reputation than any other person in America. His \n     discretion is tremendous. He can have citizens investigated \n     and, if he is that kind of person, he can have this done to \n     the tune of public statements and veiled or unveiled \n     intimations. Or the prosecutor may choose a more subtle \n     course and simply have a citizen's friends interviewed. The \n     prosecutor can order arrests, present cases to the grand jury \n     in secret session, and on the basis of his one-sided \n     presentation of the facts, can cause the citizen to be \n     indicted and held for trial. He may dismiss the case before \n     trial, in which case the defense never has a chance to be \n     heard. Or he may go on with a public trial. If he obtains a \n     conviction, the prosecutor can still make recommendations as \n     to sentence, as to whether the prisoner should get probation \n     or a suspended sentence, and after he is put away, as to \n     whether he is a fit subject for parole. While the prosecutor \n     at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our \n     society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he \n     is one of the worst.\n       These powers have been granted to our law enforcement \n     agencies because it seems necessary that such a power to \n     prosecute be lodged somewhere. This authority has been \n     granted by people who really wanted the right thing done--\n     wanted crime eliminated--but also wanted the best in our \n     American traditions preserved.\n       Because of this immense power to strike at citizens, not \n     with mere individual strength, but with all the force of \n     government itself, the post of Federal District Attorney from \n     the very beginning has been safeguarded by presidential \n     appointment, requiring confirmation of the Senate of the \n     United States. You are thus required to win an expression of \n     confidence in your character by both the legislative and the \n     executive branches of the government before assuming the \n     responsibilities of a federal prosecutor.\n       Your responsibility in your several districts for law \n     enforcement and for its methods cannot be wholly surrendered \n     to Washington, and ought not to be assumed by a centralized \n     Department of Justice. It is an unusual and rare instance \n     in which the local District Attorney should be superseded \n     in the handling of litigation, except where he requests \n     help of Washington. It is also clear that with his \n     knowledge of local sentiment and opinion, his contact with \n     and intimate knowledge of the views of the court, and his \n     acquaintance with the feelings of the group from which \n     jurors are drawn, it is an unusual case in which his \n     judgment should be overruled.\n       Experience, however, has demonstrated that some measure of \n     centralized control is necessary. In the absence of it \n     different district attorneys were striving for different \n     interpretations or applications of an Act, or were pursuing \n     different conceptions of policy. Also, to put it mildly, \n     there were differences in the degree of diligence and zeal in \n     different districts. To promote uniformity of policy and \n     action, to establish some standards of performance, and to \n     make available specialized help, some degree of centralized \n     administration was found necessary.\n       Our problem, of course, is to balance these opposing \n     considerations. I desire to avoid any lessening of the \n     prestige and influence of the district attorneys in their \n     districts. At the same time we must proceed in all districts \n     with that uniformity of policy which is necessary to the \n     prestige of federal law.\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\n       Nothing better can come out of this meeting of law \n     enforcement officers than a rededication to the spirit of \n     fair play and decency that should animate the federal \n     prosecutor. Your positions are of such independence and \n     importance that while you are being diligent, strict, and \n     vigorous in law enforcement you can also afford to be just. \n     Although the government technically loses its case, it has \n     really won if justice has been done. The lawyer in public \n     office is justified in seeking to leave behind him a good \n     record. But he must remember that his most alert and severe, \n     but just, judges will be the members of his own profession, \n     and that lawyers rest their good opinion of each other not \n     merely on results accomplished but on the quality of the \n     performance. Reputation has been called ``the shadow cast by \n     one's daily life.'' Any prosecutor who risks his day-to-day \n     professional name for fair dealing to build up statistics of \n     success has a perverted sense of practical values, as well as \n     defects of character. Whether one seeks promotion to a \n     judgeship, as many prosecutors rightly do, or whether he \n     returns to private practice, he can have no better asset than \n     to have his profession recognize that his attitude toward \n     those who feel his power has been dispassionate, reasonable \n     and just.\n       The federal prosecutor has now been prohibited from \n     engaging in political activities. I am convinced that a good-\n     faith acceptance of the spirit and letter of that doctrine \n     will relieve many district attorneys from the embarrassment \n     of what have heretofore been regarded as legitimate \n     expectations of political service. There can also be no doubt \n     that to be closely identified with the intrigue, the money \n     raising, and the machinery of a particular party or faction \n     may present a prosecuting officer with embarrassing \n     alignments and associations. I think the Hatch Act should be \n     utilized by federal prosecutors as a protection against \n     demands on their time and their prestige to participate in \n     the operation of the machinery of practical politics.\n       There is a most important reason why the prosecutor should \n     have, as nearly as possible, a detached and impartial view of \n     all groups in his community. Law enforcement is not \n     automatic. It isn't blind. One of the greatest difficulties \n     of the position of prosecutor is that he must pick his cases, \n     because no prosecutor can even investigate all of the cases \n     in which he receives complaints. If the Department of Justice \n     were to make even a pretense of reaching every probable \n     violation of federal law, ten times its present staff would \n     be inadequate. We know that no local police force can \n     strictly enforce the traffic laws, or it would arrest half \n     the driving population on any given morning. What every \n     prosecutor is practically required to do it to select the \n     cases for prosecution and to select those in which the \n     offense is the most flagrant, the public harm the greatest, \n     and the proof the most certain.\n       If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his cases, it \n     follows that he can choose his defendants. Therein is the \n     most dangerous power of the prosecutor: that he will pick \n     people that he thinks he should get, rather than pick cases \n     that need to be prosecuted. With the law books filled with a \n     great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a fair chance \n     of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the \n     part of almost anyone. In such a case, it is not a question \n     of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for \n     the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the \n     man and then searching the law books, or putting \n     investigators to work, to pin some offense on him. It is in \n     this realm--in which the prosecutor picks some person whom he \n     dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of \n     unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the \n     greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies. It is \n     here that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real \n     crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or \n     governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, \n     or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the \n     prosecutor himself.\n       In times of fear or hysteria political, racial, religious, \n     social, and economic groups, often from the best of motives, \n     cry for the scalps of individuals or groups because they do \n     not like their views. Particularly do we need to be \n     dispassionate and courageous in those cases which deal with \n     so-called ``subversive activities.'' They are dangerous to \n     civil liberty because the prosecutor has no definite \n     standards to determine what constitutes a ``subversive \n     activity,'' such as we have for murder or larceny. Activities \n     which seem benevolent and helpful to wage earners, persons on \n     relief, or those who are disadvantaged in the struggle for \n     existence may be regarded as ``subversive'' by those whose \n     property interests might be burdened or affected thereby. \n     Those who are in office are apt to regard as ``subversive'' \n     the activities of any of those who would bring about a change \n     of administration. Some of our soundest constitutional \n     doctrines were once punished as subversive. We must not \n     forget that it was not so long ago that both the term \n     ``Republican'' and the term ``Democrat'' were epithets with \n     sinister meaning to denote persons of radical tendencies that \n     were ``subversive'' of the order of things then dominant.\n       In the enforcement of laws which protect our national \n     integrity and existence, we should prosecute any and every \n     act of violation, but only overt acts, not the expression of \n     opinion, or activities such as the holding of meetings, \n     petitioning of Congress, or dissemination of news or \n     opinions. Only by extreme care can we protect the spirit as \n     well as the letter of our civil liberties, and to do so is a \n     responsibility of the federal prosecutor.\n       Another delicate task is to distinguish between the federal \n     and the local in law enforcement activities. We must bear in \n     mind that we are concerned only with the prosecution of acts \n     which the Congress has made federal offenses. Those acts we \n     should prosecute regardless of local sentiment, regardless of \n     whether it exposes lax local enforcement, regardless of \n     whether it makes or breaks local politicians.\n       But outside of federal law each locality has the right \n     under our system of government to fix its own standards of \n     law enforcement and of morals. And the moral climate of the \n     United States is as varied as its physical climate. For \n     example, some states legalize and permit gambling, some \n     states prohibit it legislatively and protect it \n     administratively, and some try to prohibit it entirely.\n       The same variation of attitudes towards other law-\n     enforcement problems exists. The federal government could not \n     enforce one kind of law in one place and another kind \n     elsewhere. It could hardly adopt strict standards for loose \n     states or loose standards for strict states without doing \n     violence to local sentiment. In spite of the temptation to \n     divert our power to local conditions where they have become \n     offensive to our sense of decency, the only long-term policy \n     that will save federal justice from being discredited by \n     entanglements with local politics is that it confine itself \n     to strict and impartial enforcement of federal law, letting \n     the chips fall in the community where they may. Just as there \n     should be no permitting of local considerations to stop \n     federal enforcement, so there should be no striving to \n     enlarge our power over local affairs and no use of federal \n     prosecutions to exert an indirect influence that would be \n     unlawful if exerted directly.\n       The qualities of a good prosecutor are as elusive and as \n     impossible to define as those which mark a gentleman. And \n     those who need to be told would not understand it anyway. A \n     sensitiveness to fair play and sportsmanship is perhaps the \n     best protection against the abuse of power, and the citizen's \n     safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human \n     kindness, who seeks truth and not victims, who serves the law \n     and not factional purposes, and who approaches his task with \n     humility.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that between the \nvotes there be 2 minutes equally divided in the usual fashion.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the first vote will be on the amendment which \nI have offered which solves the problem that has been described here, \nunlike the underlying bill which does not solve the problem.\n  The problem is that the U.S. Attorney General can appoint interim \nattorneys and the Senate doesn't have a chance to confirm them. My \namendment repeals that section of the law; the underlying bill does \nnot. So it is still possible in the future, under the underlying bill, \nfor the Attorney General to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without \nSenate confirmation. If he doesn't do that, then a Federal district \njudge makes the appointment, again without the Senate having the \nability to act on the nomination. Again, my amendment solves that \nproblem by requiring the President to nominate a candidate for U.S. \nattorney and requiring the Senate to act on that nomination. Should the \nPresident not fulfill his responsibility, the requirements for the \nSenate to act are vitiated. So there is a powerful incentive for the \nPresident to nominate.\n\n  The underlying bill reinstates the old law. The Senator from \nCalifornia has said the old system, which is the basis for her \nlegislation, has worked well for 20 years. It hasn't worked well. The \nSenate has no ability to act on a nominee when there is no nominee. \nUnder the existing law, the district court judge appoints the U.S. \nattorney. We have no ability to say yes or no to that individual. So I \nwould argue that, from the Senate's prerogative and point of view, it \nhas not worked well.\n  Secondly, yesterday, I noted two situations, one in the district for \nWest Virginia in 1987, where the system of having a Federal judge \nappoint the\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\nU.S. attorney did not work well at all. It is a case that perhaps the \nPresiding Officer is aware of. Eventually, the Justice Department had \nto remove the investigative files from the U.S. Attorney's Office and \nhad to direct the nominee to recuse herself from some criminal matters \nuntil a background check could be effectuated. The situation was not \nresolved until another U.S. attorney was approved by the Senate.\n  We had the odd situation 2 years ago in South Dakota where we ended \nup having two U.S. attorneys serving at the same time because of the \nappointment by a district judge. The point is, the old system did not \nwork well. In any event, the Senate has no say in the matter when a \ndistrict judge appoints the U.S. attorney.\n  Conclusion: We have all recognized a problem exists. The problem is a \nU.S. attorney can be appointed without the Senate ever having a say in \nit, either by the Attorney General, as an interim, or by a district \njudge. The underlying bill permits both of those practices to continue. \nMy amendment precludes both of those practices. It eliminates the \nAttorney General's ability to appoint an interim U.S. attorney and it \neliminates the district court's ability to do so. It puts the \nresponsibility where it belongs, on the shoulders of the President and \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, am I recognized under the agreement for \n1 minute?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is a friendly amendment to the \nFeinstein amendment. It would simply eliminate the difficulty that has \noccurred over the years when Federal judges, given the power of \nappointment, have appointed individuals who do not have security \nclearances and aren't able to function in the office, aren't able to \nparticipate in sensitive cases.\n  I would note that in recent years, U.S. attorneys have been given \nsubstantial responsibility against terrorism.\n  In every U.S. Attorney's Office today, there are the most highly \nsecure telephones. They are wired into the most serious terrorism \nsituations that might occur, and they become a coordinating officer in \nmany instances. This would eliminate the danger of a judge appointing \nsomeone not qualified to participate as an effective member of that \nteam because they lack the security clearance. It would require \nappointing someone with law enforcement experience and security \nclearance. This is a technical amendment. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There will be order in the Senate.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is a technical but important amendment that \nguarantees that any appointee to the office of U.S. attorney, a \ncritical component in our law enforcement and terrorism matters, will \nhave the required security clearance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are trying to put the law back to the \nway it was before this little amendment was slipped into the PATRIOT \nAct. We should oppose the amendment of the Senator from Alabama. It \nwould not put it back the way it was. Actually, under this amendment, \nthe Senator from Alabama could not have been appointed U.S. attorney, \nand former Attorney General Thornburg and former Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Larry Thompson could not have been.\n  The President should move quickly to appoint the U.S. attorney if \nthere is a vacancy, but in the meantime, the judges are in the best \nposition to appoint somebody. I hope a district court never has to make \nan appointment. But let's assume you have a case where there is \nwidespread corruption. The judge has to be able to put in someone \nindependent. It worked well for 100 years. It was changed by something \nslipped into the PATRIOT Act. Let's go back to the way we were, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I oppose this amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of S. 214, Senator Feinstein's legislation to restore the \nindependence of our U.S. attorneys. Like many in this body, I have \nwatched in dismay as more and more details of this administration's \nefforts to fire Federal prosecutors and replace them with loyal \npartisans have become public. There has been a great deal of discussion \nof these facts on the floor of this Senate--the fact that those U.S. \nattorneys who were fired were criticized in one e-mail for not being \n``loyal Bushies,'' and the fact that many of these U.S. attorneys had \nreceived glowing personnel reviews in the time leading up to their \nfirings.\n  But one of the facts that I think we are losing sight of in this \ndebate is the critical role that U.S. attorneys play in this country. \nThese are incredibly important jobs, and the people that hold them are \nresponsible for overseeing the most complex and serious prosecutions of \nthe most treacherous crimes. U.S. attorneys around the country are \nresponsible for overseeing major conspiracy cases including organized \ncrime, large-scale drug trafficking by organized gangs, terrorism, and \npolitical corruption.\n  While these are political appointments, in the past, mere political \nloyalty was not generally sufficient to get you the job. In the past, \nunder both Republican and Democratic administrations, you also needed \nto have the support of the legal community in the district and to have \ndemonstrated solid legal skills. Ensuring that people who were known in \nthe community and had the necessary judgment, skills, and independence \nto fulfill the demands of these positions is the reason that home State \nSenators are consulted.\n  It is because the importance of these positions has long been \nrecognized on a bipartisan basis that it is simply astonishing that \nthis administration gave real consideration to summarily dismissing all \n94 U.S. attorneys. Even more appalling is that the Attorney General, \nthe man who earlier this year told the Judiciary Committee that he \nwould ``never ever make a change in the United States attorney position \nfor political reasons,'' was involved in those discussions.\n  As difficult as it is to believe that the administration seriously \nconsidered wholesale replacement of the U.S. attorneys, it is even more \ntroubling that they proceeded to summarily dismiss eight prosecutors \nfor very murky reasons and then tried to justify their actions as \nperformance based. Given that each of the prosecutors underwent a \ndetailed favorable review, it has become very clear that this is simply \nnot true.\n  More troubling still is that at least three of the fired prosecutors \nwere involved in political corruption probes that were not proceeding \nin a way that the administration viewed as politically favorable, and \nin at least two of these cases lawmakers and their staff personally \nintervened with the prosecutors.\n  As if a large-scale effort to fire lead Federal prosecutors for \npolitical reasons wasn't sufficient, the Department of Justice clearly \nintended to replace sitting prosecutors with highly political White \nHouse and other administration staffers on an ``interim'' basis without \nsending them to the Senate for confirmation. That is what this bill \nbefore us today addresses. It revokes the ability of the Attorney \nGeneral to appoint an interim U.S. attorney for an indefinite period of \ntime and thus avoid the Senate confirmation process. This is just one \nof the problematic provisions slipped into the PATRIOT Act and I \ncommend Senator Feinstein for her efforts to bring this issue to light \nand to restore the balance to the process of appointing U.S. attorneys.\n  While the Deputy Attorney General has insisted that it wasn't the \nintent of the Department of Justice to avoid Senate confirmation, this \nhas been flatly contradicted by the documents. In discussing the \nappointment of Karl Rove's Deputy Tim Griffin as the ``interim'' U.S. \nattorney in Arkansas, the former Chief of Staff to Attorney General \nGonzales, Kyle Sampson, wrote in December 2006: ``I think we should gum \nthis to death . . . Ask the senators to give Tim a chance, meet with \nhim, give him some time in office to see how he performs, etc. If they \nultimately say `no never' (and the longer we can forestall that the \nbetter), then we can tell them we'll look for other candidates, ask \nthem for recommendations, interview their candidates, and otherwise run \nout the clock. All this should be done in `good faith' of course.''\n  The decision to fire the U.S. attorneys was finalized after the \nelections and the knowledge that Democrats would be taking control of \nthe Senate. But even so, it raises the question of why the White House \nwould feel it necessary to avoid Senate confirmation. After all, many \nof the current U.S. attorneys were confirmed smoothly under Democratic \ncontrol in 2001 and 2002. Again, Kyle Sampson has the answer for us. In \nan early email, he laid out the benefits of avoiding the Senate \nstating: ``we can give far less deference to home-state senators and \nthereby get (1) our preferred person appointed and (2) do it far faster \nand more efficiently, at less political cost to the White House.''\n  This bill before us today restores the status quo prior to the \nrenewal of the PATRIOT Act last fall by repealing the ability of the \nAdministration to appoint ``interim'' U.S. attorneys for indefinite \nperiods of time. I am glad the administration has dropped its \nopposition to this bill, and I look forward to seeing the President \nsign this bill in to law. But this exercise has been an eye-opener for \nthose of us in the Senate, and I hope for the American people, about \nthe contempt this administration has for the Congress and the \nwillingness of the administration to politicize any and every office. \nIt has also, once again, underscored the value of oversight into our \nsystem of government. For the past 6 years, this administration has \noperated without any independent check on its power. But those days are \nover. By passing this legislation and beginning the necessary work to \nrestore the integrity of our Nation's U.S. attorneys, we can begin to \nrestore Americans faith in our system of justice.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for S. 214, \nwhich would serve to protect the independence of our U.S. attorneys.\n  The administration's attack on sitting U.S. attorneys is an \nunprecedented abuse of power. The White House and the Attorney General \ninjected politics into the process and chose to fire eight U.S. \nattorneys, including our U.S. attorney in San Diego, Carol Lam. These \nattorneys were not fired because of poor job performance, as the \nAttorney General initially claimed, but because in one way or another \nthey did not carry out the political agenda of the White House.\n  Despite the administration's efforts to downplay and spin these \nevents to Congress, we now know that this plan was orchestrated at the \nhighest levels of the White House. For example, Karl Rove misled the \npublic when he asserted that the Justice Department's action was \ncomparable to President Clinton's actions. This is untrue. No \nadministration has ever lashed out and fired a group of their own U.S. \nattorneys in the middle of a term.\n  There is an immediate need for legislation to ensure that the \nadministration can no longer appoint new U.S. attorneys without Senate \nconfirmation. I thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for her superb \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, time and time again we have seen this \nadministration's inability to divorce politics from policy in areas \nthat politics should have no place. The recent firing of eight U.S. \nattorneys lends yet another example to that failure. It is clear that \nsome of these firings were politically motivated. I support S. 214 and \nhave cosponsored this legislation because it will restore the 120-day \nlimit for interim appointments made by the\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\nAttorney General and restore the district court's role in making any \nsubsequent interim appointments to deter the kind of Department of \nJustice actions we have seen recently.\n  Until 1986, interim U.S. attorneys were appointed by their respective \ndistrict courts and were allowed to serve until the vacancy was filled \nby a U.S. attorney nominated by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate. In 1986, the law was changed to allow the Attorney General to \nmake an interim appointment for 120 days, provided the appointee was \nnot a person for whom the Senate had refused to give advice and \nconsent. If a successor was not named at the end of the 120-day period, \nthen the district court would appoint a U.S. attorney to serve until \nthe vacancy was filled. This process remained unchanged for 20 years, \nuntil last year.\n  During the PATRIOT Act Reauthorization last year, the process was \naltered to eliminate appointments by the district court and to allow \nthe Attorney General to appoint an interim U.S. attorney indefinitely, \nor until the vacancy is filled by a U.S. attorney nominated by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate.\n  The legislation before us today is simple: it would repeal those \nchanges, which were made without debate, and would require an interim \nappointment made by the Attorney General to expire after 120 days or \nwhen a successor is nominated by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate, whichever comes first. If at the end of the 120-day period no \nsuccessor has been confirmed, the relevant district court would be \nauthorized to appoint an interim U.S. attorney to serve until the \nvacancy is filled. The legislation would also terminate existing \ninterim appointments 120 days from enactment or upon confirmation of a \nsuccessor, whichever comes first.\n  We all know that U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the \nPresident. However, U.S. attorneys are supposed to be loyal to the \nConstitution, not the President and Attorney General. When they are \nsworn in, U.S. attorneys swear to ``support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' There \nis no requirement that U.S. attorneys ``exhibit loyalty to the \nPresident and Attorney General,'' as was said to be a goal in an e-mail \nfrom Kyle Sampson, former chief of staff to Attorney General Gonzales, \nrecommending the retention of those attorneys.\n  One of the U.S. attorneys who was asked to resign was Margaret \nChiara, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Michigan. In an e-\nmail dated March 2, 2005, Kyle Sampson wrote to then White House \nCounsel Harriet Miers, designating Ms. Chiara as one of the U.S. \nattorneys who was recommended for removal because she was one of the \n``weak U.S. attorneys who have been ineffectual managers and \nprosecutors, chafed against Administration initiatives, etc.'' That \nassessment ran contrary to the Department of Justice's evaluation of \nMs. Chiara, which found her to be well regarded, hard working and a \ncapable leader who had the respect and confidence of the judiciary, \nagencies, and U.S. Attorney's Office personnel. Further, during Ms. \nChiara's tenure as the U.S. attorney from the Western District of \nMichigan, she achieved an overall increase of more than 15 percent in \nfelony prosecutions and convictions (the Northern Division alone \nexperienced an increase of 84 percent in the number of criminal cases \nprosecuted during the 2-year period of 2003-2005). The Department of \nJustice invited Ms. Chiara to serve on several key subcommittees of the \nAttorney General's Advisory Committee. Ms. Chiara developed an attorney \ntraining and mentoring program for the Western District of Michigan \nthat now serves as a national model that was acknowledged as a ``best \npractice'' by the Department of Justice. Ms. Chiara was awarded the \n``Building Bridges Award'' by the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination \nCommittee, and ``Lifetime Achievement Recognition'' by the Women's \nHistorical Center and Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.\n  On December 7, 2006, Mr. Sampson e-mailed William Mercer, then acting \nAssociate Attorney General, stating that ``All Senators have been \nnotified and are fine/no objections.'' Apparently Republican Senators \nwere contacted, but Democrats were not contacted. This Senator was not \nnotified. In fact, the ``Plan for Replacing Certain United States \nAttorneys'' drafted by Mr. Sampson, states that, on December 7, ``where \nthere is no Republican home-state Senator, the home-state `Bush \npolitical lead[s]' are contacted.'' Obviously, it was more important to \ncontact the ``political lead'' than the home-state Senators of these \nU.S. attorneys, which is further evidence that these firings had \npolitical motivations.\n  I am pleased that we will pass this important legislation today, to \nrestore integrity and political confidence to the process of filling \nthe vacancies of U.S. attorneys. I am also pleased that the Judiciary \nCommittee will continue their investigation into this matter by issuing \nsubpoenas, if necessary.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as part of the PATRIOT Act's \nreauthorization in 2006, Congress bestowed upon the Attorney General \nnew authority to appoint interim U.S. attorneys indefinitely, without \nany independent oversight. The Department of Justice proceeded to abuse \nthis provision to orchestrate a series of firings of U.S. attorneys. An \never-growing body of evidence reveals that the firings were little more \nthan a political purge. To defend its conduct, the Department of \nJustice gave Congress misleading testimony about these politically \nmotivated firings, tarnishing the professional reputations of these \nU.S. attorneys in the process. Sadly, this is only the latest in a long \nseries of episodes that call into question the independence and the \nleadership of an Attorney General more concerned with advancing a \npartisan agenda than impartially enforcing the law. It is unacceptable \nthat the Attorney General has allowed his loyalty to the President to \npoliticize the Department of Justice and corrupt the administration of \njustice. Because his conduct is unbecoming an Attorney General, I have \ncalled on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign his post.\n  For these same reasons I support and am a cosponsor of Senator \nFeinstein's Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007, \nwhich would reinstate the process for the appointment of interim U.S. \nattorneys that existed for 20 years prior to 2006. Senator Feinstein's \nlegislation would authorize the Attorney General to make an interim \nappointment for 120 days. If a successor is not named and confirmed by \nthe Senate at the end of the 120-day period, then the relevant district \ncourt must appoint a U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is \nfilled. The legislation's provisions are also retroactive, meaning it \nwould also terminate existing interim appointments 120 days from its \nenactment, or upon confirmation of a successor, whichever comes first. \nThe legislation is an important measure that will make great strides \ntoward restoring the historic independence of the U.S. attorneys.\n  But even with the passage of this legislation, there is still a lot \nof explaining to be done by the Attorney General and the Bush \nadministration. Numerous questions remain about who called for the U.S. \nattorney firings, what specific reasons were cited to justify the \nfirings, and to what extent the White House participated in the \ndecision to achieve political ends. The Attorney General and the \nPresident and their respective staffs need to be forthcoming with \nexplanations and documents that answer these and other questions and \nend the current practice of providing misleading, inconsistent, and \nunclear responses.\n  Some have attempted to defend the Attorney General's inexcusable \nbehavior by positing arguments that divert attention away from what \nreally occurred. First, much has been made of the fact that these fired \nU.S. attorneys served at the pleasure of the President and thus were \nsubject to dismissal at any time. The administration's desire to have \nU.S. attorneys engage in politically motivated investigations in direct \nviolation of their obligation to impartially enforce the law cannot \nserve as proper grounds for dismissal. Terminating these Federal \nprosecutors because they refused to serve as partisan henchmen cannot \nbe the source of the President's displeasure.\n  Further, the assertion that the Clinton administration engaged in \nsimilar misdeeds is also baseless. Holdover U.S. attorneys appointed by \na previous administration are routinely replaced by the new incoming \nPresident. Even Stuart M. Gerson, Assistant Attorney General in the \nadministration of President\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, observed, ``It is customary for a President to \nreplace U.S. attorneys at the beginning of a term.'' This practice \nallows the new President to appoint new Federal prosecutors who share \nhis or her priorities and strategy for fighting crime. You will find \nsimilar turnover when President Bush replaced President Clinton in 2001 \nand when President Reagan replaced President Carter in 1981.\n  The firings we are seeing today are nothing like what happened in \n1981, 1993, or 2001. The essential question here is why were these U.S. \nattorneys--President Bush's own appointees--fired in the middle of his \nsecond term. There is substantial evidence that the Bush administration \nfired them for political reasons: for pursuing corruption charges \nagainst Republicans too aggressively, for failing to prosecute \nDemocrats aggressively enough, or for not pursuing what one U.S. \nattorney described as ``bogus'' election claims against Democrats and \npublic interest groups in the months leading up to the 2006 elections. \nThis incursion on the independence of U.S. attorneys is unacceptable \nconduct, and the Attorney General and administration must be honest \nwith the American people about what happened.\n  The Attorney General took an oath to uphold our Constitution and \nrespect the rule of law. But time and time again, he has demonstrated \nthat his loyalties lie with the President and his political agenda, not \nthe American people or the evenhanded and impartial enforcement of our \nlaws. In executing the White House's political directives by firing \nU.S. attorneys who would not carry out the administration's partisan \nwitch hunts, the Attorney General undermined the objectives of the \nDepartment of Justice, putting politics ahead of the just enforcement \nof the law. The Department of Justice should not serve as a political \narm of any party, and U.S. attorneys should not double as political \noperatives. The administration's insistence to the contrary and the \nAttorney General's complicity are a betrayal of the highest order to \nthe fundamental mission of the Department of Justice to ensure fair and \nimpartial administration of justice for all Americans.\n  Attorney General Gonzales acknowledges that ``mistakes'' were made in \nthe dismissal of these U.S. attorneys and maintains that responsibility \nfor these unjustified firings lies with him. I agree. Because he has \nbetrayed his obligations and the trust of the American people, Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales should resign his post as head of the Department of \nJustice.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld its second hearing on the unprecedented dismissal of eight U.S. \nattorneys in December. In the past few days, increasingly disturbing \ninformation has come to light that suggests that Congress was \nintentionally misled with regard to why these U.S. attorneys were fired \nand who was involved in making the decision to fire them. Under the \nleadership of Chairman Leahy and Senator Schumer, the Judiciary \nCommittee will continue to investigate these matters in the coming \nweeks.\n  But today, we will vote on legislation to repeal a change in the law \nthat apparently helped to bring about these unfortunate events. I will \nvote in favor of S. 214 and against both amendments that have been \noffered.\n  In many ways, U.S. attorneys are the face of the Federal Government \nand of Federal law in our local jurisdictions. They make crucial \ndecisions on how federal law will be enforced. To faithfully execute \nthe law, they must be able to exercise that essential prosecutorial \ndiscretion that distinguishes our criminal justice system from a mere \ndraconian rule book that is applied without regard for the \ncircumstances of each individual case. Who fills these positions in our \nsystem is a matter of great consequence. That is why they are subject \nto confirmation by the Senate.\n  In Wisconsin, we take the nomination process for our two U.S. \nattorneys, and the participation of the Senate in that process, very \nseriously. In 1979, Senators William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson \ncreated the Wisconsin Federal Nominating Commission to advise them on \njudicial and U.S. attorney nominations. The Commission process has been \nused for over a quarter century, by both Republican and Democratic \nsenators from our State under both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents.\n  The Commission operates whenever a vacancy occurs for a Federal judge \nor U.S. attorney position in Wisconsin. The Commission reviews \napplications and then makes recommendations to the Senators. The two \nWisconsin Senators, now Senator Kohl and myself, choose from those \nrecommended by the Commission in making our recommendations to the \nPresident. This bipartisan Commission helps ensure that dedicated and \nqualified individuals fill the positions. It gives our citizens \nadditional assurance that these important nominations are made based on \nmerit, not politics. I believe commissions like this are a particularly \nreliable and transparent form of filling these vacancies.\n  That is one reason that I feel so strongly that the change made \nduring the PATRIOT Act reauthorization process to the process for \nappointing interim U.S. attorneys was a mistake: It allows the Justice \nDepartment to sidestep the confirmation process for U.S. attorneys \naltogether. There is simply no good reason why the Attorney General \nneeds the power to make indefinite interim appointments. When it \nexercises that power, the administration cuts Congress, and in the case \nof my state, the people of Wisconsin, out of that process.\n  As some of the recently released emails from the Attorney General's \nchief of staff reveal, this change in law allowing the Attorney General \nto make indefinite interim appointments was going to be used to \ncircumvent congressional involvement and instead install preselected \n``interim'' replacements for the fired U.S. attorneys with no intention \nto seek Senate confirmation. Worse yet, the emails indicate that the \nDepartment of Justice was actively planning to pretend it was following \na traditional confirmation process ``in good faith.'' Such blatant \ndisregard for Congress's legitimate role in this process--and for the \nintegrity of a three branch system of government in general--is simply \nunacceptable.\n  S. 214 will repeal the provision that prompted this plan to \ncircumvent the confirmation process. Enacting this bill is an important \nstart in preventing further abuses.\n  I want to note that the concerns expressed by some of my colleagues \nabout the involvement of the district courts in making interim \nappointments just don't ring true. Beginning in the late 1800s, and \ncontinuing until the fiasco of this past year, district courts were \ninvolved in the interim appointment process. In the time that the \ndistrict courts were involved, either exclusively--until 1986--or as a \nfail-safe after the Attorney General exercised a temporary appointment \npower--from 1986-2006--the interim appointment process went smoothly. \nNever before have we seen an administration hatch a plan to replace a \nlarge number of U.S. attorneys in the middle of a term for what appear \nto be political reasons. The reason, of course, is that until this \nyear, individuals appointed on an interim basis could only serve for \n120 days without Senate confirmation.\n  By repealing this clearly ill-advised change to interim appointment \npower and returning to the law used for the previous 20 years, S. 214 \nallows for the needed flexibility to accommodate short-term interim \nappointments made by the Attorney General while also ensuring that the \nSenate confirmation process remains in place for permanent \nappointments. And the Senate confirmation process allows states like \nmine to encourage a transparent and accountable selection process for \nthese important positions.\n  These are grave matters, for it is absolutely vital that our citizens \nbe able to rely on the integrity of the justice system. It is equally \nimportant that they have confidence that individuals who represent the \nFederal Government in the justice system are above reproach, and are \nacting in the interest of justice--and not politics--at all times. Even \nan appearance of impropriety can harm our judicial system and, in turn, \nharm the rule of law by undermining citizens' confidence in its \nintegrity.\n  Whatever role political motivations played in the dismissals of these \nU.S. attorneys--and each day more evidence surfaces to suggest that \npolitics did, in fact, play quite a large role--I think it\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\nis clear that the administration has not acted in a manner that upholds \nthe best interests of law enforcement and the reputation of our \ncriminal justice system. We have a duty to remedy this problem, and \npassing S. 214 is an important step towards doing so.\n  We must ensure that there is, once again, some accountability in how \nU.S. attorneys are selected to serve. It is the very least that we can \ndo to help restore the public's confidence that our criminal justice \nsystem is above partisan interference.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Robert Browning, a brilliant British poet, \nonce wrote a stirring poem about an unpleasant subject, namely: Rats.\n  A key section of the poem reads as follows:\n\n     Out of the houses the rats came tumbling.\n     Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,\n     Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats.\n     Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,\n     Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,\n     Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,\n     Families by tens and dozens,\n     Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--\n     Followed the Piper for their lives.\n\n  Mr. President, it is gotten so that, every morning when I open the \npaper and see another story describing the administration's \nincompetence or wrongdoing, Robert Browning's vision of administration \nwrongdoers tumbling out of the house comes into my mind. ``Brothers, \nsisters, husbands, and wives,'' who followed the misled Piper--in this \ncase, the President, ``for their lives.'' And they may pay dearly, as a \nresult. Just as the entire country is now paying dearly for the \narrogant, reckless and misguided policies of this Administration.\n  We see more clearly, every day, that the executive branch of our \nGovernment is in dire need of a thorough housecleaning, to rid itself \nof the conniving agents lodged in its bureaus, who apparently will stop \nat nothing to grab power for the Executive at the expense of the \nCongress and the People who send us here to represent them.\n  Last year, in one of several bills reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act--all \nof which I voted against--a small provision was added by the then-\nRepublican majority. It enabled administration officials to fire any \nU.S. attorney whose politics they did not like and replace them with \nwhat in Las Vegas are called ``shills.'' The word shill is defined by \nWebster's Dictionary to mean, ``one who acts as a pitchman''--in this \ncase, for the administration.\n  The provision, which was tucked into the PATRIOT Act reauthorization, \npermits the administration to fire and appoint new U.S. attorneys, \nwhose term in office can be indefinite and never subject to Senate \nconfirmation. What an abomination!\n  I was one of only ten U.S. Senators who voted against the legislation \nthat made this possible, and, in retrospect, I am feeling quite proud \nof that vote.\n  A U.S. attorney is supposed to be the chief Federal law enforcement \nofficer in his or her state. It is critical that U.S. attorneys be able \nto enforce the law and perform their duties, free of political pressure \nto achieve a partisan end. Federal law is to be applied fairly and \nobjectively; not to fuel a political witch hunt or to feather the nest \nof a political contributor.\n  This White House has made it crystal clear that it has no respect for \nthe separation of powers; no respect for our constitutional system of \nchecks and balances; and no respect for even the rule of law, going so \nfar as to pervert the appointment of U.S. attorneys for its own \npartisan purposes.\n  Well, key officials in this administration may be in for a rude \nawakening. The rule of law remains alive and well in the hearts of most \nAmericans. If our laws apply to the American people, must they not also \napply to the Justice Department? And to the White House? Imagine how \nbaffled the American public must be to hear that the nation's chief law \nenforcement officer, U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, defends \nthe administration's actions as follows: in the March 14 Washington \nPost, Attorney General Gonzales stated that he knew nothing of the \nscandal surrounding this issue, because he ``was not involved in seeing \nany memos, was not involved in any discussions about what was going \non,'' and, he said, ``that's basically what I knew as the attorney \ngeneral.''\n  Is that possible? Isn't that preposterous? Are we really to believe \nthat, as head of the Justice Department, the chief law enforcement \nofficer of the nation knew nothing about efforts to replace a plethora \nof U.S. attorneys nationwide? Which is worse: that he knew nothing that \nhis Deputy was doing, or, instead, that he did know there was a scheme \nin place, hatched by the White House, to evade congressional oversight?\n  The administration's appointment of these U.S. attorneys constitutes \na serious breach of the public trust. Americans don't want law \nenforcement officials appointed based on their good looks, family \nconnections, or because the Republican National Committee wants to \ngroom them to run for Congress some day. U.S. attorneys should be \nnominated and confirmed by the Senate based on merit. Only the \nConstitution affords the people the powers and the prerogatives that \nkeep us a free nation. The constitutional doctrines of checks and \nbalances and separation of powers are the foundations of our \ngovernment, so brilliantly formulated by the Founders in 1787. My long \nstudy of constitutional history and a lifetime of public service have \nmade me keenly aware of why so many Americans have given their lives to \nprotect these basic principles. This is why we must continue to fight \nto ensure that our constitutional rights and privileges are never \nundermined or trampled by an ambitious, overly zealous executive branch \nlike the one now in the White House. That is why we must enact S. 214--\nto restore the Senate's role in the confirmation of U.S. attorneys. The \nFounders granted the Senate the power of confirmation, precisely so \nthat we could prevent a corrupt White House from undertaking exactly \nthe indefensible actions that this White House has embraced with \nrespect to the appointment of U.S. attorneys. Let us put a stop to \nthose actions right here and right now.\n  Let us begin today to clean the house and rid our ship of state of \nthe pests that gnaw away at our constitutional protections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very proud to have supported the \nPreserving United States Attorney Independence Act we just passed in \nthe Senate. This bill will go a long way toward restoring the \nindependence of Federal prosecutors--an independence which has, \nunfortunately, been chipped away at in recent months and years.\n  I have been disappointed to watch the drama unfolding over the past \nfew weeks regarding the politicization of our justice system. Every \nday, as the Judiciary Committee continues its investigation, we see \nmore revelations of how the Department of Justice may have allowed \nportions of the U.S. attorney corps to become a vehicle for political \npatronage--this despite the fact that U.S. attorneys are among the most \npowerful public officials in our country, making virtually unreviewable \ndecisions about life and death, about punishment and leniency. They \nmake these kinds of decisions every single day all across this country.\n  The U.S. attorneys must be individuals who have integrity. They must \nbe above reproach. They must be free from any kind of partisan \npolitical interference.\n  I am disappointed the Department of Justice may have blurred the line \nbetween the representation of President Bush as a client and the \nrepresentation of the people of the United States. I understand that \ndistinction very well, having served both as chief counsel to the \nGovernor of my State as well as attorney general for the State of \nColorado. Those are two very different positions. One requires--in the \ncase of chief counsel to the Governor or chief counsel to the \nPresident--a lawyer-client relationship. The other--Attorney General--\nrequires the representation of the people whom you represent. In the \ncase of a State attorney general, you are the representative of the \npeople of that State. In the case of the U.S. Attorney General, you are \nthe representative of the people of the United States of America.\n  If Attorney General Gonzales has, indeed, crossed this line, then in \nmy view he has forfeited his right to lead the Department of Justice.\n  On January 28, 2005, I received a letter from Attorney General \nGonzales as part of his confirmation process in this U.S. Senate. In \nthat letter he reflected upon his understanding of the independence of \nthe Office of the Attorney General. I quote in part from that letter \nwhere he says the following:\n\n       If confirmed, I will lead the Department of Justice and act \n     on behalf of agencies and officials of the United States. \n     Nevertheless, my highest and most solemn obligation will be \n     to represent the interests of the People. I know that you \n     understand this solemn duty well from your prior service as \n     Chief Counsel to the Governor and as Colorado Attorney \n     General.\n\n  I would hope as the Senate Judiciary Committee moves forward in \nexamining the facts related to the allegations that have been raised, \nthe Judiciary Committee makes sure those facts are evaluated against \nthe standard of independence which is at the core of the Department of \nJustice and the U.S. Attorney General. If, in fact, this standard has \nbeen violated, then it is my view that Attorney General Gonzales \nshould, in fact, resign.\n  In the meantime, the Senate has a responsibility to ensure that \nFederal prosecutors are indeed independent of partisan politics, and \nthe bill we passed today is a good first step. But I believe we must do \nmore. Later this week, I will introduce a bill which I believe will \ntake us another important step toward restoring the independence of \nFederal prosecutors. I am hopeful it will be legislation that will have \nbroad bipartisan support. My bill would simply make it a crime to \ncoerce or to pressure or to attempt to influence a U.S. attorney's \ndecision whether to commence the investigation or prosecution of a \nperson based on that person's race, religion, sex, national origin, \npolitical activity, or political beliefs.\n  The U.S. Attorneys Manual itself, which is given to every U.S. \nattorney as they come into office, already prohibits any Federal \nprosecutor from taking action against a person for any of those \nreasons. My bill would make sure that standard of the United States \nAttorneys Manual is included in the law of the United States. It would \nalso extend the prohibitions that are set forth in that manual to \nindividuals who try to influence or manipulate Federal prosecutors.\n  Some may ask, why is this bill necessary? In my view, the bill is \nnecessary because over the past few weeks we have seen evidence that \nthe White House has politicized the appointment and termination of U.S. \nattorneys. We have also had concerns raised that individuals have tried \nto inject politics into the administration of justice.\n  I do not need to rehash the particulars of this controversy right \nnow, but suffice it to say many Senators on both sides of the aisle are \nconcerned that the independence of our Federal prosecutors has, in \nfact, been threatened. Fixing the process for appointment of interim \nprosecutors is an important first step, no doubt. But that alone will \nnot prevent individuals--whether from the Department of Justice or \nanywhere else--from attempting to influence the decisionmaking process \nof U.S. attorneys in an inappropriate manner. That is what my bill is \ndesigned to prevent.\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\n  In 1938, almost 70 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court set forth, in \nwhat I believe is seminal language, a standard of conduct that should \ngovern the actions and decisions of U.S. attorneys. In that decision, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court said the following:\n\n       The United States Attorney is the representative not of an \n     ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty\n\n``but of a sovereignty''--\n\n     whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as \n     its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, \n     therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win \n     a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a \n     peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the \n     twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or \n     innocence suffer.\n\n``guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.''\n\n       He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor--indeed, he \n     should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not \n     at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to \n     refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a \n     wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to \n     bring about a just one.\n\n  I believe these words the U.S. Supreme Court said in 1938 are equally \nas applicable today; that is, we are a nation of laws and we must \nunderstand that no person is above or below the law. If we are going to \nbe a nation of laws, we must make sure those individuals in whom we \nrepose the authority to prosecute and to enforce the laws of the United \nStates do so in an appropriate way that meets the standards that were \nset forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1938, and also which meets the \nstandards that are set forth in the manual that governs the conduct of \nthe U.S. attorneys. For many of us who have watched what has happened \nin Iraq and other places around the world, what we see is a failure of \nnations to develop a rule of law. That is what sets America apart from \nmany of these other countries that so struggle to create a safe and \nsecure society: they do not have the rule of law which is so important \nto us in this country. Therefore, I believe the legislation I will be \nintroducing will make sure that the Department of Justice and the U.S. \nattorneys within the Department of Justice are always in a position to \nuphold the rule of law for our Nation and make sure that their ability \nand their decisions are not compromised by any political influence.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I repeat the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me begin, if I may, by thanking the \nranking member, Senator Gregg, for the way in which he has conducted \nthe work of the committee on the minority side and the fairness with \nwhich he has conducted it when he was in the majority. I wish to say to \nhim that we will endeavor to approach this in the same way with him. \nThere will not be surprises. We will try to organize this in a way that \ngives each side a fair opportunity to make their points and to offer \ntheir amendments. I wish to again thank Senator Gregg for his courtesy \nand professionalism throughout both the times when he has been in the \nmajority and the times he has been in the minority.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution that has now passed the \ncommittee has these key elements:\n  It restores fiscal responsibility by balancing the budget by 2012, it \nreduces spending as a share of gross domestic product, it reduces debt \nas a share of gross domestic product after 2009, and it adopts new \ndisciplines, spending caps, and restores a strong pay-go rule. At the \nsame time, it meets the Nation's priorities by rejecting the \nPresident's cuts in key areas and provides increases for children's \nhealth care, for education, and for our Nation's veterans.\n  It also seeks to keep taxes low by protecting middle-class taxpayers \nwith 2 years of alternative minimum tax relief, the old millionaire's \ntax that has rapidly become a middle-class tax trap. It also includes a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for new tax relief and extensions of \nexpiring tax provisions.\n  Our goal is to be fiscally responsible but to do it in a way that \nkeeps tax rates low and addresses some of the other things we have seen \nthat have been brought before the committee, things that are serious \nproblems. We find abusive tax situations that have grown up around the \ncountry. We see the use of tax havens. We also see the tax gap growing \ngeometrically--the difference between what is owed and what is paid--\nand that is not fair to the vast majority of American taxpayers who pay \nwhat they owe.\n  So we try to keep taxes low, and we include no assumption of a tax \nincrease.\n  We also try to prepare for the long term by including a comparative \neffectiveness fund to address rising health care costs, looking at \nthose procedures and those disciplines and those technologies that work \nto hold down health care costs in one part of the country and to adopt \nthem in other parts of the country. We also adopt a new budget point of \norder against long-term deficit increases.\n  The budget resolution that came out of the committee and which we \nbring to the floor today starts with a $249 billion deficit and reduces \nit each and every year. In fact, we almost balance in 2011 under this \nproposal. We do achieve balance in 2012 with $132 billion to the plus \nside. One might say this is a surplus. I always hesitate to use that \nterm because the only reason it is in surplus is because of Social \nSecurity. Nonetheless, in terms of the way deficits are calculated and \nreported by the press, there is a $132 billion positive balance in \n2012.\n  One of the most important things we have to stop is the growth of the \ndebt. All the economists tell us the most important thing we have to do \nis to reverse the debt growing faster than the size of the economy. I \nam proud to report this budget does so. This shows\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\nthe debt, gross debt of the United States, as a share of gross domestic \nproduct. You can see that after 2009, each and every year we are \nbringing down the debt in relationship to the size of our economy. That \nis, by all accounts, the single most important thing we can do in terms \nof returning fiscal responsibility.\n  In terms of a spending comparison, the green line is the spending in \nthe budget resolution, the red line is the President's spending. You \ncan see there is a very close fit. We do spend more money than is in \nthe President's budget, but when you put it on a comparison basis and \nyou look at 5 years in which the United States will be spending just \nover $15 trillion, the difference between our spending and the \nPresident's is almost indecipherable.\n  As a share of gross domestic product, our spending is going down. In \n2008, we will be at 20.5 percent of GDP. Each and every year, spending \nas a share of GDP will be going down, so that by 2012 we have spending \nat 18.8 percent of gross domestic product.\n  The budget resolution has lower spending as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product than the average during the period of Republican \ncontrol. From 2003 to 2007, the average spending in Republican budget \nresolutions was 20.1 percent. Under our 5-year budget plan, the average \nwill be 19.7 percent, four-tenths of 1 percentage point below what the \nRepublican spending was in the years in which they controlled.\n  On the question of defense spending and war spending, we have matched \nthe President dollar for dollar. The President has total defense \nspending, and we are spending $2.9 trillion during this period. We \nmatch that amount. We have the same amount for defense and the same \namount for the war.\n\n  But there are other areas in which we do better. Perhaps the \nsignature proposal of this budget is to fully fund children's health \ncare, to say to every child in America: You are valued, and we want you \nto have health insurance. We believe this is substantively right, that \nthis is a good investment. Our children are the least expensive to \ncover, and you have the biggest payoff because you have an entire \nlifetime of return if you are able to safeguard a child's health. So we \nhave made a major commitment--up to $50 billion over the 5 years--to \nprovide the opportunity to provide America's children with health \ncoverage. The President only had $2 billion for this purpose. He \ncouldn't even cover those who have existing coverage. If there is one \nthing that unites our caucus, it is a vision of being able to extend \nhealth care coverage to every child in America. Our budget resolution \nwill help make that prospect a reality--if it is adopted.\n  This is from the Akron Beacon Journal in Ohio. Earlier this month, \nthey wrote:\n\n       The State Child Health Insurance Program arguably is the \n     best thing going for children in families with annual incomes \n     too high to be eligible for Medicaid but not high enough for \n     them to afford private health insurance . . . Statehouses \n     across the country consider the SCHIP a winner. . . . At \n     issue is President Bush's budget plan changing aspects of the \n     funding and direction of the program, forcing States to scale \n     back or scratch up more funds to keep their programs at \n     current levels. Why scramble something that is working well?\n\n  We have asked that question. Why is the President turning his back, \nin his budget, on millions of American children? Why is the President \nsaying we won't even provide coverage to those who already have it? Why \nisn't coverage being extended to the millions of young people in this \ncountry who have no health care coverage at all?\n  Another major area of priority in this budget is for education. The \nPresident provides in his budget, for just the fiscal year 2008--and I \nwish to emphasize that the previous numbers I have talked about were 5-\nyear numbers. I am now talking about just the year 2008. The \nPresident's budget for education is $56.2 billion. We are proposing \n$62.3 billion. Why? Because we believe education is an absolute \npriority. Education is our future. Education is what allows us to \nmaintain a competitive edge in this world. Education is what gives \nchildren in America the chance to make the most of their God-given \ntalent.\n  This is a year in which we reauthorize the Higher Education Act. This \nis a year in which we reauthorize No Child Left Behind. This is the \nyear in which we have to put the funds up to keep the promises that \nhave been previously made and, unfortunately, all too often were \nbroken. Our funding level meets those needs in education and gives an \nopportunity to improve things such as the Perkins loan program, things \nsuch as title I, No Child Left Behind, and the other education programs \nthat are critical to America's role and position in the world.\n  A third area of priority after children's health care and education \nis our Nation's veterans. We have all read the stories about what has \ngone on at Walter Reed. I do not think there is a Member on either side \nof the aisle who was not outraged to see what was happening to \nveterans. I think we all know there are problems in our VA system as \nwell. We have increased the President's proposal for veterans health \ncare from the $39.6 billion he provided to $43.1 billion.\n  I am especially proud of this because we have matched the independent \nbudget in every area but one. In fact, we have either matched the \nindependent budget, which is the budget put together by our veterans \norganizations themselves--this is what they have told us is necessary, \nand we have either matched them or exceeded them in every category but \none. The only category in which we didn't match or exceed them was in \nan area in which the Veterans' Committee tells us they couldn't spend \nthe money in 2008 if we gave it to them.\n  In medical care, the independent budget called for $36.3 billion. We \nhave provided $36.9 billion. I might add, that is at the recommendation \nof the Veterans' Committee.\n  The independent budget called for $1.3 billion for information \ntechnology. We have provided $1.6 billion--again at the recommendation \nof the Veterans' Committee--because they have analyzed the information \ntechnology systems in the VA and determined there would be a \nsignificant advantage by this additional expenditure. As you know, the \nVA system is now developing a world-class system, one that provides \ninformation in real time on each patient's condition. This makes a \nprofound difference in the medical treatment to our Nation's veterans.\n  On medical and prosthetic research, the independent budget called for \n$480 million. We have provided $481 million.\n  On operating expenses, the independent budget called for $2.23 \nbillion. We have matched that amount.\n  On construction--this is the only area in which we did not match the \nindependent budget. They called for $2.14 billion. We provided $960 \nmillion, the amount the Veterans' Committee tells us could actually be \nefficiently spent this year. If we were to provide them more money, the \nVeterans' Committee tells us that money could not be effectively or \nefficiently deployed. I don't think any of us want to waste money or to \nspend money that cannot be efficiently or effectively employed.\n  Other priorities in the budget resolution include restoring the cuts \nto the COPS Program. The President proposed cutting the COPS Program, \nwhich puts police on the street, by 94 percent. What sense does it make \nto eliminate police on the street at a time when crime is rising, at a \ntime when we face a continuing terrorist threat? It makes no sense to \nthis Senator, and I don't think it makes sense to most Senators. I held \na hearing on this in Fargo, ND. I had the police chief there and I had \nthe sheriff of Cass County there. They told me how important this has \nbeen to my State. Over 250 police officers have been added to the \nstreets of North Dakota because of the COPS Program. We should not be \ncutting it, as the President proposed, by 94 percent. So we have \nrestored that cut.\n\n  On heating assistance, the President cuts the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program by almost 20 percent. We have restored that cut.\n  Community Development, CDBG--I think we all know how important \ncommunity development block grant funds are to this Nation's mayors. If \nthere is one thing we have heard loud and clear, it is that the \nPresident's cut there makes no sense.\n  Finally, with respect to transportation and Amtrak, we have funded \nthis at $1.78 billion that the committee requested. The President had a \ndeep cut there, threatening transportation service not only in the \nNortheast corridor but all across the country, including my own State.\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\n  With respect to revenues in the resolution, I wanted to emphasize the \nfollowing points:\n  The budget resolution protects middle-class taxpayers with 2 years of \nalternative minimum tax relief, and that is fully offset, it is paid \nfor. What is the alternative minimum tax? Remember, years ago they \nfound out that some very wealthy people were paying no taxes. It was a \nhandful of people--as I recall, in the hundreds--very-high-income \npeople who were paying no taxes. So they put in place something called \nthe alternative minimum tax. It is an alternative tax structure to try \nto make certain that very wealthy individuals, high-income individuals, \npay something in terms of taxes.\n  Unfortunately, it was not appropriately adjusted for inflation. The \nresult is more and more people are being caught up in it. Last year, \nsome 3.5 million people were affected by the alternative minimum tax. \nIf we fail to act, there will be over 20 million people caught up in \nthe alternative minimum tax this year. We have prevented that from \noccurring, and we have prevented it from occurring again the next year.\n  We also provide a deficit-neutral reserve fund for tax relief, \nincluding extension of expiring provisions, a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund that says you can extend current tax cuts if you pay for them.\n  Next, we provide for new measures to close the tax gap, shut tax \nshelters, and address the burgeoning growth of offshore tax havens. I \nwill have more to say about those in just a minute.\n  We also called for fundamental tax simplification and reform. We had \ntax reform a number of years ago. Since that time, we just keep adding \ncomplexity, we just keep adding regulations, and we just keep adding \nnew and more provisions that make the Tax Code more and more complex.\n  I am a former tax commissioner. I used to be the elected tax \ncommissioner of my own State. I couldn't do my own taxes today. I \nhappen to have a very good accounting firm back in my hometown of \nBismarck, ND, prepare my taxes. Unfortunately, I think that is true of \nmost of us. That should not be. Certainly, the vast majority of people \nshould be able to do their own taxes. It should be far more simple than \nwe have allowed it to become, so we think it is important to call for \ntax simplification reform.\n  We also have no assumption--I wish to emphasize this--no assumption \nof a tax increase. We do not believe a tax increase is necessary to \nachieve the revenue levels we have outlined in this resolution.\n  Let me show why we believe that is the case. The red line is the \nPresident's revenue line. The green line is our revenue line. There is \na 3-percent difference. In other words, on the same scoring basis, same \nprojections by the Congressional Budget Office, who are the ones who \nevaluate these things, our revenue line would produce 3 percent more \nrevenue over the 5 years than the President's plan. Our plan would \nproduce some $15 trillion of revenue over the 5 years; the President's, \n3 percent less.\n  Seeing it another way, here is what the President called for in his \ninitial budget. In his beneficial budget proposal, the President said \nhis plan would raise $14.8 trillion over the 5 years. Our plan, as I \nhave indicated, raises $15 trillion. That is a difference of 1.2 \npercent. So our budget contains revenue over and above what the \nPresident proposed of 1.2 percent.\n  I know my colleague will jump up and say: But that is OMB scoring, \nthe Office of Management and Budget scoring for the President, and you \nare using CBO scoring. That is true. But what is also true is the \nPresident controls the Office of Management and Budget. That is his \noffice. It is his office that said he was going to raise $14.8 trillion \nover the 5 years. I am constrained to use Congressional Budget Office \nscoring. The Congressional Budget Office said our proposal would raise \n$15 trillion. So that is a difference of 1.2 percent. We think that can \nbe achieved by going after the tax gap, by going after these tax \nhavens, by going after these egregious tax abuses I will get into in a \nminute.\n  AMT relief. I indicated that over 3 million people were affected in \n2006. In 2007, there will be over 20 million--in fact, it is 23.2 \nmillion.\n  In 2008 it would be 25.7 million if we failed to act. This budget \nresolution will prevent that explosion of people being subject to the \nalternative minimum tax, the middle-class tax trap.\n  This is what the head of the General Accounting Office said, General \nWalker said in August of 2006: If we are looking into the future and \nface the facts, we will see that our problem is not just on the \nspending side and entitlements, it is also on the revenue side.\n  General Walker is telling the truth. Here is what happens if we \nextend all of the President's tax cuts without paying for them. If we \nextend all of the President's tax cuts without paying for them, debt as \na share of the economy will reach over 200 percent. Debt as measured by \nthe gross domestic product of the economy will reach over 200 percent \nin coming years.\n  The red part of this bar is the additional debt if tax cuts are \nextended without offsets, without paying for them. The green part of \nthis bar is what happens to the debt if tax cuts expire or are offset, \nare paid for. That is an important fact to keep in mind. We simply \ncannot extend all of the tax cuts without paying for them, without \npushing this country right over the cliff into massive debt.\n  I want to talk a minute about the tax gap because I have indicated we \nbelieve we could get this additional revenue--remember our revenue is \n1.2 percent more than what the President said his budget would raise. \nHow do we get it? Well, one of the first places we ought to look is the \ntax gap. The tax gap is the difference between what is owed and what is \npaid.\n  The Internal Revenue Service tells us for 2001 the tax gap was $345 \nbillion for that 1 year alone. That is based on an estimate of the tax \ngap back in 2001. Surely the tax gap has grown significantly since that \ntime.\n  I believe this was a conservative estimate to begin with in terms of \nwhat the tax gap was in 2001, $345 billion for that year alone. Again, \nthis is the amount of money that is owed under the current Tax Code but \nnot paid. If we could eliminate this tax gap, we would eliminate the \nbudget deficit. The budget deficit would be gone.\n  All of us know we cannot collect it all. All of us know we cannot \ncollect it all. But over this 5-year period, the tax gap is probably in \nthe range of $2 to $2\\1/2\\ trillion. If we just collected 15 percent of \nit--15 percent--that would be over $300 billion. That alone would come \nclose to meeting the revenue needs under our budget resolution.\n  But we don't just look to the tax gap, even though that is important, \nand even though the National Taxpayer Advocate finds the tax gap is \nadding more than $2,000 to the average household's tax bill in this \ncountry.\n  This is what the Taxpayer Advocate said this year: Compliant \ntaxpayers pay a great deal of money each year to subsidize \nnoncompliance by others. Each household was effectively assessed an \naverage tax of about $2,680 to subsidize noncompliance in 2001.\n  That is not a burden we should expect our Nation's taxpayers to bear. \nWhat an outrage. What an outrage. The vast majority of us who pay what \nwe owe are getting stuck with the bill from those who do not. Those \nindividuals, those corporations that do not pay what they legitimately \nowe under the current Tax Code, an amount back in 2001 that was $345 \nbillion in 1 year alone, that has now grown substantially--I am \ncertain--since then.\n  Some are saying, well, we cannot collect most of it. Why not? I used \nto be a tax commissioner. We went after it aggressively, and we \ncollected tens of millions of dollars on that tax gap in the little \nState of North Dakota. We can do it. If we could do it there, we \ncertainly can do it here in the Nation's Capital. If we can go after \nbig corporations in North Dakota, from the capital in Bismark, ND, with \nthe power of the Federal Government, we can go after these companies \nand these individuals who are abusing and avoiding what they \nlegitimately owe. I don't buy that we can't. I don't buy it.\n  It is not just the tax gap, the difference between what is owed and \nwhat is paid, it is also the explosion of tax havens. This is a \nbuilding in the Cayman Islands, a five-story building that is the home \nto 12,748 companies. Let me repeat that. This modest building in the \nCayman Islands, a five-story building, is the legal home of 12,748 \ncompanies. They say they are doing\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\nbusiness out of that building. Really? They are doing business out of \nthat building?\n  They are not doing business out of that building. They are doing \nmonkey business out of that building. What they are doing is avoiding \ntaxes in the United States and other jurisdictions. That is what they \nare doing.\n  When I was tax commissioner, I went after a company doing business in \nNorth Dakota. I found them engaged in one of these tax dodges in one of \nthose tax haven countries. They wound up sending us big chunks of money \nbecause they were hiding their profits in these tax haven countries. We \nshould go after them.\n  We went on the Internet to find out what we could find there. We \npunched in ``offshore tax planning.'' Offshore tax planning, that is \nthe euphemism used by these tax haven countries. You know how many hits \nyou will get on the Internet? You will get 1,260,000 hits on the \nInternet, 1,260,000. What do they talk about? They talk about offshore \ntax planning, basic techniques of international tax planning.\n  International tax planning. What they are really talking about, what \nyou find when you go to the individual Web pages--because tax planning, \nthat is the euphemism. What they are really engaged in is tax \navoidance, tax evasion. That is what is really going on.\n  Here is my favorite: Live tax free and worldwide on a luxury yacht. \nMoving offshore and living tax free just got easier. You bet it got \neasier. You transfer your money to one of these offshore tax haven \naccounts, and they say very clearly: Do not worry about paying taxes \nany time in the future. We will shield you from it because we do not \nhave taxes that apply to earnings in these offshore accounts, and we \nwill not report back to your home country that you have stuck your \nmoney here and are earning big chunks of change on it and owe taxes on \nit. We will help you shield that from your Government.\n  It says in one of these: Your money belongs to you, and that means it \nbelongs offshore. That means it belongs offshore because you put it \noffshore, and it will be tax free.\n  That is not fair to all of the rest of us who pay the taxes we owe. \nThis is from USA Today, a story from September of last year: ``Offshore \nTax Havens Aggressively Targeting U.S. Taxpayers.''\n  This is the quote from the UofMoney.com:\n\n       ``I am going to show you how to protect your money and all \n     you own so nobody, not even the Government, can get at it,'' \n     says University of Money dot-com.\n\n  Well it does not end there. This is, again, from USA Today, that same \nstory, ``Offshore Tax Havens Aggressively Targeting U.S. Taxpayers.''\n\n       ``Once your assets have been transferred to the offshore \n     entity they are safe,'' says website Carib-offshore.com. \n     ``You cannot be taxed on them.''\n\n  Now, what could be more clear? This is a giant tax dodge. It is \ngrowing. It is a cancer on the vast majority of people and companies \nthat pay what they owe.\n  How big is this? Well, this is from the State Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. That is \na committee of ours. That is a committee of the Congress of the United \nStates from February of this year: Experts have estimated that the \ntotal loss to the Treasury from offshore tax evasion alone--this is not \nthe tax gap, this is tax evasion--approaches $100 billion a year, \nincluding $40 to $70 billion from individuals, another $30 billion from \ncorporations engaging in offshore tax evasion. Abusive tax shelters add \ntens of billions of dollars more.\n  If we got a chunk of this money and a chunk of the tax gap money, the \ntwo of those, if we got 15 percent of those, we would meet the revenue \nrequirement in the budget resolution before the body.\n  Now, some will say, well, that is impossible to do. I do not believe \nit. I do not believe that is impossible to do. I was a tax \ncommissioner. I know what can be done if we put the effort into it, if \nwe put the resources into it. We can make enormous progress. Will we \never get it all? No. Obviously, no. We are not going to get it all. But \ncan we get some fraction of it? Goodness knows, this country, if it \nputs its mind to it, can make significant progress.\n  One hundred billion dollars a year in these offshore tax havens--this \nis according to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations. They say tens of billions \nmore in abusive tax shelters. What kind of tax shelters are they \ntalking about?\n  Here is the kind of tax shelter they are talking about. Here is the \nDortmund, Germany, subway system. What has that got to do with U.S. \ntaxes? Well, as it turns out, it has got a lot to do with U.S. taxes \nbecause wealthy U.S. investors bought the Dortmund subway system from \nDortmund, Germany. They went out and bought it. You know what they did? \nThey depreciated it on their books for U.S. tax purposes to lower their \nU.S. taxes, then they leased it back to Dortmund, Germany, to continue \nto run their own subway system.\n  Now, that is a ripoff, I think. What are we doing? We are allowing \npeople to depreciate and reduce their U.S. taxes by buying the Dortmund \nsubway system over in Germany, a system that was paid for by German \ntaxpayers, and then to lease it back to Dortmund, Germany, to run. Are \nwe really going to let this kind of thing go on?\n  It does not stop there. Here is the city hall in Gelsenkirchen. \nWealthy investors in the United States bought that, too, depreciated \nthat on their books in the United States for tax purposes, then leased \nit back to Gelsenkirchen for their city hall.\n  Shame on us for allowing this kind of thing to go on. It does not end \nhere. Here is a European sewer system. This is my favorite rate of all. \nEuropean sewer system, wealthy investors in the United States bought it \nand depreciated that on their books to reduce their U.S. taxes and \nleased the sewer system back to the European city that built it in the \nfirst place. Come on. Come on. How are we allowing this to go on?\n  And we cannot get 1 percent more revenue than the President does in \nhis budget? I don't believe it. Close down this tax gap, tax havens, \nthese offshore tax havens. Go after these kinds of scams.\n  It does not end there. Closing loopholes and abusive tax shelters are \nnot tax increases. Some are going to come out here and say, well, you \nhave got more revenue, it is a tax increase. Is it a tax increase to \nclose these loopholes, to close these abusive tax shelters? I do not \nthink so. I am not alone in that. The former chairman, Republican \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said this last year: Just in \nthe period of time since 2001, our committee has raised $200 billion in \nrevenues by shutting down tax shelters, by closing inversions and other \nabusive tax schemes.\n  Now, in the year 2004 alone, the Finance Committee fully offset a \n$137 billion tax bill at no expense to the American taxpayers--$137 \nbillion in 1 year.\n  Hallelujah. If we do that each of the 5 years of our budget, we would \nmore than meet the revenue called for with no tax increase.\n  The budget resolution also addresses some of our long-term fiscal \nchallenges. We provide $15 billion in Medicare savings. We have program \nintegrity initiatives to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse. I will \ntalk more about that in a minute.\n  We have new mandatory spending and tax cuts that must be paid for \nunder pay-go. We have a long-term deficit increase point of order. We \nsave Social Security first with an amendment that was adopted in \ncommittee.\n  We have a health information technology reserve fund the RAND \nCorporation says could save hundreds of billions of dollars a year if \nimplemented, and we have a comparative effectiveness reserve fund to \nlook at those changes we could make in health care to dramatically \nimprove the cost effectiveness of our system.\n  We all know what is driving our budget challenges. Right at the heart \nof it is health care. Rising health care costs are driving Medicare \ncost growth. If we look to the years ahead, the red part of this chart \nis what health costs are doing to raise the cost of Medicare. The green \nis the effect of demographics. The green is the change of the numbers \nof people in the baby boom generation. The red is the increase in \nprojected health cost. That is where we have to focus like a laser. \nThat is what this budget resolution does. We have this comparative \neffectiveness reserve fund that will jump-start an effort to bring down \nhealth\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\ncare costs. It provides a new initiative to provide research on \neffectiveness of different treatments, medical devices, and of drugs so \nwe can identify those things that work where we make an investment and \nit is paying off.\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary Leavitt, said \nthis in February of this year in testimony he provided:\n\n       It's evident that there is substantial fraud going on in \n     the Medicare program and we need to be able to have the \n     resources to root it out, to prosecute it, to make certain \n     that it stops. . . . [I]t's a desperate need, we have to have \n     more resources for enforcement.\n\n  This budget resolution gives the Secretary the resources he has asked \nfor to go after fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. This chart shows what \nhe is talking about. Because this is part of an ongoing investigation, \nI can't reveal on the Senate floor where this site is. It is an office \nbuilding. All these areas blotted out in white are businesses in a \nbuilding with front operations, scam operations. They are operations \nthat are billing Medicare on average about $1.5 million a year, but \nthey are not providing any services. This is the kind of thing that is \ngoing on all across the country. Unfortunately, there are certain parts \nof the country where it is more prevalent.\n  The Secretary told the committee there are hundreds of these \noperations in one State alone, billing Medicare typically $1.5 million \na year. He would go to the doors of each of these operations in the \nmiddle of a workday, and nothing is going on. Nobody is there. Yet they \nare billing, billing, billing, billing Medicare for fraudulent devices. \nThis is the kind of scam we have to shut down.\n  In this budget resolution, we provide important budget enforcement \ntools as well: discretionary caps for 2007 and 2008; we restore a \nstrong pay-go rule. Pay-go simply says if you want new tax cuts, you \nhave to pay for them. If you want new mandatory spending, you have to \npay for it. We also have a point of order against long-term deficit \nincreases, and we allow reconciliation for deficit reduction only. \nReconciliation is a big word, a fancy word for special procedures \naround here that go outside the normal way business is done. It is a \nfast-track procedure. The only reason it was provided for is to reduce \ndeficits. In recent years it has been hijacked and used to increase \ndeficits. That stands the whole process on its head. We now return \nreconciliation for the purpose it was intended, to be used to reduce \ndeficits only.\n  That is a brief summation. Maybe not so brief. I took my colleague's \nbreath away with that ``brief'' reference. That is a relatively brief \nsummation of what is in this budget resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's brief \nexplanation of his budget. I look forward to the longer version. We \nalways appreciate his charts, which are well done. I congratulate \nstaff.\n  Let me start by thanking him and his staff for their courtesy. It has \nbeen professional, cordial, and very enjoyable to work with him and his \nstaff on trying to pull this together in a way that is fair, honest, \nand everybody gets their 2 cents in. Obviously, there are philosophical \ndifferences here, but I greatly admire the chairman's commitment to \ngoverning fairly and making sure that everybody has a good chance of \ngetting their points across. I admire his ability and his effectiveness \nas chairman of the committee. I enjoy working with him.\n  There is a lot to talk about. It is hard to know where to start. I \nmay not be as brief as my colleague, in fact, because there is so much \nto talk about, although I usually try to be terse and concise.\n  Let's begin with where we are which is we are now functioning under \neconomic policies put in place by President Bush and the Republican \nCongress that have produced extraordinary results for the American \npeople. We came out of the 20th century, unfortunately, with the \nbiggest bubble in the history of the world bursting, the Internet \nbubble of the late 1990s, followed by the attack of 9/11 which threw \nour economy into a tailspin. Those two events combined should have \nthrown us into a severe recession or depression. We did have a \nrecession, but it was nowhere nearly as severe as it might have been. \nObviously, we didn't have a depression.\n  The reason primarily was because in the early 2000 period, President \nBush, with the support of this Republican Congress, put in place \npolicies which created an atmosphere for economic recovery even in the \nface of those two devastating events, the bursting of the largest \nbubble in our history, the Internet bubble--bigger than the tulip \nbubble, the South Seas bubble--followed, of course, by 9/11, which was \nan extraordinarily devastating event for all of us. As a result of the \npolicies put in place, the economy has now expanded for 21 straight \nmonths. Employment is up 7.6 million jobs. That is people with real \njobs, which, of course, is the essence of economic recovery and quality \nof life. A good job is the essence of a good quality of life. The \nunemployment rate is lower than it has historically been in most \nrecoveries, which is positive news.\n\n  The economic growth has propelled dramatic increases in revenues. I \nwill return to this in more depth in a few minutes.\n  We have seen in the last 3 years the most significant increase in \nFederal revenues in the history of the country over a 3-year period. We \nnow have revenues above their historic norm. Historically, they have \nbeen about 18.2 percent of gross national product. Now they are about \n18.5 percent. During this recovery, real wages have jumped as compared \nwith President Clinton's period, which was a good time economically, \nand we have had real wage growth that has been more significant than \nduring that period.\n  To get back to the revenue issue, as a result of the tax cuts put in \nplace by this administration and the Congress, we have seen a dramatic \nincrease in revenues. That is because we have come to a point in our \nsociety economically where we put in place a tax law that is fair. We \nare saying to the American people: Go out and be an entrepreneur. Take \na risk, be a marketplace-oriented person, create jobs. If you are \nwilling to do that, we are going to tax you at a fair return on your \ninvestment. We have, as a result, dramatically increased revenues so \nthat they are above the historic norm. We have seen the single most \nsignificant jump in revenues in our history over the last 3 years, and \nthis chart shows that. So we have as a government actually seen a huge \ninflow of revenues.\n  What is the effect of that? The effect is the deficit has dropped \ndramatically. It was estimated to be about $500 billion about a year \nand a half, 2 years ago. It is now going to be below $250 billion, and \nit is headed down. In fact, over the next 5 years, using a CBO \nbaseline, the deficit will continue to go down until we are into \nsurplus and, as a practical matter, under the CBO baseline we reach \nsurplus in late 2011, early 2012. I have said on a number of occasions, \nit is even humpty-dumpty in the next 5 years to reach surplus. Given \nwhat is happening with the revenues of the Federal Government, we are \nsimply in a good time for revenues. Why? Because we are in a good time \neconomically from the standpoint of an expanding economy, creation of \njobs and, as a result, the creation of revenue.\n  It is important to remember that if you have a tax law that says to \nthe American people, go out and invest and take a risk, they will do \nit. That is the exciting part about our economy. Americans are \nentrepreneurial by nature. They love to take risks, if they know they \ncan get a return on that risk, because that is the nature of the \nAmerican people. They will create jobs as a result. When we put in \nplace a dividends rate and a capital gains rate which essentially said: \nIf you want to expand, you want to take a risk, we are going to give \nyou a chance to do it, and you get a reasonable return on your dollars, \nthey have done it. Human nature has produced these huge revenue \nexplosions.\n  It is also human nature to say to someone: We are going to tax you at \nsuch a rate that you are not going to have much incentive to go out and \ninvest because the Government is going to take too much money out of \nyour pocket, so why should you go out and put your sweat equity into \ntrying to build a little business, a restaurant or maybe a small \nsoftware company or something such as that? Why should\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\nyou do that if the Government is going to take so much of your income \nthat it doesn't make any sense? So you don't make that type of an \nadjustment in your lifestyle.\n  We have created an economy and a tax atmosphere where people know \nthey are going to be taxed fairly--not undertaxed, taxed fairly. As a \nresult, we have seen huge increases in revenue. In fact, because we \nhave created such a fair tax climate, today the top 20 percent of \nAmerican income tax payers pay a higher percentage of American taxes to \nthe Federal Government than they did during the Clinton years.\n  Let me explain this another way. During the Clinton years, if you \nwere in the top 20 percent of the income brackets, you paid less in \ntaxes as a percent of the total Federal burden than you do today, if \nyou are in that top 20 percent. So basically high-income people are \ntoday paying 85 percent in Federal income tax. At the same time the \nbottom 40 percent of Americans who have income tax obligations actually \ndon't pay a lot of income tax. They actually get money back through \nsomething called the earned income tax credit. They are getting back \ntwice as much, almost twice as much under the system today as they got \nback under the Clinton period.\n\n  So we have the highest income people--those top 20 percent of the \nAmerican people paying income taxes--paying 85 percent. We have the \nlowest income people--the bottom 40 percent--getting about twice as \nmuch back as they did under the Clinton years.\n  What does that mean? We actually have--under this new tax law that \nwas put in place which is generating all this revenue, 21 months of \neconomic expansion, 7.5 million jobs, and all sorts of revenue for the \nFederal Government--we actually have a more progressive tax system than \nduring the Clinton years. In other words, high-income people are paying \nmore, low-income people are paying less and getting more back. That is \nprogressivity, and that is the way it ought to be.\n  So in light of this situation, where we have seen a dramatic \nexpansion in the economy, a dramatic expansion in Federal revenues, a \nbig increase in jobs for Americans, and a situation where we have a \nmore progressive tax system, what does the Democratic budget suggest?\n  Well, it suggests putting in place a set of policies which goes in \nexactly the opposite direction of the policies that got us to this \npoint. The Democratic budget, as proposed, will increase taxes, or \nrevenues, by approximately $916 billion, it will increase nondefense \ndiscretionary spending by approximately $140 billion, it will increase \nthe debt by $2.2 trillion, and it does nothing in the area of mandatory \nsavings. I will talk about all four of these areas individually.\n  I also will mention some of the things it leaves out. It has left out \nlong-term entitlement reform. It has left out long-term AMT relief. \nFunding for the ongoing costs of the war beyond 2009 is left out. It \nhas left out fixing the physicians payment and unexpected emergency \nfunding, and its spending and taxes in 24 different reserve funds. We \nwill get into more specifics on this issue.\n  On the spending side of the ledger, this budget increases nondefense \ndiscretionary spending by $146 billion, approximately--$18 billion next \nyear. Remember, that is not in a vacuum. That is on top of the budget \nthe President sent up here that would increase spending by almost $50 \nbillion next year. So you are seeing a dramatic expansion in spending.\n  At the same time, there is virtually no reduction in the amount of \nspending which is occurring in nondefense entitlement spending, in \nentitlement spending, or in nondefense discretionary spending. The \nchairman of the committee said: We need to be tough on spending. But in \nhis budget, there are no spending cuts--none. He said we would need \nmore revenues, so in his budget he put in $900 billion more of revenue.\n  What you have is a budget that dramatically expands revenue but does \nnot do anything to constrain spending. As a result, what you are going \nto get is a very significant increase in the debt of the Federal \nGovernment. It is going to be up by $2.2 trillion after this Democratic \nbudget has gone forward.\n  The wall of debt, which we have seen many times on this floor from \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, is going to grow and get higher \nand be more difficult for our children to bear and get over.\n  In addition, the budget, as proposed by the Democratic membership, \nwill significantly use Social Security funds for the operation of the \nGovernment. Over $1 trillion of Social Security funds will be used to \noperate the Federal Government. Now, that is not unusual. I admit to \nthat. Historically, Social Security funds have been used to operate the \nFederal Government. But in the past we have heard from the other side \nof the aisle it is not right to do that. Well, if it was not right for \nus to do that when we were in the majority, why is it right for the \nDemocratic side of the aisle to do that when they are in the majority, \nwhich is what they do.\n  In addition to building the wall of debt, they are also building the \nwall of spending. There are all sorts of expansions of programs in this \nbudget. In fact, as I listened to the chairman's opening remarks, what \nI heard most--maybe because my ears are attuned to it; but I also think \nthe majority of the time was spent on two things--one was new spending \nprograms. He listed them--one after another after another after \nanother. We have to spend more money here, more money on agriculture, \nmore money on SCHIP, more money on LIHEAP, more money on CDBG, more \nmoney on transportation, and more money on the COPS Program.\n  My goodness gracious, the COPS Program was put forward by President \nClinton back in, I think, 1995. He said it was going to be a 3-year \nprogram. At the end of 3 years it was going to go away, if we funded \n100,000 cops on the street. That was the program. Well, we funded \n100,000 cops. Then we funded 10,000 more. So we ended up funding \n110,000 cops.\n  Three years went by and the program did not go away. It is still \nthere. It is like every other Federal program. They do not go away. \nThey stay on, as has this one, even though that program was \nspecifically designed to go away. But we see it as a high priority for \nnew spending in this budget. So it is spending upon spending upon \nspending--$146 billion in new spending in nondefense discretionary \nspending. That is a big number. It compounds. It is not as though it is \nnot a big number to begin with. But when you get out past 5 years, that \nnumber becomes the base that everything grows off of, and it gets \nbigger and bigger and bigger. It is not as though it is a one-time \nevent.\n  The COPS Program is a good example. It was supposed to go away. It \nstayed around. It is compounding--got to add to it, got to add to it, \ngot to add to it. In the end, who pays? Well, it goes back to that wall \nof debt. The $2.2 trillion of new debt that is being put into this \nsystem by this bill goes to our children. That is a bill directly to \nour children. We need to address the fact that this budget, as proposed \nby our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, is going to do \nnothing to give our children the opportunity to have a decent \nlifestyle, to have the lifestyle our generation has had. In fact, it is \ngoing to aggravate their ability to afford the Government they are \ngoing to be handed because it is going to give them all this new \nspending, and then it is going to hit them with mandatory spending.\n  We know if we do not address the mandatory spending accounts in this \nGovernment, we are going to bankrupt this country. We are going to send \nthis country into a fiscal spiral, and our children are essentially \ngoing to be handed a country which they cannot afford. We know that. \nWhy do we know that? Well, because the chairman has been good enough \nand, appropriately, has held probably 10 or 15 hearings on this \nspecific point. Every major witness we have had--all the leaders, from \nthe Chairman of the Fed, to the Comptroller General--all of the major \nwitnesses have said the same thing: We are headed toward a fiscal \nmeltdown as a nation because of a demographic tidal wave that is headed \ntoward us. The baby boom generation is going to retire. It is going to \ndouble the number of recipients who will get Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security. As a result, our children are going to be overwhelmed.\n\n  This chart shows it so appropriately, the three programs: Medicare, \nSocial\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\nSecurity, and Medicaid. The spending on those programs is going to \nexceed what has been spent by the Federal Government historically, \nwhich is about 20 percent of gross national product. That is shown by \nthe black line on the chart. It is going to exceed that number by about \nthe year 2025, 2028. Then, it keeps going up. So as a very practical \nmatter, in about a decade and a half from now, it is going to be \nimpossible for the Federal Government to function because three \nprograms will be absorbing all the money the Federal Government \ntraditionally spends. The practical effect of that will be our children \nwill basically have to be taxed into obscurity in order to support \nthis. That, unfortunately, is what is going to happen unless we address \nthis issue.\n  The total unfunded liability of our Federal Government is about $67 \ntrillion over the next 75 years. Mr. President, $67 trillion--try to \nput that number into concept. I do not know what $1 trillion is. Try to \nthink of what that means: $67 trillion.\n  Well, to try to put it into some context--it is still unconscionable; \nit is such a huge number--if you take all the taxes paid in the United \nStates since the beginning of our Government, we have paid in about $42 \ntrillion. So the unfunded liability--most of which is due to Medicare, \nsome of which is due to Social Security--exceeds the total taxes paid \nto the Federal Government since the beginning of our country.\n  To put it another way: If you take all of the net worth of America--\neverybody's car, everybody's house, all your stocks, all your \nbusinesses--and roll it into a ball, that adds up to about $56 \ntrillion. We actually have on the books today a liability that we do \nnot know how we are going to pay for, which exceeds--exceeds--the total \nworth of America. Yet this budget, which we are presented today, does \nnothing about that. Even though we had hearing after hearing to talk \nabout the need to address entitlements and the spending on \nentitlements, it does nothing about it.\n  It is not as though nothing can be done. We will hear from the other \nside of the aisle, well, we need to do a global settlement--and I have \njoined with the Senator from North Dakota to try to accomplish that--\nthat we cannot do anything until we do a global settlement. That is a \ngood idea, and that is the way it should be done, but we have to get \nstarted, folks. We have to get started. This budget was the opportunity \nto start.\n  In fact, the President sent us up an idea--two ideas, basically, \nwhich would have accomplished very significant savings in the \nentitlement area. His proposals would have saved $8 trillion of the $24 \ntrillion now unfunded in the Medicare fund or essentially 25 percent of \nthe Medicare fund. Twenty-five to thirty percent of the Medicare fund \ninsolvency would have been addressed. How did he do it? He did not \naffect beneficiaries with his proposals. They were very reasonable \nproposals.\n  Essentially, the way he did it was to set up two proposals. One would \nhave calculated correctly the reimbursement cost to provider groups, \nnot counting doctors. The other would have required that very high-\nincome seniors, people making over $160,000 on their joint returns, \nwould have to pay a higher percentage of the cost of their Part D \npremium and their Part B premium. So 95 percent of the seniors would \nnot have been affected at all by the proposals he sent up here. \nRemember, these proposals would have reduced the insolvency of the \nMedicare trust fund by $8 trillion or by about 30 percent.\n  This type of proposal should have been taken up. It should have been \nagreed to. There should not be any debate about it. Why, for example, \nshould a person--a mother, maybe a single mother working at a \nrestaurant, who has to pay taxes--why should she be supporting the \npremium which is being used to support the drug benefit for a retired \nsenior who has an income of over $160,000 filing a joint return?\n  Let's take, for example, a retired Senator. Why should somebody who \nis working on a production line or in a restaurant or in a gas \nstation--why should their general taxes have to be used to support a \nretired Senator's Part D premium for drugs? Because the retired Senator \nis probably going to be making more than $160,000 jointly or $80,000 \nindividually. It makes no sense.\n  Just by effecting this one change, you could have dramatically \nreduced the liability of the trust fund and made our Government more \naffordable to our children so our children would be able to send their \nkids to school and not have this huge tax burden. This is another \nexample of that.\n  But, essentially, this budget, as presented, totally ignores the \nentitlement storm that is coming--the Medicare storm, the Social \nSecurity storm, and the Medicaid storm. It is a failure in policy and a \nfailure in leadership. It is especially unfortunate because when you \nput it in the context of the fact that this budget significantly \nincreases taxes, taking--we will get into that in a few minutes--the \ntax burden of the American people from 18.5 percent of gross national \nproduct up to 20 percent of gross national product, instead of using \nthose revenues for the purposes of maybe trying to resolve this long-\nterm crisis which is so significant that it truly will cause an \neconomic meltdown--instead of doing that, these tax increases are \nfrittered away. They are frittered away. They are spent. They are used \nto adjust this program or that program, whereas, they should have been \nused, if they were going to be done at all--which they should not be at \nthis time--to at least address the liability of the Medicare trust \nfund. But they didn't. It didn't occur.\n\n  So when the Democratic chairman says: ``I have said I am prepared to \nget savings out of long-term entitlement programs,'' I wish he had done \nthat. Instead of that happening in this budget, there is absolutely no \nsavings that would improve the trust fund situation. There is a $15 \nbillion savings, but that is used to pay for a $50 billion expansion of \nthe SCHIP program, so it is actually a net loser to the tune of $35 \nbillion.\n  The practical implications of this budget--the practical situation, \nto clarify, because it is fairly complex, is that by increasing \nspending by $146 billion and then increasing revenues by $900 billion \nand then increasing the debt by $2.2 trillion and doing nothing on the \nentitlement side of the ledger, this budget essentially creates almost \nwhat you could call a perfect storm of tax and spend. It is \noverwhelming, the practical implications of where this is going to go, \nbecause of the four priorities as they are set out and the way they \nhave been dealt with. Missed opportunities on the entitlement side, \ndramatic expansion of revenues on the revenue side, nondefense \ndiscretionary spending increases to $146 billion. On the revenue side--\non the big red chart--this bill essentially says the revenues increase \nis going to be about $900 billion.\n  To put this fairly, if you were to look at the President's budget and \ncompare it to this, the President's budget would be about $400 billion \nor $450 billion. That basically involves the AMT. So what essentially \nis being proposed is a $450 billion to $500 billion increase in taxes \nover what the President might have suggested, or did suggest, which is \na half trillion dollars.\n  The chairman likes to call this 3 percent. We are just 3 percent \nabove the President. He has these two graphs that go together. You \nremember when you were in junior high school and you did graphs. If you \ncompress the numbers enough, you make everything go together. It is all \nmushed together. That is what he has done.\n  Three percent is real money, folks. Even though the graphs go like \nthis, they are all crushed together on his chart. Three percent is a \nhalf trillion dollars. A half trillion dollars, that is a lot of money \nin new taxes. In fact, that represents the single largest tax increase \nin the history of the country. This budget reflects that. We don't know \nwhere it is coming from because we have this representation from the \nmajority leader that it is not going to come from increasing the rates. \nWell, that is hard to understand because he has claimed he is going to \nget it from the tax gap, and then he has claimed he is going to get it \nfrom closing loopholes.\n  We had testimony before the committee from the head of the IRS. The \nCommissioner of the IRS said he might get another $30 billion to $40 \nbillion at most over 5 years--and I am giving him the benefit of the \ndoubt--out of the tax gap. He was close to $20 billion, actually. \nRegarding closing the loopholes,\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\nwe have had a lot of people around here chasing loopholes for a long \ntime. Everybody has loopholes they chase all around this place. It is \nsort of like one of those games when you take your kids to Chuck E. \nCheese's and they have those things with the big heads that pop up and \nyou hit them with the club. Everybody is chasing loopholes all over \nthis place, but they don't appear to get them very often. When they do \nget them, they don't generate a half trillion dollars. It might \ngenerate $5 billion or $4 billion. That is a lot of money, but it is \nnot a half trillion dollars.\n  A half trillion dollars is real money. Where do you get it? You raise \nrates. This budget is a stocking horse for rate increases. There is no \nquestion about it. In fact, all you have to do is read the fine print. \nIn the fine print, there are four--not one, not two, not three, but \nfour new--because I count their pay-go proposal as new--four new--and \ntax-go proposal--four new points of order against tax rates increasing \nover their present--tax rates being allowed to stay at their present \nrate.\n  Let me restate that because I obviously mixed up the sentence. There \nare four new points of order against the ability to keep tax rates \nwhere they are today.\n  My colleagues, remember when we started this discussion, we talked \nabout all the good news we were getting as a result of having a tax \nsystem that was finally fair and where people were willing to go out \nand take a risk and invest and create jobs: 7.4 million new jobs, 21 \nmonths of expansion, best revenues we have ever had in the history of \nthis country. That is going to go by the board because you are going to \nhave to jump the first hurdle, the second hurdle, the third hurdle, and \nthen the fourth hurdle with very aggressive points of order which will \nrequire 60 votes before we are going to be able to maintain those tax \nrates.\n  This budget, which increases taxes by $900 billion, which, as a \nresult, has to be focused on driving those tax rates up because there \nis no place else you can get the money, is a clear attack on things \nlike the capital gains rate, the dividends rate, the death tax rate, \nand rates in general, plus all the other extensions, whether they are \nhelping kids or not. The practical effect of this is what you have to \nworry about.\n\n  We are on a path under this budget to become France. That is where we \nare headed, a tax level which is essentially a French tax level. The \nAmerican people aren't going to want to work very hard. Well, the \nFrench people don't want to work very hard. I shouldn't say that. Maybe \nthey do, they just don't act like they do.\n  As a result, we are going to find that our Nation's productivity \ndrops precipitously because we are raising our taxes. Under this \nproposal taxes will go up to 20 percent of gross national product.\n  Remember that chart I showed you. You probably don't remember it, but \nI will remind you of it. Historically, the tax rate has been about 18.2 \npercent of gross national product. Today we are at 18.5 percent of \ngross national product, so we are actually bringing in a lot more than \nthe historical level. This budget assumes--assumes that we are going to \ngo to 20 percent of gross national product in taxes. That is a dramatic \nexpansion in the size of the government.\n  What do we get? Well, we get more asparagus growing. We get more COPS \nPrograms, more CDBG, more ag payoff. We are not getting something \nsubstantive that is going to, in the long term, straighten out our \nbiggest issue, which is entitlement reform for this dramatic expansion \nin revenues. What we are getting is more government, more government. \nIt doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n  In fact, not only do we have a wall of debt, which the chairman has \noften mentioned to us, we now have a wall of taxes. You can see how, \nunder the chairman's budget, the tax wall goes up and up and up. The \nproblem with this wall is that when people try to climb over it, they \nrun out of energy after a while and they stop climbing. Productivity \ndrops, people who are willing to take risks stop, jobs dry up, and \npeople come to the conclusion that maybe it is not worth working all \nthis hard because they are going to send all the money to the \nGovernment in Washington, and they are not all that confident the \nGovernment in Washington spends their money all that well.\n  Now, the chairman--and I just have to respond to this one because the \nchairman keeps holding up this chart that says--first, he had the 3 \npercent chart which mushed the lines, but then he has the chart which \nsays, well, our taxes are about the same as the President's taxes.\n  What he fails to mention is--well, he did mention it actually, but \nwhat he fails to point out is that he uses one scoring mechanism and \nthe President uses another scoring mechanism. He uses apples and the \nPresident uses oranges. So that chart is a little misleading.\n  So I decided to do it apples to apples and oranges to oranges. When \nyou compare the scoring mechanisms equally, you end up with the fact \nthat, my goodness, $934 billion in new taxes under the Democratic \nproposal, apples to apples, that is CBO. That is the number that I \nthink even the chairman of the committee will acknowledge is how much \nnew revenue he is raising, and under the OMB scoring it would be $600 \nbillion of new taxes. Dramatic increases. Dramatic increases in tax \nrevenues, with the implications, of course, with all of these new \nbudget points of order and all--and the failure to be able to--even out \nof this building in--where is it--the Cayman Islands or Panama or \nsomeplace, this one little building, no matter how he squeezes that \nbuilding down and crushes it into dust, he cannot get $439 billion out \nof it. He might get $30 billion out of it, but that still leaves him \n$400 billion to go, or depending on the other scoring, $570 billion. \nThe only place you can go with this type of money is the American \ntaxpayer. We are not talking about the rich. We are talking about \nAmericans trying to make a living, small businesspeople running a small \nbusiness.\n  Most people who live off dividends actually are senior citizens. \nSenior citizens will be hit heavily by this tax increase. Capital \ngains--that is where people take risks, and they are not going to \nchange their asset mix anymore and, as a result, it will dry up. This \nis a huge tax increase budget.\n  So to summarize, although I hate to do that because I haven't taken \nnearly enough time, the Democratic budget raises taxes by $900 billion, \nraises spending on the nondefense discretionary side by $146 billion, \nand most acutely, in my opinion, although the tax number is obviously \ndaunting, the most acute failure of this budget is that it passes all \nthis debt on to our children and then further burdens them by not doing \nanything of any significance to address the coming tsunami, which is \nthe entitlement costs which the baby boom generation is going to force \non to our kids, making our Government unaffordable for our children.\n  So I have reservations about this budget. As we go forward, I imagine \nthere will be amendments to reflect those reservations.\n  At this time, I would like to yield to our leader for 10 minutes, if \nthat is all right with the chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would like to respond, and then I will \nbe happy to yield to the leader.\n  The Senator has used one of the most entertaining presentations I \nhave seen in a long time. I want to give special praise to his staff \nfor his wonderful new charts. I assume that the creative genius behind \nthese charts was the Senator himself.\n  Mr. GREGG. No, you cannot assume that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say I have enjoyed this. It has tremendous \nentertainment value. There is not a whole lot of factual value but a \nlot of entertainment value.\n  Let me say this. The hard reality is regarding the Senator's chart \ncomparing apples and oranges. The problem with that chart is it is not \nto scale. It is not to scale. If you do a scale of what the President \ncalled for in revenue and what I have called for in revenue, here is \nwhat it is to scale. The President said his budget would produce $14.8 \ntrillion of revenue; mine, $15 trillion. That is a difference of 1.2 \npercent. I don't think civilization is going to cease to exist because \nwe get 1 percent more revenue than the President called for.\n  How do we say we should get it? We say we should go out and close \ndown\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\nthe tax gap. That is over $300 billion a year--a year--going after the \ntax havens, these outrageous scams that are going on that another \ncommittee of Congress says is costing $100 billion a year. Then these \nother egregious tax loopholes where companies and wealthy individuals \nare buying sewer systems from Europe and using them to reduce their \ntaxes in the United States and then leasing them back to the Europeans.\n  Now, on this whole question of tax increases, the Senator, to his \ncredit, was square with people about this because when he says I have a \n$900 billion tax increase, the fact is, the President, in a similar \nanalysis, has a $484 billion tax increase because the President has \n$328 billion of AMT increase, $104 billion of tax extenders, and $52 \nbillion in this health tax proposal. So the difference between us--both \nhave revenue increases. Both do. The difference in revenue is $439 \nbillion.\n  As I have indicated, the President called for $14.8 trillion in his \nbudget, and we have $15 trillion in mine, a difference of 1 percent.\n  The Senator also talked about debt, and he talked about our wall of \ndebt. He didn't mention anything about the President's wall of debt, \nand he left that out because the President's budget--by the way, our \ncolleague here on the other side has no budget. The only budget from \nthe other side is the President's budget, and the President's budget \nhas $250 billion more debt than our proposal. So when my colleague \ncriticizes our proposal on building debt, you didn't hear him mention a \nword about the proposal from the President. The only budget we have \nfrom the other side has $250 billion more debt than in our proposal.\n  Here is the wall of debt, not only looking forward but looking to the \nprevious years that their side has built up. The reason, for example, \nthat we still have Social Security funds being used is because our \nfriends on the other side have dug a mighty deep hole. We are on a \nladder scrambling to get out, but we are still stuck in a hole they \ndug, and here is the hole they dug. When they came in, at the end of \nthe President's first year, there was $5.8 trillion in debt. At the end \nof this year, there is going to be $9 trillion in debt. This is the \nhole they dug. They controlled the Senate and the House and the White \nHouse, yet they put us in this deep chasm of debt. Under the \nPresident's proposal, as I have indicated, they would add even more \ndebt--even more debt--taking us to over $12 trillion by 2012.\n  One of the results of this, because increasingly this debt is being \nfinanced from abroad, is that it took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up \n$1 trillion of our debt held abroad. This President has more than \ndoubled that amount in 6 years. One President, in 6 years, has more \nthan doubled foreign holdings of our debt, a debt which took 42 \nPresidents 224 years to run up.\n  On the question of Social Security and who is taking Social Security \nmoney, the President's budget is the only budget from their side of the \naisle, because our colleagues have no budget. They have presented no \nbudget. They have presented no alternative. The only alternative budget \nwe have from their side is the President's budget. So if we want to \ntalk about Social Security money, their budget uses $1.16 trillion of \nSocial Security money, which is $130 million more than does ours.\n\n  So I would ask my colleagues: Where is your budget? Where is your \nbudget? You think we should use less. Where is your budget? The only \nbudget you have is the budget of the President, and it uses more Social \nSecurity money, it runs up more debt, and also has massive, or at least \nlarge, capped increases associated with it.\n  So I am a little concerned that the other side hasn't produced any \nbudget other than the President's budget.\n  When our colleague talks about this big spending increase, there is \nno big spending increase. It is indecipherable, the difference. It is \nindecipherable, the difference. On a $15 trillion base, yes, we spend \n$150 billion more over 5 years. Where does it go? Where does it go? It \ngoes to education, it goes to children's health, and it goes to our \nNation's veterans and their health care.\n  It has been a failure of the other side of the aisle to take care of \nour Nation's veterans' health care. It has created the scandal that is \nnow here in this town, the Walter Reed scandal. It was a failure on \ntheir watch. It was a failure to care for our veterans. We are not \ngoing to accept that. We are not going to allow it. So, yes, it \nrequires more money; and, yes, it requires more money for education; \nand, yes, it requires more money if we are going to provide health \ninsurance for the children of this country.\n  The Senator also said that under the President's watch, the tax cuts \nhave been very progressive. No, they have not. They have not been \nprogressive. The top 1 percent have income of more than $418,000 a \nyear. They have gotten 71 percent of the benefits of the tax cuts \npassed by this administration. That is progressive? This is how \nconfused our colleagues have become on the other side, that they think \nit is progressive when those earning over $400,000 a year get 71 \npercent of the benefit.\n  Here is what the average tax cut for a millionaire is in 2006. Those \nearning over $1 million a year, under their tax plan, got a $118,000 \ntax cut, on average. They received a $118,000 tax cut, and those \nearning less than $100,000 got $692. They say that is more progressive? \nI mean, that is true denial. That is true denial. Those earning over $1 \nmillion a year got an average of $118,000 in tax cuts under their plan, \nand those earning less than $100,000 got $692, and they say that is \nmore progressive. That stands logic and truth on its head.\n  The drop in the tax rate is the largest for the high-income \ntaxpayers. Those who are in the top 1 percent got a drop of 3\\1/2\\ \npercentage points in their rates. Those in the bottom 20 percent got \nthree-tenths of 1 percent. That is progressive? I don't think so. That \nis not the definition of ``progressive'' I learned in school.\n  Now, he talked about job creation under the Bush administration and \nhe talked about 4.9 million jobs being created. Yes, that is true. In \nthe first 73 months, 4.9 million jobs were created. Let me compare that \nto the Clinton administration. In the first 73 months of the Clinton \nadministration, 18 million jobs were created. That is over three times \nas many.\n  The Senator also held up a chart talking about job creation. Let me \nmake this point. We have gone back to the nine recoveries since World \nWar II, nine major recoveries, and compared this one to those. Here is \nwhat we find. This recovery is running 6.7 million private sector jobs \nshort of the average of all of the other recoveries since World War II. \nThis is a success? I don't think so.\n  It is not just on jobs, it is also on business investment. In \nbusiness investment, this recovery compared to the nine previous \nrecoveries since World War II, business investment is lagging in this \nrecovery by 68 percent.\n  What about the median household income under this administration? It \nhas declined. From 2000 to 2005, real median income in constant dollars \ndeclined by almost $1,300. Maybe that is why people are working more \nand earning less. Maybe that is why in the latest Newsweek poll two-\nthirds of the American people say the economy is not doing well. Two-\nthirds of the American people say the economy is not doing well.\n  If we look at the question of recoveries, the Senator held up another \nchart talking about how well recoveries have done and revenues have \ndone in this recovery. Well, again, if we compare it to previous \nrecoveries, in this recovery we are running $127 billion short of the \naverage of the nine previous recoveries since World War II. Something \nis very wrong.\n  On the Senator's revenue chart, he didn't show you the first 4 years \nof this administration. He only showed you the most recent years. Why \ndidn't he show you all the years? Why did he just show you some of the \nyears? Well, I think here is the reason. It gives a very different \nconclusion than the one he drew.\n  When you show all the years, what you see is we have not gotten back \nto the revenue base we had back in 2000 until 2006. It has taken us 6 \nyears to get back to the revenue base we had back in 2000. He didn't \nwant to show you that. He doesn't want to show you that, after the big \ntax cuts in 2001, the revenue base went down. It went down again the \nnext year and stayed down the next year and the next year. Only in 2006 \ndid we get back to the revenue base we had 6 years ago.\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n  Maybe that is the reason the debt has exploded under their watch. The \ndeficits grew dramatically under their watch. Increasingly, we are in \nhock to foreign governments and foreign entities and foreign investors, \nand our budget says we have to stop it. We have to balance the budget \nand, yes, we have to look to the longer term.\n  My own belief is, and I think virtually everyone in this town knows \nthis, the only way we are going to deal with the nagging long-term \nfiscal shortfalls is with bipartisan agreement, one between Republicans \nand Democrats, one in which both of us come to the table and \ncompromise. That is what Senator Gregg and I have proposed, a working \ngroup, eight Democrats, eight Republicans, with the responsibility to \ncome up with a plan to deal with these long-term fiscal imbalances. My \nown belief is that is the only way that will happen.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I always look forward to budget week \nevery year because this debate illustrates the differences between the \ntwo parties like no other debate we have in the course of the year. Our \nbudget debate is led by one of our most, if not our most skillful \ndebater and budget expert, Senator Gregg, and I know he will want to \nrespond once again to the observations of our good friend from North \nDakota, the chairman of the committee.\n  Republicans got their first look at the Democratic budget last week. \nWe have been pouring over the details for the last few days, and at \nthis point I can safely say this: If anyone is searching for a \npolitical document that reflects the triumph of rhetoric over reality, \nlook no further.\n  For years, Republicans have politely stood by and listened as \nDemocrats lectured us about the rich--the richest 1 percent is the \nfavorite phrase--while casting themselves as the party of the working \nclass. We have heard from brave Democratic candidates and newly elected \nMembers who tell us we favor the country club set and the CEOs. Many \nwould like to paint us into a modern day Thomas Nast cartoon, chomping \ncigars and taking care of businessmen at the working man's expense. It \nis a caricature that has always been wrong and that has persisted so \nlong it has certainly been a nuisance.\n  Americans usually know better. They look at their paychecks and they \nask themselves that simple question: Am I better off now than I was 4 \nyears ago? The answer, for most Americans, is clear: Republican \neconomic policies have lifted tens of millions of working families into \nthe middle class over the last two decades and sparked a general wave \nof prosperity that few of us could ever have imagined. Americans know \nit, and so do our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, which is \nwhy the budget they are proposing is so disturbing.\n  Rhetorically, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been \ncareful to embrace an appealing script: Keep taxes low, reform \nentitlements, and control spending. But the rhetoric always meets \nreality right here in the budget, and this time the collision between \nthe two is straight out of the movie ``300,'' playing right now.\n  Let's start with the rhetoric. A few months ago, in November, the \nsenior Senator from Delaware was asked whether Democrats planned to \nraise taxes. Here is what he said: ``Well, the answer is that they will \nnot do that--they won't raise taxes on working and middle class \n[Americans].''\n  That was the senior Senator from Delaware on November 5. His \nDemocratic colleagues have stuck to the same script. In early November, \nvoters in Missouri asked the now junior Senator from that State whether \nRepublicans were right to say that she and other Democrats would raise \ntaxes if they took back the majority. ``There's nothing to that \nallegation,'' she said. ``We're going to cut taxes for the middle \nclass.''\n  Then there was the now junior Senator from Virginia, who recently \nlaid out a case against Republican economic policies in a Jacksonian-\ntinged response to the President's State of the Union Address. Talking \nto the Roanoke Times on November 6, he too denied the Democrats would \nraise taxes on the middle class. He said he would not ``raise taxes for \nwage-earning people.'' He would put more burdens on corporations \ninstead, he said.\n  Well, someone on the Budget Committee isn't conferring with the new \nMembers because the budget the Democrats handed down last week not only \ncontradicts the stated intentions of these new Senators, its passage \nwould represent, as Senator Gregg has pointed out, the greatest tax \nhike in U.S. history by far, four times greater, in fact, than any \nprevious tax hike. Four times greater.\n  The last time we saw a tax hike even remotely this big was in the \nDemocratic-controlled Congress back in 1993, and we know what happened \nthe following year. Voter anger over those hikes put Republicans in \ncharge of both Chambers for the first time since 1954. President \nClinton himself would lay those electoral losses squarely at the feet \nof the 1993 tax hike. Speaking later to a group of donors, President \nClinton said, ``I'll tell you the whole story about that tax hike. \nProbably there are people in this room who are still mad at me at that \nbudget because you think I raised your taxes too much. It might \nsurprise you to know that I think I raised them too much too.''\n  That was President Clinton speaking about his tax hike in 1993.\n  If President Clinton thought that tax hike was too much, he would \nchoke on this one. The tax hike the new majority party sent down last \nweek is four times bigger than one that he said was too big for \nAmericans--and, ultimately, him--to stomach.\n  How can the Democrats possibly think the American people will stomach \nthis one?\n  Do they think Americans are ready to see all the economic gains of \nthe last 5 years washed away by a budget that reinstates every tax we \nhave lowered or repealed over that period?\n  If this budget passes, those cuts are gone. Extinct. Dead.\n  And their reimposition would cost working men and women and retirees \ndearly--nearly $1 trillion over the next 5 years, by our count.\n  Everyone will take a hit. Despite the Democratic refrain that the tax \ncuts we enacted in 2001, 2003, and 2005 favor the richest 1 percent, \nthe truth is, the wealthiest Americans continue to pay the lion's share \nof taxes.\n  Under the Democrat budget, they would see their share increase even \nmore--disincentivizing the kind of corporate and individual investment \nthat has driven the economic boom of the last several years.\n  But the wealthiest taxpayers can absorb a hit. They are not the ones \nthis budget hurts the most. That is what is most astonishing about this \nbudget: Working families will take it on the chin.\n  How? Let me count the ways.\n  Under the Democrat's budget, 45 million working families with two \nchildren will see their taxes increase by nearly $3,000 annually.\n  The child tax credit is cut in half--to $500, piling one more worry \nonto the shoulders of parents, not to mention parents-to-be. We should \nbe encouraging and supporting young, growing families in this country, \nnot penalizing them.\n  Newlyweds are robbed of a measure of their happiness, with the budget \ncutting the standard deduction for married couples by $1,700.\n  Far from shifting the burden onto the wealthy, the Democrat's budget \nwould drive up the taxes of an average family of four by more than 130 \npercent--more than doubling their taxes.\n  Single parent households would take a hit too. By letting the 2001 \nand 2003 tax cuts expire in 2010, single-parent families would see \ntheir taxes rise by nearly 70 percent.\n  Senior citizens get hit big.\n  Again: Despite Democratic grumbling that only the richest 1 percent \nof Americans benefit from the tax cuts we passed in 2001 and 2003, \nseniors were a major beneficiary of the capital gains and dividend tax \nrelief. More than half of all seniors today claim income from \ndividends, and one-third claim income from capital gains.\n  That's right, this proposed hike will hit more than half of all \nseniors.\n  The expansion of the market over the last 2 decades hasn't just \nbenefited the few. It has helped millions of hard-working Americans \nretire earlier than they could have dreamed of a generation earlier. \nDemocrats see the wealth\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\nthat more than 15 million American seniors accumulated over that \nperiod, and they want a piece of it.\n  In a sort of perverse politics of inclusion, business owners and \nexecutives, middle-class families of four, struggling single-parent \nhouseholds, and millions of seniors--everyone gets slammed by this \nbudget.\n  Call it fair but cruel.\n  This budget represents a tax hike four times greater than the \nprevious record, and Republicans cannot support it. We said at the \nbeginning of the session we would not support tax hikes. We certainly \nwill not support what amounts to the biggest one in American history.\n  Worse still, the Democrats don't even plan to put their $916 billion \nin new revenue to good use. They don't take back working Americans' tax \nrelief to pay down the debt or lower the deficit--they want it so they \ncan continue to raise spending to unprecedented levels.\n  Let's take a look at some of the numbers.\n  This budget increases annual spending on federal programs over the \nPresident's 2008-2012 requests by nearly $150 billion.\n  It spends more than $1 trillion of the Social Security surplus, \nincreases gross debt by more than $2 trillion between 2008-2011, \nincreases the deficit by $440 billion, and it completely ignores the \nurgent need to address entitlement reform--this, despite the fact that \nthe new Democratic chairman of the budget committee stated flat out on \nnational television just 2 weeks ago, and I quote, that ``We need to \nreform the entitlement programs.''\n  Add it all up and you've got the classic stereotype of the Party of \nTax and Spend. Only, this time, it is on a level the likes of which we \nhave never seen before. It is hyperbole, really.\n  Republicans made a pledge to fight tax increases and to rein in \nspending, and we intend to stick by it. With this budget, the Democrats \nhave guaranteed quite a fight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me indicate we do not want to let \npeople's imaginations run wild here. Let me just make this flatout \nstatement: We have no proposed tax increase in this budget resolution.\n  The Senator from Michigan is to be recognized for 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee for his outstanding work and his \ncommitment day in and day out to putting together a new direction for \nthe country in this budget and meeting our fiscal responsibilities, and \nthanks to his staff for their hard work as well. Also, to our ranking \nmember, the former chairman, we disagree in approach, but I have great \nrespect for him and his staff and the way in which they conduct \nbusiness and their professionalism.\n  Before talking about why this is a good budget resolution, let me \nstart out by, in fact, disagreeing with the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire. He says everything is going great all across the \ncountry, everything is going great. But just last week, in the \nnewspaper here, the Washington Post, we had a story about a national \nsurvey showing a soaring number of homeowners failed to make their \nmortgage payments. The number of foreclosures of all homes jumped to \nits highest level in nearly four decades, according to the survey by \nthe Mortgage Bankers Association. The highest level in nearly four \ndecades? Is that because people just don't want to pay their mortgage? \nOf course it is not. It is because the average people--middle-class \nfamilies, people working hard every single day--are not feeling the \nbenefits of what the distinguished Senator was talking about.\n  It is true that you can show numbers--stock market up 58 percent, \nreal GDP up 32 percent, real corporate profits up 36 percent. But the \nmedian household income--the majority of Americans working hard every \nsingle day, who care about their families and are trying to make a \nbetter life for themselves, have seen their incomes go down--in fact, \n$1,253 over a 5-year period, from 2000 to 2005.\n  Why? First of all, we have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs in \nAmerica under this President and during the previous Congress--3 \nmillion manufacturing jobs. What does that mean? Good-paying jobs, good \nwages, pensions, health care benefits, a chance at the future, the hope \nof sending your children to college--good-paying jobs, 3 million of \nthem lost. I have a list here of just some of those in manufacturing: \ncomputer and electronics manufacturing, 543,900 jobs, good-paying jobs, \npeople who have a very different view than what was presented earlier \nabout how great it is right now economically in America. Vehicle parts, \nmachinery, fabricated metal products and primary metals, and right on \ndown, transportation equipment, furniture products, textile mills--43 \npercent drop in textiles--leather products, right on down through \nchemicals.\n  The reality is too many people in this country, the majority of \npeople in this country, have not benefited from the rosy picture we \nhave heard about and we are going to continue to hear about on this \nfloor. Why? Because they have not been the priority under this \nadministration and the previous Congress. They have not been the \npriority.\n  The good news about this budget is that in this budget, they are the \npriority. We are in a new direction through this budget. We are, in \nfact, returning to fiscal discipline. Yes, we value paying the bills. \nNo more borrow and spend, borrow and spend, over and over again, \nborrowing, adding up mounds of debt. We are putting us back on the road \nto fiscal discipline, and we are putting middle-class families first. \nThat is the value base for this budget. That is what we are looking at \nin the big picture.\n  In fact, the budget is our value statement. It is about our values \nand our priorities. It reflects who we are as a country and allows us \nto shape who we want to be in the decades ahead. This budget is about \nmaking sure everybody has a chance to make it. Folks working hard every \nsingle day want to know that they are going to see their lives improve, \nnot just some numbers for some people.\n  Last November, the American people sent a clear signal that they were \nunhappy with the way this Government was doing business. They chose new \nleadership for America. They wanted a new direction, a direction that \nbuilds on our common values and places a premium on putting our middle-\nclass families first.\n  We have already made great strides in delivering on those promises \nand the potential of last year's election. The Senate has passed an \nincrease in the minimum wage for folks working hard every day, working \nnot one but maybe two or three jobs, probably without health insurance, \ntrying to make ends meet for their families. We finally engaged in an \nopen, important, a critical debate on the war in Iraq, and we have \ntaken concrete steps to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission to make our families and our communities safer.\n  But in many ways, this budget debate, the budget in front of us, is \nour first big test about who we are and what are our priorities. We are \nfaced with a very simple question: Will we bend to business as usual \nand deliver a budget that fails, again, to live up to the mandate the \ncountry has asked of us or will we do what the American people have \ncharged us to do--deliver a budget that reflects middle-class values \nand works for American businesses, farmers, workers, and families? That \nis what our budget resolution does.\n  It will not be easy. We have inherited a fiscal mess, quite honestly. \nWe have tough choices to make. I love seeing that the wall of debt, the \nwall that was actually created by the distinguished Budget chairman \ntalking about where we have come from in the last 6 years--I remember \nin the Budget Committee when we had the largest surplus in the history \nof the country, over $5.6 trillion. We at that time, the Democrats, \nindicated in the Budget Committee that we wanted to see a third of that \ngo to tax cuts, a third of it to investments and opportunity and \nscience and the future--education and health care--and a third to \nprefund the liability on Social Security. We wouldn't be where we are \nin the Social Security debate if we had done that back in 2001. But \nthat is not what happened. Virtually all of it was put into supply-side \neconomics,\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\ntax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and then we went into a war that \nhas not been paid for, et cetera. So we are in a hole. We are in a huge \nhole.\n  One of the things we always talk about is: If you are in a hole and \nyou want to get out, the first thing is to stop digging. This budget \nstops digging the hole and puts us on a path of fiscal responsibility. \nJust like every family in America, the Government has the \nresponsibility to balance its checkbook, and we are committed to \nputting us in that direction and getting that job done.\n  We are committed to a return to fiscal discipline and putting a stop \nto the bad habits of the last 6 years of writing checks the Government \ncannot cash. Under our budget resolution, we begin to chip away at the \nproblem immediately with the target of 2012, 5 years from now, for \ncompletely erasing the Federal deficit.\n  We know we can do that. It is simply a matter of prioritizing and not \nspending money we do not have. I was proud to be part of a Congress \nthat balanced the budget in 1997, working across party lines, to keep \nspending in check. It was not easy. But we understood the long-term \nhealth of the American economy and the long-term well being of our \nmiddle-class families and our businesses were dependent on making tough \nchoices.\n  The irresponsible fiscal policies of this administration have gutted \nour record surpluses and driven us into record deficits. Thank goodness \nwe are beginning now to come out. But it has hurt our families, it has \nhurt our businesses, and it has put our way of life at risk. We are \ncommitted to stopping that.\n  Second, as we put our fiscal house in order, we need to focus on the \npriorities that matter to American families, and that is what this \nbudget does. I should mention in talking about that, when we hear about \nall this spending being talked about, only 17 percent of all the so-\ncalled domestic discretionary spending, the money we have the ability \nto make decisions about, in terms of science and health care and \neducation and environment, public safety, and so on, that the \ndiscretionary part of the budget is 17 percent of the whole budget--17 \npercent. It is invested in the quality of life and the future for the \nfamilies of this country. Those are critical investments.\n  What are we suggesting? Well this budget, in fact, focuses on what \nmatters to middle-class families the most. First, people want to know \nwe are going to be investing in education and opportunity in the future \nfor themselves and their children. We commit to health care for every \nchild. We commit to making sure every child who does not have health \ninsurance is able to get health insurance, so that families who go to \nbed tonight don't worry about what is going to happen--and pray to God, \nplease do not let the kids get sick tonight--they will know there is \nhealth care available to them. Frankly, it needs to be step one to make \nhealth care available to every American.\n  Third, we keep our promises to our veterans. This ought to be a \ngiven. This budget resolution guarantees that. We provide middle-class \ntax cuts. We are all for tax cuts; it is about time the middle class \ngot some. That is what this budget resolution does. We restore key \ninvestments in law enforcement, health care, technology, protecting our \nenvironment. Key investments the President has tried to cut, we have \nput back and restored those.\n  Let me speak for a moment about education. Everyone understands the \nworld economy is changing. Our increased reliance on technology and the \ngrowing competition in the global marketplace means that today, more \nthan ever, we need to be investing in the best education system \npossible for our children. We all say that. We all talk about \neducation.\n  We had a wonderful hearing this morning in the Finance Committee on \neducation. This budget actually does more than talk about it; it takes \ncritical investments and places them as a top priority for us because \nwe know this is the only way we are going to be able to have our \nbusinesses competitive and create real financial opportunities for \nworking-class America.\n  In real-world terms, that means investing more in education and \nfocusing more on innovation. Education policy is economic policy. We \nunderstand that. Creating opportunity for everyone who works hard to \nmake it is what America is all about. It is one of the pillars, the \nfoundations of our economy and a huge focus for our families and a huge \nfocus in this budget.\n  Unfortunately, what did the President do when it came to education \nlast year? Well, he and the Republican Congress, back in Christmas of \n2005, cut $12 billion out of student loans. Then the President came \nback in 2006 with the largest proposed cut in the history of education. \nOur children deserve better. This budget resolution reflects our \ncommitment to education. Under our budget proposal, we invest $6.1 \nbillion more in education funding than the President's proposal for \n2008.\n  Let me speak for a moment about health care. This is a major priority \nin this budget. I believe health care should be a right, not a \nprivilege, in this country. We need to be about the job of changing the \nway we finance it in total and getting it off the back of business. \nYour ability to remain healthy should not be tied to your employment \nstatus or depending upon where you were born or what kind of family you \nwere born into.\n  In America, we can do better than we are doing, and this budget moves \nus in the right direction. We spend more on health care, per capita, \nthan any other Western Nation. Yet we have nearly 50 million people \nwith no health insurance. There is something wrong with this picture. \nWe intend to fix it. Americans who do not have regular access to health \ncare also put a strain on our system economically, produce less for \nsociety, while at the same time saddling business with the skyrocketing \ncost of employee health care is making it more and more difficult for \nour manufacturers and our other businesses to compete globally.\n\n  This is an economic issue as well as a quality of life issue. Our \nbudget proposal, this budget resolution, begins to tackle this issue \nwhere common sense dictates we should start--America's children. Our \nchildren have no choice when it comes to access to health care. They \nalso represent the segment of our population that will reap the most \nlong-term benefits in the introduction of regular, reliable, affordable \naccess to health care.\n  Programs that exist, namely SCHIP for children, already exist, and it \ncovers millions of American children who do not have insurance \notherwise. But this needs to be expanded, and we need to create a \npriority to say that every child without insurance should have access \nto this program.\n  The President's budget designated only $2 billion for children's \nhealth care, for SCHIP, $2 billion. To say that this will not get the \njob done is an understatement. That is why our budget has designated \n$50 billion, 25 times more than that over 5 years, to fully fund health \ncare for children in America.\n  Now I might say as an aside because that is a lot of money, we are \ntalking about $10 billion a year to make sure every child in America \nhas access to health care, $10 billion. That is about what we are \nspending in 1 month in Iraq--1 month in Iraq. We can take 1 month in \nIraq for American children. That is what the budget does. It is time to \nget beyond talking about how children are our future. It is time to \nwalk the walk.\n  That is what this budget does. Americans also want us to keep our \npromises to our veterans. The revelation about conditions at Walter \nReed Army Hospital over the past few weeks have brought into focus the \nconcerns that many of us in this Chamber have been voicing about the \ntreatment of America's veterans over the past few years. No group of \nindividuals, no group, deserve our respect, support and admiration as \nAmericans more than those who selflessly and voluntarily choose to wear \nthe Nation's uniform.\n  They put their lives on the line for us every day, and all they ask \nin return is that when they come home from the battlefield, their \nNation, our country, keeps its promises to them, including providing \nthe health care they need and deserve. It is not enough to make \nstatements on Veterans Day or remove military leadership when problems \narise. It does not get any simpler than this: If the money is not in \nthe budget then our veterans do not get what they need and deserve.\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\n  Now we are not talking about the type of issues that have reared \ntheir ugly head at Walter Reed, we are also talking about systematic \nissues that touch America's veterans in all our 50 States. Inadequate \naccess to doctors and the facilities, extremely long drive times for \ncare, which frequently happens in my State of Michigan, patient \nbacklogs that would make you cringe, our budget addresses what we \nbelieve are the shortfalls in the President's plan when it comes to our \nveterans and their health care.\n  We have set aside an additional $3.5 billion for veterans health care \nin 2008 alone. What is most important is that, for the first time, this \nSenate has a budget resolution that reflects the recommendations of the \nindependent budget, which is the budget of all the veterans \norganizations about what they believe is needed to adequately fund \nveterans health care and other critical needs.\n  Finally, let me say a few words about tax cuts. My friends on the \nother side of the aisle will try to paint Democrats in this budget as \nbeing antitax cut. Nothing could be further from the truth. You know we \nare going to hear all of this; it does not matter what the document \nlooks like. We also know in advance what the mantra is going to be \nbecause it has been that way for years. It has been that way for years. \nBut the reality is very different. I have to say that the--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 20 minutes yielded to the Senator from \nMichigan has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would ask for an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I can give her an additional minute because we are now \ndown to 9 minutes, and they have got 43 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I will take 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We support this budgeting through tax cuts that make \nsense for middle-class families. That is who needs the tax cuts. We \ntalk a lot about these tax cuts being given. You ask the average family \nif they feel like they have gotten a tax cut. They tell me: No. Because \nthey did not get it. People are smart enough to know they did not get \nit.\n  Well, we have put in place tax cuts for the middle class. We have \nstarted with the alternative minimum tax, which is about ready to hit a \nwhole new group of middle-class taxpayers. We make sure that our Tax \nCode gives middle-class families a leg up and does not punish them for \nworking hard and being successful.\n  Finally, we go on to make sure we reinstitute, as I said in the \nbeginning, law enforcement, transportation, community development, \nprotecting our environment, which is a very small part of the budget \nbut critical for our families.\n  The bottom line is this budget works for people. This is about \nmiddle-class families, the values of the majority of Americans, and \ndoing it in a responsible way. I urge the adoption of the budget \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an \nadditional 30 minutes of debate time be added to the original 3 hours, \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 40 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, a few minutes before the last speaker, \nyou heard the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee say there is no \ntax increase in the budget that is before us.\n  Well, technically that is correct, if you consider allowing existing \ntax law to sunset on December 31, 2010. If you do that, we are going to \nhave the biggest tax increase in the history of the country without a \nvote of Congress, without a vote of any of us, the biggest tax increase \nin the history of the country, January 1, 2011. This budget covers that \nperiod of time. I don't know how you can say there is no tax increase \nin this budget, if we are going to have the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of the Congress without a vote of the people, if you have an \nopportunity to do something about it and keep taxes where they \npresently are. That is what is in this budget. There is not going to be \nan attempt to keep taxes where they are so the existing tax laws sunset \nand we have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, \nJanuary 1, 2011.\n\n  We have a budget by the majority party, the Democratic Party, before \nus because the people spoke in November. For the first time in 12 \nyears, the Democrats are in the majority and, consequently, control the \ncongressional budget process. As ranking Republican on the tax-writing \nFinance Committee, I was not consulted, nor did I expect to be, by the \nchairman of this year's budget resolution. Unfortunately, after \nreviewing this resolution, which was presented 5 days ago, it is \nabundantly clear it does not realistically address the possibilities of \nthe Finance Committee carrying out what are its supposed \nresponsibilities under this budget resolution.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, this budget does not provide for even \n1 year of alternative minimum tax relief, let alone 2 years, or even a \n1-year extension of provisions of various tax laws that expire from \ntime to time and that we normally reinstitute. It does not provide for \nthat as well. So this budget puts the burden on the Finance Committee \nto come up with the offsets to pay for the alternative minimum tax \nrelief and for what we refer to as extenders, things that are normally \nextended by the Congress because they are things the economy demands be \nextended.\n  Press reports have largely echoed the defenders of this resolution on \nthe needs of the Finance Committee. I strongly suggest the media folks \ntake a very careful look at the claims of the Democratic leadership and \nsee how they stack up against the cold, hard fiscal numbers and the \noperating history of the Finance Committee in these policy areas. They \nwould find it does not square with the reality of what is possible for \nthe Finance Committee.\n  I back up that statement with these numbers. Over the 5-year budget \nwindow going out to the year 2012, keeping existing policies in place \nwill have a revenue effect of about $916 billion. This includes \nalternative minimum tax relief, extension of bipartisan 2001 and 2003 \ntax relief, and extending other broadly supported expiring provisions. \nIn the aggregate, this budget provides no resources for extending these \npolicies over the 5-year window. In so doing, we end up with the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the country without Congress \nvoting for it. Yet somehow the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \ncan say there are no tax increases in this budget.\n  I go back to the grassroots. As a family farmer, which I am, I like \nto think we country folk can teach city folk a lesson or two by \nreferring to the country's sayings and metaphors. Although I am going \nto be using numbers, you will recognize some rural touchstones in the \nchart I am using, which is this chart of a well where you get water. \nThe first chart involves the method a lot of us farmers use to get our \nwater, through the well on our family farm. You will see the well in \nthis chart.\n  Here is the top of the well. My colleagues can see it is a long well \nand a very deep well. There is some water way down at the very bottom, \nbut most of this well in between is very dry. At the top of the well we \nsee the number that represents the rough--and it is probably a bit on \nthe low side--amount of the revenue raisers in this budget, and it \nassumes we on the Finance Committee will be able to find $916 billion. \nThat is revenue we would have to find offsets for over a 5-year period \nto pay for extending existing tax policies that expire during this \nperiod. If we don't do it, that is where I continue to make the point \nwe are going to have the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry.\n  Of course, this is talking about existing tax policy. It doesn't even \ninclude any new starters such as tax relief to encourage renewable \nenergy which most Members of this body are talking about, or tax relief \nto help education which a lot of Members of this body, including this \nSenator, have talked about, and a lot of new starters such as providing \ntax benefits to help the health care problem. A lot of us in this body \ntalk about that. It doesn't include renewable energy, education, and \nhealth care. So this budget assumes the well of revenue raisers is full \nto the brim. We can see it is not.\n  As a farmer, I know something about the predictability of wells. You \nhope\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\nyou will get a lot of rain and it will give you a decent level of \nwater. As former chairman and now, because we Republicans are in the \nminority, ranking member of the Finance Committee, I think I know \nsomething about revenue raisers and how difficult or how easy it might \nbe to raise a certain amount of revenue. I have been there. I have done \nthat. When I was chairman of the Finance Committee, I aggressively led \nefforts to identify and enact sensible revenue raisers and at closing \nthe tax gap and shutting down tax shelters. As ranking member, I \ncontinue to look for ways to shut off unintended tax benefits. I \nconsider myself to be a credible authority on what is realistic when it \ncomes to revenue raisers.\n  This budget is not realistic. From 2001 through 2006, Congress \nenacted over 100 offsets with combined revenue scores of $1.7 billion \nover 1 year, $51.5 billion over 5 years, and $157.9 billion over 10 \nyears. That figure is reflected on this chart. That would be the figure \nof $51 billion enacted over a 5-year timeframe.\n  To show I am not making this up, I ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record a table that shows the track record on enacted offsets. \nThese numbers are conservatively high because they include repeal of \nthe FSC/ETI to comply with the ruling of the World Trade Organization \nwhich could not have been done without also providing tax relief with \nthe manufacturing deduction.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       REVENUE RAISERS ENACTED SINCE 2001\n                                        (Amounts in millions of dollars)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  # of\n                                                               provisions      1-yr         5-yr        10-yr\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMilitary Family Tax Relief Act of 2003\n    Extensions of Customs User Fees.........................            2          619        1,305        1,305\nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004\n    Repeal of FSC/ETI (to comply with WTO ruling)...........            1          354       16,411       49,199\n    Provisions to Reduce Tax Avoidance Through Individual               6          139          526        1,343\n     and Corporate Expatriation.............................\n    Provisions Relating to Tax Shelters (including SILOs)...           21        1,182       10,328       33,236\n    Reduction of Fuel Tax Evasion...........................           21          625        4,380        9,138\n    Other Revenue Provisions................................           30      (1,335)       13,601       38,249\n                                                             ---------------------------------------------------\n      Total.................................................           79          965       45,246      131,165\nEnergy Tax Incentives Act of 2005\n    Revenue Raising Provisions..............................            4            2        1,491        3,028\nHighway Reauthorization and Excise Tax Simplification (2005)\n    Provisions to Combat Fuel Fraud.........................            7         (10)          297          607\nGulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005\n    Interest Suspension Modification........................            1           50           50           50\nTax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005\n (2006)\n    Revenue Offset Provisions...............................           14          104        3,086       21,787\n                                                             ---------------------------------------------------\n      Grand Total...........................................          107        1,730       51,475      157,942\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Finance Committee Staff summary of revenue tables prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The legislation that contains these provisions spans \nyears so they don't correspond on a year-by- year basis. The point here \nis to look at what Congress was able to accomplish over a 6-year period \nas evidence of what it might be able to accomplish over the 5-year \nwindow of the budget resolution. Some might say it is comparing apples \nand oranges, because the House was under Republican control during that \nperiod. But as we are seeing, Democratic control does not seem to have \nchanged the allergic reaction of the House of Representatives to \nrevenue raisers. Because during the markup, while the chairman of the \nBudget Committee was holding up his chart, as he did today, with a \npicture of a German sewer system that U.S. companies are claiming phony \ndepreciation deductions on through abusive leasing transactions, the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the other body was holding \na hearing and somehow sympathizing with lobbyists about how it is bad \ntax policy to shut off these tax benefits.\n  The most significant package of revenue raisers over this period was \nin the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. I took a lot of heat on \nthose revenue raisers, as shown in the Congressional Daily article \nentitled ``Balance of Payments, A Closer Look at Tax Bill Losers.'' \nThis article refers to the revenue raisers in the Senate passed JOBS \nbill as ``the most significant rollback of tax loopholes since 1986.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Balance of Payments--A Closer Look at Tax Bill Losers\n\n       By now we're well aware of the winners in the Senate's \n     just-passed, $170 billion-plus, corporate tax cut package--\n     they include NASCAR racetrack operators, Oldsmobile dealers \n     and Learjet makers, as well as large manufacturers and \n     multinational companies more generally.\n       But one almost-overlooked aspect of the bill--and perhaps \n     the one that packs the most significant impact over the long \n     term--is the number of losers the bill would create.\n       The insistence by Senate Democrats and a few dissenting \n     Republicans that all tax cuts be balanced out by offsetting \n     ``revenue raisers'' has given birth to a peculiar form of \n     alchemy on the Finance Committee. The new tax breaks are \n     offset by provisions shutting down tax shelters and closing a \n     vast array of perceived ``loopholes,'' which will raise \n     upwards of $60 billion for the Treasury over 10 years.\n       Finance Chairman Grassley said the revenue offsets in his \n     bill are designed to punish tax cheats and corporate \n     criminals. The revenue-raising provisions, if they eventually \n     become law, will be the most significant rollback of tax \n     loopholes since the 1986 law that changed the passive loss \n     rules, observers said. They include new, stiff penalties for \n     failure to disclose tax shelter activities, codification of \n     the economic substance doctrine and an end to abuses brought \n     to light by the Enron scandal.\n       But skeptics in the House and on K Street believe some \n     offsets are a product of panning in the revenue stream of the \n     U.S. government for tax cut gold. The rocketing cost of \n     Senate bill and the parallel drive to create money-saving \n     offsets have led the Finance Committee to over-reach, they \n     claim.\n       House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas criticized the Senate \n     approach in a Q with reporters last week, saying that the \n     Senate has the tendency to turn striving for revenue \n     neutrality ``into a mechanical exercise.'' He said this led \n     to some situations in which ``the revenue you are reaching \n     for is not the same as the policy you are trying to cover.''\n       The most significant piece in terms of the money it \n     raises--$42 billion over 10 years--is provisions to curb \n     abusive leasing transactions, under which taxpayer dollars \n     have literally been used to help finance dozens of foreign \n     and domestic infrastructure projects, including sewer systems \n     and subways, while the large financial institutions that \n     structured the deals raked in billions.\n       Almost no one in Washington argues that no legislation is \n     needed to stop the abusive leasing transactions, but the way \n     the Senate went about it has raised a few eyebrows. By moving \n     back effective dates and other adjustments, Grassley \n     gradually expanded the scope of the provision to squeeze a \n     greater number of transactions as tax cuts were added to the \n     bill, making it more costly.\n       Particularly galling to some Republicans in the House and \n     Senate was making the new curbs applicable to transactions \n     entered after Nov. 19, 2003, which they argued makes the \n     provision retroactive. But Senate aides said that was done to \n     thwart a ``rush-to-market'' of promoters of the leasing \n     transactions seeking to close deals under the wire.\n       ``The fact that it was moved back continually to pay for \n     various items might suggest that revenue had some kind of \n     relevance,'' said Kenneth Kies of Clark Consulting, who \n     lobbies on behalf of a coalition that wants the leasing \n     benefits preserved.\n       Hill sources said Thomas and other Republicans, including \n     some from the Senate, would insist in an eventual conference \n     committee that the Senate language making the leasing \n     provisions retroactive to last year be removed.\n       Also stirring some controversy are new limits on the amount \n     individuals could deduct for donating automobiles to charity. \n     (Full disclosure: My 1991 Buick was worth a\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\n     $950 deduction to me on my 2003 return. I went with the book \n     value for ``good'' condition and wished the American Lung \n     Association best of luck getting that much for it. Under the \n     new rules in the Senate bill, I would have been able to \n     deduct only what the charity reported to me was the actual \n     resale price of the car.)\n       Most donated used cars are sold at auction, and charities \n     for which car donations are an important part of their \n     fundraising are arguing to lawmakers that it is unfair to \n     limit taxpayer deductions to the liquidation price when many \n     could fetch more for cast-off autos if they found a private \n     buyer themselves.\n       Charities--including the National Kidney Foundation, the \n     American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association--\n     are shopping alternative language to House tax writers for \n     inclusion in the House FSC/ETI bill.\n       Business sources say a provision tightening rules on \n     deferral for income derived from contract manufacturing \n     overseas is an example of where the Finance Committee reached \n     for a revenue raiser without fully understanding the policy \n     consequences. The provision was struck from the bill in the \n     hours before final Senate passage.\n       ``The folks that were advocating that as a possible revenue \n     raiser--at a time when people were looking for revenue \n     raisers--didn't appreciate the extent to which most of \n     contract manufacturing is a completely legitimate, \n     appropriate business strategy,'' said Dan Kostenbauder, vice \n     president of transaction taxes for Hewlett-Packard. ``This is \n     not like someone found a fancy tax dodge.''\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Looking then at the 5-year numbers, Congress has \nenacted $51 billion of revenue raisers since 2001. That happens to be \nonly about 6 percent of the amount that is needed to make the budget we \nare debating now work, without regard to any new relief which will also \nhave to be paid for.\n  What other revenue raisers have been identified and scored? Because \nwe are always looking for them, because we are always getting scores \nfor them, there is always going to be some need for them. The \nPresident's budget, for instance, contained a package of 16 tax gap \nmeasures that the Joint Committee on Taxation scores as raising $5.7 \nbillion over 5 years. We can see that figure reflected on this chart. \nThe Democrats have identified raisers that amount to $35.6 billion. So \nwe have $42 billion of identified and scored revenue raisers. Let's \nlook at how that figure compares to the budget before us. That is only \nabout 5 percent of the amount that is needed to make this budget work. \nBased on these facts, the likelihood that the Finance Committee, the \ntax-writing committee of the Senate, will be able to come up with \nrevenue raisers of this magnitude is remote at best.\n  If that is the case, what will then happen? The revenue side of the \nbudget will be ignored, but the spending side will be followed. The net \neffect will be a massive tax increase, a bigger deficit, or both. I am \nletting my colleagues know the revenue-raising well is about 5 to 6 \npercent full, not 100 percent full, as it would take to do it. If we \nlook at the Finance Committee tax staff's aggressive record on revenue \nraising as a guide, we might be able to fill the revenue of this well a \nlittle bit more, but there is no way we can get to where this budget \npurports to go.\n  In conclusion, this budget represents a dramatic step backward for \nthe American taxpayer. For the first time in 6 years, this budget is a \nbarrier, not a path, for bipartisan tax relief for virtually every \nAmerican taxpayer.\n\n  I have another chart that uses a farm analogy. We farmers are \nfrequently visited by Canadian geese as they fly south down the \nMississippi ``fly-away'' for the winter, and as they come north for the \nspring. Geese are not like chickens in that they do not hang around to \nlay eggs. Here is a chart with a goose on it. This chart shows that the \nbudget guarantees a goose egg for tax relief.\n  City folks know the term ``goose egg'' means zero. For the first time \nin 6 years, that is what the American public is getting in guaranteed \ntax relief--a goose egg. That is what they are getting--zero, zip, \nnothing. So take a look at our track record. Take a look at the revenue \noffsets Senate Democrats have identified and scored. What you will see \nis a minimal amount, as the well chart showed. This budget, then, puts \nan unrealistic demand on the revenue offsets that are possible. The \nwell of offsets cannot be filled to the level the budget assumes. It is \nso unrealistic as, in my judgment, to be fictitious. It means virtually \nevery taxpayer gets a goose egg.\n  Now, for 6 years, we have heard the primary reason for partisan \nopposition to popular bipartisan tax relief is fiscal responsibility. \nWhere is the fiscal responsibility on the spending side of the ledger \nin this budget? If you take a look, you will see that goose egg again.\n  So after 6 years of fiscal responsibility arguments, you would think \nif the American taxpayer was going to get a goose egg in tax relief, \nthe party in power would show us more than a goose egg on the spending \nrestraint side. Not so. As a matter of fact, spending goes up several \nhundred billion dollars.\n  As ranking member of the Finance Committee, I am sorry to say this \nbudget does not even attempt to mesh the demands of the Finance \nCommittee with the numbers in this budget. From my Finance Committee \nperspective, we might as well demand we have 60-vote bills. That is the \nonly way you can ignore the budget resolution. There is no way for \noffsets of the size that is demanded here that are possible.\n  I hope deficit hawks on both sides of the aisle pay close attention. \nThe only thing certain is new spending is going to occur. That is the \nonly thing that is going to happen. The deficit impact of not \nrealistically dealing with the tax, trade, and health policy priorities \nof the Finance Committee disguises the deficit built into this budget.\n  I am going to have more to say on this disconnect between the Finance \nCommittee policies and this budget as we continue this debate in coming \ndays. Today, I merely wished to show the Senate how the numbers on the \nrevenue side do not work. As we take up amendments, I am hopeful we can \nmake this budget mesh with what is possible for the Finance Committee \nto do and the policy demands before that committee.\n  I also wish to discuss another thing that is going to be heavily \ndiscussed, in fact to some extent has already been discussed with this \nbudget; that is, the sources of revenue the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee claims will help offset the 5-year $916 billion cost of \nextending existing tax policy. That happens to be something I like to \ntalk about because I like to do things in this area--shutting down \noffshore tax havens.\n  I have been aggressive in combating abusive tax shelters offshore and \notherwise. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I worked hard to shut \ndown offshore tax evaders. I already referred in my remarks today to \nthe 2004 JOBS bill, shutting down the tax benefits for companies that \nenter into corporate inversion transactions and abusive domestic and \ncross-border leasing transactions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. On the issue of loopholes, the Senator is a leading expert \nin this Chamber. Mr. Conrad, the Senator from North Dakota, the \nchairman of the committee, has, on a number of occasions, said as to \noffshore tax planning, when you go on Google and put in ``offshore tax \nplanning,'' you get 1.2 million hits on Google for sites you would go \nto to find out how to game the tax system.\n  I was wondering if the Senator was aware, when you put ``Democratic \ntax increases'' into Google, you get 1.5 million hits.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, I could imagine so because they are a party that \nenjoys increasing taxes. So I can understand that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for answering the question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question on this issue?\n  I was going to ask the Senator, was this on the Republican National \nCommittee Web site?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Of course not. It is on the real Web site.\n  Well, I referred to this 2004 JOBS bill before in my remarks, \nshutting down the tax benefits for companies that enter into corporate \ninversion transactions and abusive domestic and cross-border leasing \ntransactions.\n  The JOBS bill also contains a package of 21 antitax shelter \nprovisions. That has been law since 2004.\n  As ranking member of the Finance Committee, I saw to it that the \nminimum wage and small business tax relief package also contained \nantitax loophole provisions--and that stuff is still before the \nSenate--including shutting off tax benefits for corporations\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\nthat inverted after Senator Baucus and I issued a public warning that \nlegislation would stop these deals, shutting off tax benefits from \nabusive foreign leasing transactions that were not caught by the JOBS \nbill, and doubling penalties and interest for offshore financial \narrangements.\n  But again, I refer to the Democratic chairman of the tax-writing \ncommittee in the other body, the Ways and Means Committee, who does not \nappear to be supportive of these provisions based upon a hearing he had \nlast week, even though--even though--the same Member of the other body \nvoted for many of them in the public JOBS conference in 2004.\n  So having studied these issues and having legislated in this area, I \nconsider my views on tax policy directed at tax shelters and tax havens \nto be credible. From what I can tell, the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee in the Senate views the problem of offshore tax havens \nin two categories: One, the ability of U.S. multinationals to shift \nincome to these tax havens; and, two, tax evasion by U.S. individuals \nwho hide assets and income in tax havens.\n\n  We have seen Democratic Senators, including the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, hold up a picture of the Ugland House, a law firm's \noffice building in the Cayman Islands, as home to 12,748 corporations. \nI would like to give Senators some background on where that picture \ncomes from and at what issue it is aimed.\n  That picture comes from an article published in Bloomberg Markets in \nAugust 2004, and it is titled ``The $150 Billion Shell Game.'' The \narticle focused on the ability of U.S. multinationals to shift income \nto low-tax jurisdictions through transfer pricing. Transfer pricing is \na term for how affiliated corporations set the prices for transactions \nbetween them. Transfer pricing is important because it determines how \nmuch profit is subject to tax in different jurisdictions involved in \nrelated party transactions.\n  The $150 billion figure is an academic estimate of the annual amount \nof profit that corporations shift outside the United States with \nimproper transfer pricing. That is what the $150 billion figure is. Let \nme make that clear. It is an estimate of the annual amount of profit \nthat corporations shift outside the United States with improper \ntransfer pricing.\n  So this article is aimed at U.S. corporations that artificially shift \ntheir income to low-tax jurisdictions through improper transfer pricing \npractices. To illustrate this point, I have produced a few quotes from \nthat article. The first one says:\n\n       Under U.S. law, U.S. companies can use Cayman subsidiaries \n     and transfer pricing rules to shift sales and profits from \n     other countries, thus reducing their overall tax burden.\n\n  Another quote:\n\n       A practice called transfer pricing may be the key to how \n     U.S. corporations avoid taxes in the U.S. and other \n     countries.\n\n  That last quote is from my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, \nMr. Dorgan.\n  One of the Democrats' revenue raisers, then, that is still on the \nshelf purports to target this transfer pricing problem. But you would \nnot know it by looking at the language of the proposal because it does \nnot make any changes to our transfer pricing rules. Instead, the \nproposal would eliminate deferral for income of any U.S. \nmultinational's foreign subsidiaries incorporated in certain black-\nlisted jurisdictions. It is called the tax haven controlled foreign \ncorporate proposal. I am going to call it CFC for short.\n  Part of our Tax Code since 1918, ``deferral'' means that U.S. \nmultinationals do not pay tax on active income of their foreign \nsubsidiaries until that income is repatriated to the United States. \nPassive income is subject to tax on a current basis. Deferral only \napplies to active income.\n  I agree with the premise of this proposal that U.S. multinationals \nshould pay their fair share of U.S. taxes. U.S. multinationals that use \nimproper transfer pricing do so to obtain the benefits of deferral on \nprofits that, economically, should be subject to tax in the United \nStates on a current basis. Here is my quote from the Bloomberg article:\n\n       We have to get on top of corporate accounting and \n     manipulation of corporate books for the sole purpose of \n     reducing taxes.\n\n  Nobody is going to disagree with that.\n  So my view is that stronger transfer pricing rules and stronger \nenforcement of those rules is the right way to target this problem in \nour current international tax system. The Internal Revenue Service is \ntaking steps to tighten our transfer pricing rules.\n  In 2005, that agency proposed regulations that would overhaul the \nrules for so-called cost-sharing arrangements. These are arrangements \nby which U.S. multinationals are able to transfer intangible property \nto subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions. Based on the volume of \ncomplaining I have seen lobbyists level at the Treasury and the IRS, \nthe proposed IRS regulations would go a long way to prevent artificial \nincome shifting. I hope to see these regulations finalized very soon.\n  Others have different views. They would eliminate deferrals \naltogether. So another quote in the Bloomberg article succinctly states \nthis view. This is a quote from Jason Furman, a former aide to Senator \nKerry of Massachusetts. It says:\n\n       American companies should pay taxes on their profits in the \n     same way whether they earn them in Bangalore or Buffalo.\n\n  Now, that might sound simple enough, but that is where these \nproposals to eliminate or curtail deferrals on a piecemeal basis are \nheaded--headed in a way that is going to be harmful, to completely \neliminate deferral for U.S. multinationals. Without a significant \ncorporate tax rate reduction--and I would be in favor of doing that--\neliminating deferrals would have the effect of exporting our high tax \nrates and putting U.S. multinationals at a competitive disadvantage in \nthe global marketplace. When I said I would be in favor of reducing our \ncorporate tax rates, that is because other countries are doing it and \nif we don't soon do something along that line, we are going to lose a \nlot of business and particularly a lot of manufacturing here in the \nUnited States.\n\n  The Senate is on record as wanting to protect the competitiveness of \nU.S. businesses in the global marketplace. That is what the American \nJobs Creation Act of 2004--an act I referred to several times today \nwhich contains several international simplification provisions, and \nwith a vote of 69 Senators, including 24 Democrats, we passed that \nbill. The Senate version of the JOBS bill passed with a more bipartisan \nmajority--92 Senators, including 44 Democrats.\n  There has been a longstanding debate about whether our international \ntax system should be fundamentally changed. Some advocate taxing all \nforeign income on a current basis; others argue for completely \nexempting active foreign income under a territorial system, as many of \nour trading partners do. If we want to have that debate, that is a very \nfair debate to have, but piecemeal cutbacks on deferral for active \nforeign income would do nothing but complicate the Tax Code and create \nopportunities for tax planning around those cutbacks.\n  The other offshore issue identified by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is U.S. tax evasion by individual taxpayers who hide their \nassets and income in foreign bank accounts and foreign corporations. \nSince 1913, our Tax Code has subjected U.S. citizens to taxes on their \nworldwide income. No matter what the Internet purveyors of tax evasion \nsay, this principle cannot be avoided by putting passive assets and \nincome into a foreign corporation. The Tax Code has rules to prevent \nthis. Taxpayers who do that willingly violate these rules and, of \ncourse, are guilty of tax fraud and, in some instances, may even be \nguilty of criminal fraud.\n  So the problem of offshore tax evasion isn't that our laws permit it; \nthe problem is there are some taxpayers who are intent on cheating, \nintent on hiding their income from the Internal Revenue Service. The \nService has been successful in catching many of these, but more can be \ndone, and I will help do it.\n  The Service has difficulty detecting tax evasion and obtaining the \ninformation necessary to enforce our laws. One important tool for the \nIRS is information exchange with other jurisdictions. Our double tax \ntreaties contain an article on information exchange designed to help \nthe IRS obtain quality information to enforce our tax laws. In \naddition, administrations past and present\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\nhave entered into over 20 tax information exchange agreements with \njurisdictions that are often referred to as tax havens. Sensible \nsolutions to this problem should aim to improve on our tax information \nexchange network and not put it at risk.\n  Underreported income is the largest piece of the tax gap. We should \nkeep in mind that hiding assets and income from the IRS isn't just an \noffshore tax haven problem; it may also be an onshore problem. A recent \narticle in USA Today noted that there is:\n\n       A thriving mini-industry that has capitalized on real or \n     perceived gaps in domestic incorporation laws and virtually \n     nonexistent government oversight to promote some U.S. States \n     as secrecy rivals of offshore havens.\n\n  The picture of the Ugland House in the Cayman Islands makes for good \ngrandstanding, yes, but there are also office buildings in some States \nthat are listed as addresses for thousands of companies which are \nincorporated in those States for similar reasons as corporations may be \nincorporated in the Cayman Islands; that is, secrecy of ownership and a \npermissive regulatory environment.\n  Whatever additional solutions the Finance Committee comes up with to \nshine sunlight on tax evaders will need to consider both offshore as \nwell as onshore evasion.\n  To conclude, I wish to emphasize that I am all for shutting off \ninappropriate tax benefits from offshore arenas. The chairman has said \nhe thinks we could get $100 billion a year from this source. I haven't \nseen any proposals scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation that come \neven close to bringing in that kind of money. The last score I have \nseen for the tax havens CFC proposal is $7.7 billion over 5 years. \nSenators Levin, Coleman, and Obama have recently introduced a bill \nwhich contains several proposals aimed at offshore tax havens, but I \nhaven't seen a Joint Committee on Taxation score on it yet.\n  So once again, it will be the Finance Committee's responsibility to \ncome up with real, sensible, effective proposals to combat offshore and \nonshore tax havens, and I am glad to do it, as I have over the last \nseveral years. But the likelihood that they will be scored by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation to bring in the kind of money assumed in this \nbudget resolution is remote at best, and it borders on, I believe, blue \nsmoke.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, first of all, I have previously \ncommended publicly the former chairman of the Finance Committee for the \nwork he has done in this area, and I wish to commend him again because \nI consider him an ally in this effort and somebody who has been serious \nabout going after tax havens and somebody who has been serious about \ngoing after abusive tax shelters. In fact, I have even quoted him, and \nlet me quote him again. Here is what he said last year at this time on \nthe Senate floor:\n\n       Just in the period of time since 2001, our committee has \n     raised around $200 billion in new revenues by shutting down \n     tax shelters, by closing inversions, and other abusive tax \n     schemes.\n\n  I believe that is the case.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Now, just in the year 2004 alone, the Finance Committee \n     fully offset a $137 billion tax bill at no expense to the \n     American taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Those are 10-year figures.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I understand, 10-year numbers. But we are talking about \n5-year numbers of $439 billion. Let me say, if they can do that, these \nextraordinary numbers, and we combine not only tax gap with tax havens \nand with abusive tax shelters, I believe we could easily get that $439 \nbillion. Again, the President said his budget would produce $14.8 \ntrillion in revenue. We are saying $15 trillion. That is a 1.2-percent \ndifference.\n  Finally, this is from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations:\n\n       Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury \n     from offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per \n     year.\n\n  I rest my case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I know the Senator from Massachusetts is waiting \npatiently, and I just have a couple of quick questions I wanted to ask \nthe recent chairman, now ranking member, of the Finance Committee, who \nI think is regarded as an expert in the area of how we get at these \npeople who are avoiding our tax system. He has obviously studied this \nissue.\n  Could the Senator from Iowa give us his thoughts as to how much you \ncould raise relative to loophole closing that is legitimate--I mean \nversus a stated number, which can always be fairly high? But what is \nthe real number one could actually generate over the next 5 years, in \nthe Senator's experience and as a result of his studying this issue?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am glad to answer that question because I think, if \nyou look at what this budget assumes, raising this much money--\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, $434 billion minimum; $900 billion, \nactually.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think it is about like this, maybe $30 billion, $35 \nbillion at best.\n  Mr. GREGG. That would be a 5-year number?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Five-year number, yes.\n  Let me say, if I could raise the amount of money which is assumed to \nbe raised here, I would have done away with the alternative minimum tax \na long time ago because you need that kind of offset to get that job \ndone over the long haul.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator from Iowa is much too \nmodest. I have much greater confidence in his abilities and the \nabilities of the other members of the Finance Committee--a committee, \nby the way, on which I serve--to do far better.\n  Look, we are talking about a tax gap over this period alone of $2 \ntrillion. Fifteen percent of that would be $300 billion. I don't know \nif we can get that amount, but I would say to the Senator, when we put \nit all together, when we put together the tax gap, tax havens, tax \nscams, abusive tax shelters, there is a ton of money there. Just in \nthis offshore area alone, another committee of Congress, the \nInvestigations Subcommittee, says $100 billion a year is being lost.\n  There is a lot of money here, without any tax increase to anybody, \njust collecting--let me just give one other example--this is very \ninteresting--on compliance. If we were able to increase our compliance \nfrom 86 percent to 89 percent, we would raise the total amount of \nrevenue that is in the budget I have proposed. Again, the President \nsaid his budget would raise $14.8 trillion. Here is what he said. He \nsaid his budget would raise $14.8 trillion. My budget raises $15 \ntrillion. That is a 1.2-percent difference.\n  Civilization is not going to end if we do a better job of collecting \nthe revenue that is due. Civilization is not going to end if we \nsuccessfully go after these abusive tax shelters. We can do this. We \nneed a lot more confidence in ourselves. We need to be a little \noptimistic. You know what. America can do this. We can do this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I am sorry to delay the Senator from \nMassachusetts, but it is only because the Senator from North Dakota has \ndelayed him.\n  It is important to note that the IRS Commissioner testified before \nthe Budget Committee. He said the most we could probably recover over \nthe next 5 years over and above what they have already recovered--\nbecause they believe they have done a good job of expanding their \nactions in this area for owed but uncollected taxes--the most in the \nlast year would be $20 billion, and the most over the entire period \nwould be somewhere between $30 billion and $40 billion. That is the tax \ngap. There is no $400 billion sitting there.\n  The Senator from Iowa, who is the expert in the area of these \noffshore activities, how you get to them, how you can structure better \nways to get to them, has said--and I think in a very commonsense way, \ncommon sense being one of the things he is most respected for around \nhere--if these type of dollars were available, he would have gone after \nthem in order to take\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\ncare of some other issues that are very important, such as the AMT.\n  So I have referred to this budget as the budget from the Land of Oz \nbecause somewhere behind the curtain, somebody is supposed to develop \nall this money. Regrettably, there is probably no curtain and nobody \nbehind it, even though the Senator from Iowa would probably be as close \nas you could get around here to somebody who has that sort of wizardry. \nHe cannot produce and his committee cannot produce the type of dollars \nthat are being proposed here unless you raise rates.\n  I would ask the Senator from Iowa if he does not agree with that \nassessment and if he has any further comment on this issue.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree, yes. I emphasize that we are told by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee time after time that there is no tax \nincrease in this budget. But if you do nothing--and doing nothing is \nnot an excuse to have the biggest tax increase in the history of this \ncountry go in without even a vote of Congress. If you are going to \nraise taxes, you ought to at least vote them up, it seems to me, so you \ncan be held responsible. It seems to me to be very irresponsible to say \nthat you can have the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry and not think you can do economic harm and strike a blow \nagainst economic freedom for individuals.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, when they make this Wizard of Oz \nreference, I do remember words from the Wizard of Oz: brains, courage, \nand heart. That is what we need here. I believe we have the brains in \nthis country to go after a tax gap that is well over $400 billion a \nyear now. That is $2 trillion over 5 years, and it should return \nsubstantial money to the Treasury of the United States. I believe we \ncan go after these tax havens that another committee of Congress has \nsaid are running a revenue loss to this country of $100 billion a year. \nI believe we can shut down these abusive tax shelters that have the \nspectacle of wealthy investors in this country buying European sewer \nsystems and depreciating them on their books so they hold down their \nU.S. taxes and then lease them back to these foreign enemies.\n  Come on. We can't capture 15 percent--15 percent--of the tax gap and \nthe tax haven abuses and the tax shelter scams? We can't do that? Well, \nif we can't, they ought to get a new bunch in here. They ought to get a \nbunch of new Members of the Senate and the Congress of the United \nStates. If we can't increase the compliance rate from 86 to 89 percent, \nthey ought to get some new Senators in here. They ought to get some new \nCongressmen in here to get the job done, because that is a job the \nAmerican people deserve to have accomplished.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I appreciate the enthusiasm of the \nSenator from North Dakota for his theory that you can get $434 billion \nfrom behind the curtain, but we have to at least acknowledge the fact \nthat experts in this area, including the Commissioner of the IRS, the \nformer chairman of the Finance Committee, the present ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, have all said you can recover some dollars here, \nbut that type of pot of gold is not there.\n  The yellow brick road the Senator wishes to follow, and which his \nbill is basically forcing us to follow, will increase taxes by $900 \nbillion, and we know where it is going to come from. It is going to \ncome from raising rates, raising rates on American workers and \nAmericans generally. There is no other place to get it.\n  If that were not the case, then we wouldn't have structured within \nthis budget, or he would not, or the Democratic Party would not have \nstructured within this budget all these mechanisms to absolutely \nguarantee that rates have to be raised. Point of order after point of \norder after point of order makes it virtually impossible to maintain \nrates where they are.\n  You can throw up the smokescreen of, well, we are going to get it \nfrom here and there, but we are not going to get it from the place that \nis obvious. Well, if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, it \nmust be a duck, and the duck here is that tax rates are going up.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, look, this isn't that hard. The \nPresident said in his budget he was going to raise $14.8 trillion. In \nmy budget, I say $15 trillion. That is a 1.2 percent difference. I \ndon't believe for a minute that we can't raise that difference by going \nafter these abusive tax shelters, these offshore tax havens, this \nlooming tax gap. The tax gap alone is going to be well over $2 trillion \nover these 5 years--$2 trillion.\n  It seems to me it is very clear. I used to be a tax commissioner. I \nhave audited the books--Senator Dorgan and I are perhaps the only ones \nhere who have audited the books and records of companies operating on \nan international basis. I went to my legislature and told them I would \nproduce this kind of additional revenue if they would increase my \nbudget. They did, and I did.\n  I know this can be done. This isn't an imagining to me. I have done \nit. Senator Dorgan has done it. We have actually checked the books and \nrecords of companies. We have found extraordinary sums of money for the \nlittle State of North Dakota. My goodness, if it can be done for North \nDakota, it can certainly be done for the United States.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have listened with interest for the last little bit \nwhile my colleague from Iowa was on the floor. It appeared to me he was \ndefending some of these tax breaks. I couldn't quite figure that all \nout, but I will ask the Senator, who is the chairman of the committee, \nis it true you are having trouble convincing people, or are we having \ntrouble convincing people that having Wachovia Bank buy a sewer system \nin Germany for the purpose of reducing their U.S. income tax burden is \na bad idea?\n  If the Senator from New Hampshire wants to talk about where we would \nget some additional revenues, maybe we could start now a dollar at a \ntime. Let's take at least the first dollar and decide that U.S. \ncompanies that buy and immediately lease back sewer systems, \nstreetcars, or city halls in foreign countries, or in this country for \nthat matter, for the purpose of depreciating an asset that otherwise \nwouldn't be depreciable, for the purpose of reducing their U.S. income \ntaxes and agree that is a bad idea. Let's shut it down. Let's decide \ntoday, on Tuesday, that is over. Can we at least agree on that piece? \nIf so, my colleague Senator Conrad has us on the road to at least \nbeginning piece by piece to putting the system together to get the \nrevenue we need. This is not about raising taxes, it is about asking \nthose who ought to be paying taxes to start paying them.\n\n  I have been on the floor talking a lot. In fact, the chart my \ncolleague is putting up now--and David Evans, who is a very \nenterprising reporter from Bloomberg put this story together--states \nthat 12,748 companies exist in that one five-story building on a quiet \nlittle street called Church Street in the Cayman Islands. They are not \nin that building, of course. It is a legal fiction to allow them to \nreduce their U.S. tax burden.\n  I ask my colleague Senator Conrad, are we having a hard time \nconvincing our colleagues of these simple baby steps we ought to be \ntaking to get the revenue people ought to be paying without allowing \nthem to depreciate foreign sewer systems, for gosh sakes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will tell my colleague that I have a \npicture of a foreign sewer system that was handled in precisely that \nway. U.S. investors bought a foreign sewer system and depreciated that \non their books in the United States for the purpose of reducing their \ntaxes in the United States, and then they leased it back to the foreign \ngovernment that built it in the first place. Look, here is the building \nin the Cayman Islands, home to the 12,748 companies.\n  Here is the work of another committee of the Congress that points out \nwe are losing $100 billion a year in that kind of scam. Our country is \nlosing $100 billion a year. Our friends on the other side of the aisle \nwill say, oh, there is nothing we can do about it. Sure, there is \nsomething we can do about it, if we have the brains, the heart, and the \ncourage. That is Wizard of Oz.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for one \nadditional question.\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\n  What I want to do is come tomorrow to the floor and spend a little \ntime responding to what was offered today by the Senator from Iowa on \ndeferral, transfer pricing, and a whole range of things on those tax \nissues. If I can arrange with my colleague to do that tomorrow, I also \nhave a picture of several sewers, actually.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How is this one?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't have that picture, but I have several pictures of \nseveral sewers owned by American corporations, not because they are in \nthe sewer business, not because they like sewers, not because they have \nsome sort of attachment to sewers, but because they do not want to pay \nU.S. taxes, so they buy a sewer system and depreciate it. I also have \npictures of streetcars and rail cars and a picture of a city's 9/11 \nemergency response system sold by the city to a private investor in \norder that the private investor could depreciate it and, therefore, \nreduce their taxes.\n  Now, whether it is the 9/11 emergency response system, sewer systems, \nor city hall--and I have pictures of city halls I will show tomorrow as \nwell, that have been purchased and leased back--all of these are scams, \nand they ought to stop. No, they ought not stop gradually. That is not \nthe way you stop this addiction. You shut it down, right now.\n  I understand there will be people coming to the floor of the Senate \nsaying: You can't do that. You have to be competitive. That is such a \nload of nonsense. You don't have to be competitive in these kinds of \nescapes from the reality of having to pay taxes you rightfully owe on \nyour income.\n  I say to my colleague Senator Conrad that I wish to come tomorrow at \na time we can conveniently arrange and talk about these issues of \ndeferral, transfer pricing, and SILOs and LILOs and so on.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe we need to spend the whole day tomorrow.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That would be fine, because I have a lot to say. If we \ncan't take the first baby step in shutting down this sort of \nperversity, there is nothing more pernicious in the Tax Code, and \nnothing more perverse to common sense than this sort of nonsense. So I \nwish to come talk about it tomorrow. Perhaps we could get a majority in \nthis Chamber to say, yes, you know what, people ought to pay their \ntaxes, corporations ought to pay their taxes, and they ought not own \nforeign sewers in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes. It is very simple.\n  If someone on the other side would call that a tax increase, I would \nsay it is actually increasing the tax paid by those who should have \npaid more, but that is a different kind of circumstance, isn't it? So I \nwant to talk about that tomorrow, and I thank my colleague, Senator \nConrad. He is steeped in experience in these areas, and he is right. I \nthink it is a wonderful opportunity, finally, because we don't have \nquite enough opportunity in some of the committees, to finally on the \nfloor of the Senate begin exposing this.\n  This exposure is very important so the American people understand who \nis paying the taxes and who isn't. One of our primary responsibilities \nis to say to those who aren't, you apparently want all the benefits of \nbeing an American except the responsibility of paying your fair share \nof taxes to this country. Senator Conrad says it should stop, and so do \nI, and I look forward to being back on the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I am uncertain if he is the junior or \nsenior Senator from North Dakota, but will he yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Conrad has the time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from North Dakota allow me to ask a \nquestion of the Senator from North Dakota who just made a passionate \nstatement?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to ask the Senator from North \nDakota whether he supports an extension of the tax rates relative to \ncapital gains, No. 1; relative to dividends, No. 2; relative to highest \nrate, No. 3; and relative to the rates regarding the death tax, or some \nmodification of the death tax in years 2011 and 2012, No. 4.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I say I don't do four-part questions. I \nwill be glad to answer the first, however.\n  I happen to believe a tax code ought not penalize work and reward \ninvestment. I happen to believe those in this Chamber who have \nperverted the Tax Code that says if you work, you get penalized, \nbecause you pay taxes, but, by the way, if you don't work and get to \nclip coupons, if your income comes exclusively in dividends and capital \ngains, guess what, you are in luck because this Chamber thinks you \ndon't have to pay taxes.\n  So, do I believe at some point we ought to recognize working people \nin this country and recognize they ought to be paying taxes in a fair \nway? Yes, I believe that strongly.\n  I observe, however, that the Senator from New Hampshire changed the \nsubject. The subject, of course, was sewer systems, foreign streetcars, \nforeign city halls, and the sale of 9/11 emergency systems of an \nAmerican city for the purpose of avoiding taxes by corporations that \nwant to purchase them. That is a subject about which I wish to visit.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, not only did I not change the subject, I \nwent to the essence of the issue. I have heard the Senator from North \nDakota many times on this floor rail against the tax cuts that were put \nin place that generated this economic recovery. He has railed against \ncapital gains, dividends, and the highest rates. This budget, as it is \npresently structured, can only accomplish its goal of raising the \nlargest tax increase in history if it significantly raises rates.\n  The representation was made here that the Senator from Iowa was \nsomehow supportive of people who are inappropriately gaming the system. \nIt is the opposite. His statement was all about how you address that, \nand how he has addressed that, and how he intends to continue \naddressing that. But he also was concise in his conclusion in saying \nthat the most you can get from addressing that in a realistic sense is \nsomewhere around $30 billion or $40 billion.\n  The head of the IRS, whom we also want to have all the resources he \nneeds--in fact, in the budget last year we gave him all the resources \nhe felt he needed in order to expand recovery from people who owed \ntaxes and were not paying them--has said the most he is going to be \nable to get in a 5-year period is probably $30 billion.\n  So there is a huge issue of credibility here when there is a tax \nincrease in revenues of $450 billion to $500 billion, half a trillion \ndollars over the President's number, and the only items that can be \npointed to that you are going to cover that with are less than $70 \nbillion, probably, or $80 billion. So you have $400 billion or $350 \nbillion of new revenues that have to be generated somewhere. \nIronically, that happens to be almost exactly the amount of increasing \nthe rates to the levels that the Senator from North Dakota seems to \nwant on income taxes, dividends, capital gains.\n\n  It does not pass the commonsense test of, when a party ran for \nreelection, got reelected--obviously, international affairs had a lot \nto do with it, but a lot of that campaign was based on the desire to \nrepeal the tax cuts the President put in place, especially on income--\nand then comes to the floor of the Senate with a budget that raises \ntaxes by an amount which is essentially equal to the raising of the \nincome tax rates, it does not make sense to deny that the income tax \nrates are going to be the source for most of those revenues. Sure, we \nwill get some money from the tax gap. Sure, we will get some money from \na more aggressive approach on loopholes--which everyone wants to do but \nnowhere near the dollars needed in order to cover the obligations of \nthis budget which assume the biggest tax increase in history, which \nclearly is going to come from raising rates.\n  I just find it unfortunate that people are not willing to say what is \ngoing on here. Why is the Senator from North Dakota--the junior Senator \nor senior Senator, I am not sure--Senator Dorgan, why isn't he willing \nto simply say: I am for raising these rates, and admit to it?\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am willing to yield for a question.\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is this on the time of Senator Gregg?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator answer this question on your time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I certainly would, as long as the question is brief and \nconcise.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Very brief. Senator Kennedy is waiting. I would point \nout, given all this revenue consternation, I know where there is $104 \nbillion. That would have been the tax paid on that amount that was \nrepatriated that my colleague and some of the others offered a 5.25 \npercent income tax rate to recently. They said to the biggest \nenterprises in the country: If you have done business overseas, you \nbring that money back, and we will give you a 5.25 income tax rate. No \nother American gets to pay that low a tax rate. But the result was \nabout a $104 billion giveaway.\n  So I know where there is some revenue perhaps. I wish we had been \nquite as concerned about revenue back then when it was given to the \nlargest companies in the country.\n  Mr. GREGG. I reclaim my time because that obviously was not a \nquestion. It was a rhetorical question at best, probably not even that.\n  Senator Kennedy has been very patient. I hope the Senator from \nMassachusetts would note that I was the only one who, on a number of \ntimes, prefaced my remarks saying I wished to hear from the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and did not just take his time willy-nilly. I think \nwe should turn to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does the Senator from Massachusetts need?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fifteen minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I only have 4 minutes left on our time.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time do we have left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 14\\1/2\\ \nminutes and the Senator from North Dakota has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent to extend for 15 minutes on each \nside, so 30 minutes total, and 15 minutes given to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who has been extraordinarily patient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the two leaders for their \nkindness and their consideration, permitting me to speak on the budget. \nI welcome the opportunity to participate in the opening discussion of \nthis debate, particularly as it centers around national priorities. I \ndo think, quite frankly, we rarely see the contrast so clearly as in \nthe recent debate and discussion on the Senate floor between those who \nwant additional tax reductions for wealthy and powerful groups and \nthose who are really interested in the agenda and the priorities of \nworking families and middle- income families who are primarily \nconcerned about the future of their children, health care for their \nchildren, and education for their children.\n  Certainly they are concerned about veterans; all of us are. I commend \nthose who have spoken very eloquently this afternoon about how this \nbudget reflects our priority to address the needs of our veterans.\n  I would like to take a few moments--and will the Chair let me know \nwhen I have 5 minutes left, please, Madam President--to talk about the \npriorities that have been included in this budget that Senator Conrad \nhas mentioned, and why it really ought to gain the support of the \nmajority of the American people. This really represents the people's \nagenda and the people's priorities.\n  There is a very important commitment in this budget to the children \nof this Nation, in terms of their education and in terms of their \nhealth. I will speak this evening on those two issues. There are other \nmatters of the budget which are important, and perhaps I will speak \nabout those at another time.\n  I take pride that an ancestor of our State, John Adams, was the one \nwho identified the importance of education for this Nation. He did so \nin 1780, which was the year the Massachusetts Constitution was passed. \nIt was passed 7 years prior to the Federal Constitution. In that \ndocument is the most elaborate commitment of any constitution in this \ncountry. But just about every other State has, basically, copied \nlanguage similar to the language in the Massachusetts Constitution--\nthat commits the people in that State and in this country to quality \neducation for young people.\n  We have seen the progress that has been made since that time. In \n1837, Horace Mann campaigned relentlessly for the support and \nimprovement of public schools. He reminded us that a free and public \neducation was vital to our future. At the turn of the last century, we \nexpanded from the early grades and founded public high schools to \nenable the nation to move forward. We have seen the extraordinary \nprogress that was made with the creation of the land grant colleges. In \nthe height of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln signed the legislation \ninto law and made a commitment on behalf of this Nation to the \neducation of the children of our country. Time and again, when America \nwas faced with challenges, we responded by strengthening education.\n\n  We did it once again when the Russians sparked the Space Age with the \nSputnik launch. We came together as a nation and doubled the education \nbudget.\n  There are those on the other side who say: You can throw money at an \nissue, and it doesn't solve all the problems--and that is true. But a \nclear indication of national priorities is whether we are going to \ninvest in education. There are many reasons to do it. Obviously ``for \nthe benefit of the child'' is the best reason. Obviously ``so we will \nhave a well-educated, democratic society'' is important. Obviously, \n``so we can have well-educated individuals to compete in a global \neconomy.'' And, obviously, ``because we need well-trained, intelligent \nindividuals to serve in the Armed Forces of our country.'' For all \nthose reasons and more we need strong investment in education.\n  We are facing a global challenge around the world. It is fair to ask: \nWhat has this budget done with regard to education?\n  All you have to do is to look at the contrast between this budget and \nwhat has happened over the period of recent years under Republican \ncontrol. This column on the left of this chart is the 5-year cumulative \nincrease in funding for K-12 programs, specifically for No Child Left \nBehind and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, from 2003 \nto 2007--the five-year increase is $4.7 billion.\n  Over here, we see this year's Democratic budget--a $3.8 billion \nincrease in one year alone. This is a commitment to education, and it \nis extremely important. It is essential.\n  We hear a great deal about the commitment we made to our children in \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. But the Administration and Republican \nLeadership in Congress have failed to keep their promises about funding \nthe law, and today we are leaving 3.7 million children behind.\n  I have said many times that when we passed Social Security, we \nenrolled everyone who was eligible in the Social Security system. In \nMedicare, we said we wanted to cover all the elderly, and today, \neveryone who is eligible is included in Medicare. So when we said No \nChild Left Behind, I thought we meant that no child was going to be \nleft out and left behind. But the reality is that 3.7 million children \nare being left behind today. The challenges that schools are facing are \nreal, and the idea that we are leaving these children behind is \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  There is a simple comparison. If this had been our approach when \nPresident Kennedy said we were going to go to the Moon, we would have \nspent the money to get our rockets together and we would have sent \npeople to the Moon. They would have landed on the Moon and gotten \nhalfway back, and then we would have pulled the funding. Today, 3.7 \nmillion children are not receiving the resources we promised.\n  If you look at other indicators like what's happened with rising \ncollege costs and stagnant student aid, you see the same picture. If \nyou look at the gap between the increased cost of attendance at a four-\nyear public college and the maximum Pell grant, you see that the gap \nhas gone up and up and up as the Pell Grant has remained effectively \nflat. Every middle-income family understands the explosion of the costs \nof college and the 5.3 million children who depend on the Pell grant \nhave been faced with this crisis. But earlier this year, under the \njoint funding resolution, Democrats increased the Pell\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\ngrant for the first time since 2003. With this budget, we're going to \nbuild on that, and for the first time in the last 5 years, we are going \nto extend a helping hand to children who are talented, who have been \naccepted into schools and colleges of this country. Each year, 400,000 \ncollege ready students do not go on to a four-year college. Families \nand students need this kind of help and assistance to make college a \nreality.\n  This budget is about children. It is about education. It is about \nnational security. It is about our economy, and it is about our ability \nto compete in a global economy.\n  This budget will allow us to increase the maximum Pell grant to at \nleast $4,600. It will also help us do even more for struggling students \nand families. We are going to continue our work to cut the student loan \ninterest rates. We are going to cap student loan payments at 15 percent \nof discretionary income. And we are going to have a loan forgiveness \nprogram for individuals in public sector jobs. We want the middle class \nand working families to know: If you are concerned about the costs of \nyour children's education, this budget is going to provide help and \nassistance to you. Make no mistake about it.\n  On another issue, health care, we have also made enormous progress \nthrough the years. Probably the most dramatic, I believe, was the \nprogress made under President Lincoln at the time that he made that \nmagnificent speech, saying we cannot lose sight of our responsibilities \nto the widows and the orphans of the Civil War.\n  And we began the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So we started the process toward taking care of those \nwho have served in our country. Then we saw the need that we had after \nthe Second World War. We said we are not going to have a whole \ngeneration that brought us out of the Depression and fought in the war \nlive, effectively, without any kind of health care coverage. We had \npassed Social Security in the 1930s. Then we passed the Medicare \nprogram in the 1960s.\n  In 1965, we started the community health care centers program. Today \nthere are more than 16 million Americans who get their health care \nthrough that extraordinary program. In 1997, this body, in a bipartisan \nway, passed the CHIP program. We have seen the remarkable growth, in \nterms of covering children. This is about children of working families.\n  If you go up to 300 percent of poverty, you are talking with a family \nof three, about $49,800 a year. That is not an enormous income. For \nfamilies with even one or two children, the cost of health insurance is \nvirtually out of sight. In Massachusetts the children of these families \nwould be covered by the CHIP program.\n  This program has been a remarkable success--some 6 million children \nhave been included, but we know there are 9 million who are not.\n  Under the President's budget, these red States on the map are the \nStates that would effectively have to drop children in 2007. Down here \nin Georgia, even my State of Massachusetts and the State of Maine.\n  If we continue like that in 2008, look at the growth of the number of \nStates that would be dropping hundreds of thousands of children. If you \ncontinue with the Republican budget, you virtually emaciate that \nprogram in terms of covering children.\n  But under this budget that is different. We are committed to making \nsure that the children of this country who don't have health coverage \nwill be able to benefit. In this budget, $50 billion over 5 years is \ncommitted to making sure that all of the children of working families \nare going to be able to get the health care coverage they need. This \nmeans they are going to listen and learn when they go to school because \nthey will have had the health care that they need.\n  This means they are going to grow up strong and healthy. This is our \ncommitment to the children of this Nation. It is our commitment to the \nchildren of working families. We say this is a priority in this budget. \nWe say children are a priority, and we are committed to making sure \nthat the young children of this Nation are going to grow up strong and \nhealthy, and we commit to them that they are going to have the \neducational opportunity they need to be successful.\n  That is the priority.\n  Anybody who watched this debate this afternoon would say one side has \nbeen talking about tax loopholes, talking about how this budget is \ngoing to increase their taxes. We are talking about a responsible \nbudget that is going to have children as its priority. I hope when the \ntime comes that it will have the kind of broad support that it \ndeserves.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, before I yield to the Senator from \nColorado, I wanted to talk about the education funding because it is \nimportant for us to understand that this President increased the \nfunding for education more than any other in history as a percentage \nand in total numbers: a dramatic increase in funding for education; \nIDEA is up dramatically; No Child Left Behind funding, which was \noriginally title I funds prior to our passing No Child Left Behind, up \ndramatically in the budget he sent up.\n  He increased those accounts one more time by $1 billion for No Child \nLeft Behind. Granted, we cannot and do not intend, and do not think it \nis good, to outbid Senator Kennedy on issues of spending. We are not \neven going to try. But the fact is, we have made a very substantial \ncommitment to education funding under this Presidency and a substantial \ncommitment to education generally.\n  I want to talk about Pell grants because that is another area where \nwe have done dramatic work. Senator Kennedy says Pell grants have held \nsteady. Well, actually they have gone up. In fact, because the \nPresident put in place a program last year, which we paid for, we now \nhave Pell grants, if you qualify for the Smart Program, which deals \nwith math and science education, and you pursue those courses that we \nthink are important to our culture and we do not have enough people \npursuing, you can get Pell grants literally jumping up to $8,000 a \nyear, a significant expansion of the Pell Grant Program.\n  We have heard in the press that we cut funds--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on this point?\n  Mr. GREGG. I probably do not have the time. Is it a quick question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Two quick questions, but I will settle for one. Is it \nnot a fact that those who are eligible under that program are less than \n10 percent of all of the Pell recipients?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. The point being, if people pursue courses which we think \nare important in this country, we basically double the amount of the \nPell grant they will get, which is a fairly significant commitment to \nthose individuals.\n  We have increased the Pell Grant Programs generally also. But it \nstarted to make sense to focus dramatic increases in Pell grants on \npeople and on disciplines that we think are important to our culture.\n  The second point is that we have heard in the press and we have heard \nfrom the other side this idea that we cut education funding by $12 \nbillion in the reconciliation bill 2 years ago. That is a total \nmisstatement. That is an outright--well, it is so incredible, it rises \nto the ``L'' word. It truly is dishonest to make that statement.\n  What we did was we reduced lenders' benefits under the student loan \nprogram by almost $20 billion, and then we took a big chunk of that \nmoney and put it back into student aid. So we actually increased \nstudent aid by approximately $9 billion in that reconciliation \nproposal. It was a significant shift of funds from lenders to kids who \nare going to school.\n  When I read in newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal today, a \nreporter represented, which is basically the dialogue, the line of the \nDemocratic National Committee that we cut student lending by $12 \nbillion, it makes me angry. I oversaw that. I was not chairman of the \ncommittee. Senator Enzi was totally committed to student loans and \noversaw this exercise.\n  What we did was the opposite. So the dishonesty of the Democratic \nNational Committee in putting out that type of information, and then \nthe incompetence of the Wall Street Journal reporter for picking it up \nand saying that we cut student loans by $12 billion is\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\nabsurd on its face. They wrote whatever the Democratic National \nCommittee handed them as a cheat sheet.\n  We cut lenders' subsidies by $20 billion, put $9 billion into student \nloans.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I have been listening to this debate \nfrom my office. I tell you, I have to agree with the chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I joined him in voting against this budget. But \ngenerally this is what this budget does: we are back to the old spend-\nand-tax ways and increases in the debt.\n  This budget has an increase, over a $900 billion tax increase. We \nhave a nondefense increase in spending of $146 billion. The President \nhas already come in with his budget with a 50-percent increase in \nspending. Now on top of this, this budget provides $146 billion.\n  Then we look at the debt figures. We see that the debt is increasing \nby $2.2 trillion. This is unimaginable. If the tax increase goes into \nplace--and that happens because there is no provision in here to make \nthe tax cuts that were passed in the Republican Congress in 2001 and \n2003 to make them permanent--by default these taxes are going to \nincrease over $900 billion. That is going to be the largest tax \nincrease in the history of this country.\n  I want to look at the $146 billion. I think we need to pull up a \nspendometer and talk a little bit about how much spending there is, if \nyou are already starting at $146 billion--because you are $146 billion \nabove what the President's budget proposal is--based on a $50 billion \nincrease.\n  So in addition to that, we are seeing a tremendous growth in the \ndeficit, increasing by $440 billion. We see mandatory spending growing \nunchecked by $411 billion, fiscal years 2008-2012. We spend more than \n$1 trillion of the Social Security surplus. Ultimately, what we end up \nwith is a growth in the debt of over $2.2 trillion.\n  Now, we have heard those who are supporting this budget and justify \nit because they are going to tax the rich. I think we ought to take a \nlook at who pays taxes in this country. You know the top 1 percent of \nthe wealthy pay 37 percent of the taxes. The top 5 percent pay 57 \npercent of the taxes. So if you are going to raise taxes, the only \nplace you can go is there.\n  If we look to the top 10 percent, there is another 10 on top of that. \nYou have got 31 percent plus 37. We have 68 percent of the taxes that \nare paid by the top 11 percent of the taxpayers of this country. So we \nhave a very progressive tax system.\n  The tax cuts that we put in place in 2003 really stimulated this \neconomy. As a result of those tax cuts, there is more money available \nfor local governments to help pay for their programs. There is more \nmoney available for the Federal Government. That is why it was so easy \nfor the majority party to put together this budget--because of the \nlarge amount of revenues coming into the Federal Government.\n  I attribute that to the fact that we cut taxes for the working men \nand women of this country, primarily those who own their small \nbusiness, by the way, who put in more than 40 hours a week. Many times \nthey work 7 days a week to keep those small businesses operating, \nsupporting their communities. That is where we really generate the \nrevenue.\n  We are going to start talking about how we are going to tax them now \nso that they do not keep as much in their own pocket. The reality of \nthat is going to be that we are going to depress our economic growth. \nWe are talking about increasing taxes on corporations that do business \nall over the world. Well, they are in a competitive environment. They \nhave to compete with other countries. We cannot constrict our economy \nto strictly American borders. We have to extend beyond that. If we \nreally want to get our economy going, we are going to have to talk \nabout trade. We are going to have to talk about doing business all over \nthe world.\n  We cannot expect it to grow and constrict it to the borders of this \ncountry. That is what we are doing, in the tax policy that we have \nheard from the other side of the aisle.\n  The question always comes back to all the spending that we have in \nthis bill, some $146 billion above the $50 billion increase that the \nPresident already put in place. Where are we going to get the money to \ndo that? The only way that happens is when we do not act on putting \nthose tax cuts in place that have served us so well to grow this \neconomy. They talk about closing the tax gap.\n  We had testimony in committee, and they thought that the reasonable \namount was $35 billion in collections as a reasonable expectation over \n5 years. Yet on the other side, they insist it is going to be much \nmore, regardless of what the IRS--the ones who would know--said in our \nBudget Committee hearings.\n  I think this is a budget that is going to create problems for us down \nthe line. It is going to begin to create problems as soon as it is \npassed. It is going to create spending problems. It is going to create \ntax increases by default. We are going to see the debt continue to \nincrease by $2.2 trillion.\n  Let's look and see how individuals are going to be impacted by this \ntax increase that will happen in this budget by default because we do \nnot do anything to keep them from expiring in the outyears of this \nbudget.\n  A family of four, earning $40,000 a year--that is if the husband and \nwife are both working and making $20,000 each--will face a tax increase \nof $2,052. And we have 113 million taxpayers who will see their taxes \ngo up an average of $2,216.\n  Now, when we look at this a little further, we see that over 5 \nmillion individuals and families who have seen their income tax \nliabilities completely eliminated will now have to pay taxes. That is \nthe new tax bracket that we have created to provide tax relief for many \nof those working families. So that is going to expire. When that \nexpires, that is going to impact 5 million individuals and families who \nwill again have to pay taxes that they were allowed to get by without \npaying so they could pay for their educational costs for their kids, so \nthey could pay for health care, and so they could pay for the needs of \nthe family--food and shelter.\n  We are not talking about individuals who are making a lot of money in \nthis case. Forty-five million families with children will face an \naverage increased tax of $2,864; that is the marriage penalty. Fifteen \nmillion elderly individuals will pay an average tax increase of $2,934. \nThese are the people who are on retirement. Twenty-seven million small \nbusiness owners will pay an average tax increase higher than any of the \ngroups that I mentioned of $4,712. That is where our economic growth is \ngenerated.\n  If you want to see your economy grow like we did, you target the \nsmall business sector. Well, that is true in Colorado; that is true \nnationally. I think one of the things that stimulated growth of the \nsmall business economy more than anything else was the expense \nprovisions that we put in place so that small business owners could \nwrite off over $100,000 a year, expense them out in one year. They took \nthat money and they invested it. They invested it in equipment they \nneeded. If they were a contractor, they went and bought a Bobcat and a \npickup and got to work. If they were a farmer, they bought a new \nharvester and got to work. If they were a physician, they got an x ray \nand had more work to do. If they were a veterinarian, maybe they bought \nsome lab equipment and had more work to do. So by targeting the small \nbusiness sector, we generated all these jobs. It churned the economy.\n\n  I had an opportunity to visit with Dr. Greenspan, former chairman of \nthe Fed. I said: One of the things that has not been talked about much \nis how the small businesses generated this economy. I think the \nexpensing provisions we put in there had a lot to do with that. He \nsaid: I agree with you. I don't think that people really appreciate \nwhat has happened because of the tax cuts that were directed toward \nsmall business.\n  There are many important items that are not to be found in this \nparticular legislation. There is no long-term entitlement reform. There \nis no permanent AMT relief, no permanent tax relief at all with the tax \ncuts that were put in place to stimulate the economy. There is no \nfunding for ongoing war costs between 2009, no proposals on reducing \nmandatory spending or the debt.\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\n  People of Colorado have asked me: How is this likely to affect me? \nLet me talk a little bit about how this could affect taxpayers of the \nState of Colorado. In Colorado, the impact of repealing the Republican \ntax relief would be felt widely. For example, more than 1.6 million \ntaxpayers Statewide who are benefiting from a new lower 10-percent \nbracket would now see their tax rates go up; 590,000 married couples \nwould face higher tax rates because of an increase in the marriage \npenalty; 432,000 families with children would pay more taxes because \nthe child tax credit would expire; 310,000 investors, including \nseniors, would pay more because of an increase in the tax rate on \ncapital gains and dividends. Remember, seniors who have retired have a \nlot at stake when we talk about capital gains taxes and dividends \nbecause they have put their money many times in the stock market. They \nhave put it in investments. As retired individuals, they are finding \nthat they are beginning to pull that out. The consequences are that \nwithout that tax break, they would not have been able to save as much \nmoney toward their retirement.\n  To wrap this up, I wish to remind people I will be keeping a spending \nbarometer here. We are at $146 billion already over what the President \nproposed. We are not off to a very good start on this budget. We are \ngoing to see it increase considerably before this week is over.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator such time as I may still have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 12 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, budgets are defining things. They tell \nthe country what direction we would like to go, where we intend to take \nthe country, what kind of policies on taxing and spending we have. \nThere are not many ways to hide it. There are ways to attempt to hide \nit, but when one looks at budgets carefully and studies them, they can \nbegin to see what the priorities are of the majority party, the party \nthat has an obligation to present a budget, as the Republicans did for \na number of years and now the Democrats do. It reveals something about \ntheir priorities, their direction, where they want to go.\n  I believe this Nation is a nation conceived in liberty. We believe in \nentrepreneurship. We believe in freedom. We believe in a smaller \ngovernment and a more vibrant private sector. That is not like many of \nour European allies. They are high-tax, high-regulation, high-welfare \nstates. We have many of those qualities and characteristics but not \nnearly so much as they. We made a conscious decision. That is not our \nheritage. That is not the way we go. I am proud to say our Nation has \nhad a far greater growth rate consistently over the years than the \nEuropeans. Our unemployment rate is well below the Europeans. They \ncontinue to struggle. They have government unions striking all the \ntime. They are trying to make the government fix everything for them.\n  When the government does everything, then everything that is \nimportant is decided by a bunch of politicians. We are not capable of \nrunning this economy. We are not capable of running an automobile \nbusiness, running a farm or any other kind of business. That is not \nwhat we are capable of doing. We let the private sector do those things \nand let them compete and let them see who can produce the best widget \nat the lowest price with the least defects. That is our heritage. I \nresist the idea that we can continue to increase regulations, increase \ntaxes, increase spending and make the Government bigger and bigger and \nbigger and the individual smaller and smaller and smaller. Because when \nwe take from one to give to the Government for the benefit of another, \nwe diminish the freedom of the first. We strengthen the Government, and \nwe diminish the moral autonomy of the person who received the benefit. \nThis is a matter of deep importance philosophically for us. We ought to \nthink it through at the beginning.\n\n  Where are we today? When President Bush took office--there is no need \nto rehash everything--the Nasdaq stock bubble had already burst. When \nhe took office, the Nasdaq had lost half its value. When he took \noffice, the last month of the calendar year, this country had negative \ngrowth in GDP. The first quarter President Bush inherited a negative \ngrowth GDP. He inherited from his predecessor an economy in serious \ntrouble. There is no doubt about that. On top of that, we had 9/11, 9 \nmonths later. So the entire Nation was in a state of shock. He had to \nmake some major decisions. Was he going to start a tax-and-spend jobs \nprogram to try to jump start the economy?\n  He made a commitment consistent with our American heritage to reduce \ntaxes and to allow the private sector to recapture itself, restabilize \nitself and grow. It has worked to an extraordinary degree. It is \nsomething of which we should be proud. We have cut taxes and now \nrevenue is beginning to surge.\n  We had the 2003 tax cuts, the 2001 tax cuts. In 2004, when the \neconomy began to hit its stride, we had an increase in revenue to the \nTreasury of 5.5 percent. That is a pretty good number. But the next \nyear, 2005, it hit a 14.6-percent increase in revenue. Then the next \nyear it was almost 12 percent, 11.6. This year they are projecting, \nbased on the first few months of the year, a 9.3-percent increase in \nrevenue. What I am talking about is not statistics. It is not some \nsurvey. I am talking about actual dollars going into the Federal till.\n  Is anybody paying taxes if they are not making money? Are they \nvoluntarily sending more money to Washington than they ought to send? \nNo, they are not doing that. The economy is doing well. People are \nmaking money. They are working more. They are getting higher wages. \nThey are doing more overtime. Corporations are making profits instead \nof having losses. They are paying taxes. When someone sells stock or an \nitem, it has appreciated in value, and he pays capital gains on it. \nThose are the things that are working because we have the economy \nmoving.\n  I believe President Bush made a historic, tough decision. We passed \nthat first tax cut in this body by a tie vote. We had to bring in the \nVice President to break the tie. That side over there that now has the \nmajority opposed it with every strength in their being. The same was \ntrue with the next one in 2003.\n  I will offer a critical amendment on taxes as this debate goes along. \nI wish to continue the general trend of my remarks and the dangers that \nI fear are exhibited here. When we pass a budget, we pretend to pass a \n5-year budget. We pass one every year. So what does that mean? If you \npass a budget every year and every year you pass a new 5-year budget, \nit means the only budget year that counts is the one you pass that \nyear. Our colleagues think that spending as a percentage of the gross \ndomestic product might go down in future years. I hope it would. It \nshould, based on the strength of our economy. What about the budget \nthat counts? What about the budget that counts, the one that we are \nenacting as a part of this process for 2008?\n  I will show my colleagues what this budget does in terms of spending. \nIn terms of spending, it is going up, actual spending over the last \ndecade. This budget for 2008 before us today, and which we are being \nasked to ratify, has the highest percentage of GDP being captured by \nthe Federal Government, by the Federal tax gendarmes of anything we \nhave had in a decade. This budget, the one we are passing, the one that \ncounts, ups it. There is no doubt about it. We can talk about future \nyears, and we hope they will be better.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will close with one more point. A number of years \nago, I understood this when the Republicans did what I considered a \nbudget gimmick of several billion dollars. I began to count up how that \nadded up. This year this budget has about $18 billion in spending over \nthe President's budget, 2 billion of which is a gimmick. I believe it \nis going to amount to advance funding and will be spent. I believe, \nwithout dispute, it is $18 billion over the President's budget. \nSomebody\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\nmight say: This is a large economy. What is $18 billion? That is what I \nused to hear. I made up a chart that I call ``Every Billion Counts.'' A \nbillion here, a billion there, pretty soon it is real money. Look at \nthis chart.\n  They say: Well, we only jumped the President by $18 billion. This is \nin the discretionary accounts. This is the discretionary budget. They \njump it just $18 billion in 2008. But what happens to that $18 billion? \nIt goes into the baseline of our Government spending.\n  It goes into the baseline of our Government spending. So next year, \nif you try to remove that $18 billion, you know what they will say. \nThey will descend on us in the halls, they will descend on us in this \nbody and say: You are slashing the budget. You are cutting the budget. \nYou can never cut the budget. So it goes into the baseline.\n  Let's say we just continue at that rate. Let's say next year, they \njust do another $18 billion. It is not $18 billion going to the debt to \nour children and grandchildren for them to carry throughout their \nlifetime; it is $36 billion because you have already got an $18 billion \nincrease from the previous year and then have $18 billion on top of \nthat. The next year, it is $36 billion plus $18 billion, which is $54 \nbillion. The next year, it is $54 billion plus $18 billion, which is \n$72 billion. If you carry it out 10 years, it is $180 billion extra \nthat year. Then, if you add all that up, what do you come up with? An \nincrease in spending, on that pattern alone, of $986 billion. That, I \nwould say to my colleagues, is the kind of indifference to a billion \nhere and a billion there that gets us surging in our spending.\n  Finally, in our Budget Committee hearing, I asked the committee staff \nwhat the Consumer Price Index is, what the inflation rate is. They told \nus it is a little over 2 percent. Well, what do we know? We know this \nbudget is going to increase spending in the non-defense discretionary \naccount over 6 percent--three times the cost of living.\n  They say: Well, a big part of this surge in spending is the war. But \nwe have had a war for the last 4 years, and spending has not gone up a \nwhole lot this year as compared to the last couple years in terms of \nthe war. But what we do know is the non-defense discretionary spending \nin a time of war ought to be at least contained somewhat. Shouldn't we \nat least try to keep it to the cost of living? Yet we are going to come \nin with a budget about three times that amount, maybe more than three \ntimes the cost of living in terms of a percentage increase in non-\ndefense spending.\n  So those are some concerns I have. I believe we are on the road to \ntaxing and spending. I think this budget demonstrates where our \ncolleagues are heading in the Senate. I am going to resist it because \nwe are moving to a point where we will not be able to--Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent to speak 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will talk more later, but perhaps the \nmost important thing about this budget--with the points of order that \nare set in it and the fact that it is increasing spending rather than \nreducing spending--it is going to block the extension of extremely \npopular tax reductions that have been in place for a number of years. \nThen the taxes will go up on families. It will go up for children. For \nchildren, the tax credit will go down from $1,000 to $500. The capital \ngains rate--which actually raises revenues when it is cut--will go up. \nOther taxes will go back up, such as for dividend income.\n  That is not the right direction for America. This is not our \nheritage. We need to contain the growth of spending and not go back to \nhigher taxes.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 5 \nminutes to speak as in morning business and that the time to be charged \non our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        FIRING OF U.S. ATTORNEYS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to respond to the President's \nremarks he made about a half hour ago about the problems we are facing \nwith the firing of eight U.S. attorneys.\n  The President had a press conference, basically, where he said he \nwanted to cooperate and he wanted the information to come out. That is \ngood news because that is what we all want. This is such a serious \nissue. The integrity of the U.S. attorneys, the integrity of the \nJustice Department has been hurt, and we must restore it.\n  It is good to see the President understands we have to do something, \nwe must restore integrity to what is the foundation of this country, \nthe rule of law, without fear or favor. So when the President began to \nspeak, I felt quite good. But when we learned of what he has proposed, \nit can only be called very disappointing because while he has made an \noffer that appears to be cooperative, when you look at it closely--you \ndo not even have to look at it that closely--the cooperation is \nminimal.\n  Let me show you why. The President has said we could interview--his \nwords, we could interview--some of his high-level staff. However, the \ninterview will be held in private, not in public. There will be no oath \nor sworn testimony. There will not even be a transcript.\n  The interview will be as if it occurred in a darkened room, and then \nthere is no record of what happened. If at these interviews the \nstatement of, say, Karl Rove or Harriet Miers contradicts statements \ngiven before, there is nothing that can be done about it. We cannot get \nto the bottom, we cannot get to the truth. What is the objection to \nhaving a transcript if there is nothing to hide, nothing wrong with the \ntranscript? What is the objection to an oath? If there is nothing to \nhide and everyone is telling the truth, there should be no objection to \nan oath. What is the objection to having this discussion in public? \nBecause if we want to restore the integrity of the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice and the Justice Department, that cannot be done by someone \nwhispering to someone else in a back and darkened room. It must be done \nin public.\n  Any lawyer will tell you that the offer made by the President is not \ngoing to get the truth. No transcript, no oath, no public testimony--\nwhat are we hiding? The bottom line is, if the President wants the \ntruth to come out, then he would have testimony given in a far more \nfull and open way. It seems as if the President wants to appear to be \ncooperative but not really cooperate. So we will have to go back and \ncome up with a better plan because this plan does not work.\n  The President has said he will give us memos, but the only memos we \nwill get are memos we have already received, with only a few exceptions \nbecause the President has said any memos within the White House are off \nlimits. If Aide A sends an e-mail to Counsel B, and it says, ``Let's \nfire U.S. Attorney C because they are doing an investigation we don't \nlike, but find another justification, another reason,'' and then the \ncounsel writes to the Justice Department, ``We are firing that U.S. \nattorney because they are not working hard enough on,'' say, \n``immigration cases,'' we will have no way to get at the first memo, \nand the truth will not come out.\n\n  So, Mr. President, give us all the memos, not just some. Give us all \nthe memos related to this issue, not just the ones that won't help us \nwith the case.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 3 minutes, charged \nagainst our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If we really want to get to the bottom of this issue, \nthere is a much better way to do it--one without politics, one without \npartisanship, but one that gets at the truth--in public, under oath, \nwith a transcript, and with all the memos being made public.\n  I think the President has an obligation to tell the American people \nwhy he is against a transcript, why he is against an oath, why he is \nagainst testimony in public. If our mutual goal is to get at the truth, \nthere is no good justification to not allow those things.\n  There is precedent. It is not unusual for Presidential advisers to \ntestify\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\nunder oath in public before congressional committees or subcommittees. \nTake President Bush's immediate predecessor, President Clinton. \nAdvisers who held the very same positions that are now held by Karl \nRove and Harriet Miers in their time, and their deputies, testified. \nHarold Ickes testified. Bruce Lindsey testified. John Podesta \ntestified. Beth Nolan testified. Those are people who had the exact \nsame positions as Karl Rove, Harriet Miers, and their aides. They \ntestified under oath, in public, with a transcript. If it was good \nenough for President Clinton and previous Presidents and their aides, \nwhy isn't it good enough for this President? Why do we have to have a \nnarrow, constricted standard that seems almost designed not to bring \nout the truth?\n  So the Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of Senator Leahy, \nwill follow this investigation where it leads. We have an obligation \nfar above party, far above partisanship to our country and its system \nof justice to get to the bottom of this situation. We will not be \ndeterred. We will continue to focus. And the truth will come out. We \nowe it to the U.S. attorneys who were dismissed for reasons that still \nhave not adequately been explained, with their careers and reputations \ndamaged. We owe it to all the other U.S. attorneys who are now under a \ncloud because of what has been done. We owe it to our system of \njustice.\n  Mr. President, please let us have a full, complete investigation, not \na limited one almost designed so the truth does not come out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n8 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I guess, listening to the comments of my \ndistinguished colleague from New York, we know this is about an effort \nto find the truth and follow the facts wherever they may lead, and I \nguess we should all be satisfied that this has nothing to do with \npolitics, nothing to do with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee that he chairs, because he wants us to believe this is about \ngetting the facts--although the President today offered to produce his \nformer White House Counsel and his adviser, Ms. Miers and Mr. Rove, for \nan interview to provide information to the investigators, to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. But we have just been told now that is \nunsatisfactory, that we will not be able to get to the truth.\n  Well, I am as interested as anyone is, as a member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, as to what the facts are. But let me tell you, \nwhile I have some question as to all the information this investigation \nmight turn up, I am not in doubt about this: President Clinton fired 93 \nU.S. attorneys appointed by his predecessor, a Republican President, \nand that was not about politics. This President has replaced eight U.S. \nattorneys whom he himself appointed, and that, for some reason, is \nsupposed to be all about politics, all about dirty pool. Well, it just \ndoes not stack up. The fact is, this President, just like President \nClinton, could replace U.S. attorneys for no cause.\n  I think the real problem here--and I do agree it has been \nmishandled--is the suggestion that we somehow ought to be demanding in \nthe public domain whether there are performance-related reasons why \nthese particular U.S. attorneys were replaced that caused them to feel \nthe necessity to defend their reputation in the public arena. Frankly, \nI do not think they should have to be put to that sort of debate. These \ndistinguished lawyers ought to be able to move on in their careers with \ntheir reputations intact. But because of my colleague, the chairman of \nthe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who is leading the charge \nin this effort, it, I believe, undermines what should be a legitimate \ninquiry into the facts.\n\n  So I don't think anybody should be under any illusion of what the \ngoal is here. It is not to get the facts or else the Senator from New \nYork would have accepted the offer and said: Sure, we would be glad to \ntalk to the witnesses who have been subpoenaed and who will appear from \nthe Department of Justice. We will be glad to hear what Mr. Rove and \nMs. Miers have to say. We will be glad to look at the 3,000 pages of \ndocuments produced by the Department of Justice yesterday, and we would \nbe glad to look at the other documents that are being proffered by the \nWhite House. Instead, he has already reached a verdict. He has already \nconcluded there is foul play regardless of the facts and regardless of \nwhat this information will yield. I think we shouldn't be under any \nillusion that this is about politics. It is not about a search for the \ntruth.\n  Frankly, I think this Congress and the Senate deserve better than \nthat. We deserve the ability to conduct an inquiry to find out where \nthe facts may lead without this conflict of interest the Senator from \nNew York has. Senator Specter, the ranking member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, has pointed out that this calls into legitimate \nquestion the whole basis for this purported investigation, and while he \ndidn't call on him to recuse himself, he did suggest--and I think he is \nexactly right--that it undermines the legitimacy of what should be an \ninquiry into the facts.\n  I think it is appropriate to point out to our colleagues that this \nsort of campaign by the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee, who is using this incident to raise money on the Web site of \nthe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, of ethics complaints \nfiled against colleagues is inappropriate and unworthy of this \ninstitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss the matter I alluded to earlier that is a very real concern of \nmine, which is that the budget that is before us sets us on a direction \nwe should not go. It is a major policy document. It states to the whole \nNation how our Democratic colleagues, who now have the majority in the \nbody and who passed this budget out of committee by a single vote \nmajority or a party-line vote, as budgets have been over the last \nseveral years--that is not particularly unusual because there is a very \nreal difference in how we approach taxing and spending in America \nbetween the parties that are represented in this body. It has been \ngreat to see Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg work on these issues. \nThey have done a great job of representing their principal points of \nview and they have shared their own ideas and battled it out with \nrespect and collegiality. They are very capable leaders of our Budget \nCommittee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 466\n\n  I wish to talk about this subject, and I call up an amendment to S. \nCon. Res. 21 at this time, and I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself, Mr. \n     DeMint, Mr. Graham, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Crapo, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 466.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To exclude the extension of tax relief provided in 2001 and \n 2003 from points of order provided in the resolution and other budget \n                            points of order)\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EXCLUSION OF TAX RELIEF FROM POINTS OF ORDER.\n\n       Sections 201, 202, 203, and 209 of this resolution and \n     sections 302, 311(a)(2)(B), and 313 of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 shall not apply to a bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     would provide for the extension of the tax relief provided in \n     the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2001, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2003, and sections 101 and 102 of the Tax Increase Prevention \n     and Reconciliation Act of 2005.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, our colleagues tell us this budget does \nnot\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\nraise taxes, and in a sense that is a legitimate position for them to \ntake, but in reality, I suggest it is not. I would note the budget we \nhave before us now assumes--assumes, see--$916 billion in additional \nrevenue over the next 5 years. Where do you get $916 billion? It is \nabout a half a trillion more than the President assumed. What could \ngenerate $916 billion in additional revenue except a tax increase?\n  The revenue levels in this budget mirror those numbers prepared by \nthe Congressional Budget Office as part of its budget baseline. The \nCongressional Budget Office's baseline assumes that President Bush's \ntax cuts will expire as scheduled under current law, resulting in $916 \nbillion in tax increases. Why does CBO assume they will expire and will \nnot be extended as we have for nearly a decade? Well, that is what \naccountants do. There is nothing in the law that requires them to be \nextended, so CBO makes an accounting decision that they assume they \nwill not be extended. The lower rates will not be extended. That means \nthe rates will immediately jump up in a series of important taxes that \naffect the middle class in America.\n  But Members of the Senate don't have to assume that. In fact, we \nought to assume they are extended, because they are working. They are \nproducing more revenue, economic growth, low unemployment. Alabama's \nunemployment, my home State, hit 3.3 percent last fall. Isn't that \nfabulous? We had the lowest drop in unemployment rate on a percentage \nbasis of any State in the Nation in the last several years.\n  Simply put, the Democratic budget is raising taxes by $916 billion by \ndeciding not to extend the existing tax cuts. Tax rates will then go up \nand they will receive more money. The $916 billion in tax increases \nwould become the largest tax increase ever, dwarfing President \nClinton's record $241 billion tax increase in 1993. But our colleagues \ndon't want to admit that today. They didn't want to admit that in \ncommittee when we voted on it last week. They want to have it both \nways, if you want to know the truth. They want to spend and not take \ncredit for raising taxes. So now the Democrats say their budget \nincludes a reserve fund that would somehow allow for extensions of \nexisting tax credits without increases in taxes. But this reserve fund \nis a mere vapor. It is without any substance. It has no funding in it \nthat would allow for tax cuts--it does not allow for the extension of \nthese tax cuts that are in place now and have been in place for years. \nThey would not be acceptable under this reserve fund because they would \nincrease the deficit, of course. That is what CBO will say.\n  It does not contain any money to pay for the extension. In fact, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation scores all tax legislation statically, \nwhich I disagree with, but that is what they do. It nearly always \noverestimates the amount of lost revenue whenever you cut taxes, rather \nthan scoring the cost to the Treasury dynamically, which would \nrecognize that many tax cuts actually increase growth and taxable \nactivity, and thus increase Federal revenue. Good tax reductions will \nseldom fully pay for the full cost they incur in the short run, but \nusually they do help the economy do better than otherwise would be the \ncase, and bring in more revenues. So it is not a full dollar-for-dollar \ncost like CBO scores. Thus, spending would have to be reduced \nsubstantially to allow under some pay-go idea any tax relief, including \neven extending the existing tax rates.\n  Let me ask: When did our colleagues ever execute any spending \nreductions? They have talked about it. They attacked President Bush \nmercilessly for spending, spending, spending, they said. President Bush \nwas a reckless spender. He caused all this great deficit. He inherited \nan economy sinking into recession. He inherited a war and a 9/11 \nattack. He had to work from those facts and work out of those facts. So \nthey have attacked him mercilessly for his tax reduction policies, \nwhich I noted a little earlier increased revenues significantly in \nrecent years.\n  But I will say this: Under the plan of this budget, under the points \nof order, one cannot continue those tax reductions without reducing \nspending the amount that CBO says they cost the Treasury. Now, how are \nwe going to do that? In fact, I will ask, when have our Democratic \ncolleagues ever proposed reducing spending? Look at this budget that is \npresented this year. It contains virtually no spending cuts, $18 \nbillion in discretionary spending increases, and not one dime saved in \nthe entitlement program. No reform whatsoever in the massive \nentitlements which now make up over 60 percent of spending in this \nGovernment.\n  Our colleagues are not facing up to that. Thus, I would say to my \ncolleagues with confidence that the plan is clear, their tactics are \nchosen, and they will say they are not for raising taxes today by this \nbudget. They say this budget does not raise taxes. But I say clearly \nthat is only half true; not much true at all. Because this budget \nassumes--``assumes'' $916 billion in new revenue, new tax revenue. It \nassumes we are going to receive $916 billion in new revenue, and where \ncan we figure that? Well, those are the numbers that come from CBO's \nestimate, that is the Congressional Budget Office which estimates these \nthings--that is what CBO estimates will occur if the existing tax rates \nare not extended, but allowed to jump back up again to a higher rate.\n  Second, they have created four new budget points of order against \nextending the current tax rates. This means that extending low tax \nrates will require not 50 votes but 60 votes, a supermajority to do \nthat. As I noted when we passed these tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, the \nvotes were razor thin. Now that we have a Democratic majority--not only \nthat, now they have changed the vote total necessary to extend these \ntax cuts to 60. How are we going to get 60 votes? Well, under these \ntactics and under the budget points of order fine print contained in \nthe budget, these lower tax rates that are in existence today cannot be \nextended without ``paying for'' them. How do you pay for them? By \ncutting spending by the amount CBO scores the loss in revenue. This \nmeans reducing spending. The thought that our Democratic majority plans \nto reduce spending, even though they talked about it this fall in the \ncampaign like they had an intention to do so, the thought that they \nwould have plans to actually contain waste and fraud and reduce \nspending is really to step through the looking glass, I have to tell \nyou.\n\n  How can I say that? Oh, you are just being critical, Sessions. You \nare just being critical. Let's look at the budget to see what it says. \nThe budget completely ignores President Bush's request to terminate or \nreduce funding for 141 programs that would save $12 billion in 2008 \nalone. It doesn't touch any of those programs.\n  Here is the Chief Executive of the Government of the United States. \nHe recognizes that some of the programs simply don't work well. Out of \nthe 1,000 in existence, he recommended a modest 141 be substantially \nreduced or terminated. It would save $12 billion in 1 year. Over 5 \nyears, that is $60 billion. What do we see in this budget? Nothing. \nZero.\n  What about the entitlement programs? We are now at $1.5 trillion, \n$1.6 trillion in entitlements, which is about $900-some-odd billion in \ndiscretionary spending. The biggest amount of the budget now is in \nentitlement, or mandatory spending. We all know that. Did our \ncolleagues propose any steps to contain the growth at over 6 percent a \nyear automatically of mandatory entitlement spending? No. Zero. No cuts \nin that. No reductions.\n  Well, there was a little reduction, but they used that to go around \nand spend it on some other entitlement program. So the net was no \nreduction in the growth of entitlements, not one step toward making the \nentitlement programs more solid.\n  What else? We have to keep this between us all. It is a little bit of \na secret. But let me tell you what the budget does. It doesn't cut \nspending. This budget increases spending by $18 billion in the \ndiscretionary account above what President Bush asked for, the man who \nwas being accused by Democratic candidates last year of being a \nreckless spender. It increases spending.\n  So you tell me, colleagues, what we are dealing with. I would suggest \nthat elections have consequences; that despite protestations of \nfrugality and criticisms of Bush spending, our Democratic friends have \nproduced a budget that will result in a $916 billion tax increase and \n$986 billion spending increase, just as I pointed out, with the\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\n$18 billion spending increase over President Bush's proposals, as I \nmentioned earlier. It adds up over a period of time, goes into the \nbaseline, and surges spending. That is why you have to have restraint \nand show toughness and responsibility. I will just say that the leopard \nhas not changed its spots.\n  When we look at it, as a budget, what does it do to our sustained \neffort to keep our economy vibrant, keep our taxes low, and the growth \ngoing and reducing unemployment? I submit that what we have done in the \nbudget is that we have loosed forces that inevitably will put us at a \npoint in time down the road, 1, 2, 3 years, when these tax extensions \ncan't even be carried out. When they can't be extended anymore, these \nlower tax rates are going to have to go up because we are not going to \nhave a cut in spending. My colleagues are not going to cut spending. \nThey are going to increase spending. They are not going to cut \nspending.\n  How are we going to pay for these tax cuts? How can we pay to extend \nthe existing rates? They are going to continue spending. What is going \nto happen is the tax man is going to get deeper and deeper into the \npockets of working American citizens. It includes the marriage penalty, \nit includes the dividend tax, the capital gains tax, and the child tax \ncredit, and others. So that is the big deal we are dealing with.\n  I started thinking about this, and I decided what this is, in my own \nlittle mind. The way I figure it out, here is the Budget Committee, our \nDemocratic Budget Committee. They passed a budget. The budget, in my \nmind, amounts to a torpedo heading toward our vibrant, free economy. \nOur Democratic colleagues say: We haven't sunk the ship. We haven't hit \nthe ship. But the torpedo has already been loosed. It is going to hit \nthe ship because that is what the budget does.\n  Anyway, I just tell you that the mechanism is at work, and I don't \nknow how we can stop it if we pass this budget. I do have a solution to \nit, however, and I will talk about that in just a minute.\n  This is not an academic debate. We are talking about real dollars for \nreal Americans if these tax cuts expire, the lower rates that we have \ntoday, and they go back up. The lowest income families in America who \npay taxes, those earning less than $15,000 per year, whose tax rates \nare covered by this temporary extension, will see their tax rates \nincrease 33 percent. I think the $1,000 current per-child tax credit is \none of the best things this Congress ever did, and I campaigned on it \nin 1994. The $500-per-child credit worked so good and was so popular \nthat we added another $500 per child as part of the budget \nreconciliation process. That is coming to an end. It needs to be \nextended. So it is going to drop from $1,000 to $500.\n  The standard deduction for married couples will be cut by $1,700 per \nyear. That is $140 a month for a family. 45 million working families \nwith two children, if those tax reductions are not extended, will pay \n$3,000 more in taxes per year, which is equivalent to a 5-percent pay \ncut. And 15 million seniors will see their taxes increase. This is \nreality, and I am not going to go quietly on it. We need to fight this \nwith all the strength that we have.\n  The four new points of order that are in this budget make it almost \nimpossible to extend the existing tax cuts, and they are the trouble \nhere. We need to confront those. I have offered an amendment that will \ndeal with it, and I called it up on the floor just a minute ago, but \nlet me mention the four points of order that are included in this \nbudget that make it dead certain, if we continue with those points of \norder, that we are not going to be able to maintain the current tax \nrates and that we will see a substantial tax increase on all Americans.\n  The so-called pay-go rule, which states in part that the Senate \ncannot consider any revenue legislation that would increase the on-\nbudget deficit in the current fiscal or budget year, the five fiscal \nyears following the current fiscal year, or the 5 years after that--\nthat is the pay-go rule. Basically, it means you either have to raise \ntaxes to pay for tax extensions or you have to cut spending, and we are \nnot likely to do the latter.\n\n  No. 2, a point of order against any legislation that increases long-\nterm deficits.\n  Well, Joint Tax has already scored these tax reductions as costing \nthe Treasury money. Even though money to the Treasury is going up after \nwe reduce taxes, they scored it as costing the Treasury. Therefore, \nthat point of order would be sustained.\n  What does a point of order mean? It means that you can object to \nextending one of these tax cuts, and it would not take a 50-vote \nmajority to extend the tax cut, or 51. It would take 60, a \nsupermajority, because we create a point of order that allows for a \nlarger vote to be required.\n  No. 3, there is the so-called save-Social-Security-first point of \norder. This point of order prevents any new tax relief or extension of \nexisting tax relief that would worsen the budget deficit until the \nPresident has submitted and the Congress has enacted a bill that would \nensure the long-term solvency of Social Security.\n  The President tried to do that a couple of years ago. He received not \na single vote of support in this body. They wouldn't even discuss it. \nThey said it was dead on arrival. Senator Gregg asked that we have in \nthis budget some plans to begin to reform our entitlement programs, \nincluding Social Security. What did our colleagues do in the budget? \nZero. Now they are going to say: You can't extend your tax cuts, you \ncan't extend the current lower rates of taxes until you fix Social \nSecurity. Not only that, it says until the President has submitted, and \nthe Congress has enacted, a bill to fix Social Security.\n  I certainly think we should do that, but I have to tell you, in my \nview, I think that is unlikely to occur no matter who is President, no \nmatter how this Congress is made up. We need to do it, and I support \nit, and I am disappointed we haven't taken any steps whatsoever in this \nbudget to get there.\n  Finally, there is a point of order against any reconciliation action \nthat would increase the deficit. Reconciliation has been the mechanism \nthat Republicans have used to provide tax relief to the American \npeople. That is how we got it through, by a 50-vote majority, as part \nof the budget reconciliation process. These were narrow votes. We \nbarely got 51 votes. Under this proposal, under this budget, it is \ngoing to require 60 votes.\n  So if this budget goes through, the four points of order will \npractically guarantee that all of President Bush's tax cuts will \nexpire. Out the window will go the marriage penalty relief, this \npenalty that we impose on people who marry--how dumb is that, to tax \nmarriage? That is not a smart thing for the Nation to do. We eliminated \nmost of that, but that will go out the window if we can't extend that \ntax reduction, along with the $1,000-per-child tax credit, the adoption \ntax credit, and the estate tax repeal, along with the capital gains \nreduction.\n  When we cut capital gains taxes, we didn't lose $5 billion in revenue \nas CBO said; revenues went up $133 billion.\n  It also will eliminate the dividend tax deduction. So the 10-percent \ntax bracket will disappear and marginal rates will increase.\n  So each of these points of order require 60 votes, and it means that \nwe are facing a problem of a serious nature. We will be drifting more \ntoward the social European model of higher taxes, higher spending, and \nhigher regulation. I do not believe that is what the American people \nwant.\n  I know there is an idea that through better enforcement against tax \nfraud we can make up some of this money and that we will increase tax \nrevenue by $100 billion. I wish that could be done. I will support \nreasonable steps and fair steps to enhance enforcement of our tax laws. \nBut I have to tell you, I met last week with a group of county \ncommissioners from my State, and their No. 1 complaint was that there \nis some sort of Federal law that has been passed to make them withhold \ntaxes when they pay anybody they deal with so we can close some \nloophole. And they contend, I don't know how correctly, but they \ncontend it costs more to effectuate the Government's plan than it saves \nthe Government in taxes.\n  The IRS Commissioner, however, testified before Congress that only \n$35 billion could be expected to be saved through enhanced enforcement \nover 5 years.\n  I am a former Federal prosecutor, a U.S. attorney. I prosecuted a \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\ntax fraud cases. I try to pay my taxes. I do the best I can, and I tell \nyou, I think most Americans do. When somebody cheats, they need to be \nchased down and they need to be prosecuted. It is not right for a rich \nperson to cheat on his taxes while the average Joe is working hard and \npaying his taxes. So I support that. I am just telling you, there is \nnot a pot of gold out there, as much as we would like to believe there \nis.\n  Our colleagues, in writing their budget, just assumed we would get \nit. They made their budget balance by assuming that we would bring in \n$100 billion out of tax enforcement. It begins to look like smoke and \nmirrors, really. The Commissioner says $35 billion is the most we can \nget. Senator Grassley, former chairman of the Finance Committee, says \nwe can't get that much money. It is not as easy as people say.\n  To prevent the largest tax increase in history from occurring, just \nfrom not having our existing tax rates extended, I am offering an \namendment today that would not only exclude any extension of the \nexpiring tax relief from those four new budget points of order but any \nbudget point of order that would threaten that. If my amendment is \nagreed to, it would therefore take 50 votes to extend the President's \ncurrent tax breaks that we have passed here in the body and not 60. If \nwe do not do that, the tax collector is going to be jumping back into \nyour pocket. He is going to be taking a lot bigger chunk out of what \nyou make every week. We have to look at the realities of it.\n\n  I would say once again, the way this budget is constructed, based on \nthe increased spending our Democratic colleagues propose, we have \nthrough this budget loosed a torpedo. How long it takes to hit the ship \nI don't know--1, 2, 3 years--but it is on the way and it is going to \nget there and it is inevitable. The bullet has already been launched.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Budget Committee who worked hard--\nSenator Conrad and Senator Judd Gregg. They are both extremely capable. \nThese arguments I am making deal a great deal with philosophy and \ndirection, how we see our Government, how big we want it to be, how \nmuch we want it to take from the private sector and the wealth that \ngreat private sector generates--how much of it we want it to take. I am \nvery troubled that we are headed down the wrong road, that we are going \nto increase taxes on middle America, on corporate America, and the net \nresult will be this surging economy may be damaged and, in the long \nrun, we may not receive any tax revenue at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Alabama. Senator Sessions is a \nconstructive member of the Budget Committee. He and I have many \ndisagreements. We have spirited debates. But I have high regard for the \nSenator and have enjoyed his service on the Budget Committee. He has \nbeen, as I said, a very constructive member there.\n  Let me say I disagree with some of the conclusions he has reached. I \nwish to say to the Senator, I believe that the revenue objectives we \nhave set in this budget resolution are entirely achievable with no tax \nincrease. I would say to the Senator, the President, when he put out \nhis budget, said it would raise $14.8 trillion. My budget says $15 \ntrillion. That is a difference of 1.2 percent, and I believe that can \nbe accomplished by going after tax havens, tax gaps, tax scams that are \noccurring. I do not think it is that difficult to do.\n  With that said, I very strongly resist the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Alabama to remove points of order against additional spending or \nadditional tax cuts. In this part of it, the Senator is talking about \nadditional tax cuts. That guts pay-go. A central part of the new budget \ndiscipline being proposed in this budget resolution is to reassert pay-\ngo. Pay-go says simply this: New mandatory spending and tax cuts must \nbe offset or get 60 votes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield briefly for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I am always happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't think I made it clear, and I think maybe the \nSenator misspoke because I may have earlier. This eliminating the point \nof order would only be eliminating points of order that are related--\nthat could be raised against existing tax relief. Not any new tax cuts. \nThese points of order--I did not seek to change it in that regard.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate that. My argument still holds because the \nway pay-go works, because the existing tax cuts are sunset under \ncurrent law, to extend them, costs money. It has to come from \nsomewhere. Pay-go says you have to pay for it. That is what we are \nseeking to do. The amendment of the Senator would gut that attempt.\n  What we are saying is to extend the current tax cuts, you have to pay \nfor it. If you want new mandatory spending, you have to pay for it. Let \nme indicate very quickly, under the current GOP pay-go rule, the \nRepublican pay-go rule, it exempts all tax cuts and mandatory increases \nthat are assumed in any budget resolution, no matter how much they \nincrease the deficits.\n  Our pay-go rule says all mandatory spending and tax cuts that \nincrease deficits must be paid for or require 60 votes.\n  That is a budget discipline that worked very well in the 1990s and we \nneed to restore it. One of the reasons we have this, when we had strong \npay-go in effect, here is what happened to the deficits. Each and every \nyear they were reduced until we actually went into surplus and even, \nfor 2 years, we stopped using Social Security money to pay bills around \nhere. Then the weakened pay-go rule went into effect right here and \nlook what happened: Right back in the deficit ditch big time, record \ndeficits, record increases in debt. That is what we are trying to avoid \nwith these points of order, to make it more difficult around here to \nspend money on new mandatory programs, to have more tax cuts, new tax \ncuts. The amendment of the Senator would gut it.\n  Senator Gregg said this, in 2002:\n\n       As a practical matter you can get 60 votes on the floor of \n     the Senate fairly quickly for most things that make sense.\n\n  Senator Gregg was absolutely right back in 2002. But he had other \nthings to say as well. Back in 2002 he said this:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program or you \n     are going to cut taxes during a period, especially of \n     deficits, you must offset that event so that it becomes a \n     budget-neutral event that also lapses.\n\n  He went on to say this:\n\n       If we do not do this, if we do not put back in place caps \n     and pay-go mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline in \n     this Congress and, as a result, we will dramatically \n     aggravate the deficit which, of course, impacts a lot of \n     important issues but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  Senator Gregg was absolutely right about that. That is why I think \nadopting the amendment of the Senator from Alabama would be a serious \nmistake. Does the Senator from Michigan request time to respond?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, the comment I have, when we look at what \nthe Senator from Alabama is talking about, he is basically saying that \nthe tax cuts that were passed, first of all, were a good idea for most \nAmericans and that he wants to make it as difficult as possible to \nchange that. So when we look at what happened this last year, if you \nhave more than $1 million that you earned in some way--unearned income \nor earned income--more than $1 million, you received $118,477 from the \nPresident's tax cuts last year. So what this amendment would do is say \nbasically that they like this ratio. The less you made last year, the \nless you got. In fact, less than $100,000 in income, a family making \nless than $100,000 got $692. If you were willing to run that out even \nfurther, you had a lot of folks who maybe got $30, $40, $50 from this \ntax cut. So this locks in this kind of a tax cut.\n  We don't think this is fair. This budget resolution changes the way \nwe look at tax cuts going forward and basically says we want tax cuts \ngoing to middle-class Americans. We want tax cuts going to the majority \nof Americans who are working hard every day, worried about their kids, \nwho want to be able to send them to college, want to be able to have \nhealth care for them, and want a job, a good-paying job in America. \nThese are the folks we are focusing on in this budget.\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\n  There is no question about it. This budget resolution is a new \ndirection. It is a new day. It is a new set of values and priorities. \nThe idea of saying, as this amendment does, that we should make it \nharder to change this, harder to rearrange things here or to maybe move \nsome of those dollars over into making sure kids can go to college or \nmaking sure they have health care or their folks have health care or \nmaking sure we keep our promises to our veterans--those are the \npriorities in our budget.\n  Essentially, this amendment would say, if we need to address our \nveterans through adding dollars to make sure they have the health care \nthey need, if we need to do more as we investigate and see what is \nunfolding with Walter Reed and other parts of the VA system and so on, \nthat it would take more votes, it would take 60 votes to do something \nthat would help our veterans but it would only take 50 votes to be able \nto continue this kind of a tax cut, this kind of a structure.\n  We reject that. We reject that set of values and priorities. They \nhave been in place for 6 years, and I believe the American people have \nrejected those priorities with the changes in majority and the change \nin leadership that was made and that has begun as of January. What we \nhave is a different approach.\n  First of all, as our distinguished budget chairman has said, we do \nwant to say for new spending--whether it is tax cuts or other kinds of \nspending--we do want, overall, to make it a little tougher by having a \n60-vote requirement because we want to make sure we are paying \nattention to lowering the deficit and moving in the other direction, to \nstop this spending using Social Security that has been going on for \nyears and years.\n  But also in our budget, within that context, we have changed the \npriorities on the spending. We have said let's be fiscally responsible \non any new mandatory spending, any new tax cuts, and require that \npeople come together in a bipartisan way. It is a conscious choice, a \nsupermajority vote. But we have also said we are going to increase the \nbudget in education.\n  Earlier we heard from colleagues talking about all the new money that \nhas been put into education under this President. The fact is that if \nyou include this President's budget for next year, the Leave No Child \nBehind legislation is underfunded by over $70 billion. We put more \ndollars into education because we know it is about opportunity for our \nkids, it is about economic competitiveness, it is about creating \nopportunity--to dream big dreams and go as far as you can in the \ngreatest country in the world--and that we have to focus on education.\n  Our budget does that. Our budget also says that part of what we need \nto do is invest in children's health care. For working families, those \nfolks whose minimum wage we raised who do not have health insurance \nwith their job, who are working one job, two jobs, three jobs, to try \nto make ends meet, we think they ought not have to go to bed worried \nabout whether their kids are going to get sick; with a prayer at night \nsaying: Please, God, don't let my kids get sick.\n  The SCHIP program is about making sure we support those working \nfamilies, and we made a commitment in this budget to say we want every \nchild from that working family--every child who does not have insurance \nto be able to receive insurance. This budget keeps its commitment to \nits veterans. This budget provides real middle-class tax cuts.\n  Not what is on this chart. I am not interested in adding. Can you \nimagine, $118,000-plus is the tax cut for last year? That is more than \nthe average person in Michigan or anywhere in this country makes in a \nyear. That is more than they make in a year.\n  We say we need a different kind of tax cut. For the folks who are \nmaking less than $118,000 a year, for the folks who are working hard \nevery day, we want to change this picture. This amendment would \nbasically say: The current tax cuts that are in place are great, we \nwant to make it harder to change them. They keep in place something \nthat frankly has been so unfair to middle-class Americans.\n  All over Michigan, when you talk to folks about tax cuts, most people \nsay to me: What tax cuts? What are you talking about? I did not get a \ntax cut. You mean that tax cut that went into place in 2001?\n  You don't remember getting that big tax cut? Most people never saw \nthat tax cut. That is why if you earned more than half a million \ndollars last year, you saw it, $21,000 worth. If you earned more than \n$1 million last year, you got over $118,000 in tax cuts.\n  We need a new direction. That is what this budget resolution is \nabout, a new direction for the country that says: It is about \neverybody. It is about everybody who works hard every day, who gets up \nin the morning, does their best knowing they are going to be able to \nshare in tax cuts.\n  But they are also going to be able to share in a community, in an \neducational system that works for the kids, being able to send them to \ncollege; that they are going to be able to share in the great health \ncare we have in this country. We have got the greatest health care in \nthe world. We have got 50 million people with no health insurance.\n  We spend twice as much money as any other country in the Western \nHemisphere on our health care coverage. We are saying: We can do this \nbetter. We can do this differently so that American families reap the \nbenefit of working hard and know that the future of this country is \navailable to them for the great things about this country, the health \ncare system, access to college, good schools are available to them.\n  Then we go further and we say: We want to make sure you have enough \npolice officers on the streets and firefighters and that local \ncommunities can take care of water and sewer needs and other issues and \nprotect the environment; in Michigan, it is the Great Lakes and our \nair, to be able to breathe the air, and on and on.\n  There is a set of things that we are committed to doing. The good \nthing is all that domestic spending we have talked about, that $18 \nbillion in increased spending, 17 percent of the entire budget, only 17 \npercent of the entire budget, our investments that we are talking about \nfor the people of this country.\n  Let me also say again, when we talk about differences and where \ndollars go, $10 billion, $10 billion a year is needed to make sure \nevery kid in this country has health care. That is what we are spending \nin 1 month in Iraq--1 month in Iraq worth of funding to fund every \nchild in America with health care coverage.\n  We believe we need to be doing that. In fact, the entire increase in \ninvestments in the future for this country's health care, science, \neducation, protecting the environment, law enforcement, all of it adds \nup to less than 2 months' spending in Iraq.\n  What this amendment would say is we are going to make it very hard to \ndo any other kind of investments for the American people, American \nfamilies, but we are going to make it easy to extend this kind of tax \ncut for people earning over $1 million a year.\n  I hope we will say no. I hope we will say yes to the budget \nresolution. We are bringing back fiscal responsibility and stopping \ndigging so the hole does not get any bigger and we can get out of it. \nWe are redirecting the priorities of this country to reflect what the \nmajority of Americans want to see happen for the future of this country \nand for the future of kids.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand now that Senator Cornyn is \ngoing to offer an amendment. We have a unanimous consent agreement \nwhich would put him in order. So I yield to Senator Cornyn for the \npurposes of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 477\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, Mr. Graham, Mr. Bunning, Mr. McCain, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n     Crapo, and Mr. DeMint, proposes an amendment numbered 477.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a budget point of order against legislation \n   that increases income taxes on taxpayers, including hard-working \n      middle-income families, entrepreneurs, and college students)\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT RAISES \n                   INCOME TAX RATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill, resolution, amendment, amendment between \n     Houses, motion, or conference report that includes a Federal \n     income tax rate increase. In this subsection, the term \n     ``Federal income tax rate increase'' means any amendment to \n     subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of section 1, or to \n     section 11(b) or 55(b), of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     that imposes a new percentage as a rate of tax and thereby \n     increases the amount of tax imposed by any such section.\n       (b) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--\n       (1) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeal.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of \n     the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my amendment creates a 60-vote point of \norder against any legislation that raises income taxes on taxpayers. \nNow, I have served on the Budget Committee, and we have had discussions \nduring the course of marking up this budget resolution in the \ncommittee.\n  The chairman tells me it is not his intention for this budget to \nreflect a tax rate increase. I say good for him and good for us if \nthat, in fact, is true. The problem is that this budget, over the next \n5 years, contemplates a $146 billion increase in discretionary \nspending. That money has to come from somewhere.\n  Unfortunately, during the committee's debate on this budget, I \noffered this amendment, but it was opposed. I am told the chairman may \nhave some different views today after additional clarification and \nexplanation. We will see.\n  But let me make sure it is clear that this amendment will not hinder \nour efforts to shut down and close illegal tax shelters or perceived \nloopholes in the IRS Code. This amendment deals with the tax tables \ncontained in the 1040 form that the IRS annually sends to every \ntaxpayer. It will not--let me be clear--it will not hinder efforts to \nreform or overhaul the Tax Code. Any tax simplification effort will \nneed bipartisan support in the Senate, and if it is revenue neutral, I \nam confident it will be forthcoming.\n  Rather, this point of order is an insurance policy when Congress \ndecides to look at the pocketbook of taxpayers for even more revenue \ninstead of looking for ways to eliminate Government waste, fraud, and \nabuse. The former Chief Justice, John Marshall, said:\n\n       The power to tax is the power to destroy.\n\n  The power to tax is the most powerful tool Congress has at its \ndisposal, and my amendment puts it in a place where it will be a \nsafeguard that will protect the pocketbooks of middle-class families, \ncollege students, and entrepreneurs. Some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are advocating that we pull the rug out from our \neconomy and roll back the President's tax relief or simply let it \nexpire on its own. That is the last thing we should do to protect \ngrowth policies of this Government that have helped this economy \nperform well.\n  Similar to millions of Americans out there, I am very optimistic \nabout where we are headed. Frankly, I am surprised that our numbers, \nthe good numbers that are reported almost weekly and monthly have not \nmade more headlines because we have one of the strongest economies of \nany industrialized country in the world despite the present-day \nchallenges we experience.\n  The economy's performance speaks to its resiliency and its strength. \nWe can and we should take pride in this economy's performance and look \nfor optimism toward the future. Earlier this month, the Labor \nDepartment reported that almost 100,000 new payroll jobs were created \nin February and that the unemployment rate remains at a historic low, \nabout 4\\1/2\\ percent.\n  The progrowth policies we have been working and living under have \ngiven rise to 21 straight quarters of growth and 7.6 million new jobs \nover the past 42 consecutive months--a tremendous accomplishment and a \ntrend we must work to continue as we face significant fiscal challenges \nahead. As we move forward, the last thing we need to consider is \nreversing the policies that have helped bring about this well-\nperforming economy. We need to continue to generate more revenue, not \nby raising tax rates but by allowing this economy to create those \nrevenues which are unprecedented in our Nation's history, as we allow \nmore Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  In fact, I think we should go a step further and make the President's \nprogrowth tax relief permanent, because if we don't, we will not only \njeopardize future economic growth but also the financial well-being of \nmillions of Americans--families, small business owners, seniors, all \nwill face higher tax bills beginning in 2011.\n  Not making this tax relief permanent will result in an increase in \ntaxes to every American taxpayer. For example, a family of four with \ntwo children making $50,000 in annual income would see an increase of \n$2,092 in its tax bills or a 132-percent hike.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee argues that his budget does not \nraise rates to the American taxpayer, and I am hopeful that is the \ncase. Frankly, there is no way the chairman can guarantee this policy \nassumption will remain, short of my amendment. I see this amendment as \nan insurance policy when Congress decides to look at the pocketbooks of \nthe American taxpayers for more revenue, which would contemplate \napplying the brakes on the economy instead of eliminating Government \nwaste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I have had conversations with the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee. He has indicated to me that perhaps there are some \nquestions he has about the import or the impact of this amendment. I \nwould be glad to respond to any questions he may have.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Texas very much. Senator Cornyn \nis another member of the Budget Committee whom I always look forward to \nworking with and hearing his views; sometimes we agree, sometimes we do \nnot.\n  But with Senator Cornyn, it is always done in a collegial and \nprofessional manner, and I appreciate the attitude he brings to the \ncommittee.\n  I have three questions I wish to ask Senator Cornyn with respect to \nthis amendment. First, would it be the Senator's intent, in any way, \nthat this amendment would preclude a corporation or an individual from \npaying more if we were to close down certain offshore tax havens?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would answer the Senator's question by \nsaying it would not. The import and the effect of this amendment would \nbe to prevent an increase in the rate of taxes but not to close \nloopholes on those who are not paying taxes or not their fair share of \ntaxes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have one question related to tax havens, one to tax \nloopholes, and one to tax gap. So my understanding, from the answer to \nthe first question--which went to the question of tax havens--is that \noffshore tax havens that certain companies and individuals have been \nsetting up in order to avoid the U.S. taxes, you have no intent in this \namendment to preclude us from collecting more revenue from those who \nwere engaged in those practices?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The second question would be with respect to the tax gap. \nObviously, we have some who are not paying what they legitimately owe \nunder the current Code. I assume it would be the Senator's position \nthat his amendment would not preclude us from collecting more revenue \nfrom companies or individuals who are not now paying what they \nlegitimately owe under the current law.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator is also correct. This would \nnot affect collecting taxes from what people are not paying that they \ndo legitimately owe now.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Final question goes to this more nuanced question of \nbasically tax scams, circumstances such as the one I have described \nearlier today in which U.S. companies and investors are buying foreign \nassets--for example, sewer systems or public facilities such as \ncommuter rail or other foreign assets--depreciating them on the books\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nhere for tax purposes, and then engaging in lease back of those assets \nto the communities that paid for them in the first place. Would it be \ncorrect to assume there is nothing in this amendment that would \npreclude us from shutting down those abusive tax shelters?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee, there is nothing in this amendment that would \npreclude the action he described.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to the Senator, based on his answers to me, I would \nbe willing to accept the Senator's amendment. Would the Senator be \nwilling to accept a voice vote on the amendment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee, my concern is that amendments that are accepted or \ntaken by voice vote are sometimes looked upon by the conferees as \nhaving less dignity and likely not to make it out of the conference \ncommittee as compared to amendments on which there is actually a \nrollcall vote. It would be my preference to ask for the yeas and nays \nand to have a rollcall vote. We can stack it along with other votes we \nwill be having. I don't think it will delay the work of the chairman or \nthe ranking member. That is my preference.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say, the Senator has that right. I don't think we \nneed to belabor this point. I have received answers to the questions I \nhad. The Senator has been very forthcoming with respect to his answers.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair and the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Budget Committee for their courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to both Senators. I wanted to \nsay that tomorrow night, unless there is something changed, we will be \nin session until 1 a.m. Thursday morning. Unless we work something out \non the time on this by yielding back time, the next night--that is, \nThursday night--we will be in all night. That is the only way the time \ncan be used up. If that happens, our time will be gone at 1:30, \napproximately, on Friday morning. That is when the vote-arama would \nstart. We have no two men who are more experienced than these two \nmanagers. This is a difficult bill. Hopefully, we can work something \nout to yield back part of the time. If we can't, we have to do that \nbecause we have to have final passage or a final vote on this matter \nsometime Friday. That is where we are. The vote-arama could take us \ninto Saturday. But to get to Friday at 1:30 is going to take all night \ntomorrow night, all night Thursday night, until 1 o'clock Friday \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no other \namendments be in order today; that on Wednesday, when the Senate \nresumes the budget resolution, there be 42 hours remaining equally \ndivided; that on Wednesday, the first amendment be offered by a \nRepublican Senator, and the intention is that be Senator Ensign, and \nthat the next amendment be one offered by the majority leader or his \ndesignee; further, that no rollcall votes occur prior to 5 p.m. \nWednesday and that the first vote in the sequence be the amendment \noffered by the majority leader or his designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, for the information of the Senate, I \nwould like to announce that during the vote sequence, if Republicans \nhave an alternative to the first Democratic amendment, then it would be \nvoted after the Democratic amendment, and we expect that other \namendments will be offered and debated Wednesday prior to 5 p.m. So \nthere are expected to be a series of votes at that time. We expect that \nthey will be voted in an alternating fashion; that is, going back and \nforth between the two parties.\n  Mr. GREGG. This has been worked out. This is an appropriate way to \nproceed, and it makes significant progress. I would hope that tomorrow \nevening when we start this vote, we will have more than these \namendments lined up. In fact, I hope we have five or six other ones to \nvote on so we would have quite a series of votes at 5 o'clock tomorrow \nnight. That will get us on course.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is entirely appropriate to say to our colleagues, to \nput them on notice, that we intend to have a series of votes after 5 \no'clock, not limited to these. The other amendments we are going to try \nto get through as quickly and as fairly as we can tomorrow so that we \nreduce what is left over for vote-arama.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may add, reserving the right to object, tonight, if \npeople wish to come down and speak on the resolution, this is a good \ntime to do it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. This is an excellent time to speak on the resolution, but \nthere will be no further amendments in order, nor votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The consent had been granted.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We appreciate that. I appreciate very much the \ncooperation of Senator Gregg in setting up this series of votes \ntomorrow tonight.\n  We have the Senator from Ohio. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. BROWN. No more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Ohio. We are \ndelighted he is here to talk about the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, for too long policies set in Washington \nhave failed to represent the values of families throughout our Nation. \nThe last 6 years, the President has used his State of the Union Address \nto assert his administration's commitment to economic development, to \nquality education, to enhanced national security, and to other \nworthwhile goals. For the last 6 years, he has presented a budget that \ncuts funding, that cripples communities, that devastates families. His \nadministration talks about the importance of economic development, then \nthey propose cuts to small business and to manufacturing programs. His \nadministration talks about the importance of education, then year after \nyear they dramatically underfund No Child Left Behind. The \nadministration talks about the importance of homeland security, then \nthey cut critical first responder funding, all the while continuing to \npush for more tax breaks for billionaires.\n  Budgets, as we know, are moral documents, for a business, for a \nfamily, and for a government. Budgets reveal what is important and what \nis not. They reveal priorities. Over the last 6 years, the Federal \nbudget has strayed further and further away from the priorities of the \npeople we represent. This budget is an opportunity to reverse course.\n  Members of Congress serve at the pleasure of those who elected us to \noffice. We are supposed to serve on their behalf. Families across Ohio, \nfamilies across the Nation made their priorities well known last \nNovember. They want a budget that helps to educate our children, \ninvests in our communities, and secures our Nation. They want a budget \nthat supports our military overseas and our first responders at home \nand our veterans and our soldiers and sailors when they return. They \nwant a budget that values our Nation's veterans, bolsters the public \nhealth, and makes a meaningful, not a token, investment in alternative \nenergy.\n  Congress has hard work to do in the months and years ahead. Six years \nago, we had a budget surplus. Now we have deficits as far as the eye \ncan see. We must realign our budget priorities and our policymaking to \nreflect the priorities of working families. This budget takes us in a \nnew direction, guided by our constituents' priorities.\n  Say no to the Sessions amendment. Say yes to the budget resolution. \nIt is a new direction. It is the right one.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered. Does the Senator from North Dakota yield time?\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am always happy to yield time to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I know our budget leaders are working \ndiligently as they put together what will be happening on amendments. I \nthought I would take a moment to summarize again what it is that we are \nproposing in this budget resolution. Let me again commend our leader, \nSenator Conrad, the very distinguished Senator from North Dakota, for \nhis incredible job of putting together a very complicated budget with \nmany pieces. He has worked very hard. His staff has worked very hard. I \nthank them for that, as well as the distinguished former chairman, \ncurrent ranking member, the Senator from New Hampshire, who is also a \nreal pleasure to work with. Even though we disagree on many \nphilosophical points, it is a pleasure working with him. I appreciate \nall of his hard work and the hard work of his staff.\n  What we are looking at for the next year and for basically the 5 \nyears of the budget resolution is a return to fiscal responsibility; in \nother words, we think it is time that we stop digging the hole and \nstart filling in so we can climb out of it. In other words, we think it \nis time to start paying the bills and not spending more than we have, \nwhich is what every family in America has to wrestle with every day. \nThey expect us to make the tough choices to do the same things. This \nbudget does that.\n\n  This budget also puts middle-class families first. We start by \naddressing all that we know families are concerned about. It is a new \ndirection for America. It is a new time.\n  We have seen in the last 6 years an effort to put the privileged few \nfirst--whether that was tax cuts, whether that was other kinds of \ninvestments, or a lack of fiscal responsibility, a real borrow-and-\nspend mentality.\n  We now are saying it is time for a new direction. I think the people \nof America said in November it is time for a new direction. They \nelected a new majority, and it is our job, it is our responsibility now \nto fulfill that.\n  That is what this budget resolution does. It reflects a very \ndifferent set of values and priorities. We do return to fiscal \ndiscipline. In fact, by year 5--by year 5--we are back in the black, \nwhich is extraordinary given the fact that in the Clinton years, in the \n1990s, we did all the hard work of getting it into balance. I remember \nbeing in the House with the distinguished Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Ohio. We were in the House together. It was a very tough \ntime to make tough decisions to balance the budget. The first year I \nwas in the House, we did that in 1997. Then we began to see surpluses. \nWe did that with a very balanced approach. We did that with tax cuts to \nstimulate the economy, but it was for middle-class families and small \nbusinesses and those who were creating jobs in America. We did it by \nstrategic investments. We did it by strategic investments in education, \ninnovation, science, technology development, and investing in health \ncare.\n  That is when the first children's health care program was developed, \nto provide health care for children of working families who do not have \nhealth insurance connected to their job. We did it by making some very \ntough decisions that put Social Security first and stopped using that \ntrust fund as a way to fund other things. As a result of some tough \ndecisions and some smart investments, by 2001, when I had the privilege \nof coming to the Senate representing Michigan and sitting on the Senate \nBudget Committee, we had the largest budget surplus in the history of \nthe country--$5.7 trillion. I could live on that--$5.7 trillion.\n  We had, then, choices. What do you do with that? After all that hard \nwork, what do you do with that?\n  I remember the now distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, \nthe Senator from North Dakota, suggesting what I believed was a very \nwise plan at the time. He said: We need to be balanced, as we have \nbeen, as we were in the 1990s, in getting us to this point. We need to \ndo strategic tax cuts, again to stimulate the economy. Those kinds of \ntax cuts create jobs in America, innovation. Then we need to have \nstrategic investments in our people, in science, in health care, in \neducation, having the opportunity for people to be able to afford to go \nto college.\n  Let's make sure our communities are safe by having enough police \nofficers on the streets. Let's do those things that protect our air and \nour water and our land and invest in the quality of life of America. So \nlet's do that for one-third; tax cuts for one-third. And then we know \nwe baby boomers are coming. We know the concern about Social Security. \nSo let's take a third of all that surplus and put it aside, put it into \nprefunding the gap we know is coming.\n  That was the current chairman's plan. I thought that was a good plan. \nI supported it. We were in the minority, and we were not successful in \npassing that plan. I believe if we had, we would not be debating the \ngap in Social Security as we are now, and we would not be talking about \ndigging ourselves out of a hole that has been created, because instead \nof that balanced approach that every family would take trying to \nbalance out multiple needs--and how do we make sure we are smart, how \ndo we be strategic, how do we create opportunities, and so on--instead \nof doing that, virtually all of it was put into a tax cut that resulted \nlast year in people who earn over $1 million--just in 2006--getting an \nover $118,000 tax cut, which was more than most people in Michigan make \nin a year.\n  So that was done. Then it left us no rainy day fund, no ability to \nrespond to emergencies. Then the war happened. We essentially put it on \na credit card. Other things were passed that were essentially put on a \ncredit card. We racked up--I should not say ``we;'' I did not support \nthose things--the largest deficit in the history of the country.\n  Now there is a new majority, and we have inherited all of the things \nthat happened before. I heard tonight colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle talking about all these problems in the budget. Boy, do we \nagree. Unfortunately, we did not create those problems. We have \ninherited those problems over the last 6 years. But we know it is our \nresponsibility to do something about it. That is what this budget does. \nThis budget is an effort to be responsible, to do what every American \nwants us to do to get our arms around this deficit, to do those things \nthat will require tough choices, the right choices.\n\n  We say if there are going to be further tax cuts or mandatory \nspending in the future, you should have to think long and hard, and we \nshould have to get 60 votes or a supermajority to do that because we \nwant to make it a fiscally responsible budget.\n  But we also understand part of being responsible is responding to \nwhat is happening to every--almost every--American family across this \ncountry. Earlier today, I heard the distinguished ranking member on the \nBudget Committee talk about how great things are, how great things are \ngoing. Well, they are not going great for a majority of Americans in \nthis country who have seen their real wages, their earning power go \ndown since 2000, not up. For others it may be going up. Corporate \nprofits are going up. The S 500 is going up. But for everybody \nworking hard every day, trying to make ends meet for their family, \ntheir wages on average are going down.\n  This budget addresses that issue. This budget focuses on middle-\nincome families and those working very hard to get into the middle \nclass who are saying: What about me? When is somebody going to stop \nwhat is going on and focus on the majority of Americans and what we \nneed to grow the economy, our quality of life, and to make sure our \nfamilies have what they need, who are working hard every day? That is \nwhat this budget addresses, those people who are, in fact, the majority \nof the people.\n  So we do it in a number of ways. We do it by investing in education. \nWhen you look at the President's budget for this year, and you add up \npast years, there is over a $70 billion shortfall in Leave No Child \nBehind. We are leaving a lot of kids behind. There was a commitment \nmade to raise standards, and at the same time to give resources to \nschools, and it is $70 billion short as of this date with this \nPresident's budget.\n  We put more money into education. We do not think that is good \nenough. I was at an education hearing today, and some very good points \nwere made. In fact, our chairman, the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, told a story at the beginning of the hearing about Rip\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\nVan Winkle waking up and seeing all these changes in the world, but he \nfinally could feel comfort because the school looked the same.\n  My kids graduated from college not long ago, but not too long ago \nhigh school. One of the things that consistently has caused me great \nconcern is that the schools they went to look dangerously like the \nschools I went to. Yet we carry around personal computers. Every single \none of us operates with computers. We have computers right here in the \nSenate Chamber. Yet we do not have one on the desk for every child in \nAmerica. So we are leaving kids behind in a lot of different ways. We \nsay in our budget resolution, that is not OK. We want to turn that \naround. So we put dollars back. We stopped the cuts the President has, \nand we invest more dollars in education and innovation.\n  Then we say if you are working hard and you are trying to make ends \nmeet, and you are working in a job that does not have health insurance \nfor your family, you ought to be able to know that when you go to bed \nat night your kids have health care and you can do something about it \nif they get sick. That is what we do by making a commitment to fully \nfund what is called SCHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nThis is something that is available to working families. Low-income \nfamilies are able to receive Medicaid. These are families who are \nworking hard, families whose minimum wage we raised not long ago. So \nmaybe they only have to work two jobs now instead of three to make ends \nmeet, but they still do not have health insurance. We make a commitment \nto provide that health insurance for every child of a working family.\n  That is a very important value. It is a very important principle. I \nhope we are going to come together with strong bipartisan support to be \nable to do that.\n  We also then keep our promise to our veterans. We all know what has \nhappened at Walter Reed. We know also there are other very serious \nsystem problems. In my State of Michigan, people wait too long to see a \ndoctor. They drive too far to get basic kinds of tests, blood drawn, or \nx rays. We need to do a better job for our veterans. We need, frankly, \nto get them out of the yearly budget process and put them into a \nsituation where they know their funding is assured.\n  Our budget, for the first time ever, I assume--certainly for the \nfirst time since I have been here; and I have asked others, and I think \nit is the first time ever--we have in the budget the amount recommended \nby the independent budget which is organized by all the veterans \ngroups. The veterans groups have come together. They analyze the VA \nhealth system and other needs and recommend to us what is needed.\n  For the first time, our budget for veterans health care and other \ncritical needs matches what they are recommending. This is very \nimportant. We are making veterans--our men and women who are coming \nhome from wars, who put on a veteran's cap, who may have tremendous \nhardships, physical challenges, mental challenges, financial challenges \nfrom being extended more than once--and with serious issues for \nfamilies--we make veterans a top priority and say we are going to keep \nour promise to our veterans. That is an integral part of our budget \nresolution.\n  Then we go back to what we have always been about. The other side \nwill say: Well, we are for tax increases. No. No. We just want to see \nthe folks who are working hard, who are the majority of Americans, get \nthe tax cut. I am not interested in another tax cut for somebody who \nmakes over $1 million a year, who got $118,000 back in a tax cut last \nyear. I want somebody making $118,000 a year to get a tax cut. We start \nby saying the alternative minimum tax, which is creeping up and hitting \nmiddle-income people, should be changed so it does not become the \nalternative middle class tax. We are very focused on making sure the \nother parts of the Tax Code that are important to families remain in \nplace and that we, in fact, are giving middle-class tax cuts.\n  Then we take a look at all of the efforts to deinvest, to defund that \nthe President recommended in education, cutting the COPS Program again, \nfirefighter grants, various kinds of technology programs, environmental \nprograms in Michigan, and I know in Ohio as well. The manufacturing \nextension partnership is important for small and medium-sized \nbusinesses to be able to help them receive technical assistance, to be \nable to compete in the global economy, to be able to hire more \npeople. We have restored the funding for that. We address other \ntechnology programs. So we also reject the President's efforts to move \naway from critical areas of priority and need of the American people.\n\n  So there are a lot of other pieces in this budget, but these \nbasically, overall, are the important priorities that we have placed in \nthe budget that say to the American people: We care about you. We want \nto put you and your family first. We know that you are squeezed on all \nsides. If you are from Michigan and losing your job or being asked to \ntake less in your job or pay more for your health care or lose your \npension, it is time to fix that. It is time to make you a priority.\n  That is what this budget does. It makes the people who work hard \nevery day, who make this country run--the middle class, the people \nworking hard every day to get into that middle class, who keep the \neconomic engine of this country going--it makes them the priority. That \nis what this is all about. It is about whose interests are going to be \nrepresented in this budget.\n  I am very proud of the fact we are representing the interests of the \nmajority of Americans, the folks who are working hard and seeing the \ngas prices go up along with the oil company profits, who are seeing \ntheir health care costs go up, maybe losing their pension, seeing the \ncost of college go up for their kids. Everything is going up and up and \nup and up. Those are the folks whose pockets we want to put money back \ninto. That is where we want the tax cuts to go. That is where we want \nthe tax cuts to go. That is where we want the investments in the future \nto go. That is what this budget resolution does.\n  I am very proud of the fact that we return fiscal discipline and we \nput middle-class families first. It is about time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, last Friday GEN John Abizaid handed over the \njob of Commander of the U.S. Central Command to ADM William J. Fallon \nand officially entered retired life, a civilian citizen for the first \ntime in more than 30 years.\n  General Abizaid entered the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant after \ngraduating from West Point in 1973. General Abizaid is among the elite \nof the Army's infantry commanders--an Airborne Ranger. Over his time in \nthe military, he led paratroopers in several key units of the 82nd \nAirborne Division, including the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment and \nthe 325th Airborne. In command of a Ranger Rifle Company, he was one of \nthe first commanders on the ground during the invasion of Grenada. He \ndeployed to Kurdistan during the first gulf crisis, was Commandant of \nWest Point, Division Commander of the Big Red One, Deputy Commander of \nCentral Command during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and took over as \nCommander of Central Command in 2003.\n  What most has distinguished General Abizaid is his combined ability \nas both a warrior and as one of our Nation's great strategic thinkers \nregarding the Middle East. He knows and understands the Middle East and \nits strategic implications for American security. As a young officer, \nJohn Abizaid\n\n[[Page S3341]]\n\nlearned fluent Arabic, served as an Olmsted Scholar in Jordan, served \nwith the United Nations Observer Group Lebanon, and conducted strategic \nresearch at Harvard and Stanford Universities. In his generation, there \nwere few officers with this combined set of skills and experiences, and \nhe served as a role model to those who now protect America's interests \nand fight for security in the Middle East. In the next generation of \nofficers in the years to come, we will need hundreds, if not thousands, \nmore like him.\n  I am especially pleased that General Abizaid has chosen to return to \nnear where he grew up by making his new civilian residence in my great \nState of Nevada. General Abizaid has said that after retirement he \nwould like to continue to examine how best to reform the national \nsecurity apparatus of our Government to better address the ``long war'' \nthat he believes we are fighting against violent extremism, to empower \nmoderates in the region, and to rebuild the power, influence and \nsecurity of the United States. He has said he may even write a book on \nthese subjects, and I would hope he would do so. He has served the \nNation ably and honorably over the last several decades, and while I \nwish him his fair share of peace, quiet, rest and relaxation not far \nfrom the shores of Lake Tahoe, I believe he has years of additional \nservice to the Nation ahead of him. We owe General Abizaid our thanks \nand our deep gratitude, and I look forward to working with him in his \nnew chapter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3341-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BOB FERRARO RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the longest \nserving current elected official in southern Nevada, Boulder City, NV--\nMayor Robert Stanley ``Bob'' Ferraro. Later this spring, Bob will \nretire after 31 years of dedicated public service.\n  For three decades, Bob has been a civic leader, kind neighbor, and \nlevelheaded voice in the politically active and dynamic community he \nhas called home since 1970. For 17 years, Bob served on the Boulder \nCity Council. Later, he was elevated to serve the city as its mayor. In \n1999, he became the first mayor directly elected by the people of \nBoulder City. During each campaign, he proudly knocked on every door in \ntown--a feat he accomplished seven times.\n  During his time in public service, Bob has presided over Boulder City \nin an era of unprecedented growth, expanding from 7,800 residents in \n1976 to more than 15,000 today. The community Bob calls home is one of \nthose unique places in America that has managed to maintain its \ndistinctive identity in the face of massive change. Throughout the last \nthree decades of unparalleled growth in southern Nevada, Bob Ferraro \nhas stood alongside Boulder City residents to fiercely defend limited \ngrowth policies that have preserved this special place.\n  Located just 20 miles from Las Vegas, Boulder City was built by the \nBureau of Reclamation during the Great Depression as a housing complex \nfor workers building nearby Hoover Dam. While the original residents \nflocked to Boulder City seeking opportunity, modern times have seen \ngenerations of families choosing to reside in this city on the shore of \nLake Mead for its superb quality of life, access to outdoor recreation, \nand sense of community.\n  This sense of community can be attributed, in part, to Bob's hard \nwork. As mayor, Bob encouraged the development of parks and recreation \nareas throughout Boulder City. These parks affect the lives of all \nresidents, young and old. From youth sports leagues to adult \nrecreational programs, Boulder City's park system has allowed all \nresidents to continue to enjoy the smalltown feel that makes this city \nunique.\n  Throughout his time serving the Boulder City community, Bob never \nforgot that he was a part of the community. He is a past President of \nthe Boulder City Rotary Club and was named the 1980 Rotarian of the \nYear. He also served as president of the Nevada League of Cities in \n1985 and was named Nevada Public Official of the Year in 1986.\n  His leadership, sincerity, and poise will be missed. I am honored to \npay tribute to Bob Ferraro as he prepares to complete his distinguished \nservice to Boulder City and Nevada. I wish him and his wife Connie, his \nthree children, and eight grandchildren much happiness for the future. \nSouthern Nevada is truly a better place because of Bob.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3341-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3341-S3346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA MEDICARE WAGE INDEX\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for a considerable period of time, there \nhave been a number of counties in Pennsylvania that have been suffering \nfrom low Medicare reimbursements, which has caused them great \ndisadvantage in comparison to surrounding areas. I refer specifically \nto Luzerne, Lackawanna, Wyoming, Lycoming, and Columbia in northeastern \nPennsylvania, and there are open disadvantaged counties elsewhere in \nPennsylvania. Those counties are surrounded by MSAs, metropolitan \nstatistical areas, with higher Medicare reimbursements in Newark, and \nNew York, to the east; in Allentown to the southeast; and in Harrisburg \nto the southwest. As a result, a flight of very necessary medical \npersonnel has occurred as northeast Pennsylvania hospitals are not able \nto provide employees with adequate competitive wages.\n  Further complicating this issue are the exceptions to the Medicare \nwage index regulations. Since 1987, exceptions have been created to the \nwage index program for rural facilities, new facilities, and others. In \nfact, in 1999, Congress passed legislative reclassifications for \nspecific hospitals to allow selected facilities to move to a new MSA \nand receive greater Medicare reimbursement. While these \nreclassifications have improved funding for those hospitals, hospitals \nthat did not receive improved funding are being further disadvantaged.\n  It has also come to my attention that inpatient rehabilitation \nfacilities are not provided an opportunity to obtain equitable Medicare \nreimbursement. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities receive adjustments \nin their Medicare reimbursement due to geographic disadvantages within \nthe Medicare inpatient prospective payment system. This is based on \ninformation gathered from other acute care facilities in the MSA, not \nfrom their own wage information. Thus, inpatient rehabilitation \nfacilities cannot apply for reclassification to another MSA that \nreflects their actual labor costs. As such, the facilities are \nprevented from being eligible for increased funding to assist with \nwages like acute care facilities, while being forced to compete for \nemployees with those facilities that have had access to increased \nfunding.\n  I have worked to find a solution to the Medicare wage index disparity \nin reimbursement for a number of years. During the conference for the \nfiscal year 2002 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations bill, the conferees agreed that there should be relief \nfor these areas in Pennsylvania that were surrounded by areas with \nhigher MSA ratings. However, at the last minute, there was an objection \nto including language in the conference report.\n  To correct this problem I, along with Representatives Sherwood and \nEnglish, brought the matter forward in the fiscal year 2002 \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The language was included in the \nHouse version of the bill, and I filed an amendment to Senate bill. \nDuring conference negotiations my amendment was defeated and the \nprovisions were not included.\n  As part of the fiscal year 2004 Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation appropriations bill, $7 million was provided for hospitals in \nnortheast Pennsylvania that continued to be disadvantaged by the \nMedicare area wage index reclassification. The funding was provided as \ntemporary assistance for those facilities.\n  During the consideration of the Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003, I met with Finance \nCommittee chairman, Charles Grassley, and ranking member Max Baucus \nabout the bill provisions, including the need for a solution to the \nMedicare area wage index reclassification problem in Pennsylvania. \nThereafter, section 508 was included in the bill, which provides $300 \nmillion per year for 3 years to increase funding for hospitals \nnationally to be reclassified to locations with higher Medicare \nreimbursement rates. The temporary program, which began in April 2004 \nand\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\nwas scheduled to expire March 31, 2007, has and will provide \nPennsylvania hospitals $69 million over that time, or $23 million per \nyear.\n  On September 29, 2006, I introduced the Hospital Payment Improvement \nand Equity Act to extend the section 508 Medicare wage index program \nfor 3 more years until March 31, 2010. This legislation would have also \nexpanded the eligibility of the program to include inpatient \nrehabilitation facilities and facilities that qualified for the program \nbut did not receive assistance due to inadequate funding.\n  As part of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act, which was signed into \nlaw on December 20, 2006, an extension of the section 508 Medicare wage \nindex program was included. This will provide 14 Pennsylvania hospitals \nan additional $18.4 million for 6 more months until September 30, 2007.\n\n  On February 21, 2007, I visited Moses Taylor Hospital in Scranton, \nPA, and met with representatives of northeast Pennsylvania hospitals \naffected by this issue. I went over with them the situation that had \noccurred and asked that they submit memoranda or letters outlining \ntheir hospitals' extreme plight, which I could then share with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and have printed in the Congressional Record \nfor everyone to see.\n  A letter prepared by Harold Anderson, president & CEO of Moses Taylor \nHospital, Scranton, PA, pointed out the following:\n\n       Health care facilities in our area are especially \n     disadvantaged in that we must compete for specialized, \n     skilled health care labor in a geographic market that \n     includes easy access to Philadelphia, Allentown, and \n     Stroudsburg, three geographic areas in which the Wage Index \n     reimbursement for acute care hospitals is higher than that \n     found in NEPA [Northeast Pennsylvania].\n\n  He goes on to write:\n\n       Considering the relative scarcity and high demand for a \n     highly skilled work force, such as nurses, pharmacists, \n     imaging technologists, etc., the out-migration to the \n     adjacent MSAs is further exacerbated in that NEPA hospitals \n     are forced to pay higher salary and wage rates, which are not \n     fully compensated by the Medicare reimbursements. As just one \n     example, the starting salary for Registered Nurses has \n     increased by more than 18% over the past three years.\n\n  Regis Cabonor, president & CEO of Bloomsburg Hospital, Bloomsburg, \nPA, wrote on February 26 as follows:\n\n       The significant volume of services provided to Medicare \n     beneficiaries renders the Hospital largely dependant upon \n     Medicare reimbursement to cover the cost of direct patient \n     care. . .\n\n  He also states:\n\n       Without the additional reimbursement provided by this [508 \n     wage index] reclassification, our hospital would not be able \n     to attract and retain qualified clinical staff, forcing staff \n     and our patients to travel to the next closest facility for \n     work and care.\n\n  Similar concerns were expressed in a memorandum from Jim May, \npresident & CEO of Mercy Health Partners, Scranton, PA, pointing out \nthat:\n\n       The 508 reclass funding has enhanced our ability to compete \n     with our adjacent CBSA's [Core-Based Statistical Area] for \n     registered nurses, technicians, and other medical \n     professionals. Over a three year span we have reduced our \n     registered nurse vacancy rate from 12.2% to 4.5%. \n     Significantly, we have cut our spending for contract agency \n     nurses in half. We believe that reducing those expenses has \n     contributed toward improved care management and quality for \n     our patients.\n\n  Mary Theresa Vautrinot, President & CEO of Marian Community Hospital, \nCarbondale, PA, noted that Marian Community Hospital is the largest \nemployer in the Carbondale area. The hospital serves a large Medicare \npopulation who would have difficulty accessing health care if not for \nthe hospital, which struggles to find physicians to staff the facility. \nShe notes that, without the 508 wage index funding, the hospital may \nnot be financially viable.\n  Similar concerns were noted by the Community Medical Center \nHealthcare System of Scranton, PA. John Nillson, interim president and \nCEO, stated in his letter that:\n\n       The dramatic differential in Medicare payments between our \n     MSA and the surrounding MSA's will continue to have a \n     negative impact. . .\n\n  Further:\n\n       . . . the nursing shortage has intensified and when \n     combined with other skilled labor shortages, has resulted in \n     a highly competitive environment for these skilled \n     caregivers. As a result, it remains difficult to recruit and \n     retain healthcare professionals.\n\n  John Wiercinski, chief administrative officer, Geisinger South \nWilkes-Barre, Wilkes-Barre, PA, and Lissa Bryan-Smith, chief \nadministrative office, Geisinger Wyoming Valley, Wilkes-Barre, PA, \nnoted that:\n\n       Due in large part to the Section 508 legislation, nurse \n     vacancy rates have decreased significantly at both hospitals.\n\n  James Edwards, president & CEO, of the Greater Hazelton Health \nAlliance, which is made up by Hazelton General Hospital and Hazelton--\nSt. Joseph Medical Center, Hazelton, PA, submitted a memorandum that \nsimilarly states:\n\n     The monies received through the Section 508 reclassification \n     played a major part in the successful turnaround of our \n     health care system, assuring our community that quality \n     health care services will be available to meet their health \n     needs.\n\n  The Wyoming Valley Health Care System, in a letter from president and \nCEO, Dr. William Host, points out the problems in retaining registered \nnurses:\n\n       Prior to [the Section 508 wage index program], the \n     discrepancy between our reimbursement by Medicare and that of \n     surrounding MSA's was having disastrous effects. Nurses, \n     technologists of all sorts, nurse anesthetists and \n     pharmacists were abandoning northeastern Pennsylvania in \n     droves. Vacancies in these areas were running 14% to 20% and \n     this created a serious threat to quality of care and access.\n\n  Raoul Walsh, president & CEO, Tyler Memorial Hospital in Tunkhannock, \nPA, sent a memorandum that shared this concern:\n\n       If the Section 508 was removed or reduced, the hospital \n     would be forced to eliminate or reduce clinical services . . \n     .\n\n  James Brady, president of Allied Services, of Clarks Summit, PA, an \ninpatient rehabilitation facility which did not qualify under the \nsection 508 wage index program, shared that as a result of not \nreceiving funding they have been forced to employ international nurses \nto fill 13 of the 30 open nursing positions.\n  Neal Bisno, secretary treasurer, Service Employees International \nUnion, district 1199P, which has a number of northeast Pennsylvania \nhospital employees as members, addressed the issue from the workforce \nperspective, stating:\n\n  A permanent solution is needed [to the Medicare wage index program \nproblems] in order to maintain a stable, well-trained health care work \nforce in area hospitals and guarantee continued access to quality \nhealth care services in Wilkes Barre/Scranton region.\n\n  Denise Cesare, president & CEO, Blue Cross of Northeastern \nPennsylvania, in a memorandum dated February 26, 2007, notes:\n\n       Due to their current Medicare Wage Index classification, \n     hospitals in the northeast and north central regions receive \n     disproportionately lower reimbursements when compared to \n     similar hospitals that compete with them for services and \n     staff. This reimbursement imbalance drains trained clinical \n     staff, primarily nurses, from the local delivery systems. Our \n     system continues to suffer and decline as medical \n     professionals move to hospitals in neighboring locales \n     because higher Medicare Wage Indexes allow these regions to \n     pay higher salaries.\n\n  On February 24, 2007, the Scranton Times-Tribune published an \neditorial regarding this issue in northeast Pennsylvania. The editorial \nposited that northeast Pennsylvania hospitals are in critical need of \nreform to the Medicare wage index system to end this cycle and cogently \ncaptures the issue:\n\n       Wage rates at regional hospitals are lower than those for \n     large metropolitan areas, resulting in lower Medicare \n     reimbursements, resulting in the inability of many hospitals \n     to significantly increase wages, resulting in lower \n     reimbursements . . . and on it goes.\n\n  Congressional action is needed to reform the Mediare wage index \nsystem and provide a fair reimbursement for hospitals. MedPAC, the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, is scheduled to release a report \nin late June, 2007 that will offer recommendations on reforming the \nwage index system. I encourage Finance Chairman Baucus and Ranking \nMember Grassley to examine these recommendations and move forward with \nimprovements to this system in an expedited fashion. Northeast \nPennsylvania hospitals are in great financial distress. They deserve \nfair treatment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these memoranda, letters, \nand editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\n\n\n\n                                        Moses Taylor Hospital,\n\n                                  Scranton, PA, February 22, 2007.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     310 Spruce Street, Suite 201,\n     Scranton, PA.\n       Dear Senator Specter: The Section 508 funding which Moses \n     Taylor Hospital currently receives amounts to $3.3M in \n     Medicare revenues each year. Given the fact that this funding \n     is scheduled to expire on September 30th, 2007, the loss of \n     the appropriated funds would be devastating not only to Moses \n     Taylor Hospital, but to all of the similarly situated, acute \n     care facilities in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Health care \n     facilities in our area are especially disadvantaged in that \n     we must compete for specialized, skilled health care labor in \n     a geographic market that includes easy access to \n     Philadelphia, Allentown, and Stroudsburg, three geographic \n     areas in which the Wage Index reimbursement for acute care \n     hospitals is higher than that found in NEPA.\n       The original Medicare Wage Index mechanism assumed that \n     highly skilled health care workers would somehow remain in \n     the geographic area most closely located to the acute care \n     facility in which they would work. However, intensive media \n     advertising campaigns, targeted personnel recruitment \n     initiatives, and an excellent interstate highway and turnpike \n     system make it much easier for personnel to travel to the \n     adjacent MSAs in which acute care hospitals receive higher \n     Medicare Wage Index payments and can, therefore, afford to \n     pay higher salaries and wages. [Considering the relative \n     scarcity and high demand for a highly skilled work force, \n     such as nurses, pharmacists, imaging technologists, etc., the \n     out-migration to the adjacent MSAs is further exacerbated in \n     that NEPA hospitals are forced to pay higher salary and wage \n     rates, which are not fully compensated by the Medicare \n     reimbursements. As just one example, the starting salary for \n     Registered Nurses has increased by more than 18% over the \n     past three years.]\n       The lower Medicare reimbursements ultimately impact \n     hospital capital expenditures since the facilities are unable \n     to generate appropriate capital reserves to acquire advanced \n     medical technology and upgrade physical plants. This \n     inability to invest in buildings and equipment has the \n     additional, unfortunate consequence of causing area residents \n     to seek care in adjacent MSAs, often at great expense and \n     logistical difficulties to patients and their families.\n       We certainly hope that the Federal Government will devise a \n     means to address the inadequate wage component of Medicare \n     reimbursements in the long term; however, we urge the \n     extension of the Section 508 adjustments beyond the end of \n     September 2007. Thank you for your continued effort and \n     support regarding this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Harold E. Anderson,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Bloomsburg Hospital,\n\n                                Bloomsburg, PA, February 26, 2007.\n       The Bloomsburg Hospital (the ``Hospital'') is a 52-bed \n     acute care and 20-bed psychiatric care hospital located in \n     Columbia County, Pennsylvania. The Hospital provides \n     healthcare services primarily to patients in Columbia and \n     Montour counties and surrounding communities. The Hospital \n     registers approximately 85,000 patients annually for medical \n     care.\n       The geographic region served by the Hospital has had an \n     average population over 65 years of age of approximately 16% \n     since 1996, as reported by the Pennsylvania State Department \n     of Health. This population is slightly higher than the \n     statewide average of 15.2%. The over 65 population is treated \n     by the Hospital primarily as Medicare beneficiaries.\n       Currently, Medicare beneficiaries account for 25% of total \n     Hospital volumes and 31% of total payments for services. The \n     Medicare population is the single largest payor population of \n     the Hospital.\n       The significant volume of services provided to Medicare \n     beneficiaries renders the Hospital largely dependent upon \n     Medicare reimbursement to cover the cost of direct patient \n     care as well as to defray the ever increasing costs of \n     utilities, professional liability, information technology, \n     facility upgrades and other technology expenditures. All of \n     these expenditures are necessary to continue to provide \n     adequate patient care in a rapidly advancing industry.\n       During fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the Bloomsburg \n     Hospital received approximately $663,000 in additional \n     payments from the Medicare program as a result of the \n     temporary reclassification of Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Area \n     hospitals MSA. Should the reclassification not be extended or \n     made permanent, the Hospital would lose this reimbursement.\n       It is important to note that the largest competitor to our \n     hospital is located only 12 miles from our facility. That \n     hospital is located in Montour County and is therefore \n     included in the Harrisburg MSA (whose reimbursement rates \n     from the Medicare program are consistent with the current \n     rates paid to our hospital since the reclassification). The \n     temporary reclassification of our hospital allowed us to \n     compensate our clinical employees commensurate with our \n     competitor.\n       Without the additional reimbursement provided by this \n     reclassification, our hospital would not be able to attract \n     and retain qualified clinical staff, forcing staff and our \n     patients to travel to the next closest facility for work and \n     care. While this is easily commutable for clinical workers \n     seeking higher wages for comparable work, the same commute is \n     not as manageable for elderly or sickly patients.\n       Without adequate qualified staff to provide medical care at \n     our community hospital, we will be forcing patients to travel \n     further for their care.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Regis P. Cabonor,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Mercy Health Partners,\n\n                                                February 26, 2007.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you for recognizing the severe \n     economic situation that healthcare providers face in \n     Northeastern Pennsylvania and for your tireless efforts in \n     securing the original 508 reclassification and our most \n     current six month extension. I also wanted to offer high \n     praise to your staff, including John Myers and Andy Wallace, \n     for their willingness to work on behalf of the region's \n     hospitals and the thousands of patients they serve.\n       During last week's meeting, you requested specific \n     information about the impact of our reclass. Mercy Hospital \n     in Scranton would lose approximately $6.2 million in the next \n     fiscal year without the ability to maintain our reclass to \n     the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ Core-Based Statistical \n     Area (CBSA). In short, the reclass funding has moved us from \n     losing money to breaking even. Prior to the original 508 \n     reclass, we experienced negative operating margins every year \n     from fiscal year 2000 through 2003. Since 2004, our average \n     operating margin is 0.42%. The loss 508 funding would result \n     in an overall CY2006 operating loss of -5.14 percent.\n       The 508 reclass funding has enhanced our ability to compete \n     with our adjacent CBSA's for registered nurses, technicians, \n     and other medical professionals. Over a three year span we \n     have reduced our registered nurse vacancy rate from 12.2% to \n     4.5%. Significantly, we have cut our spending for contract \n     agency nurses in half. We believe that reducing those \n     expenses has contributed toward improved care management and \n     quality for our patients.\n       We are very proud that since the 508 reclass we have \n     consistently placed in the top 10 percent of hospitals \n     nationwide for the twenty-one quality measures set by the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services. We \n     performed at the 96th percentile on the nationally recognized \n     HHS quality measures in 2006.\n       In addition, we are one of 27 hospitals nationally \n     recognized by Solucient as a top 100 hospitals for \n     cardiovascular care in the past three consecutive years. \n     Furthermore, Mercy is one of 3 Pennsylvania hospitals \n     certified in both cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation \n     by the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary \n     Rehabilitation.\n       We believe that you agree that our mission demands \n     delivering world-class care to our community. Elimination of \n     the 508 funding would force us to consider staff and service \n     reductions to cope with the substantial loss of revenue.\n       On behalf of our patients, our community, our employees and \n     our physicians, Mercy implores the honorable members of the \n     United States Congress to move towards fair and permanent \n     reforms of the Medicare wage index and extend the 508 \n     reclassification until these reforms take effect. Please \n     contact me at (570) 348-7012 if I can provide further \n     information or be of service.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James E. May,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 26, 2007.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you and your staff, including \n     John Myers and Andy Wallace, for your continued support of \n     the Section 508 Wage Index reclassification for the hospitals \n     in Northeastern Pennsylvania. This issue is paramount to the \n     survival of Marian Community Hospital and the Maxis Health \n     System.\n       Marian Community Hospital is a 104-bed acute care hospital \n     located in Carbondale, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania. The \n     Hospital is the largest component of the Maxis Health System. \n     With its 470 employees, Marian Community is the largest \n     employer in the Greater Carbondale Area, contributing \n     $15,000,000 annually to the local economy. Our hospital \n     serves a predominantly Medicare and Medical Assistance \n     population who would have considerable difficulty accessing \n     healthcare if this hospital were not here. Because of \n     Carbondale's proximity to Scranton (we are located 20 miles \n     north of Scranton) and its three large hospitals, we \n     continually encountered significant difficulty recruiting key \n     health care professionals such as nurses and technologists. \n     Because of our relatively small size, and location, we also \n     struggle to attract physicians to practice here.\n       The Section 508 reclass has added approximately $1 million \n     to Marian Community Hospital's annual Medicare reimbursement. \n     These funds have allowed us to compete with the other larger \n     hospitals to attract critical staff because we are able to \n     offer more competitive salaries than would be possible absent \n     the 508 reclassification. In addition, we have been able to \n     recruit much needed physicians to the area. While $1 million \n     does not\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\n     appear to be a significant amount of money to many hospitals, \n     it represents 3% of our annual net revenue from all sources \n     and 8% of our total annual Medicare payments.\n       In 2006, Marian Community Hospital initiated an aggressive \n     restructuring plan to return the organization to \n     profitability. Although this is a difficult task, we are \n     making progress. If we lose the funds provided through the \n     Section 508 reclassification, it would be necessary for the \n     hospital to take drastic steps to remain financially viable, \n     such as cutting services or significantly reducing our staff. \n     The results of losing the 508 classification would have a \n     detrimental impact on the patients we serve and the community \n     in which we operate.\n       Your efforts to extend the Section 508 reclassification and \n     to find an equitable solution to the wage index issue are \n     greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                       Mary Theresa Vautrinot,\n\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer,\n     Maxis Health System.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Community Medical Center\n\n\n                                            Healthcare System,\n\n                                  Scranton, PA, February 23, 2007.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing to you today relative to \n     the Wage Index. I strongly support your initiative to \n     maintain the Medicare Wage Index reclassification of the \n     hospitals located in Lackawanna County to the Newburgh, NY-PA \n     MSA for the purposes of calculating reimbursement. As Interim \n     President and CEO of Community Medical Center Healthcare \n     System, this critical issue still remains at the forefront of \n     Healthcare in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and I encourage you \n     to continue your efforts of working to find a permanent \n     solution.\n       The dramatic differential in Medicare payments between our \n     MSA and the surrounding MSA's will continue to have a \n     negative impact on our healthcare infrastructure if this \n     temporary fix is not extended. The financial impact for CMC \n     is projected to be $5.6 million for Fiscal Year 2008. As you \n     are aware, the nursing shortage has intensified and when \n     combined with other skilled labor shortages, has resulted in \n     a highly competitive environment for these skilled \n     caregivers. As a result, it remains difficult to recruit and \n     retain healthcare professionals.\n       Since healthcare represents a major capital asset, the \n     failure to maintain the temporary fix would have a \n     significantly adverse effect on every member of our \n     community. Recognizing this potential crisis and continuing \n     the wage index would go a long way toward assuring that \n     northeastern Pennsylvania will have healthcare resources \n     available.\n       Thank you for your consideration. I ask for your continuing \n     support and attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Nilsson,\n     Interim President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  memo\n\n     Date: February 27, 2007.\n     To: Senator Arlen Specter.\n     From: John Wiercinski and Lissa Bryan-Smith.\n     Re Medicare Wage Index/Section 508.\n\n       Sen. Specter--Thank you very much for your recent visit to \n     Northeastern Pennsylvania and your continued interest in and \n     support of the Medicare Wage Index/Section 508 legislation.\n       The continuation of this important legislation--and a \n     permanent fix to the Medicare Wage Index for Northeastern \n     Pennsylvania hospitals--is imperative not only to Geisinger \n     South Wilkes-Barre Hospital and Geisinger Wyoming Valley \n     Medical Center, but also to the people we serve.\n       The positive financial impact to both Geisinger hospitals \n     in the Wilkes-Barre area is approximately $8 million. Above \n     all, these dollars allow Geisinger to continue to invest in \n     our workforce so we can effectively recruit and retain the \n     best and the brightest healthcare professionals and keep them \n     here in our community caring for patients. Due in large part \n     to the Section 508 legislation, nurse vacancy rates have \n     decreased significantly at both hospitals.\n       The Section 508 funding also helps to ensure that our \n     employees at Geisinger South Wilkes-Barre and Geisinger \n     Wyoming Valley are able to utilize the latest technological \n     advances; for example, 64 Slice CT Scanning, Stereotactic \n     Linear Accelerators and Computer Assisted Surgical Equipment.\n       As major employers, hospitals have a significant impact on \n     the local economy. Studies have shown that every dollar of \n     expenditures by hospitals results in approximately two \n     dollars of additional spending to local businesses. This \n     positive economic impact is important for everyone in our \n     area.\n       Thank you, again, Senator Specter, for your support.\n                                  ____\n\n         Greater Hazleton Health Alliance, Hazleton General \n           Hospital, Hazleton-Saint Joseph Medical Center.\n       In March 2004, the Greater Hazleton Health Alliance (GHHA) \n     and its affiliated hospitals (Hazleton General Hospital and \n     Hazleton-Saint Joseph Medical Center) were notified of their \n     three-year temporary reclassification into the Lancaster MSA. \n     This reclassification could not have come at a better time, \n     bringing in approximately $3 million per year between April \n     2004 and March 2007, and having a major impact on health care \n     in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and the surrounding communities. \n     Without this reclassification, GHHA hospitals were headed to \n     possible bankruptcy or sale.\n       The monies received through the Section 508 \n     reclassification played a major part in the successful \n     turnaround of our health care system, assuring our community \n     that quality health care services will be available to meet \n     their health needs.\n       As background, in 1996, Hazleton's two hospitals, Hazleton \n     General Hospital (HGH) and Hazleton-Saint Joseph Medical \n     Center (HSJ), reached a management agreement that formed the \n     Greater Hazleton Health Alliance, an effort to expand the \n     offerings of area health care as well as to carefully steward \n     community healthcare resources.\n       Some initial savings were created through the formation of \n     the Alliance and local decision-making became far more \n     coordinated. However, with downward pressure on reimbursement \n     and intensified competitive pressure locally, as well as from \n     neighboring regions, GHHA began facing significant strain in \n     2003. As such:\n       Financial performance of both hospitals had deteriorated \n     significantly eroding cash reserves. On a combined basis, \n     operating losses were approximately $3.3 million in 2002; \n     $6.2 million in 2003; and $2.3 million in 2004.\n       Important capital investments in facilities, equipment and \n     information technology had not been made in nearly a decade.\n       Physician relationships were badly suffering. A loss of \n     confidence and trust in leadership, as well as a growing \n     perception that the quality of hospital care was \n     deteriorating, were causing the local medical community to \n     begin withdrawing public support and patient referrals.\n       Negative public perceptions of GHHA were increasing in \n     Hazleton and the surrounding region.\n       Staff were accepting positions in surrounding communities, \n     in other MSAs with higher wage indices. HGH is only two miles \n     away from an MSA with significantly higher wage indices.\n       Employee morale was at an all-time low and union \n     negotiations had become contentious.\n       In fall 2003, the Board of GHHA made a tough decision to \n     seek the help of outside experts to assist with stabilization \n     and turnaround and to advise the organization on long-term \n     strategic positioning. A three-year Financial Recovery and \n     Turnaround Plan was developed. Had it not been for the \n     additional monies received as a result of the MSA \n     reclassification, GHHA may not have been able to successfully \n     effect a financial turnaround.\n       Below are just some of the GHHA's accomplishments since \n     2004.\n       Implementation of a new business model that resulted in a \n     financial turnaround allowing us to be profitable for the \n     last two years.\n       Adjustments of pay scales to market rates making GHHA \n     hospitals competitive in recruitment and retention of highly \n     qualified staff with surrounding communities in other MSAs.\n       Made strategic capital investments in equipment and \n     physical plant approximating $18,000,000 including: expansion \n     of HGH's physical plant to include an annex building to house \n     non-clinical services allowing for expansion of the \n     hospital's first floor; renovation of most of the first floor \n     including expansion of the surgical suite/recovery unit and \n     doubling the size of the emergency department; development of \n     a brand new short procedure unit and a new step-down unit; \n     renovation to the endoscopy unit and patient floors.\n       Investment in new state-of-the-art equipment and \n     technology. A $3-$4 million project is currently underway to \n     replace our entire information system, preparing us for the \n     electronic medical record.\n       Consolidation of inpatient beds and Emergency Services at \n     HGH to reduce duplicative operating and capital costs.\n       Surrender of the HSJ acute care license.\n       Commitment to deliver outstanding customer service and \n     expansion of our quality improvement program. Patient safety \n     and clinical care initiatives were implemented, a high-\n     quality professional radiology group was retained, and a \n     relationship was formed with Lehigh Valley Medical Center, a \n     tertiary center in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to staff our \n     Emergency Department with quality, emergency credentialed \n     physicians.\n       Increased volumes by enhancing quality and expanding \n     community outreach, initiating a staffing productivity \n     program, and holding the line on expenses.\n       The hard work and collaboration of the GHHA management team \n     brought about a renewed energy and positive momentum that \n     continue today. The financial picture of the organization has \n     changed dramatically, thanks in large part to the temporary \n     reclassification to the Lancaster MSA. However, should GHHA \n     have to revert back to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton MSA as is \n     now set for October 2007, the resulting financial loss of $3 \n     million per year would, without question, hamper our ability \n     to recruit and retain quality health professionals and \n     continue in our quality improvement and turnaround processes. \n     The real losers would be the communities we serve.\n                                                 James D.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Your unrelenting attention to the \n     Medicare Wage index issue confronting northeastern \n     Pennsylvania is deeply appreciated by the Wyoming Valley \n     Healthcare System, its 3200 associates and the \n     disproportionately blue collar Medicare population we serve. \n     Due in great measure to your efforts, Section 508 of the \n     Medicare D legislation temporarily re-classified our MSA to \n     the Lehigh Valley. Prior to that event, the discrepancy \n     between our reimbursement by Medicare and that of surrounding \n     MSA's was having disastrous effects. Nurses, technologists of \n     all sorts, nurse anesthetists and pharmacists were abandoning \n     northeastern Pennsylvania in droves. Vacancies in these areas \n     were running 14% to 20% and this created a serious threat to \n     quality of care and access. The negative impact on the \n     regional economy was another serious matter.\n       After the temporary repair, changes were dramatic. All the \n     institutions spent the money as intended--90% to improve \n     employee wages and benefits and 10% for capital equipment \n     they need to do their work with quality and efficiency. \n     Vacancies are now down to 1-2%. Morale is greatly improved \n     while quality of care and access are preserved.\n       We are now faced with a deadline of September 30, 2007 to \n     achieve either another extension or a permanent repair. \n     Failure to do so will mean a loss of $8.5 million to WVHCS, a \n     serious decrease in our ability sustain access, a threat to \n     quality of care, a serious departure from our 135 year \n     history of bringing the best in personnel and technology to \n     bear on the health of citizens in our region, and all the \n     associated adverse effects on our economy.\n       Thank you, Senator, for all your past and current efforts. \n     If there is anything we can do to enhance your prospects of \n     success in this matter, please do not hesitate to communicate \n     that to us.\n           Sincerely and respectfully,\n                                                  William R.

The Hospital \n     consists largely of a Medicare and Medicaid population \n     supporting the infrastructure. The hospital would lose \n     approximately $400,000 on a hospital budget of nearly \n     $26,000,000. If the Medicare Section 508 was removed or \n     reduced, the hospital would be forced to eliminate or reduce \n     clinical services, forego salary increases for a period, or \n     some combination thereof to create a solution.\n       Please note that Tyler is 28 miles from Scranton and \n     Wilkes-Barre with less than ideal driving arrangements. \n     Elderly patients don't like to travel great distances for \n     routine care and they may have to if this comes to pass.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Raoul M.

I thought we would be a good resource for what \n     could have happened to all the acute care hospitals if they \n     did not get the wage index adjustment. Perhaps our data will \n     be useful in demonstrating how important the adjustment is to \n     our health care region.\n       These numbers are the totals for the approximate 3\\1/2\\ \n     year period.\n       Additional Wage Index Revenue Not Received--$16 million.\n       Over and beyond expenses normally needed for recruitment \n     and filling vacancies: Contract Labor--$3.5 million; \n     Recruitment--$1 million; Advertising-- $1.5 million; Sign-on \n     Bonus--$1 million; Overtime--$1.5 million.\n       Total additional expenses--$8.5 million.\n       Total effect of not getting wage index adjustment on Allied \n     was $24.5 million.\n       The wage index affects all employees but this is our \n     nursing staff data. Allied Services had 23 position openings \n     3\\1/2\\ years ago. Today we have 17 openings but would have 30 \n     if we did not recruit 13 nurses from the Republic of the \n     Philippines.\n       I hope this data helps to support the need for the wage \n     index adjustment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James L. Brady,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Service Employees International Union, Pennsylvania's \n           Health Care Union,\n                                                    March 2, 2007.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you for your willingness to \n     work on behalf of the region's hospitals, hospital employees \n     and the thousands of area patients. We appreciate your \n     efforts in securing the original 508 reclassification and our \n     most current six-month extension.\n       In our region and across the country, at a time when more \n     patients are struggling to access the health care they need, \n     nurses--the central providers of that care--are leaving the \n     bedside in large numbers as a result of poor working \n     conditions and low wages. However, a recent study published \n     by the Institute for Women's Policy Research, ``Solving the \n     Nursing Shortage through Higher Wages'' found that increasing \n     pay for nurses is a direct way to draw both currently \n     qualified and aspiring nurses to hospital employment. \n     Hospitals that offer higher wages are able to attract more \n     nurses, leading to more adequate staffing and improved \n     patient care.\n       As you know, our area hospitals operate with restricted \n     budgets, low operating margin and financial instability. Our \n     hospitals in the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area are heavily \n     dependent on Medicare. Yet, we have found that the temporary \n     reclassification, access to more appropriate Medicare \n     reimbursements, has had direct impact on region's health care \n     workforce. Area nurses and hospital workers have shared in \n     the benefits of increased Medicare funding. For example, in \n     their most recent contract settled in late 2005, SEIU 1199P \n     RNs at Geisinger South Wilkes-Barre (formerly Mercy Hospital \n     Wilkes-Barre) increased wages an average of 13% in the first \n     year of the contract and 31% by 2010. SElU 1199P RNs at \n     Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre \n     negotiated comparable wage rates in their negotiations in \n     January 2006. We directly attribute these advances to two \n     factors: the improve Medicare reimbursement and high union \n     density in the Wilkes-Barre market. Area nurses used their \n     collective bargaining strength to hold hospitals accountable \n     to investing the additional reimbursements into increasing \n     nurse wages. These increased wages not only significantly \n     enhancing nurse retention and recruitment but also improve \n     the quality of care at area hospitals.\n       While section 508 was tremendously helpful to our area \n     hospitals, currently this assistance is temporary. Section \n     508 reclassified our hospitals for only three years. Without \n     congressional action to extend section 508, these \n     reclassifications will expire in March 2007. A permanent \n     solution is needed in order to maintain a stable, well-\n     trained health care workforce in area hospitals and guarantee \n     continued access to quality health care services in Wilkes \n     Barre/Scranton region. Retaining and strengthening the ranks \n     of a qualified, dedicated professional health care workforce \n     is essential to strengthening our region's health care \n     system.\n       On behalf of our members, our families and the patients we \n     serve, SEIU District 1199P urges the United States Congress \n     to move toward fair and permanent reforms of the Medicare \n     wage index and extend the 508 reclassification until these \n     reforms take effect. Please contact me at (717) 238-3030, \n     ext. 1020 if I can provide further information or be of \n     service.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Neal Bisno,\n     Secretary Treasurer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      BlueCross of\n\n\n                                    Northeastern Pennsylvania,\n\n                              Wilkes-Barre, PA, February 26, 2007.\n       Hon. Arlen Specter: The following is submitted on behalf of \n     Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania (BCNEPA) in support \n     of our hospital partners throughout the northeast and north \n     central regions as we collectively strive to address the \n     impacts of Medicare Wage Index funding shortfalls.\n       Across Pennsylvania, hospitals have been struggling to \n     achieve positive results for many years. Although we have \n     seen some positive changes in our region in recent years in \n     terms of financial results, the situation remains critical as \n     evidenced by the following:\n       Only 9 of the 22 hospitals in our region had a positive 3 \n     Year Average Total Margin.\n       Of the 9, only 4 hospitals had a 3 Year Average Total \n     Margin of 4 percent or greater, which is commonly accepted as \n     an industry benchmark for acceptable performance.\n       In Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties, only 1 hospital had a \n     positive 3 Year Average Total Margin and that margin was less \n     than 4 percent.\n       Hospitals in our region are heavily dependent on Medicare. \n     In aggregate, approximately 44 percent of our regional \n     hospitals' revenue comes from Medicare. In Lackawanna and \n     Luzerne Counties, 48 percent of the hospitals' revenue comes \n     from Medicare. The hospitals' next closest payer to Medicare \n     is the Blues at 23 percent. As the second largest payer in \n     our region, BCNEPA--and unfortunately our ratepayers--will \n     continue to be negatively affected as Medicare reimbursement \n     falls short.\n       The overall financial struggle for hospitals in our region, \n     coupled with the high rate of Medicare dependency, make the \n     current Medicare Wage Index situation a critical one for our \n     facilities. Due to their current Medicare Wage Index \n     classification, hospitals in the northeast and north central \n     regions receive disproportionately lower reimbursements when \n     compared to similar hospitals that compete with them for \n     services and staff. This reimbursement imbalance drains\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\n     trained clinical staff, primarily nurses, from the local \n     delivery systems. Our system continues to suffer and decline \n     as medical professionals move to hospitals in neighboring \n     locales because higher Medicare Wage Indexes allow these \n     regions to pay higher salaries.\n       Our region has been fortunate, through the leadership of \n     Senator Arlen Specter and others, to have benefited from \n     temporary Section 508 funding adjustments over the past \n     several years. These adjustments have been a temporary yet \n     critical funding source for our area hospitals. The loss of \n     these funds will represent at least a $35 million financial \n     loss for area facilities, a loss that cannot be absorbed by \n     commercial insurers and their customers.\n       We are therefore asking for consideration of a more \n     permanent solution to the current calculation of Medicare \n     Wage Index reimbursement for facilities in the northeast and \n     north central regions of Pennsylvania.\n                                                 Denise S. Cesare,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Scranton Times Tribune, Feb. 24, 2007]\n\n                    Resolve Funding for Quality Care\n\n       Hospitals in Northeastern Pennsylvania face the same \n     economic pressures as hospitals everywhere else--and then \n     some. Here, hospitals also face a vicious cycle involving \n     Medicare funding that threatens the financial well-being of \n     regional hospitals and, therefore, access to quality health \n     care for hundreds of thousands of regional residents.\n       Wage rates at regional hospitals are lower than those for \n     larger metropolitan areas, resulting in lower Medicare \n     reimbursements, resulting in the inability of many hospitals \n     to significantly increase wages, resulting in lower \n     reimbursements . . . and on it goes. The low reimbursement \n     issue is particularly difficult for hospitals in this region \n     because the relatively high average age here means that \n     regional hospitals have a higher percentage of Medicare \n     patients than do hospitals in other parts of the country. \n     Thus, they treat more Medicare patients for less money.\n       Since 2004, the hospitals have done somewhat better because \n     of a temporary fix authorized by Congress, under which \n     indexes from nearby metropolitan areas have been applied to \n     the regional hospitals. That measure is due to expire in June \n     and, without an extension, 13 regional hospitals will return \n     to the standard reimbursement formula and lose $35 million a \n     year.\n       According to several local hospital administrators who met \n     with Sen. Arlen Specter on the issue this week, they have \n     been able to reduce nursing shortages through better pay and \n     otherwise shore up their operations since Congress' action in \n     2004.\n       Nationwide, about 80 hospitals are in the same position as \n     those in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Mr. Specter and Sen. Bob \n     Casey, along with Reps. Paul Kanjorski and Chris Carney, \n     should work with their colleagues from the other regions with \n     unrealistic reimbursement rates, in order to permanently set \n     fair rates that ensure access to quality care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3346-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Dustin Gould\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime to remember a Coloradan who was lost to us in Iraq last week. \nMarine Corps SSgt Dustin Michael Gould--7th Engineer Support Battalion, \n1st Marine Logistics Group, I Marine Expeditionary Force--was in his \nfourth tour in Iraq when he was taken from this life, at the age of 28.\n  Sergeant Gould was a unique man, with a unique job in Iraq: he was an \nexplosives ordnance demolition technician--a marine who disarmed bombs. \nIn a country whose fabric is strained almost daily with bomb attacks, \nSergeant Gould was there to help prevent them, literally working to \ndefuse violence that threatened his fellow marines and Iraqis alike.\n  Dustin Gould grew up in several towns in Colorado and attended \nBerthoud High School in Longmont, which he graduated in 1997. He chose \nto serve his Nation in the Marine Corps because of their elite status.\n  During his service to this Nation, the Marine Corps estimates that \nStaff Sergeant Gould neutralized more than a million pounds of \nexplosives, explosives that could have killed untold numbers of \nmarines. Every time Dustin Gould went to work, he saved lives. That, \ntruly, is the definition of heroism.\n  With all of this talk of military service, we should not lose sight \nof the man. Dustin Gould loved the outdoors and spent his spare time as \na young man there with his father. He was respectful and thoughtful, a \nnatural leader who never hesitated to lend a hand to a friend in need.\n  GEN Douglas MacArthur once said, ``The soldier, above all other \npeople, prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds \nand scars of war.'' Dustin's father David said that Dustin did not \nrelish conflict but was serving his Nation because a higher calling, \nprotecting our freedom and way of life, compelled him to act. He did \nnot seek praise or recognition but instead accomplished his job with \nhumility and courage and in doing so helped others do the same.\n  In the midst of America's Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln wrote \nto the mother of a Union soldier, ``I pray that our Heavenly Father may \nassuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the \ncherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must \nbe yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of \nFreedom.'' We pray now for Dustin, for his wife Elizabeth, and for his \nwhole family. The wounds they suffer from the loss of Dustin are deep \nand painful, and we as a Nation honor their and Dustin's humbling \nsacrifice by never forgetting this fine young man.\n\n\n                        Specialist Blake Harris\n\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to turn its attention to the loss of \na Coloradan in Iraq, Army SPC Blake Harris, of Pueblo, CO. SPC Harris \nwas in the Army's 1st Squadron, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 1st \nCavalry Division. He was only 22 years old, and will be laid to rest \nlater this week.\n  Pueblo, CO, is known as the ``Home of Heroes.'' Pueblo hosts National \nMedal of Honor Day and has had as many as four living Medal of Honor \nrecipients living in the community. In 1953, President Eisenhower joked \nto recipient Raymond G. ``Jerry'' Murphy, ``What is it . . . Something \nin the water out there in Pueblo? All you guys turn out to be heroes.''\n  President Eisenhower was not far off. There is something special in \nPueblo--the brave sons and daughters, like Blake Harris, that have \nanswered the call to service for this Nation and those that have given \nup their lives for the cause of freedom. They are heroes.\n  Unfortunately, we cannot bring back the heroes like Blake Harris. \nAnd, like so many of our Nation's soldiers that have made this ultimate \nsacrifice, Blake Harris was man of great courage and character who had \nhis entire life ahead of him.\n  Blake met his wife Joanna at South High School, and while Blake was \nin Iraq they kept in contact every day. He graduated from South High in \n2002 after spending 3 years in ROTC , and he followed in his father's \nfootsteps by enlisting in the Army. He was in his second tour in Iraq \nand was stationed in Baghdad. Specialist Harris loved his job and was \nlooking to become a career soldier, a man who dedicated his life to the \nservice of his country.\n  After the assassination of American civil rights pioneer the Reverend \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Senator Robert Kennedy reflected upon the \nwords of the Greek poet Aeschylus: ``Even in our sleep, pain which \ncannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until, in our own \ndespair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of \nGod.''\n  To his wife Joanna and their son Jonah and Blake's parents John and \nDeborah, the prayers of our entire Nation are with you, today and \nalways. Each and every American is humbled by the sacrifice made by \nBlake. He served with honor and distinction, and I hope that the pride \nin his service and memories you carry with you will help ease the grief \nyou feel at his loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3346-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3346-S3347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            S.

Con. \nRes. 20, when the Senate considered this and other measures related to \nIraq on March 15, 2007.\n  The Bush administration and the Republican leadership in Congress \nhave been making every effort until recently to avoid any real debate \non Iraq and have, at each and every step of the way, supported the \nfailed stay-the-course strategy by conflating Iraq with the war on \nterrorism and by propagating a false choice concerning Iraq: according \nto their logic, you either support the President or you harm the \ntroops.\n  I firmly reject this false choice, as I rejected the Gregg resolution \nwhich was an attempt to validate that false choice.\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\n  There is no doubt that I and every other Member in this body will do \nall in our power to protect our troops while they are serving so \nbravely in Iraq or wherever else their political leaders decide to send \nthem.

Res. 107, which we voted on prior to the Gregg \nresolution.\n  I would remind our colleagues that I have fought as hard as anyone in \nthe Congress to ensure that our troops have the equipment and resources \nthey need in Iraq--on some occasions over the objections of the \nadministration and their congressional allies, I might add.\n  In 2003, the Army identified $322 million in shortfalls in critical \nhealth and safety gear--ranging from body armor, camelback hydration \nsystems, and com-\nbat helmets to equipment for deactivating high-explosives--all \npriorities that the Rumsfeld Pentagon and Bush administration failed to \nprovide for in their initial budgets. I offered an amendment to the \nemergency appropriations bill to resolve these problems. Unfortunately, \nthe Bush administration opposed this legislation, and the amendment was \ndefeated along party lines with the help of the very same Senators who \nare now claiming to be supporting our troops.\n  In 2004, we tried a different approach--requiring the Department of \nDefense to reimburse military personnel who bought equipment with their \nown funds for military service in Iraq and Afghanistan that the \nRumsfeld Pentagon had failed to provide. This time, despite ardent \nobjections of Secretary Rumsfeld's Pentagon, Congress approved the \nlegislation in October 2004, President Bush signed the bill into law. \nWe approved similar legislation in 2005 to further extend this benefit \nas troops, their families, and their communities continued to dig into \ntheir own pockets to buy needed lifesaving equipment for use on the \nbattlefield.\n  Last year, the difficulties associated with equipment shortfalls \nposed a far more serious problem. I offered an amendment to address a \n$17 billion budget shortfall to replace and repair thousands of war-\nbattered tanks, aircraft, and vehicles. Without these additional \nresources, the Army Chief of Staff claimed that U.S. Army readiness \nwould deteriorate even further.\n  That said, still more remains to be done if the men and women on \nactive duty, in the Reserves and National Guard are to be fully \nequipped and ready to defend our country. We need to make certain that \nour troops have the resources they need to stay ready to fight wherever \nand whenever duty calls. Regrettably, the war in Iraq is actually \ndraining these resources and making us less safe. That is why I am \ngoing to work to continue restocking our troops' equipment inventories \nto restore their readiness and assure their protection.\n  Voting for a resolution expressing support for the troops is not the \nsame as making concrete decisions to actually do so. Making sure they \nare fully equipped and that the mission they have been sent to do is \nachievable is a fundamental part of meaningfully supporting the troops. \nFor me and many others in this body, our vote in support of the Reid \nresolution, S.J. Res 9, was a vote to support our troops by mandating a \ndifferent direction in the current failed policy in Iraq, namely the \nphased redeployment of our combat troops from Iraq, and a narrowing of \nthe mission for those who remain.\n  I will continue to stand up for what I believe is a necessary change \nin course in Iraq and in American strategy. I will continue to fight to \nreverse the President's failed policy which has made us less safe, \nwhich has created a safe haven for extremists and terrorists in Iraq, \nand which has undermined the moral and political standing of the United \nStates around the world.\n  Most important, I will continue to stand up for our brave men and \nwomen in uniform. I will continue to fight for increased funding for \nbody armor and other critical needs. I will continue to fight for \nfunding for our military personnel to keep them safe and effective and \nto ensure they are not forgotten if they come home injured and in need \nof care.\n  I will continue to call for meaningful actions in this Congress to \nredirect funding away from major combat operations, while ensuring that \nwe have the means and tools necessary to continue vital training and \nequipping of Iraqi security forces, counter terrorism operations, and \nthe diplomatic, political, and economic offensive and strategies that \nare the key elements to finding a solution to the crisis in Iraq and in \nthe wider region.\n  I refuse to be cowed or bullied by false choices. It is long overdue \nthat we stand up to unreasonable arguments, conflated logic, attacks \nagainst dissent and debate, and most important, failed policies which \nare making our country less safe, each and every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3347-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HEALTHY FAMILIES ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on Thursday, March 15, 2007, I proudly \njoined Senator Kennedy as a cosponsor of the Healthy Families Act. This \nlegislation will provide full-time employees with up to 7 paid sick \ndays a year so that they can take care of their own medical needs or \nthe medical needs of family members. Part-time employees would receive \na pro-rata amount of paid sick leave. All employers--public and \nprivate--with at least 15 employees would be covered by the Healthy \nFamilies Act.\n  Today, 57 million workers in the United States do not have paid sick \ndays. Thus, when faced with either a personal or family medical issue, \nthey are forced to choose between caring for themselves or their loved \nones and going to work to keep food on the table and a paycheck in the \nmail. This is not acceptable. People get sick every day. They should \nhave the right to get medical treatment without jeopardizing their jobs \nor harming the people around them. The Healthy Families Act would \nguarantee them that right.\n  According to Harvard University's Global Working Families Project, \n139 nations provide some sort of paid sick days; 177 of those nations \nguarantee at least a week of annual sick pay. The United States, \nhowever, has no such guarantee--the federal Family and Medical Leave \nAct provides only unpaid sick leave for serious personal or family \nillnesses. This lack of paid sick leave puts our Nation's workforce, \nboth present and future, at risk.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am extremely conscious of the regulatory burden \nthat our businesses face--particularly our small businesses. I believe \nthat government should avoid weighing down small businesses with \nunnecessary regulations. However, the more I have examined this issue, \nthe more obvious it becomes that this legislation benefits both \nemployees and employers.\n  It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that healthy \nemployees are the key to a productive and vibrant economy. Healthy \nemployees are more productive and often more efficient. But, without \npaid sick days, many employees will go to work rather than take time \noff to get regular preventative medical checkups or to recover from an \nattacking illness or to care for a sick child. Thus, they will get sick \nmore often, and their illnesses will spread. Employees who opt to come \nto work when sick can make their condition worse or even spread their \nillness to coworkers. For a business, it is far more costly to cope \nwith a depleted staff or to search for a replacement when an employee \nis suffering from an extended illness than it is to provide just 7 sick \ndays. Providing employees with a small number of paid sick days is a \nsimple and commonsense fix that will save businesses time and money.\n  In addition, I have heard that small businesses often complain that \nthey want to offer this benefit but are unable to and need a level \nplaying field. This legislation would offer them just that.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will take a look at the Healthy \nFamilies Act and will join me in cosponsoring it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3347-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3347-S3348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ASSAULT WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the National Rifle Association leadership \nhas stated repeatedly that a ban on assault weapons is ineffective and \nunnecessary. They assert that guns labeled as assault weapons are \nrarely used in violent crimes and that most people use them for \nhunting. However, despite these repeated assertions, the list of\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\npeople speaking out against assault weapons continues to grow.\n  Jim Zumbo, an outdoors entrepreneur who lives in a log cabin near \nYellowstone National Park, has spent much of his life writing for \nprominent outdoor magazines, delivering lectures across the country and \nwho starred in a highly rated TV show about big-game hunting. Jim has \nbeen an NRA member for 40 years, and, according to his Web site, has \nappeared with NRA officials in 70 cities across the country. This \nrelationship changed drastically when Jim expressed his commonsense \nopinion on assault weapons.\n  Last month, after learning that some hunters were using assault \nweapons to hunt prairie dogs, Jim expressed his thoughts in his \npersonal blog on the Outdoor Life magazine website. He wrote:\n\n       Maybe I'm a traditionalist, but I see no place for these \n     weapons among our hunting fraternity. I'll go so far as to \n     call them ``terrorist rifles.''\n\n  He continued by stating that in his:\n\n       . . . humble opinion, these things have no place in \n     hunting. We don't need to be lumped into the group of people \n     who terrorize the world with them, which is an obvious \n     concern. I've always been comfortable with the statement that \n     hunters don't use assault rifles. We've always been proud of \n     our ``sporting firearms.''\n\n  The reaction from NRA officials was swift and callous. They \nimmediately severed all ties with Mr. Zumbo. His TV program on the \nOutdoor Channel was canceled, and his longtime career with Outdoor Life \nmagazine ended. In addition, many of his corporate ties to the biggest \nnames in gun making, such as Remington Arms Co., were terminated.\n  Jim Zumbo has worked for years to improve the image of outdoorsmen. \nAs he put it:\n\n       As hunters, we don't need the image of walking around the \n     woods carrying one of these weapons. To most of the public, \n     an assault rifle is a terrifying thing. Let's divorce \n     ourselves from them. I say game departments should ban them \n     from the prairies and woods.\n\n  We all owe Jim Zumbo a debt of gratitude for his forthrightness, his \nhonesty and his courage. We must put the safety of our communities \nfirst by taking up and passing sensible gun legislation that includes \nrenewing the assault weapons ban.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3348-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          CONGRATULATING GLENN MEANS III AND REBECCA SCHWAGER\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and \nhonor two young Kentucky students who have achieved national \nrecognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Glenn \nMeans III of Mount Sterling and Rebecca Schwager of Louisville have \njust been named the top two honorees in Kentucky by the 2007 Prudential \nSpirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on the \nmost impressive student volunteers in each State and the District of \nColumbia. This award was created by Prudential Financial in partnership \nwith the National Association of Secondary Principals.\n  Mr. Means, a senior at Montgomery County High School, is being \nrecognized for starting ``Helping Older People Smile, HOPS.'' This \nyouth-senior friendship club is a program that pairs young volunteers \nwith nursing home patients for weekly visits. Mr. Means has paired more \nthan 120 residents with middle and high school students since its \nfounding.\n  Miss Schwager, an eighth-grader at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic \nSchool, is being recognized for helping to raise thousands of dollars \nto benefit genocide victims in Darfur, Sudan as the co-chair of her \nschool's Committee on Conscience. She also volunteers as a tutor and \nmentor for immigrant and refugee children at Arcadia Community Center.\n  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are \nless involved in their communities than they once were, it is vital \nthat we encourage and support the kind of selfless contribution these \nyoung citizens have made. Young volunteers like Mr. Means and Miss \nSchwager are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our \nbrightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  Mr. Means and Miss Schwager should be extremely proud to have been \nsingled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. I heartily \napplaud Mr. Means and Miss Schwager for their initiative in seeking to \nmake their communities a better place to live, and for the positive \nimpact they have had on the lives of others.\n  All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and \ndeserve our sincere admiration and respect. They serve as an example to \nthe Commonwealth and show the best of community service that Kentucky \nhas to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3348-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF DOUGLAS K.

The \nworld's first service club, The Rotary Club of Chicago, IL, was formed \nin 1905 by Paul P. Harris, an attorney who wished to recapture in a \nprofessional club the same friendly spirit he had felt in the small \ntowns of his youth. As Rotary grew, its mission expanded to help serve \ncommunities in need around the world. Today, 1.2 million Rotarians \nbelong to some 32,000 Rotary clubs in more than 200 countries. Local \nRotarians constantly pool their resources and contribute their talents \nto help serve their local communities and address such pressing issues \nas illiteracy, environmental degradation, world hunger, and children at \nrisk.\n  For over 20 years, Mr. O'Connell has donated countless hours of \ncommunity service to the northwest corner of Connecticut. Through his \nwork with the Winsted Chapter of Rotary, United Way, the YMCA, as a \nvolunteer basketball coach, and a dedicated member of the Torrington \nBoard of Education, Mr. O'Connell has made a longlasting impact on his \ncommunity.\n  Mr. O'Connell embodies Rotary's principal motto: ``Service Above \nSelf.'' Mr. O'Connell, a talented attorney himself, is receiving the \nPaul Harris Award in appreciation of his tangible and significant \nassistance given for the furtherance of a better understanding and \nfriendly relations between the peoples of the world in the true spirit \nof Rotary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3348-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The following messages from the President of the United States were \ntransmitted to the Senate by one of his secretaries:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/20/senate-section/article/S3348-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT RELATIVE TO HAITI MEETING THE CONDITIONS REGARDING ENFORCEMENT \n   OF CIRCUMVENTION UNDER SECTION 213A(e)(1) OF THE CARIBBEAN BASIN \n                      ECONOMY RECOVERY ACT--PM 10\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement \nAct of 2006 (Division D, Title V of Public Law 109-432), amends the \nCaribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (Title II of the Trade and \nDevelopment Act of 2000, Public Law 106-200) (CBERA), to make certain \nproducts from Haiti eligible for preferential tariff treatment.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas relative to supporting the National \n     Bio and Agrodefense Facility; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5009\n\n       Whereas, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 has \n     tasked the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \n     to coordinate ``countermeasure research and development of \n     new methods for detection, prevention technologies, agent \n     characterization, and dose relationships for high-consequence \n     agents;'' and\n       Whereas, at present there are no facilities in the United \n     States that have adequate containment, security, equipment \n     and infrastructure to meet the requirements identified in \n     Presidential Directive 9; and\n       Whereas, to meet this need, the Department of Homeland \n     Security and its federal partners initiated plans for a \n     National Bio and Agrodefense Facility (NBAF); and\n       Whereas, the NBAF will enhance protection from both natural \n     and intentional threats by modernizing and integrating high-\n     biosecurity facilities, thus enhancing our nation's capacity \n     to assess potential threats to humans and animals alike; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Homeland Security is seeking a \n     location to build the $451 million, 500,000 square foot, NBAF \n     facility; and\n       Whereas, the State of Kansas pledges its support for the \n     funding and construction of the NBAF to address the needs of \n     Kansas and the nation to protect human and animal health from \n     both naturally occurring and intentionally introduced disease \n     threats; and\n       Whereas, Kansas is the ideal location for the NBAF. Kansas \n     is a world leader in bioscience, especially in the areas of \n     animal health and vaccines, infectious diseases and food \n     safety, and has an exceptionally well qualified workforce; \n     and\n       Whereas, two sites in Kansas, one in Manhattan and one in \n     Leavenworth, are actively under consideration by the \n     Department of Homeland Security to site the NBAF facility; \n     and\n       Whereas, the State of Kansas has already demonstrated its \n     strong support for the siting of the NBAF in Kansas, as \n     Governor Kathleen Sebelius and the Kansas Bioscience \n     Authority have taken the initiative to create a task force of \n     prominent industry leaders, public officials, including the \n     entire Kansas Congressional Delegation, representatives from \n     the Kansas Legislature, producer groups and leaders of \n     prominent academic institutions to lead Kansas' bids for the \n     NBAF; and\n       Whereas, the State of Kansas has a long-standing commitment \n     of supporting biosecurity research in partnership with the \n     federal government. Most recently, Kansas and the federal \n     government invested $54 million in the nation's most modern \n     biosecurity laboratory, the Biosecurity Research Institute at \n     Kansas State University: Now, therefore, Be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That the Kansas \n     Legislature pledges its support for Kansas State University, \n     the City of Manhattan and the City of Leavenworth in their \n     bids to site the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's \n     National Bio and Agrodefense Facility, and that the \n     Legislature commits to do everything in its power and ability \n     to provide any support necessary in or for the NBAF to be \n     constructed in Kansas; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Kansas Legislature strongly encourages \n     the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to consider Kansas' \n     existing building and security infrastructure, and the human \n     resources already in place that make Kansas a natural fit for \n     the location of this new federal laboratory; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be directed to send \n     enrolled copies of this resolution to President Bush, Vice \n     President Cheney, Secretary Chertoff of the U.S. Department \n     of Homeland Security, Secretary Johanns of the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture, Secretary Leavitt of the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services, each member of the \n     Kansas Congressional Delegation and Governor Kathleen \n     Sebelius.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-26. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho relative to forest land management; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n       Whereas, the United States Forest Service administers the \n     management of 39% of the land base in the state of Idaho, and \n     an additional 22% is administered by the United States Bureau \n     of Land Management; and\n       Whereas, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. Section 471, an 1891 law \n     authorizing the President to establish national forests, the \n     purpose for establishing and administering national forests \n     was to set aside public lands reserved as national forests to \n     be controlled and administered, to the extent practical, in \n     accordance with the Act which provided that ``no national \n     forest may be established except to improve and protect the \n     forest, or to secure favorable conditions of water flows, and \n     to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and \n     necessities of citizens''; and\n       Whereas, it has long been the intent and policy of the \n     federal government to hold rural communities harmless from \n     the creation of federal lands and in 1906 the Committee on \n     Public Lands recognized that the presence of federal lands \n     could create a hardship for many counties, as they provided \n     little revenue or commerce at that time; and\n       Whereas, in 1908 Congress created the Twenty-five Percent \n     Fund Act to pay states and counties 25 percent of receipts \n     collected from national forests and mandated that payments \n     were to be spent on schools and roads, recognizing that \n     viable communities adjacent to the public lands, with \n     adequate roads and schools, were essential for the \n     development and preservation of the national forests; and\n       Whereas, the federal policy of holding counties harmless \n     from the creation of public lands within counties was \n     reiterated in 1916 with the creation of the Oregon and \n     California Grant Lands under the Chamberlain-Ferris Act, and \n     again in 1937 with passage of the Oregon and California Grant \n     Lands Act; and\n       Whereas, the forest resources were intended to be managed \n     in such an environmentally responsible manner that they would \n     produce long-term sustainable revenue to share with schools \n     and counties as well as products for the nation; and\n       WHEREAS, in 2000, Congress passed the Secure Rural Schools \n     and Community Self-Determination Act, commonly known as \n     public law 106-393, which restored historical payment levels \n     previously made to states and counties from the federal \n     government for road and school purposes due to declining \n     levels of actual forest receipts; and\n       Whereas, the reauthorization of public law 106-393 is \n     pending before the United States Congress and Idaho counties \n     are on record as being strongly supportive of a fully-funded \n     approval of this Act; and\n       Whereas, recently, federal land managers have been faced \n     with an ever-present funding shortage and rural counties will \n     be faced with higher property taxes or a reduction in \n     services if the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act is not reauthorized and appropriated; and\n       Whereas, there is continued concern that if the Act is \n     reauthorized and appropriated it may be the last time it \n     occurs and a long-term solution to these issues is necessary; \n     and\n       Whereas, the state of Idaho is dependent upon healthy \n     national forest system lands for economic benefit, recreation \n     and scenic beauty and it is time to demonstrate a new \n     initiative and commitment to the intent and policy of the \n     federal government to hold counties and schools harmless from \n     the creation of federal lands and construct a path leading to \n     economic stability for rural communities and schools; and\n       Whereas, transfer of the management of the national forest \n     system lands that are not designated as wilderness, proposed \n     or recommended wilderness, wild and scenic river, or national \n     recreation area, or designated roadless area in Idaho, to the \n     state of Idaho would promote better stewardship of the public \n     lands, provide financial returns to the counties, secure \n     public access, meet Congress's intent to hold rural \n     communities harmless from the creation of federal lands, and \n     fund schools, road and bridge infrastructure which would \n     offset significant tax increases in rural counties in the \n     event the Secure Rural Schools payments are not reauthorized \n     or are allowed to expire following the 2006 reauthorization; \n     and\n       Whereas, precedent for state administration of federally-\n     owned lands exists in the state of Idaho at the City of Rocks \n     area in southern Idaho and campground-related facilities and \n     land at Lake Cascade; and\n       Whereas, a transfer of management to the state of Idaho \n     would demonstrate a new initiative and commitment to the \n     intent and policy of the federal government to hold rural \n     counties and schools harmless from the consequences of the \n     reservation of federal lands and construct a process leading \n     to economic stability for rural communities and schools; and\n       Whereas, lands for which management responsibility is \n     transferred to the state of Idaho could administered by the \n     Idaho Department of Lands in cooperation with county \n     officials and with cooperative oversight by the United \n     States. Forest Service and state and local government could \n     establish, or use existing natural resource advisory \n     committees composed of a diverse cross-section of the public, \n     with all decisions and actions relating to the lands being \n     required to comply with every federal and state environmental \n     law; and\n       Whereas, the management of these lands would have to meet \n     the mandates of the Healthy Forest Initiative, the National \n     Fire Plan, and state and county fire mitigation plans. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, That we \n     urge the Congress to support federal legislation transferring \n     management of national forest system lands within Idaho to \n     the state of Idaho to be managed for the benefit of the rural \n     counties and schools with the state of Idaho being held \n     harmless from the costs of administration; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is urged to provide that any \n     transfer of management authority would not affect any rights \n     or authority of the state with respect to fish and wildlife, \n     or repeal or modify any provision of law that permits the \n     state or political subdivisions of the state to share in the \n     revenues from federal lands, or any provision of law that \n     provides that fees or charges collected at particular federal \n     areas be used for or credited to specific purposes or special \n     funds, and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is urged to provide that fees or \n     revenues collected under state management be allocated 75%, \n     or other appropriate percentage, for the benefit of the \n     counties and schools in which the national forest system \n     lands are located and 25%, or other appropriate percentage, \n     for the benefit of the national forest in which the lands \n     administered by the state of Idaho are located to be paid at \n     the end of the year to the Secretary of the Treasury, and \n     that amounts allocated to the counties should not be taken \n     into account for purposes of the Twenty-five Percent Fund \n     pursuant to 16 U.S.C. Section 500; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is urged to seek a long-term \n     solution to the significant issues that will face rural \n     counties in the event the Secure Rural Schools payments are \n     not reauthorized or are allowed to expire following the 2006 \n     reauthorization; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-27. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Idaho \n     relative to the authorization of a study of the decline in \n     receipts on national forest system lands; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 26\n\n       Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:\n       Whereas, it has long been the intent and policy of the \n     federal government to hold rural communities harmless from \n     the creation of federal lands and in 1906 the Committee on \n     Public Lands recognized that the presence of federal lands \n     could create hardship for many counties as they provided \n     little revenue or commerce at that time; and\n       Whereas, in 1908, the federal government promised rural \n     counties twenty-five percent of all revenues generated from \n     the multiple-use management of the newly created national \n     forests to support public roads and public schools; and\n       Whereas, in recent decades, the forest resources have not \n     been managed in a manner to produce long-term sustainable \n     revenue to share with schools and counties; and\n       Whereas, in 2000, Congress passed Public Law 106-393, the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. \n     The Act restored historical payment levels previously made to \n     states and counties from the federal government for road and \n     school purposes because of declining levels of actual forest \n     receipts; and\n       Whereas, the reauthorization and appropriation of the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act is \n     pending before the United States Congress, and Idaho counties \n     are on record as being strongly supportive of a fully funded \n     approval of this Act; and\n       Whereas, federal land managers continue to be faced with \n     funding shortages. In the event the Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act is not reauthorized and \n     appropriated, counties will be faced with higher property \n     taxes or a reduction in services and even if the Act is \n     reauthorized and appropriated, it will likely be the last \n     time, and the state of Idaho must seek a long-term solution; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 2006, House Joint Memorial No. 21 was adopted \n     by the members of the Second Regular Session of the Fifty-\n     eighth Idaho Legislature to provide one option to address the \n     problem of declining forest receipts by urging Congress to \n     support federal legislation transferring management of \n     National Forest System lands within Idaho to the state of \n     Idaho to be managed for the benefit of the rural counties and \n     schools. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislative \n     Council is authorized to appoint an interim committee to \n     undertake and complete an assessment of the decline in \n     receipts on National Forest System lands, which have \n     historically been shared with counties, with the goal of the \n     interim committee's recommendations being to develop a \n     federal, bipartisan, long-term solution that addresses \n     sustainable management of federal forest lands to \n     stabilize payments to Idaho's forest counties, which help \n     support roads and schools, and to provide projects that \n     enhance forest ecosystem health and provide employment \n     opportunities, and to improve cooperative relationships \n     among those who use and care about the lands the agencies \n     manage. The Legislative Council shall determine the \n     membership from each house appointed to the interim \n     committee and shall authorize the interim committee to \n     receive input, advice and assistance from interested and \n     affected parties who are not members of the Legislature. \n     As much as is practicable, the interim committee shall \n     work in cooperation and coordination with the state of \n     Idaho, its counties, its school and highway districts, \n     along with the recognized Indian tribes of the state of \n     Idaho. The interim committee is also authorized to retain \n     the services of consultants, within appropriated moneys, \n     who are familiar with forest receipts, and who can provide \n     necessary economic and other research to assist the \n     interim committee and the Legislature in making an \n     informed decision on this most important topic. Now, \n     therefore, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Idaho legislative interim committee on \n     forest receipts will address National Forest System lands, \n     but only those lands that do not have special designations. \n     The interim committee is directed to formulate a solution \n     that will protect all valid existing rights, existing public \n     access and activities, including hunting, fishing and \n     recreation, and that will not be construed to interfere with \n     treaties or any other obligations to the Indian tribes, \n     commitments to county governments, or the General Mining Law \n     or Taylor Grazing Act. Now, therefore be it further\n       Resolved, That nonlegislative members of the interim \n     committee may be appointed by the cochairs of the interim \n     committee who are appointed by the Legislative Council. \n     Nonlegislative members of the interim committee shall not be \n     reimbursed from legislative funds for per diem, mileage or \n     other expenses and shall not have voting privileges regarding \n     the interim committee's recommendations or proposed \n     legislation. Now, therefore, be it further\n       Resolved, That the interim committee shall report its \n     findings, recommendations and proposed legislation, if any, \n     to the Second Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho \n     Legislature.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-28. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona urging Congress to enact legislation repealing the \n     privacy violations contained in the REAL ID Act of 2005; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          Senate Memorial 1003\n\n       Whereas, in May 2005, the United States Congress enacted \n     the REAL ID Act of 2005 (REAL ID Act) as part of the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the \n     Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief Act (Public Law 109-\n     13), which was signed by President Bush on May 11, 2005 and \n     which becomes fully effective May 11, 2008; and\n       Whereas, some of the requirements of the REAL ID Act are \n     that states must issue driver licenses and state \n     identification cards in a uniform format as prescribed by the \n     Department of Homeland Security; must verify the issuance, \n     validity and completeness of all primary documents used to \n     issue a driver license, and provide for their secure storage: \n     must provide fraudulent document recognition training to \n     persons who issue driver licenses or state identification \n     cards; and must issue a driver license or state \n     identification card in a prescribed format if it does not \n     meet the criteria provided for a federally approved license \n     or identification card; and\n       Whereas, use of the federal minimum standards for state \n     driver licenses and identification cards will be necessary \n     for any type of federally regulated activity for which an \n     identification card must be displayed; and\n       Whereas, some of the intended privacy requirements of the \n     REAL ID Act, such as the use of common machine-readable \n     technology and state maintenance of a database that can be \n     shared with the United States and agencies of other states \n     may actually make it more likely that a federally required \n     driver license or state identification card or the \n     information about the bearer on which the license or card is \n     based will be stolen, sold or otherwise used for purposes \n     that were never intended or that are criminally related than \n     if the REAL ID Act had not been enacted; and\n       Whereas, these potential breaches in privacy that could \n     result directly from compliance with the REAL ID Act may \n     violate the right to privacy of thousands of residents of \n     Arizona; and\n       Whereas, the American Association of Motor Vehicle \n     Administrators, the National Governors' Association and the \n     National Conference of State Legislatures have estimated that \n     the cost to the states to implement the REAL ID Act will be \n     more than $11 billion over five years; and\n       Whereas, the mandate to the states, through federal \n     legislation that provides no funding for its requirements, to \n     issue what is effectively a national identification card \n     appears to be an attempt to commandeer the political \n     machinery of the states and to require them to be agents of \n     the federal government, in violation of the principles of \n     federalism contained in the tenth amendment to the United \n     States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, some states have enacted legislation that opposes \n     the implementation of the REAL ID Act.\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, prays:\n       1.

A bill to reauthorize Department of Agriculture conservation \nand energy programs and certain other programs of the Department, to \nmodify the operation and administration of these programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today along with several of my \ncolleagues to introduce the Healthy Farms, Foods, and Fuels Act of \n2007. I am also proud to be joined in this effort by my friend and \nformer colleague, Representative Ron Kind of Wisconsin, who is \nintroducing this legislation today in the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation is crucial because we have a tremendous opportunity \nthis year to set a healthier course for American agriculture. To allow \nour farmers, ranchers, and foresters to thrive while giving them the \ntools they need to meet our environmental and energy challenges; to \nopen up new markets and opportunities for our small farmers; and to \nprovide consumers and schoolchildren with more fresh fruits and \nvegetables, and make it easier for low-income Americans and the elderly \nto have access to healthier foods.\n  Like all legislation, a Farm Bill is a statement of priorities and of \nvalues. And the Healthy Farms, Foods, and Fuels Act embodies many of \nthe priorities and values that I believe we as a nation should be \nfocused on.\n  Although many people are not aware of New Jersey's thriving \nagricultural sector, the fact is that we are the Garden State, and a \nhealthy agricultural sector nationwide--one that addresses the needs of \nall of our farmers, whether\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\nthey grow corn in the Midwest or blueberries in the Mid-Atlantic--is \nessential for New Jersey to remain the Garden State.\n  However, New Jersey's farmers are under a tremendous amount of \npressure. They operate in a very high-cost environment and see \ndevelopment encroaching on their farms from all sides. Conservation \nprograms are crucial to the survival of agriculture in the Garden \nState, as well as for the protection of sensitive wetlands and animal \nhabitats, which is why the Healthy Farms bill increases funding and \nexpands eligibility for the Environment Quality Incentives Program, \nConservation Reserve Program, Conservation Security Program, Farmland \nand Ranchland Protection Program, Wetlands Reserve Program, and \nWildlife Habitat Incentive Program.\n  New Jersey's farmers are also among the most prolific in the country \nin growing fruits and vegetables, yet they are often just a few miles \nfrom distressed communities where children struggle for access to \nnutritious food. That's why the Healthy Farms bill expands the Fresh \nFruit and Vegetable Program to schools in all states, giving more \nchildren access to healthy snacks. The bill also expands the Farmers \nMarket Promotion Program, and provides additional funding for programs \nthat allow seniors and low-income families to obtain food at farmers \nmarkets. Not only do these programs help people eat healthier, they \nprovide an additional market for local farmers.\n  This bill is, of course, just the start of this conversation. As we \nmove forward this year, we must work together on issues of farm \nprofitability, entrepreneurship and innovation, toward a Farm Bill that \nemphasizes flexibility, efficiency and equitable distribution of \ngovernment programs. This will help to ensure success for our farm \nfamily enterprises and the wider community of Farm Bill beneficiaries, \nboth large and small, near urbanized areas and in more rural settings, \nthroughout all regions of the country.\n  Ideally, an emphasis on the diversity of agricultural and related \nbusinesses, their interaction with the citizens who are their ultimate \ncustomers, and the role these enterprises play in addressing issues of \nnutrition, hunger and economic growth throughout our nation will join \nwith conservation and environmental issues to form a comprehensive Farm \nBill that will serve the nation well for the next five years and \nbeyond.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 920. A bill to provide wage parity for certain prevailing rate \nemployees in Rhode Island; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I address an issue of critical \nimportance to Rhode Island's Federal Wage System employees.\n  Federal Wage System (FWS) employees are the Federal Government's \nblue-collar employees. In Rhode Island, these workers include janitors, \nmechanics, machine tool operators, munitions and explosive operators, \nelectricians, and engineers. The majority of FWS employees in the \nUnited States work in the Department of Defense or the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. Indeed, Naval Station Newport employs the most FWS \nworkers in the Narragansett Bay area. These workers are essential to \nthe government's daily operation, and the work that they perform is \nimportant to our national security.\n  Regrettably, in the Narragansett Bay wage area, Federal blue-collar \nworkers are faced with one of the lowest FWS pay scales, while residing \nin an area with one of the highest costs of living. The significant \ndisparities between wages in the Narragansett Bay wage area and the \nproximate Boston and Hartford wage areas raise serious questions about \nthe fairness and equity of these pay scales. In Rhode Island, an \naverage wage grade worker earns $18.47 per hour, whereas the same \nworker in Boston earns $20.77 per hour and an employee in Hartford \nearns $19.99 per hour. Competitive compensation is the best way to \nensure the retention of qualified and effective workers. Rhode Island \nshould not suffer the loss of experienced Federal employees to the same \njobs, at the same grade levels, just miles away because of better pay.\n  The chair of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee (FPRAC), \nwhich advises the Office of Personnel Management on decisions dealing \nwith the FWS pay scales, has been left vacant, leaving the FPRAC unable \nto make needed decisions regarding these wage areas.\n  Due to the lack of a chair and any action by FPRAC or OPM, which I \nhave long urged to resolve this matter, I am reintroducing the Rhode \nIsland Federal Worker Fairness Act, and I am pleased that Senator \nWhitehouse is joining me as a cosponsor. This bill will merge the \nNarragansett Bay wage area with the Boston, MA, wage area to provide \nregional pay equity to Rhode Island Federal blue-collar workers. \nMerging these two wage areas will keep Federal workers in Rhode Island \nfrom abandoning their government jobs for higher paying positions \nelsewhere in southern New England, and help the approximately 500 wage \nrate workers in Rhode Island better provide for their families. I urge \nthat this long pending inequality be addressed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 920\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rhode Island Federal Worker \n     Fairness Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WAGE PARITY FOR CERTAIN PREVAILING RATE EMPLOYEES IN \n                   RHODE ISLAND.\n\n       The wage schedules and rates applicable to prevailing rate \n     employees (as defined in section 5342 of title 5, United \n     States Code) in the Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, wage area \n     shall be the same as the wage schedules and rates applicable \n     to prevailing rate employees in the Boston, Massachusetts, \n     wage area.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Section 2 shall take effect beginning with the first pay \n     period beginning on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 921. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the coverage of marriage and family therapist services and \nmental health counselor services under part B of the Medicare program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe ``Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2007'' with my \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln. Specifically, the \n``Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2007'' permits mental \nhealth counselors and marriage and family therapists to bill Medicare \nfor services provided to seniors. This will result in an increased \nchoice of mental health providers for seniors and enhance their ability \nto access mental health services in their communities.\n  This legislation is especially crucial to rural seniors who are often \nforced to travel long distances to utilize the services of mental \nhealth providers currently recognized by the Medicare program. Rural \ncommunities have difficulty recruiting and retaining providers, \nespecially mental health providers. In many small towns, a mental \nhealth counselor or a marriage and family therapist is the only mental \nhealth care provider in the area. Medicare law--as it exists today--\ncompounds the situation because only psychiatrists, clinical \npsychologists, clinical social workers and clinical nurse specialists \nare able to bill Medicare for their services.\n  It is time the Medicare program recognized the qualifications of \nmental health counselors and marriage and family therapists as well as \nthe critical role they play in the mental health care infrastructure. \nThese providers go through rigorous training, similar to the curriculum \nof masters level social workers, and yet are excluded from the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Particularly troubling to me is the fact that seniors have \ndisproportionally higher rates of depression and suicide than other \npopulations. Additionally, 75 percent of the 518 nationally designated \nMental Health Professional Shortage Areas are located in rural areas \nand one-fifth of all rural counties have no mental health services of \nany kind. Frontier counties have even more drastic numbers as 95 \npercent do not have a psychiatrist, 68\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\npercent do not have a psychologist and 78 percent do not have a social \nworker. It is quite obvious we have an enormous task ahead of us to \nreduce these staggering statistics. Providing mental health counselors \nand marriage and family therapists the ability to bill Medicare for \ntheir services is a key part of the solution.\n  Virtually all of Wyoming is designated a mental health professional \nshortage area and will greatly benefit from this legislation. Wyoming \nhas 174 psychologists, 37 psychiatrists and 263 clinical social workers \nfor a total of 474 Medicare eligible mental health providers. Enactment \nof the ``Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2007'' will \nmore than double the number of mental health providers available to \nseniors in my State with the addition of 528 mental health counselors \nand 61 marriage and family therapists currently licensed in the State.\n  I believe this legislation is critically important to the health and \nwell-being of our Nation's seniors and I strongly urge all my \ncolleagues to become a cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 921\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the existing provisions regarding the \neligibility for essential air service subsidies through fiscal year \n2012; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nsustain important air service--in South Dakota and other rural States \nacross the country. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 allowed \nairlines to provide air service to domestic markets as they saw fit. \nBut Congress had the foresight to create the Essential Air Service \n(EAS) Program to ensure a minimal level of scheduled air service in \nsmall communities. Without the EAS program, these small communities \nmight have otherwise seen the airlines pull up stakes and only focus on \nlarger, more profitable markets.\n  Essential Air Service is especially important to rural States like my \nhome State of South Dakota. We have four communities that participate \nin the EAS program: Brookings, Huron, Pierre, and Watertown. Ensuring \nair passengers have access in and out of these smaller communities \nmakes our entire commercial airline network more valuable.\n  The bill I am introducing today is very simple. It extends a \nprovision, Section 409, passed by Congress and signed into law by the \nPresident in the 2002 Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization, \ncommonly referred to as Vision 100. This provision ensures that certain \nmileage calculations that determine EAS program eligibility are\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\nnot simply measured by some bureaucrat in Washington, but are in fact \ncertified by States' Governors. There are, of course, budgetary strains \non the EAS program. Congress and the Administration should focus on \nstrengthening the program and examine the air service it is supporting \nto make sure it is truly essential, but we should not allow bureaucrats \nbehind a desk in Washington to surreptitiously use mileage \ndeterminations to cut the costs of the program and reduce air service \nin the process.\n  Brookings is a community in my home State that would have more than \nlikely lost its commercial air service if this provision was not in \nplace five years ago. We should keep it in place for the next five \nyears to make sure Brookings and other communities like it do not end \nup the cutting room floor of the EAS program.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Commerce \nCommittee to begin the process of reauthorizing FAA programs again this \nyear. Aviation is a crucial element of our economy. I hope that this \nlegislation, or at least the concept behind it, is considered during \nthe reauthorization debate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 924. A bill to strengthen the United States Coast Guard's \nIntegrated Deepwater Program; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I think we all agree that the United \nStates Coast Guard plays a critical role in keeping our oceans, coasts, \nand waterways safe, secure, and free from environmental harm. Following \nthe events of September 11 and, more recently, Hurricane Katrina the \nCoast Guard has served as a source of strength for this Nation. And, in \nthe face of increasing marine traffic, security threats at our Nation's \nports, and climate change increasing the odds of another Katrina, the \nresponsibilities of the Coast Guard continue to increase.\n  The Coast Guard is struggling right now to replace their rapidly \naging fleet of ships, aircraft, and facilities. At a cost of $24 \nbillion, the Deepwater program is the largest and most complex \nacquisition program in the history of the Coast Guard. We have a \nresponsibility to ensure there is transparency and oversight so this \nprogram is as efficient and effective as possible.\n  The Deepwater program utilizes a private sector lead systems \nintegrator, LSI, know as Integrated Coast Guard Systems, ICGS, to \noversee acquisition of a ``system of systems.'' When the Deepwater \ncontract was originally awarded in 2002, the Coast Guard did not have \nthe personnel within their acquisition department to manage such a \nlarge contract. We were told that outsourcing that role to industry \nwould save the Coast Guard time and money over the long run.\n  The approach, which may have seemed innovative at the time, has not \nproduced the promised results. Instead of cost and time savings, we've \nseen less competition, inadequate technical oversight and a lack of \ntransparency. Over the last year, these problems have caused major \nblunders in the Deepwater program.\n  The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General, IG, has \nreleased three recent reports detailing some of the problems with \nDeepwater.\n  In an August 11, 2006 report titled Major Improvements Needed in the \nU.S. Coast Guard's Implementation of Deepwater Information Technology \nSystem, the IG described problems with Deepwater's C41SR electronics \nequipment, which is to be the integrating technology linking \nDeepwater's aircraft and ships.\n  On January 29, 2007, the IG released a scathing report on Deepwater's \nflagship National Security Cutter, NSC, documenting crucial design \nflaws and cost overruns created by a faulty contract structure and lack \nof Coast Guard oversight.\n  Finally, on February 9, 2007, the IG released another report, this \none detailing serious issues with Deepwater's 123-foot cutter \nconversion project.\n  These reports, along with others by the Government Accountability \nOffice about problems with the stalled Fast Response Cutter, FRC, \nprogram and the Deepwater contract structure, have prompted a \nresounding cry for Deepwater reform, transparency, and oversight.\n  On February 14, 2007, I chaired a hearing in the Commerce Committee's \nSubcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard to \nbetter understand these issues and seek solutions. From that hearing it \nwas clear that the Coast Guard was working hard to make internal \nreforms. It was also clear that we needed to do more to protect the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Today, I'm pleased to introduce, along with Senator Snowe, the \nIntegrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, a comprehensive bill which \nmakes fundamental changes to the Coast Guard's Deepwater acquisition \nprogram.\n  My bill requires the Coast Guard to move away from the industry-led \nLead Systems Integrator and have full and open competition for future \nDeepwater assets.\n  It requires a completely new ``analysis of alternatives'' of all \nfuture Deepwater assets to ensure that the Coast Guard is getting the \nassets best-suited for their needs.\n  It requires the Commandant of the Coast Guard to certify to Congress \nthat specific assets to be procured are mature and cost-effective \ntechnologies, a requirement already applied to Department of Defense \ncontracts.\n  And, it gives the Coast Guard the tools they need to manage this \ncontract and future contracts effectively, including requiring the \nCoast Guard to make internal management changes to ensure open \ncompetition, increase technical oversight and improve reporting to \nCongress.\n  I'm pleased to say that I have worked closely with Senator Snowe and \nthe Coast Guard in crafting this bill and I'm confident that this will \nfix many of the problems that have plagued the Deepwater program.\n  This legislation takes a big step towards getting the Coast Guard the \nassets they need to meet the pressing needs of our Nation and ensuring \nresponsible management of taxpayer dollars. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to enact the changes we propose today so we can get \nthis program back on track.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Summary of Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act\n\n\n                    Use of a Lead Systems Integrator\n\n       Would direct the Coast Guard to stop using a Lead Systems \n     Integrator (LSI) on future Deepwater acquisitions.\n       Would allow the Coast Guard to use the LSI to complete any \n     specific work for which a contract or order had already been \n     issued.\n       Would allow the Coast Guard to use the LSI to complete the \n     C130-J modifications, the C4ISR program, and also to complete \n     procurements of the National Security Cutters (NSCs) and \n     Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) already under contract for \n     construction. However, the LSI must have no financial \n     interest in subcontracts or have competed the subcontracts.\n       Would allow the Coast Guard to use the LSI to complete all \n     of the remaining NSCs and MPAs only after an analysis of \n     alternatives has been conducted and, if the Coast Guard \n     concludes that these procurements and use of an LSI are in \n     the best interests of the federal government, that \n     justifications for not competing assets under the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulations are met, and that the LSI has no \n     financial interest in subcontracts or has competed the \n     subcontracts.\n       All other Deepwater assets would be done as a traditional \n     procurement.\n\n\n                              Competition\n\n       Would require that the Coast Guard have a full and open \n     competition of all Deepwater assets that have not yet gone \n     under contract, other than those that the LSI can complete.\n       Would require that the LSI have no financial interest in \n     subcontracts for assets managed by the LSI, or that \n     subcontracts be fully competed. A similar provision was \n     included in the 2006 Defense Authorization Act.\n\n\n                        Analysis of Alternatives\n\n       Would require an analysis of alternatives of all of the \n     proposed Deepwater assets not currently under contract and \n     whether other alternatives are preferable. Such review would \n     be conducted by an independent third party entity with \n     expertise in major acquisitions, and no financial conflict of \n     interest.\n       Would require the Coast Guard to provide a plan to Congress \n     for how to move forward with Deepwater procurements based on \n     this review.\n       Would require a similar review for any major changes to the \n     agreed plan in the future.\n\n\n                             Certification\n\n       Would require the Commandant to certify to Congress, prior \n     to issuing new contracts\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\n     for specific proposed acquisitions, that the proposed asset \n     meets objective criteria for feasibility, maturity of design, \n     and costs. A similar requirement applies to Department of \n     Defense contracts.\n\n\n                            Contract changes\n\n       Would require improvements to any contract entered into by \n     the Coast Guard for Deepwater assets, including changes to \n     award term and award fee criteria as recommended by the \n     Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n       Would end the practice of allowing the private contractor \n     to self-certify the design and performance of assets being \n     delivered. This will ensure adherence to accepted industry-\n     wide standards and procedures.\n\n\n                    Internal Coast Guard Management\n\n       Would require improvements to Coast Guard's management of \n     Deepwater, including implementation of the Coast Guard's \n     Blueprint for Acquisition Reform as well as recommendations \n     for improved management included in a February 5, 2007 \n     Defense Acquisition University (DAU) report and by GAO.\n       Would ensure better technical oversight by the Coast \n     Guard's engineering staff.\n       Would allow the Coast Guard to shift personnel to support \n     acquisitions projects.\n\n\n                         Reporting to Congress\n\n       Would require Coast Guard to provide significant additional \n     information to Congress regarding the status of the Deepwater \n     program, similar to what the Department of Defense provides.\n\n\n                               GAO Review\n\n       Would require GAO to monitor closely the Coast Guard's \n     implementation of improvements to its management of the \n     Deepwater program.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 924\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to support introduction of the \nIntegrated Deepwater Reform Act.\n  Since 1790, the United States Coast Guard has served as the guardian \nof our shores. It began its service to the Nation as a lifesaving \norganization, protecting our mariners from the perils of the sea. Over \ntime, its missions have come to encompass additional responsibilities \nincluding performing drug and migrant interdiction, enforcing fisheries \nregulations, and maintaining our Nation's waterways and aids to \nnavigation. Following the tragic events of September 11th, 2001, the \nCoast Guard expanded its role in homeland security operations, becoming \nthe agency charged with protecting our Nation from maritime threats.\n  Though we have expanded the role of this valiant service, we have not \nupgraded its equipment to the degree necessary to carry out the tasks \nit has been assigned. Current Coast Guard vessels comprise the third \noldest naval fleet in the world. Some of its cutters still in service \nare over sixty years old. Recognizing the looming obsolescence of its \nlegacy fleet, in the mid 1990s the Coast Guard embarked on an effort to \ncreate a wholly integrated system of ships, aircraft, sensors, and \ncommunications systems and called the effort Deepwater. Recapitalizing \nthe Coast Guard remains one of this Nation's most important National \nSecurity initiatives.\n  However, recent events have made it clear that additional \nCongressional oversight is warranted for this major acquisitions \nprogram. Failure of the 123-foot patrol boat conversion program, and \nquestions about the fatigue life of the hull of the National Security \nCutter under the purview of Integrated Coast Guard Systems have called \ninto question the value of this ``lead systems integrator.'' The \ncontract as written has given the contractor too much autonomy and not \nenough focus on actual performance.\n  By placing restrictions on the structure of any agreements between \nthe Coast Guard and its contractors, this bill will ensure that future \nDeepwater contracts protect the American taxpayer while allowing the \nCoast Guard to acquire the assets necessary to carry out its critical \nresponsibilities. We cannot change the simple fact that in order to \nprotect our Nation, the Coast Guard must be able to upgrade its \nexisting assets. The safety of the brave men and women who serve in the \nCoast Guard, and the security of every American depends on the success \nof this program.\n\n[[Page S3360]]\n\n  I remain convinced that the Integrated Deepwater Program is the \nappropriate vehicle for the Coast Guard's modernization. However, in \norder for the Coast Guard to receive the best assets at the best value \nfor the American taxpayer, Congress must ensure that the service and \nthe contractors recognizes their joint commitment to both excellence \nand fiscal responsibility. By limiting the use of a lead systems \nintegrator, increasing requirements for open competition, requiring \nadditional internal Coast Guard management, and increasing reporting \nrequirements to Congress, this bill provides that assurance.\n  I am proud to add this bill to my record of Coast Guard oversight. I \nalso would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Cantwell for \nall her hard work on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Martinez):\n  S. 926.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague Senator Mel Martinez as we introduce a package of bills aimed \nat providing a comprehensive solution to strengthen our Nation's \nproperty and casualty insurance market. Without serious reform, the \nFederal Government will be forced to continue to spend billions of \ndollars of taxpayer money to cover the costs of natural disasters in \nthe United States. Worse, without Federal action, property insurance \nsoon will become more expensive and hard to find, preventing some \nconsumers from insuring their homes and businesses.\n  As we know all too well, the last few years have brought a \ndevastating cycle of natural catastrophes in the United States. In 2004 \nand 2005, we witnessed a series of powerful hurricanes that caused \nunthinkable human tragedy and property loss. Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita alone caused over $200 billion in total economic losses, including \ninsured and uninsured losses.\n  In my own home State of Florida, eight catastrophic storms in fifteen \nmonths caused more than $31 billion in insured damages. Now Florida is \nwitnessing skyrocketing insurance rates, insurance companies are \ncanceling hundreds of thousands of policies, and Florida's State \ncatastrophe fund is depleted.\n  In short, the inability of our private markets to fully handle the \nfallout from natural disasters has made our Nation's property and \ncasualty insurance marketplace unstable. This market instability \nrepeatedly has forced the Federal Government to absorb billions of \ndollars in uninsured losses. This is a waste of taxpayer money, \nespecially when we know there are ways to design the system to \nanticipate and plan for the financial impacts of catastrophes.\n  As insurance companies struggle to maintain their businesses, costs \nare passed on to homeowners and small businesses in Florida and in \nother States. In essence, the people who can least afford it are being \nforced to bear the disproportionate share of the billions of dollars of \nlosses caused by natural catastrophes.\n  Many Floridians have seen their insurance bills double in the last \nfew years. As I travel around Florida, I hear repeatedly from my \nconstituents that they may soon be unable to afford property and \ncasualty insurance. That is a frightening proposition for people living \nin a State where increasingly vicious hurricane seasons are predicted. \nI am sure we all agree--consumers never should be put in the untenable \nposition of having to choose between purchasing insurance and \npurchasing other necessities.\n  While our Nation's property and casualty insurance system is not yet \nbroken, it's clear that Congress needs to act now to shore up the \nsystem. Private sector insurance is currently available to spread some \ncatastrophe-related losses throughout the Nation and internationally, \nbut most experts believe that there will be significant insurance and \nreinsurance shortages. These shortages could result in future dramatic \nrate increases for consumers and businesses and the unavailability of \ncatastrophe insurance.\n  Let me be clear: these issues will not just affect Florida or the \ncoastal States. Natural catastrophes can strike anywhere in the \ncountry. For example, a major earthquake fault line runs through \nseveral of our Midwestern States. We also saw firsthand the devastating \neffects of a volcano eruption at Mount Saint Helens in Washington \nState.\n  In the past few decades, major disasters have been declared in almost \nevery State. As I mentioned earlier, the Federal Government has \nprovided and will continue to provide billions of dollars and resources \nto pay for these catastrophic losses, at huge costs to all American \ntaxpayers.\n  Congress has struggled with these issues for decades. Although we \nhave talked about these issues time and time again, nothing much has \ngotten accomplished. The most notable step Congress did take was to \ncreate a National Flood Insurance Program. But Congress needs to do \nmuch more. It's time for a comprehensive approach to solving our \nNation's property and casualty insurance issues.\n  These matters are usually within the purview of the States, and I \ncannot understate the importance of State-based solutions to these \ninsurance issues. Nonetheless, the Federal Government also has a \ncritical interest in ensuring appropriate and fiscally responsible risk \nmanagement of catastrophes.\n  For example, mortgages require reliable property insurance, and the \nunavailability of reliable property insurance would make most real \nestate transactions impossible. Moreover, the public health, safety, \nand welfare demand that structures damaged or destroyed in catastrophes \nbe reconstructed as soon as possible.\n  In order to help protect consumers and small businesses, today I join \nSenator Martinez to introduce this package of bills as part of a \ncomprehensive approach to fixing our troubled insurance system. Let me \nsummarize each of the bills and tell you how this integrated approach \nmakes good policy sense.\n  The first piece of legislation Senator Martinez and I are introducing \ntoday is the Homeowners Protection Act of 2007. This bill is a \ncompanion bill to legislation introduced by Florida Representatives \nBrown-Waite, Buchanan, and others.\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\n  This bill would establish a Fund within the U.S. Department of \nTreasury, which would sell Federal catastrophe insurance to State \ncatastrophe funds; like the fund I helped to set up in Florida. State \ncatastrophe funds essentially act as reinsurance mechanisms for \ninsurance companies who lack resources to compensate homeowners for \ntheir losses.\n\n  Under this bill, State catastrophe funds would be eligible to \npurchase reinsurance from the Federal fund at sound rates. However, a \nState catastrophe fund would be prohibited from gaining access to the \nFederal fund until private insurance companies and the State \ncatastrophe fund met their financial obligations.\n  Why is this good for homeowners? Because this back-up mechanism will \nimprove the solvency and capacity of homeowners' insurance markets, \nwhich will reduce the chance that consumers will lose their insurance \ncoverage or be hit by huge premium increases.\n  Importantly, the Homeowners Protection Act of 2007 also recognizes \nthat part of the problem with our broken property and casualty \ninsurance system lies with outdated building codes and mitigation \ntechniques. Noted insurance experts and consumer groups have been \npointing out this problem for many years. So, under the bill, the \nSecretary of the Treasury would establish an expert commission to \nassist States in developing mitigation, prevention, recovery, and \nrebuilding programs that would reduce the types of enormous damage we \nhave seen caused by past hurricanes.\n  I note that this bill covers not just hurricanes, but catastrophes \nsuch as tornados, earthquakes, cyclones, catastrophic winter storms, \nand volcanic eruptions. These are disasters that can--and do--occur in \nmany different States. Again, every State and every taxpayer is \naffected by this problem, not just Florida.\n  This bill has widespread support from a broad range of stakeholders, \nincluding ProtectingAmerica.org, a national coalition of first \nresponders, businesses, and emergency managers. This organization is \nco-chaired by former FEMA director James Lee Witt, one of the most \nrespected names in disaster prevention and preparedness.\n  The second bill that Senator Martinez and I are introducing today is \nthe Catastrophic Savings Accounts Act of 2007. This bill proposes \nchanging the Federal tax code to allow homeowners to put money aside--\non a tax-free basis--to grow over time. If and when a catastrophe hits, \na homeowner could take the accumulated savings out of the account to \ncover uninsured losses, deductible expenses, and building upgrades to \nmitigate damage that could be caused in future disasters. Homeowners \ncould even reduce their insurance premiums because their tax-free \nsavings would allow them to choose higher deductibles.\n  The benefits of this approach are pretty straightforward and very \nconsumer friendly. Homeowners would be encouraged to plan in advance \nfor future disasters, and they wouldn't be taxed to do it. Moreover, \nhomeowners wouldn't be as dependent on insurance companies to help them \nout immediately after a disaster. As one expert has noted, why should a \nconsumer continue to give insurance companies thousands of dollars each \nyear when the consumer could deposit the same amount of money annually \nin a tax-free, interest-bearing savings account controlled by the \nconsumer?\n\n  The third bill that Senator Martinez and I are introducing today is \nthe Policyholder Disaster Protection Act of 2007. Under this bill, \ninsurance companies would be permitted to accumulate tax-deferred \ncatastrophic reserves, much like the way that homeowners would be \npermitted under the bill I just discussed. Depending on their size, \ninsurance companies could save up to a certain capped amount, which \nwould grow over time.\n  Our current Federal tax code actually provides a disincentive for \ninsurance companies to accumulate reserve funds for catastrophes. Under \nthe current system, insurance companies can only reserve against losses \nthat have already occurred, instead of future losses. The United States \nis the only industrialized nation that actually taxes reserves in this \nway. It's time for reform, so that consumers are better protected.\n  Make no mistake, though--this bill is not a give-away to the \ninsurance companies. Instead, the Policyholder Disaster Protection Act \nof 2007 would strictly regulate when and how insurance companies could \naccess their reserves, to make sure the money is used only for its \nintended purposes.\n  If implemented correctly, this bill could result in approximately $15 \nbillion worth of reserves being saved up by insurance companies, which \nlater could be spent to pay for policyholder claims and to keep \ninsurance policies available and affordable. Consumers could feel more \nprotected knowing that their insurance company would have the money \nsaved to help them out after a major disaster. Moreover, this approach \nshould help make the insurance market more stable and less prone to \ninsurers going bankrupt.\n  The fourth bill that Senator Martinez and I are introducing is the \nHurricane and Tornado Mitigation Investment Act of 2007. A similar bill \nwas introduced in the House of Representatives by Gus Bilirakis and has \neight cosponsors.\n  We have learned through experience that steps taken to fortify and \nstrengthen homes and businesses can prevent damage in the event of a \ncatastrophe. This bill would allow a tax credit of 25 percent not to \nexceed $5,000 for the costs of building upgrades to mitigate damage \ncaused by hurricanes or tornados.\n  Updates and improvements to roofs, exterior doors and garages would \nbe covered under this bill. To ensure that these measures are \nadequately constructed, a state-certified inspector must examine the \nhome or business. The benefits of this approach are straightforward--\nhome and business owners would be encouraged to plan in advance for \nfuture disasters and take steps to mitigate damage caused by \ncatastrophic events.\n  The fifth bill that Senator Martinez and I are introducing is the \nNonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2007. Last year, a similar \nbill, introduced by Ginny Brown-Waite passed unanimously in the House \nof Representatives.\n  Currently, a small percentage of consumers may be unable to find \ninsurance from a licensed insurer, and may be able to purchase \ninsurance from non-licensed insurers, called nonadmitted or surplus \nlines insurers. These surplus lines insurers often function as a \n``safety valve'' for the insurance market. Florida has more individuals \nin the surplus lines market than any other State.\n  Virtually every sector--insurers, producers, consumers--has voiced \nconcern with the inefficient patchwork of different laws and \nregulations that characterize the surplus lines regulatory system. This \nbill aims to streamline regulations in the surplus lines marketplace \nthrough a mix of national standards with State enforcement and \nuniformity achieved through both incentives and preemption of certain \nState laws. This bill would create a more efficient and streamlined \nregulatory system and promote competition in the nonadmitted \nmarketplace.\n  The sixth bill that Senator Martinez and I are introducing is the \nNational Hurricane Research Initiative Act of 2007. From the storms of \n2004 and 2005 we learned the importance of accurate hurricane tracking \nand prediction. Accurate prediction provides residents of coastal \ncommunities more time to find safe and sound shelter.\n  The objective of this bill is to enhance and improve knowledge of \nhurricanes by harnessing the expertise of the Federal Government's \nscience professionals to better understand hurricane prediction, \nintensity, and mitigation on coastal populations and infrastructure.\n  Let me emphasize again what we need to accomplish to reform our \ncurrent insurance system and to effectively plan for catastrophic \nlosses.\n  We need a comprehensive approach that will make sure the United \nStates is truly prepared for the financial fallout from natural \ndisasters. We need a property and casualty insurance system that is not \nforced to spread valuable taxpayer dollars after a catastrophe strikes. \nWe need a system that protects consumers and small businesses from \nlosing their insurance policies or being forced to pay exorbitant \ninsurance rates. We need ways to encourage responsible construction and \nmitigation techniques. And we need a\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\nsystem that helps insurance companies use their resources in cost-\neffective ways so that they will not go insolvent after major \ndisasters.\n  Our American economy depends on a health property and casualty \ninsurance system. By enacting meaningful reforms, we can ensure that \nour economy remains protected and remains the most resilient economy in \nthe world. I know this complicated process won't be easy for us--but \nlet's roll up our shirtsleeves and get it done.\n  I request that the text of the Homeowners Protection Act of 2007, the \nCatastrophe Savings Accounts Act and the Policyholder Disaster \nProtection Act of 2007 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Policyholder Disaster \n     Protection Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rising costs resulting from natural disasters are \n     placing an increasing strain on the ability of property and \n     casualty insurance companies to assure payment of homeowners' \n     claims and other insurance claims arising from major natural \n     disasters now and in the future.\n       (2) Present tax laws do not provide adequate incentives to \n     assure that natural disaster insurance is provided or, where \n     such insurance is provided, that funds are available for \n     payment of insurance claims in the event of future \n     catastrophic losses from major natural disasters, as present \n     law requires an insurer wishing to accumulate surplus assets \n     for this purpose to do so entirely from its after-tax \n     retained earnings.\n       (3) Revising the tax laws applicable to the property and \n     casualty insurance industry to permit carefully controlled \n     accumulation of pretax dollars in separate reserve funds \n     devoted solely to the payment of claims arising from future \n     major natural disasters will provide incentives for property \n     and casualty insurers to make natural disaster insurance \n     available, will give greater protection to the Nation's \n     homeowners, small businesses, and other insurance consumers, \n     and will help assure the future financial health of the \n     Nation's insurance system as a whole.\n       (4) Implementing these changes will reduce the possibility \n     that a significant portion of the private insurance system \n     would fail in the wake of a major natural disaster and that \n     governmental entities would be required to step in to provide \n     relief at taxpayer expense.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) America needs to take steps to be better prepared for \n     and better protected from catastrophes;\n       (2) the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 are startling \n     reminders of both the human and economic devastation that \n     hurricanes, flooding, and other natural disasters can cause;\n       (3) if a repeat of the deadly 1900 Galveston hurricane \n     occurred again it could cause thousands of deaths and over \n     $36,000,000,000 in loss;\n       (4) if the 1906 San Francisco earthquake occurred again it \n     could cause thousands of deaths, displace millions of \n     residents, destroy thousands of businesses, and cause over \n     $400,000,000,000 in loss;\n       (5) if a Category 5 hurricane were to hit Miami it could \n     cause thousands of deaths and over $50,000,000,000 in loss \n     and devastate the local and national economy;\n       (6) if a repeat of the 1938 ``Long Island Express'' were to \n     occur again it could cause thousands of deaths and over \n     $30,000,000,000 in damage, and if a hurricane that strong \n     were to directly hit Manhattan it could cause over \n     $150,000,000,000 in damage and cause irreparable harm to our \n     Nation's economy;\n       (7) a more comprehensive and integrated approach to dealing \n     with catastrophes is needed;\n       (8) using history as a guide, natural catastrophes will \n     inevitably place a tremendous strain on homeowners' insurance \n     markets in many areas, will raise costs for consumers, and \n     will jeopardize the ability of many consumers to adequately \n     insure their homes and possessions;\n       (9) the lack of sufficient insurance capacity and the \n     inability of private insurers to build enough capital, in a \n     short amount of time, threatens to increase the number of \n     uninsured homeowners, which, in turn, increases the risk of \n     mortgage defaults and the strain on the Nation's banking \n     system;\n       (10) some States have exercised leadership through \n     reasonable action to ensure the continued availability and \n     affordability of homeowners' insurance for all residents;\n       (11) it is appropriate that efforts to improve insurance \n     availability be designed and implemented at the State level;\n       (12) while State insurance programs may be adequate to \n     cover losses from most natural disasters, a small percentage \n     of events is likely to exceed the financial capacity of these \n     programs and the local insurance markets;\n       (13) a limited national insurance backstop will improve the \n     effectiveness of State insurance programs and private \n     insurance markets and will increase the likelihood that \n     homeowners' insurance claims will be fully paid in the event \n     of a large natural catastrophe and that routine claims that \n     occur after a mega-catastrophe will also continue to be paid;\n       (14) it is necessary to provide a national insurance \n     backstop program that will provide more protection at an \n     overall lower cost and that will promote stability in the \n     homeowners' insurance market;\n       (15) it is the proper role of the Federal Government to \n     prepare for and protect its citizens from catastrophes and to \n     facilitate consumer protection, victim assistance, and \n     recovery, including financial recovery; and\n       (16) any Federal reinsurance program must be founded upon \n     sound actuarial principles and priced in a manner that \n     encourages the creation of State funds and maximizes the \n     buying potential of these State funds and encourages and \n     promotes prevention and mitigation, recovery and rebuilding, \n     and consumer education, and emphasizes continuous analysis \n     and improvement.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill for the relief of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Joseph \nGabra and his wife, Sharon Kamel, Egyptian nationals currently living \nwith their children in Camarillo, CA.\n  Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel entered the United States legally on \nNovember 1, 1998, on tourist visas. They immediately filed for \npolitical asylum based on religious persecution.\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\n  The couple fled Egypt because they had been targeted for their active \ninvolvement in the Coptic Christian Church in Egypt. Mr. Gabra was \nrepeatedly jailed by Egyptian authorities because of his work for the \nchurch. In addition, Ms. Kamel's cousin was murdered and her brother's \nbusiness was fire-bombed.\n  When Ms. Kamel became pregnant with their first child, the family was \nwarned by a member of the Muslim brotherhood that if they did not raise \ntheir child as a Muslim, the child would be kidnapped and taken from \nthem.\n  Frightened by these threats, the young family sought refuge in the \nUnited States. Unfortunately, when they sought asylum here, Mr. Gabra, \nwho has a speech impediment, had difficulty communicating his fear of \npersecution to the immigration judge.\n  The judge denied their petition, telling the family that he did not \nsee why they could not just move to another city in Egypt to avoid the \nabuse they were suffering. Since the time that they were denied asylum, \nMs. Kamel's brother, who lived in the same town and suffered similar \nabuse, was granted asylum.\n  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe \nthat, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States \ncitizen children would endure immense and unfair hardship.\n  First, in the nine years that Mr. Gabra and Ms. Kamel have lived \nhere, they have worked to adjust their status through the appropriate \nlegal channels. They came to the United States on a lawful visa and \nimmediately notified authorities of their intent to seek asylum here. \nThey have played by the rules and followed our laws.\n  In addition, during those nine years, the couple has had four U.S. \ncitizen children who do not speak Arabic and are unfamiliar with \nEgyptian culture. If the family is deported, the children would have to \nacclimate to a different culture, language and way of life.\n  Jessica, 8, is the Gabra's oldest child, and in the Gifted and \nTalented Education program in Ventura County. Rebecca, age 7, and \nRafael, age 6, are old enough to understand that they would be leaving \ntheir schools, their teachers, their friends and their home. Veronica, \nthe Gabra's youngest child, is just 18 months old.\n  More troubling is the very real possibility that if sent to Egypt, \nthese four American children would suffer discrimination and \npersecution because of their religion, just as the rest of their family \nreports.\n  Mr. Gabra and Ms. Kamel have made a positive life for themselves and \ntheir family in the United States. Both have earned college degrees in \nEgypt and once in the United States, Mr. Gabra passed the Certified \nPublic Accountant Examination on August 4, 2003. Since arriving here, \nMr. Gabra has consistently worked to support his family.\n  The positive impact they have made on their community is highlighted \nby the fact that I received a letter of support on their behalf signed \nby 160 members of their church and community. From everything I have \nlearned about the family, we can expect that they will continue to \ncontribute to their community in productive ways.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon \nKamel.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the private \nrelief bill and the numerous letters of support my office has received \nfrom members of the Camarillo community be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 933\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel shall \n     each be deemed to have been lawfully admitted to, and \n     remained in, the United States, and shall be eligible for \n     adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence under section 245 of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) upon filing an \n     application for such adjustment of status.\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of permanent resident status to Joseph Gabra and Sharon \n     Kamel, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 2, during the current or subsequent \n     fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of Joseph Gabra and \n     Sharon Kamel's birth under section 202(e) or 203(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e), 1153(a)), \n     as applicable.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 14, 2007.\n       Dear Mrs. Feinstein: I am writing you today to beg you for \n     help. A friend and fellow parent is scheduled for deportation \n     on Monday 2/19 at 10:00 a.m. Her name is Sharon Malak Kamel \n     Hendy (alien # A75-647-452). I was horrified to hear this \n     information. Sharon is a wonderful person and mother. She has \n     4 children: Jessica (8) who is in my son's class, Rebecca. \n     (7), Rafael (6) who is in Kindergarten with my daughter and \n     Veronica (18 months). All of the children are American \n     citizens.\n       Sharon and her husband, Joseph Ayad Gabra Youssef (alien # \n     A75-647-253) came to the United States in 1998. They fled \n     their country of Egypt from terrorist threats on their lives \n     and the life of their unborn child (Jessica) due to the fact \n     that they are Christians. They have pursued all legal \n     avenues, to become citizens. Due to time lines being moved \n     up, both have been notified that deportation will occur. \n     Sharon is the first to receive the notice.\n       I am mortified that the United States would deport hard \n     working people that try to stay the legal way. To top that \n     off, they parents of 4 beautiful American citizen children.\n       Please help Sharon and Joseph with extensions and a way for \n     them to obtain green cards.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration and May God bless \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sharon D.

I am also a California \n     resident and a navy veteran. I am writing on behalf of the \n     Gabra family who has been a member of this congregation for \n     many years.\n       Joseph and Sharon Gabra fled Egypt seeking asylum because \n     of the growing persecution of people who identify themselves \n     with Jesus Christ (Christians). This persecution historically \n     included job and housing discrimination but now is becoming \n     more detrimental to the health and safety of Christians. \n     Kidnapping, rape and murder are common responses against \n     Christians by radical, extremists Muslims in Egypt.\n       Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (Gabra) has received deportation \n     orders and is scheduled to leave Monday, February 19, 2007. \n     She would leave behind four children, all American citizens. \n     Should she take them to Egypt it would be very likely they \n     would be kidnapped or outright murdered. Joseph's case is \n     still pending but the same logic used to send Sharon back \n     would still be expected in his case.\n       I see, on a daily basis, the devastating consequences of \n     raising children without a mother or father in the home. I \n     ask you to intervene on behalf of this family, particularly \n     the American raised children. Please use your influence as a \n     Senator and a spokesperson for the people of California to \n     keep Sharon in the United States and eventually giving the \n     Gabra family permanent status.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Very respectfully,\n     William J.

Time is of the essence \n     as one family member (the mother of their 4 children--ages 8, \n     7, 6 and 18 mos.), who is scheduled for deportation on 2-19-\n     2007. They only received the notice on 2-6-2007; our church \n     family became aware of this problem on 2-11-2007. For your \n     information other family members have already been granted \n     political asylum in the United States. They have complied \n     with all of the laws. Again, this is a problem of \n     bureaucratic overload and we need real human intervention \n     from your office to prevent unnecessary family separation, \n     let alone possible death due to their religion convictions.\n       I plead with your office to grant an extension as they have \n     been working since November 1, 1998 on this goal to become \n     citizens of the United States; from my perspective, their \n     arrival occurred three years before 9-11-2001 and they knew \n     their danger. I already call them citizens of America from my \n     heart as they have shown by their actions and\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\n     commitment to be such with pride and honor.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention on behalf of this \n     beautiful family as your action would show the real intent of \n     the Lady of Liberty in New York Harbor as our country is a \n     land of laws and integrity.\n           Most sincerely,\n     Toni Webster.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Camarillo Community Church,\n\n                                                February 12, 2007.\n       To Whom It May Concern: Please review this deportation \n     possibility and if possible please help us with a reprieve.\n       Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (A75 647 452) has four small \n     children all born in America and is being asked to leave our \n     country back to Egypt. This seems so unreasonable to send a \n     mother of four children to a country that is unfriendly to \n     her religious preference. To separate her from her husband \n     and children seems so un-American.\n       Attached is a Summary of the political asylum for you to \n     review. She has a deportation date of the 19th of February.\n       Thank you for any help you can give this family.

The Gabras are \n     Egyptian nationals who fled Egypt in 1998 due to religious \n     persecution. As Christians in a Muslim society, they \n     experienced terrible persecution; they were threatened by \n     government officials to recant their beliefs and embrace \n     Islam, or suffer the consequences, which meant their child \n     would be taken from them and placed in a home where the child \n     would be raised in Islam. They came to the United States to \n     raise their family and begin a new life. Sharon was pregnant \n     with their first child when they arrived here on a visitor's \n     permit.\n       Since coming to our country they have had four children, \n     one of whom is a good friend of my daughter, McKenna. The \n     Gabras are very involved in our church community, always \n     willing to lend a hand in the children's ministries. Joseph \n     is a college-educated accountant and one of the hardest \n     working men I know, and Sharon has a degree in social work. \n     Both are very well regarded by the people of our church.\n       For several years the Gabras have worked diligently to \n     become U.S. citizens, and have done so in all the right ways, \n     but it appears they are finally out of options. Sharon \n     received a notice last week that she will be deported on \n     February 19, at which time she will be forced to leave her \n     family behind. This means four children under the age of \n     eight, including an 18-month-old, will be left in the care of \n     their father, who must continue to work full-time to support \n     his family.\n       With less than a week before Sharon's deportation, I'm \n     writing to ask that you please stand for this family, that \n     you would intercede on behalf of Sharon Gabra give her family \n     a real chance at achieving their dream of a home in the \n     United States. They are the kind of people we hope will \n     become American citizens--good, honest, moral, and hard-\n     working. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Best regards,\n     Keith James.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Camarillo Community Church,\n\n                                                    Camarillo, CA.\n       To the Hon. Senator Dianne Feinstein: I am writing in \n     regard to Joseph Ayad Gabra Youssef (A 75 647 253) and his \n     wife Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (A 75 647 452). This Christian \n     couple has applied for asylum in the United States because \n     their lives were threatened by Moslem terrorists in their \n     home country of Egypt. They fled Egypt in 1998 when Sharon \n     was pregnant with their first child, hoping to find a safe \n     place to raise their children. They have been seeking asylum \n     here in the U.S, but the process has been slow and difficult. \n     They now have four children and the children are all citizens \n     of the United States, having been born here. This is a \n     wonderful young family that has become a valued part of our \n     church and community, but they are now being threatened with \n     immediate deportation. Our entire church congregation is very \n     concerned for the welfare of this family and fearful of the \n     consequence of their return to Egypt. Please, we earnestly \n     request your help in assisting this family.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph Rittenhouse,\n     Senior Pastor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Camarillo Community Church,\n\n                                                February 14, 2007.\n       Senator Barbara Feinstein: I faxed a note to you yesterday \n     and apparently the bottom portion of the note was cut off in \n     the fax so I am resending the fax with this, a more detailed \n     letter. Yesterday's note was written in a hurry because of \n     the urgent nature of this request.\n       I am a Licensed Minister, Pastor of Children's Ministries \n     at Camarillo Community Church in Camarillo, California. I \n     have held this position for two years and prior to that I was \n     the director of a Preschool and After School Program at \n     Trinity Presbyterian Church in Camarillo, California. I have \n     a true love and desire to see young children grow to become \n     confident, successful adults and know that it is only in \n     building up the child that we avoid the difficult task of \n     rebuilding the broken man. The issue I am bringing to your \n     attention deals with the brokenness of man which is now \n     impacting the lives of four children and their parents who \n     have become very precious to me and the community of \n     Camarillo.\n       It is hard for me, as an American, to truly grasp the \n     dangers Christians face in the Muslim world; however, the \n     threats that caused Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (A 75 647 253) \n     and Joseph Ayad Gabra Youssef (A 75 647 452) to flee Egypt \n     were real and continue to be present for them should they be \n     forced to leave our country. The evil caused by children who \n     have been raised in hatred, towards Americans and/or non \n     Muslims, who have now become adults in leadership--\n     terrorists--is REAL. Until we can break the cycle of hatred \n     and replace it with love and respect one for another \n     regardless of birth place or faith we will continue to \n     struggle with adults filled with evil. In the meantime we \n     must do all we can to protect those in our area from the \n     evils of terrorism.\n       Although the Gabra family has been active within our \n     church, it was not until Sunday, February 11, 2007 that we \n     became aware of the gravity of their situation. They have \n     been trying to handle the issue on their own so as not to be \n     a burden to anyone. They came to America for Safety rather \n     than financial gain and do not wish to be a burden on our \n     society. I do not understand the legal hoops that have to be \n     jumped to keep Sharon from deportation on February 19, 2007--\n     but I do know that the family has been attempting to meet the \n     requirements and jump through the hoops ever since their \n     arrival in 1999. It seems that they have, up to this point, \n     received less than appropriate or fair treatment in our court \n     system.\n       The children, Jessica, age 8, Rebecca, age 7, Raphael, age \n     6 and Veronica, 18 months are all American born, English \n     speaking children. They fit the profile of typical American \n     children, attending public school, active in our children's \n     ministries programs on Sundays and weekdays for AWANA and \n     other children's events. Without knowledge of their parent's \n     birthplace, one would never know there was a difference \n     between them and their American born peers. They are a family \n     who treasures one another and desires to be a blessing to \n     those around them in a safe society. The deportation of their \n     mother to Egypt--a place where her, her husband's, and the \n     life of their unborn first child were threatened unless they \n     turn from Christianity and return to Islam--would be \n     devastating.\n       It is my hope that you will be able to use your legal \n     authority to stop the deportation scheduled for February 19, \n     2007. Know that there are many in Camarillo depending on your \n     leadership to help in this matter. We commit to follow the \n     laws of our country in order to bring this family to safety. \n     We are asking for the time to help them fulfill the \n     requirements.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Elaine Francisco,\n     Pastor of Children's Ministries.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 12, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I hope that you will please take \n     the time to read this letter for immediate help to the Gabra \n     family. The mother of this family is scheduled to be deported \n     on 2/19/2007 and the father fears the same. The big problem \n     is that the family has four children between the ages of 8 \n     years and 18 months and are all American Citizens. This \n     family fled Egypt in 1998 because they were pregnant with \n     their first child and were threatened to have their child \n     taken from them because of their Christian beliefs. They came \n     on a visitor's visa and did all the required steps to become \n     legal. After 9/11/2001 they thought they would have a better \n     chance, but by then they were allowing only one Judge to \n     review the cases instead of 3 which shortened the time for \n     accomplishing the same number of cases. By the law they \n     became illegal and were subject to deportation.\n       Only the Mother, Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (Alien Number: A \n     75-647-452) received notice of deportation. She is to be \n     deported 2/19/2007. This would leave her husband Joseph Ayad \n     Gabra Youssef (Alien Number: A 75-647-253) here to work and \n     care for 4 children from age 8 yrs. to 18 months. His \n     deportation notice will probably come next and this will lead \n     to danger for the children. If this happens, the children \n     would suffer the most in Egypt from the Terrorists because \n     they only speak English.\n       I have taught Sunday school to 3 of their children and they \n     are a lovely, hard working, honest family and want to become \n     citizens. If they are deported their lives are in danger. \n     Also, as Christians, they will not be able to find \n     employment. The children are as follows: Jessica Gabra--8 \n     years; Rebecca Gabra--7 years; Rafael Gabra--6 years; \n     Veronica Gabra--18 months.\n       Please help us to get an extension for Sharon and a way for \n     them to get green cards. They are the kind of people our \n     country would be proud to have as citizens.\n       I'm pleading with you to help us. I know the time is short, \n     but they just received the\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\n     deportation notice 6 days ago. We would be forever in your \n     debt if you can help the Gabra Family. This family is fearing \n     for their lives and safety right now.\n           Sincerely,\n     Linda Davis.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                John F.

His wife \n     has been ordered to appear on Feb. 19th for deportation. I \n     have known the Gabra family for a number of years and am \n     writing in hopes that you will intervenue on his wife's \n     behalf and either: a. Seek a stay of execution of the order \n     to deport Mrs. Gabra; or b. Help them to arrange a green card \n     to allow her to remain in the U.S.\n       Mr. Gabra is a great asset to our community. He is employed \n     by a client of mine as an accountant and I have seen \n     firsthand the tremendous integrity and thoroughness that he \n     brings to his job each day. He is a wonderful example to his \n     co-workers and the general public.\n       Joseph was not always working as an accountant here even \n     though he is a CPA in his native country. Finding work as an \n     accountant was difficult due to a speech impediment. But he \n     has always been a hard worker, taking manual labor jobs to \n     stay off any public assistance. He has now been working in \n     his field and my client is thrilled with the job he is doing. \n     In addition, he travels to Cal State Northridge to get help \n     with his speech problem.\n       Mrs. Gabra is a homemaker and takes care of their four \n     children that range from 8 years old to 18 months. She is \n     involved at our church as well in a number of programs. The \n     family has been a great addition to my church and the \n     Camarillo community in general.\n       But if Mrs. Gabra is deported, the damage will not just be \n     to the community. There is danger that faces the family if \n     they are returned to Egypt. Mr. Gabra will not be able to \n     find work there because he is a Christian. The family will \n     face incredible persecution. The kids are U.S. citizens who \n     will suffer if they are sent to Egypt because they do not \n     speake the language and they are Christians, not Muslim. They \n     could be forced to convert to Islam or be killed. The girls \n     face a barbaric ritual of female circumcision. They are \n     dedicated to each other as a family. So, while Mrs. Gabra is \n     the only one being forced to leave at this time, splitting up \n     the family into two countries is simply not an option.\n       Senator, Mr. Gabra is a man of faith. He is confident that \n     God will provide a rcsolution to this problem. I, too, am a \n     man of faith. But I believe that perhaps God will use you to \n     provide the miracle that the Gabra family needs now in order \n     to stay together. I am asking you to intercede on their \n     behalf.\n       Thank you and your staff for taking the time to read this \n     and consider my request. He's a good man. They are a good \n     family. And they deserve better than the death sentence the \n     U.S. Government is giving them. His letter follows along with \n     the order from the Dept. of Homeland Security. Please help.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                           John F. Laubacher, CPA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Martinez):\n  S. 934. A bill to amend the Florida National Forest Land Management \nAct of 2003 to authorize the conveyance of an additional tract of \nNational Forest System land under that Act, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that helps the U.S. Forest Service to protect sensitive and \nprecious forest by selling developed land in Leon County, FL, in order \nto purchase at-risk land in the heart of our national forests.\n  Specifically, this bill allows for the sale of tract W-1979, which is \n114 acres in Tallahassee, the proceeds of which are specifically \ndesignated to purchase private inholdings in the Apalachicola National \nForest. The Forest Service believes that W-1979 has lost its national \nforest character and is unmanageable; the land will be sold to Leon \nCounty, where it will help the continued advancement of Blueprint 2000, \na series of community initiatives to improve Tallahassee and Leon \nCounty. By selling this land on the outskirt of the Apalachicola \nNational Forest, the Forest Service can acquire precious land in the \nheart of the forest that could be lost to development.\n  This legislation also gives the U.S. Forest Service in Florida the \nsame flexibility to manage lands and capital that many other states \nhave. Previously, whenever National Forest land was sold, the funds \ncould only be used to purchase more land, while many important \ninfrastructure projects went undone. With passage of this bill, \nproceeds only from the sale of ``non-green'' lands can go towards \ncapitol improvements, such as administrative facilities that help the \nForest Service manage the Ocala, Apalachicola, and Osceola National \nForests.

A bill to repeal the requirement for reduction of survivor \nannuities under the Survivor Benefit Plan by veterans' dependency and \nindemnity compensation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and \nSenators Hagel, Bingaman, Kerry, Mikulski, Lincoln, Biden, Vitter, \nDomenici, Martinez, Salazar, Snowe, Brown, Feinstein, Murray, and \nClinton, I am honored to introduce legislation today that we are \nconvinced is necessary to fix a long-standing problem in our military \nsurvivors benefits system.\n  President Lincoln's words are as relevant and moving today as they \nwere during the Civil War: ``as God gives us to see the right, let us \nstrive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; \nto care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and \nhis orphan.''\n  Our Nation continues to be engaged in a violent struggle against \nbrutal and vicious enemies around the world. Sadly, Americans are lost \nevery day. We must never forget that the families left behind by our \ncourageous men and women in uniform bear the greatest pain. Their \nsurvivors face a life forever altered, and a future left unclear. They \nsuffer the greatest cost of the ultimate sacrifice, and the nation that \nasked for that sacrifice must honor it.\n  Back in 1972, Congress established the military survivors' benefits \nplan--\n\n[[Page S3372]]\n\nor SBP--to provide retirees' survivors an annuity to protect their \nincome. This benefit plan is a voluntary program purchased by the \nretiree or issued automatically in the case of servicemembers who die \nwhile on active duty. Retired servicemembers pay for this benefit from \ntheir retired pay. Upon their death, their spouse or dependent children \ncan receive up to 55 percent of their retired pay as an annuity.\n  For over five years, I've been talking about the unfair and painful \noffset between SBP and the Department of Veterans Affairs' Dependency \nand Indemnity Compensation, or DIC, which is received by the surviving \nspouse of an active duty or retired military member who dies from a \nservice-connected cause. Under current law, even if the surviving \nspouse of such a servicemember is eligible for SBP, that purchased \nannuity is reduced by the amount of DIC received. Another inequity in \nthe current system is the delayed effective date for ``paid-up status'' \nunder SBP. We should act to correct these injustices this year.\n  We have made progress, but even with the important changes made over \nthe last few years, the offset still fails to take care of our military \nwidows and surviving children the way it should. We have considered and \nadopted increased death gratuity benefits for the survivors of our \ntroops lost in this war, and we have changed the law to enable these \nsurvivors to automatically enroll in SBP. However, now we see the pain \ncaused when at the same moment a widow is enrolled in SBP she is hit \nwith the DIC offset.\n  The SBP offset is no less painful for the survivors of our 100 \npercent disabled military retirees. SBP is a purchased annuity plan. \nBefore coming to the U.S. Senate, I served as Insurance Commissioner \nfor the State of Florida, and I know of no other purchased annuity \nprogram that can then turn around and refuse to pay you the benefits \nyou purchased on the grounds that you are getting a different benefit \nfrom somewhere else.\n  Our Federal civil servants receive both their purchased survivor \nincome protection annuity and any disability compensation for which \nthey may be entitled--without offset. Why on earth would we treat our \n100 percent disabled military retirees any differently, especially \nafter they have given the best years of their lives and their health in \nservice to the Nation?\n  Let me be clear about this: survivors of servicemembers are entitled \nin law to automatic enrollment in SBP; 100 percent disabled military \nretirees purchase SBP. Survivors stand to lose most or even all of the \nbenefits under SBP only because they are also entitled to DIC.\n  This legislation also accelerates an improvement we made earlier to \nthe SBP program. We have already agreed that military retirees who have \nreached the age of 70 and paid their SBP premiums for thirty years \nshould stop paying a premium, but we delayed the effective date for \nthis relief until 2008. We should not delay their relief any further.\n  The United States owes its very existence to generations of soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines who have sacrificed throughout our history \nto keep us free. The sacrifices of today are no less important to \nAmerican liberty or tragic when a life is lost in the defense of \nliberty everywhere.\n  We owe them and their surviving family members a great debt.\n  Unfortunately, it is too often that we fall short on this care. We \nmust meet this obligation with the same sense of honor as was the \nservice they and their families have rendered.\n  We will continue to work to do right by those who have given this \nNation their all, and especially for the loved ones they may leave to \nour care.\n  I appreciate the co-sponsorship of my colleagues--Senators Hagel, \nBingaman, Kerry, Mikulski, Lincoln, Biden, Vitter, Domenici, Martinez, \nSalazar, Snowe, Brown, Feinstein, Murray, and Clinton--and look forward \nto working with my colleagues in the days ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 935\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From \n     Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the \n     current system of privately financed campaigns for election \n     to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often \n     perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United \n     States by--\n       (1) creating a conflict of interest, perceived or real, by \n     encouraging Senators to accept large campaign contributions \n     from private interests that are directly affected by Federal \n     legislation;\n       (2) diminishing or giving the appearance of diminishing a \n     Senator's accountability to constituents by compelling \n     legislators to be accountable to the major contributors who \n     finance their election campaigns;\n       (3) violating the democratic principle of ``one person, one \n     vote'' and diminishing the meaning of the right to vote by \n     allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and \n     unfair influence within the political process;\n       (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through \n     legislative and regulatory outcomes shaped by unequal access \n     to lawmakers for campaign contributors;\n       (5) driving up the cost of election campaigns, making it \n     difficult for qualified candidates without personal wealth or \n     access to campaign contributions from monied individuals and \n     interest groups to mount competitive Senate election \n     campaigns;\n       (6) disadvantaging challengers, because large campaign \n     contributors tend to donate their money to incumbent \n     Senators, thus causing Senate elections to be less \n     competitive; and\n       (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with \n     fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry \n     out their public responsibilities.\n       (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From \n     the Senate Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and \n     declares that providing the option of the replacement of \n     private campaign contributions with allocations from the \n     Senate Fair Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and \n     general elections to the Senate would enhance American \n     democracy by--\n       (1) eliminating the potentially inherent conflict of \n     interest created by the private financing of the election \n     campaigns of public officials, thus restoring public \n     confidence in the integrity and fairness of the electoral and \n     legislative processes;\n       (2) increasing the public's confidence in the \n     accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect \n     them;\n       (3) helping to eliminate access to wealth as a determinant \n     of a citizen's influence within the political process and to \n     restore meaning to the principle of ``one person, one vote'';\n       (4) reversing the escalating cost of elections and saving \n     taxpayers billions of dollars that are (or that are perceived \n     to be) currently allocated based upon legislative and \n     regulatory agendas skewed by the influence of campaign \n     contributions;\n       (5) creating a more level playing field for incumbents and \n     challengers by creating genuine opportunities for all \n     Americans to run for the Senate and by encouraging more \n     competitive elections; and\n       (6) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with \n     raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their \n     public responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to improve support and services for individuals with \nautism and their families; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I, along with my colleague \nSenator Allard, am proud to introduce the Expanding the Promise for \nIndividuals with Autism Act (EPIAA.) This legislation will help to \nincrease the availability of treatments, services, and interventions \nfor both children and adults with autism.\n  Last year, I worked with my colleagues on the HELP Committee to pass \nthe Combating Autism Act into law. This important bill will increase \nthe amount and type of research we are doing to understand the origins \nof this disease, and help us develop new treatments--and eventually--a \ncure. It will also help to increase the ability of our health \nprofessionals to screen and diagnose autism as early as possible in \nchildren, so as to improve our ability to treat this disease.\n  But while we are carrying out the research that will lead us to gain \na better understanding of this disorder, we cannot forget those who are \nand who have been living with this disease today--the families who are \ndesperate for assistance and help with a disorder that so often shuts \noff individuals from the world around them.\n  The need for this legislation is evident--we continue to see an \nincreasing number of individuals with autism. Last month, the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention released numbers that estimate that \none in every 150 children are living with an autism spectrum disorder, \nnumbers that are higher than those released even just a few short years \nago. And our service delivery system for individuals with autism is \nbeing overwhelmed by this increase. The care involved in treating these \nsymptoms often requires hours of intensive therapy every week--regimens \nthat are often inaccessible to many families.\n  While we do not know what causes autism, we do know that with early \nintervention and concentrated treatment, the symptoms of autism \nspectrum disorder can be mitigated, enabling individuals with autism \nand their families to live less isolated lives. Our legislation will \nprovide additional treatment and support resources, increasing access \nto effective therapies and essential support services for people with \nautism.\n  This legislation will do the following: Establish a Demonstration \nGrant Program to Assist States with Service Provision. While the \nInteragency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) is developing a long-\nterm strategy for providing autism care and treatment services, there \nis currently no effort to plan for improved access to services in the \nimmediate future. The EPIAA would establish a Treatment, Interventions \nand Services Evaluation Task Force to evaluate evidence-based services \nthat could be implemented by States in the years immediately following \nenactment. The Secretary would then provide grants to states to help \nprovide the services identified by the Task Force to individuals with \nautism.\n  Develop a Demonstration Grant Program for Adult Autism Services. \nWhile early diagnosis and treatment are critical for children with \nautism, the need for intervention and services continues across the \nlifespan. In order to help address the needs of adults living with \nautism, the EPIAA would establish a grant program for states to provide \nappropriate interventions and services, such as housing or vocational \ntraining, to adults with autism.\n  Increase Access to Services Following Diagnosis. After receiving a \ndiagnosis of autism, many children and families must wait months before \ngaining access to appropriate treatment. In order to improve the \nability to access a minimum level of services during this post-\ndiagnosis period, the EPIAA would mandate that the Secretary develop \nguidance and provide funding to eliminate delays in access to \nsupplementary health care, behavioral support services, and individual \nand family-support services.\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\n  Increase Support for Developmental Disabilities Centers of \nExcellence. Many families report difficulties in accessing services \nbecause of the limited number of health and education professionals who \nare trained to provide autism-specific services. In order to increase \nthe number of individuals across sectors that can provide adequate care \nand treatment services for individuals living with autism, the EPIAA \nwould increase the capacity of University Centers for Excellence in \nDevelopmental Disabilities Education, Research and Service (UCEDDS) to \ntrain professionals in meeting the treatment, interventions and service \nneeds of both children and adults living with autism.\n  Improve Protection and Advocacy Services. Early statistics from 2006 \nindicate that a quarter of individuals served under already-existing \nprotection and advocacy programs are individuals with autism, a 6 \npercent increase from the previous year, yet thousands of individuals \nwith autism are unable to access these services due to a lack of \nresources. The EPIAA will create a program to expand currently existing \nprotection and advocacy services to assist individuals with autism and \nother emerging populations of individuals with disabilities.\n  Improves Technical Assistance and Evaluation. The EPIAA would \nestablish a National Technical Assistance Center for Autism Treatments, \nInterventions and Services to act as a clearinghouse for information \nabout evidence-based treatments, interventions and services, and \nanalyze the grant programs under this Act.\n  The organizations supporting this legislation include Autism Speaks, \nthe Autism Society of America, Easter Seals, the Association of \nUniversity Centers for Disability, the Disability Policy Collaboration, \nand the National Disability Rights Network, and I have included their \nletters of support to be printed in the Record.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Allard and all of our \ncolleagues to pass this legislation and help people with autism get the \nservices they need.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Autism Speaks,\n\n                                     New York, NY, March 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: I write to offer the enthusiastic \n     endorsement of Autism Speaks for your proposed legislation, \n     ``The Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act \n     of 2007'' (``EPIAA'') and to thank you for your ongoing \n     leadership in providing an appropriate and necessary federal \n     response to the urgent national public health issue of \n     autism.\n       Your bill is the logical next step for Congress to take in \n     creating a national battle plan against autism, following the \n     passage last year, with your significant support, of the \n     Combating Autism Act.\n       The CAA deals primarily with biomedical research and with \n     systems for the early identification of children with autism. \n     The EPIAA will expand and intensify the federal commitment to \n     the provision of services to persons with autism, from the \n     immediate period following their diagnosis, throughout their \n     lifespan.\n       In addition to the authorization of critical new resources \n     for important initiatives related to treatments, \n     interventions and services for both children and adults with \n     autism, Autism Speaks applauds the Congressional finding you \n     have drafted into the EPIAA that--``Individuals living with \n     autism have the same rights as other individuals to exert \n     control and choice over their own lives, to live \n     independently, and to fully participate in and contribute to \n     their communities . . .''\n\n       The range of grant programs authorized by the EPIAA will \n     demonstrate mechanisms to fill large gaps in the present \n     system for the delivery of autism treatments, interventions \n     and services. The task force to be created by your \n     legislation--including vital input from the autism \n     community--will facilitate consensus on the state of \n     evidence-based treatments and services. And the GAO study, \n     which your legislation requires, will provide the basis for \n     dramatically improved service provision and financing.\n       Once again, please accept the support and gratitude of \n     Autism Speaks for the EPIAA. We look forward to working with \n     you and your fine staff to enact these essential policies \n     into law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert C. Wright.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Autism Society of America,\n\n                                     Bethesda, MD, March 20, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton and Senator Allard: On behalf of the \n     1.5 million Americans with autism and their families, we at \n     the Autism Society of America (ASA) write in strong support \n     of the Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act \n     of 2007.\n       Autism is a complex developmental disability that affects \n     the normal functioning of the brain, impacting development in \n     the areas of social interaction and communication skills. \n     Both children and adults with autism typically show \n     difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social \n     interactions, and sensory processing. Research has \n     demonstrated that with early diagnosis, treatment, and \n     intervention, however, individuals with autism can experience \n     positive change in the language, social, or cognitive \n     outcomes. Unfortunately, as the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention's autism prevalence study of 2007 showed, far \n     too many children with autism are not accessing the early \n     interventions, treatments, and services that they need.\n       Just as critical, our current system for providing \n     community based services does not meet the complex needs of \n     adults with autism. Frequently, staff is not trained and \n     experienced in autism and is often at a loss when trying to \n     handle the unusual language, cognitive, behavioral and social \n     deficits of autism. As a result, adults with autism are not \n     able to access employment, health care, housing, and \n     community support services.\n       The Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act \n     addresses these problems in many ways. This critical \n     legislation provides approximately $350 million to improve \n     access to comprehensive treatments, interventions, and \n     services for individuals with autism and their families. The \n     Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act comes \n     at a time when autism prevalence is increasing to more than 1 \n     in 150 children in America today. As our Nation faces the \n     epidemic of autism, we must take steps now to strengthen our \n     services infrastructure to meet the needs of individuals with \n     autism and their families so that they too can lead happy and \n     productive lives throughout their lives.\n       ASA strongly supports the Expanding the Promise for \n     Individuals With Autism Act of 2007, and applauds you for \n     your leadership on this important issue. We urge all Senators \n     to join you in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n       Thank you, again, for your support of people with autism \n     and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Lee Grossman,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Disability Policy Collaboration,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The Disability Policy Collaboration \n     (DPC), a partnership of The Arc of the United States and \n     United Cerebral Palsy, appreciates your leadership on behalf \n     of children and adults with autism spectrum disorders and \n     related developmental disabilities. The DPC is pleased to \n     support the ``Expanding the Promise for Individuals with \n     Autism Act of 2007'' and its emphasis on developing and \n     providing effective interventions, supports and services to \n     individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their \n     families.\n       Most individuals with autism spectrum disorder and related \n     developmental disabilities need major assistance in the areas \n     of early intervention, education, employment, transportation, \n     housing and health. Expanding the capacity of the service \n     delivery system to meet these needs and providing better \n     coordination of services will enable the individuals and \n     families to access appropriate assistance to live \n     independently and fully participate in their communities.\n       The Disability Policy Collaboration applauds your \n     commitment to individuals with autism spectrum disorders and \n     related developmental disabilities and their families and \n     looks forward to working with you on speedy passage of this \n     bill in the 110th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul Marchand,\n     Staff Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                Association of University Centers on Disabilities,\n                                Silver Spring, MD, March 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the Association of \n     University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD), this letter is to \n     thank you for your outstanding work and leadership on behalf \n     of children and adults with autism spectrum disorders and \n     related developmental disabilities. AUCD is in strong support \n     of your legislation to develop and provide effective \n     treatments, interventions, supports and services to \n     individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their \n     families.\n       The prevalence of autism appears to be growing. According \n     to a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the prevalence of autism has reached epidemic \n     proportions, now affecting one in every 150 children. Clearly \n     from the information we get from our Centers and families, \n     our current service system is unprepared to meet the growing \n     needs of individuals with autism and their families. There \n     are pressing needs for trained professionals and providers\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\n     to better serve children and adults with autism with the \n     latest evidence based information and effective practices. \n     Furthermore, while early detection and treatment are \n     essential, families of children with autism often face \n     numerous obstacles for obtaining high quality services for \n     their children. Similarly, adults with autism face long \n     waiting lists and many barriers in obtaining appropriate \n     community-based supports and services to enable them to \n     participate fully in society. The Expanding the Promise to \n     Individuals with Autism Act that you have developed greatly \n     helps to address these issues by providing demonstration \n     grants to states to provide immediate assistance to \n     individuals and their families.\n       The membership of AUCD includes a network of 67 University \n     Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities located \n     in every U.S. state and territory. These University Centers \n     provide research, education, and service to further \n     independence, productivity, and quality of life for \n     individuals with developmental disabilities, including \n     autism. University Centers collaborate with stakeholders in \n     states to identify and address training needs in creative and \n     effective ways. As the prevalence of autism has risen, \n     University Centers have initiated many activities to help \n     meet the growing need for children, adults, and families. \n     This bill builds upon these efforts by expanding the capacity \n     of University Centers to focus on interdisciplinary training \n     of professionals and providers in the area of autism, provide \n     technical assistance, and disseminate information on \n     effective community-based treatment, interventions and \n     services.\n       AUCD applauds your commitment to individuals with autism \n     and their families and looks forward to working with you on \n     speedy passage of this bill in the 110th Congress.\n       Sincerely,\n     Royal Walker,\n       Board President & Associate Director, Institute for \n     Disability Studies, University of Southern Mississippi.\n     George Jesien,\n       Executive Director, AUCD.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Easter Seals,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: Easter Seals is pleased to support \n     the Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act of \n     2007. This legislation will go a long way to help children \n     and adults with autism spectrum disorders and other \n     developmental disabilities live, learn, work and play in \n     their communities.\n       The Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act \n     of 2007 (EPIAA) is necessary legislation that must become \n     law. Research has demonstrated that children who are \n     diagnosed by age 2 and who receive appropriate services can \n     live with greater independence. Yet, too many children are \n     not diagnosed until age 5. The EPIAA will allow us to do \n     better for these children. Parents and young adults with \n     autism across the country report that too many youth exit the \n     school system, needing housing and job training opportunities \n     that are in short supply. The EPIAA will allow us to do \n     better. Finally, parents, schools, and communities are \n     struggling to find the answers of how to provide appropriate \n     services and supports to individuals with autism. The EPIAA \n     will allow us to do better in this area as well.\n       Over the last 20 years, Easter Seals has seen a dramatic \n     increase in the number of people we serve who live with \n     autism. More than a generation ago, Easter Seals was front \n     and center during the polio epidemic, working tirelessly to \n     help children and adults with polio gain the skills they need \n     to live independently. Today, we are the country's leading \n     provider of services for people with autism.\n       Thank you for sponsoring this important legislation. We \n     look forward to working with you on the enactment of the \n     Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act of \n     2007.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Katherine Beh Neas,\n     Director, Congressional Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Disability\n\n\n                                               Rights Network,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Clinton and Allard: The National Disability \n     Rights Network (NDRN) is pleased with your introduction of \n     the Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act of \n     2007. NDRN is the nonprofit membership organization for the \n     federally mandated Protection and Advocacy (P) Systems and \n     Client Assistance Programs (CAP). The P/CAP network \n     operates in every state and territory in the United States. \n     Collectively, the P/CAP network is the largest provider of \n     legally based advocacy services to people with disabilities \n     in the United States.\n       Currently, the P network is on the front-line of work \n     with individuals with autism and their families. Early \n     statistics from FY 2006 indicate that 25 percent of the \n     people served by the Protection and Advocacy for \n     Developmental Disabilities program (PADD) were individuals \n     with autism. This is an increase of 6 percent from the \n     previous year. Unfortunately, due to the high demand for P \n     services from children and adults with all types of \n     disabilities and their families--and the concomitant \n     inadequate funding for the P programs--thousands of \n     individuals with autism were unable to access critical P \n     services.\n       Key components of the P network's legally based advocacy \n     include investigating abuse and neglect; seeking systemic \n     change to prevent harm to children and adults with \n     disabilities; advocating for basic human and civil rights; \n     and ensuring accountability in education, employment, \n     housing, public services, transportation, and health care. \n     Each of these components is critical to ensuring that \n     individuals with autism--no matter their age--get access to \n     the supports and services they need to live as successfully \n     and as safely as possible in the community.\n       Parents of children with autism--both young children and \n     adult children--know the important role that P services can \n     play in their lives. They have advocated for the inclusion of \n     a P component in this legislation in order to increase the \n     ability to serve this vulnerable population. These families \n     know that once this program is authorized and funded, the P \n     in their state will be mandated to make autism a priority for \n     services, providing individuals and their families with the \n     help needed to live full and successful lives.\n       NDRN is pleased to work with you on the passage of this \n     legislation, and to ensure that critical services and \n     supports are available to both children and adults with \n     autism. For more information, please contact Kathy McGinley, \n     Deputy Executive Director for Public Policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Curt Decker,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 938. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to expand \ncollege access and increase college persistence, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, \n        and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 939. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to simplify \nand improve the process of applying for student assistance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce two bipartisan bills to \nexpand access to college for students and their families.\n  We are slated to reauthorize the Higher Education Act this Congress \nfor the first time since 1998. The key to this reauthorization will be \nensuring that we make a substantial Federal investment in need-based \ngrant aid. I am pleased we took a significant first step down this path \nlast month by increasing the maximum Pell Grant, the Federal \nGovernment's primary source of need-based financial aid, for the first \ntime in four years. However, we are still far from the robust lift \nCongress provided students and their families in the mid-1970s, when \nthe maximum Pell Grant covered 84 percent of costs at a public 4-year \ninstitution. Today, it covers only 32 percent.\n  There has also been a concurrent increase in college costs. According \nto a recent report by the College Board, for the 2006-07 school year, \ntuition rose 6.3 percent at 4-year public colleges and 5.9 percent for \n4-year private institutions. The combination of declining Federal \ninvestments in need-based aid and sharp increases in college costs has \npriced more and more qualified individuals out of college.\n  This is particularly troubling, given the strong correlation between \neducational attainment, employment, and wages. A college education has \nnow increasingly become a necessary requirement for upward income \nmobility. College graduates, on average, earn 62 percent more than high \nschool graduates. Over a lifetime, the gap in earnings between those \nwith a high school diploma and a bachelor's or higher degree exceeds $1 \nmillion.\n  To help increase the amount of need-based grant aid to low-income \nstudents and fulfill their unmet financial aid need, today I introduce \nthe ACCESS, Accessing College through Comprehensive Early Outreach and \nState Partnerships, Act, cosponsored by Senators Collins, Kennedy, \nMurray, Dodd, and\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\nSanders. This legislation improves the Leveraging Educational \nAssistance Partnership or LEAP program by forging a new Federal \nincentive for States to form partnerships with businesses, colleges, \nand private or philanthropic organizations to provide low-income \nstudents with increased need-based grant aid, early information and \nassurance of aid eligibility (beginning in middle school), and early \nintervention, mentoring, and outreach services. Research has shown that \ncollege access programs that combine these elements are successful in \nmaking the dream of higher education a reality. Students participating \nin such programs are more financially and academically prepared, and \nthus, more likely to enroll in college and persist to degree \ncompletion.\n  Since 1972, the Federal-State partnership embodied by LEAP, with \nmodest Federal support, has helped leverage State grant aid to low-and \nmoderate-income students. Without this important Federal incentive, \nmany States would never have established need-based financial aid \nprograms, and many States would not continue to maintain such programs. \nLast year, States matched approximately $65 million in Federal LEAP \nfunds with over $840 million in supplemental need-based aid. By way of \nexample, in my home State of Rhode Island, the Federal investment of \napproximately $350,000 in LEAP funds spurred the State to expend over \n$13 million in need-based aid.\n  The second bill I introduce today, the FAFSA Financial Aid Form \nSimplification and Access Act, cosponsored by Senators Collins, \nKennedy, Murray, and Sanders, has several key components to make the \ncollege financial aid application process both simple and certain. \nFirst, our legislation would allow more students to qualify for an \nautomatic-zero expected family contribution, or auto-zero, and align \nthe auto-zero eligibility levels, income of $30,000 or less, with the \nstandards of other Federal means-tested programs like school lunch, \nSSI, and food stamps. Second, the FAFSA Act would establish a short \npaper FAFSA or EZ-FAFSA for students who qualify for the auto-zero. \nThird, the bill phases out the long form, using the savings to utilize \n``smart'' technology to create a tailored web-based application form \nand ensure that students answer only the questions needed to determine \nfinancial aid eligibility in the state in which they reside. For those \nstudents who do not have access to the Internet, we propose creating a \nfree telefile system for filing by phone.\n  The FAFSA Act would also emphasize providing students with the \nopportunity to complete financial applications earlier in order to \nreceive early estimates of aid eligibility. This legislation would \ncreate a pilot program to test an early application system under which \ndependent students would apply for an aid estimate in their junior \nyear, using the student's prior/prior year income (PPY). The pilot \nprogram also includes a requirement that the Secretary study the \nfeasibility, benefits, and adverse effects of utilizing information \nfrom the IRS in order to simplify the financial aid process.\n  I was pleased to work with the Advisory Committee on Student \nFinancial Assistance and a host of other higher education organizations \nand charitable foundations on these bills. I am also pleased that both \nbills are supported by a range of higher education and student groups, \nincluding the American Association of Community Colleges, the American \nCouncil on Education, the Association of American Universities, the \nAssociation of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, the Center for Law and \nSocial Policy, the National Association of College Admission \nCounseling, the National Association of Independent Colleges and \nUniversities, the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid \nPrograms, the National Association of Student Financial Aid \nAdministrators, the United States Student Association, and the College \nParents of America. The FAFSA Act is supported by the Council of \nGraduate Schools as well.\n  We must act on these bills and continue to push for increased Federal \ninvestment in need-based aid to middle- and low-income students and \ntheir families.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the subpart F exemption for active financing income; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friends and \nColleagues, Senator Hatch and Senator Crapo in introducing legislation \nto make permanent the tax treatment in Subpart F for active financial \nservices income earned abroad.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today is identical to a bill \nwe introduced in the 109th Congress. Since then, this exemption has \nbeen temporarily extended. But that extension will expire at the end of \nnext year. This exemption ensures that the active financial services \nincome earned abroad by American financial services companies, or \nAmerican manufacturing firms with a financial services operation, is \nnot subject to U.S. tax until that income is brought home to the U.S. \nparent company.\n  By making this provision permanent, our legislation will put the \nAmerican financial services industry on an equal footing with its \nforeign-based competitors. Those competitors do not face current home \ncountry taxation on active financial services income.\n  This bill is about jobs in Montana. And it is about jobs in each of \nour States. One of these competitive American financial services \ncompanies employs hundreds of Montanans in Great Falls alone. So the \nhealth of that company is critically important to my State.\n  American financial services companies successfully compete in world \nfinancial markets. We need to make sure, however, that the U.S. tax \nrules do not change that situation and make them less competitive in \nthe world arena. This legislation will extend a provision that I \nbelieve preserves the international competitiveness of American-based \nfinancial services companies, including finance and credit companies, \ncommercial banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. This \nprovision also contains appropriate safeguards to ensure that only \ntruly active businesses benefit.\n  The active financial services provision is critically important in \ntoday's global economy. America's financial services industry is a \nglobal leader. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining confidence in the \ninternational marketplace. This is a fiercely competitive business. And \nAmerican-based companies would surely be disadvantaged with an \nadditional tax burden if we allow this exemption to lapse. Through our \nnetwork of trade agreements, we have made tremendous progress in \ngaining access to new foreign markets for this industry in recent \nyears. Our tax laws should complement, and not undermine, this effort.\n  The temporary nature of the active financial services provision, like \nother expiring provisions, denies American companies the stability \nenjoyed by their foreign competitors. It is time to make permanent this \nsubpart F active financial services provision. We need to allow \nAmerican companies to make business decisions on a long-term basis.\n  I invite my Colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation to \nprovide consistent, equitable, and stable tax treatment for the U.S. \nfinancial services industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 942. A bill to modify the boundaries for a certain empowerment \nzone designation; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 943. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe period for which the designation of an area as an empowerment zone \nis in effect; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Collins to \nintroduce two pieces of legislation to help reverse the devastating \npopulation decline and economic distress that have plagued individuals \nand businesses in Aroostook County, the northernmost county in Maine, \nas well as in other parts of the country. What the first bill does is \nsimple, it will bring all of Aroostook County under the Empowerment \nZone (EZ) program. The legislation is identical to a bill that we \nintroduced in the 108th Congress and was included in the FY 2004 \nAgriculture Appropriations bill in 2003 as passed by the Senate. The \nsecond piece of legislation would enable those economically depressed \ncommunities, already taking advantage of these incentives, to secure \nthe full 15 years of targeted growth originally granted to the areas \nfirst designated as Empowerment Zones.\n  To fully grasp the importance of the former legislation, it is \nnecessary to understand the unique situation facing the residents of \nAroostook County. ``The County,'' as it is called by Mainers, is a vast \nand remote region of Maine. It shares more of its border with Canada \nthan its neighboring Maine counties. It has the distinction of being \nthe largest county east of the Mississippi River. Its geographic \nisolation is even more acute when considering that the county's \nrelatively small population of 73,000 people are scattered throughout \n6,672 square miles of rural countryside. Aroostook County is home to 71 \norganized townships, as well as 125 unorganized townships much of which \nis forest land and wilderness.\n  As profoundly remote as this geographic isolation may seem, it is the\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\neconomic isolation and the recent out-migration that has had the most \ndevastating effect on the region. The economy of northern Maine has a \nhistorical dependence upon its natural resources, particularly forestry \nand agriculture. While these industries served the region well in \nprevious decades, and continue to form the underpinnings of the local \neconomy, many of these sectors have experienced decline and can no \nlonger provide the number of quality jobs that residents require and \ndeserve.\n\n  While officials in the region have put forward a herculean effort to \nredevelop the region, with nearly 1,000 new jobs at the Loring Commerce \nCenter alone, Aroostook County is still experiencing a significant \n``job deficit'', and as a result continues to lose population at an \nalarming rate. Since its peak in 1960, northern Maine's population has \ndeclined by 30 percent. Unfortunately, the Maine State Planning Office \npredicts that Aroostook County will continue losing population as more \nworkers leave the area to seek opportunities and higher wages in \nsouthern Maine and the rest of New England.\n  In January 2002, a portion of Aroostook County was one of two regions \nthat received Empowerment Zone status from the USDA for out-migration. \nThe entire county experienced an out-migration of 15 percent from \n86,936 in 1990 to 73,938 in 2000. Moreover, a staggering 40 percent of \n15- to 29-year-olds left during the last decade.\n  The current zone boundaries were chosen based on the criteria that \nEmpowerment Zones be no larger than 1,000 square miles, and have a \nmaximum population of 30,000 for rural areas. The lines drawn for the \nAroostook County Empowerment Zone were considered to be the most \ninclusive and reasonable given the constraints of the program. It \nshould be noted as well that the boundaries were drawn based on the \n1990 census, making the data significantly outdated at the start, and \nincluded the former Loring Air Force Base and its population of nearly \n8,000 people, which had closed nearly 8 years before the designation, \ntaking its military and much of its civilian workforces with it. The \nMaine State Planning Office estimated that the base closure resulted in \nthe loss of 3,494 jobs directly related to the base and another 1,751 \nin associated industry sectors for a total loss of $106.9 million \nannual payroll dollars.\n  Some of the most distressed communities that have lost substantial \npopulation are not in the Empowerment Zone, and other communities, such \nas Houlton, literally are divided simply by a road, having one business \non one side of the street with no Empowerment Zone designation across \nfrom a neighboring business on the other side of the street with full \nEmpowerment Zone benefits. The economic factors for these communities \nand for these neighbors are the same as those areas within the \nEmpowerment Zone. This designation is not meant to cause divisiveness \nwithin communities, it is created to augment a partnership for growth \nand to level the playing field for all Aroostook County communities who \nhave equally suffered through continuing out-migration whether it be in \nMadawaska or Island Falls.\n  The legislation I am introducing would provide economic development \nopportunities to all reaches of Aroostook County by extending \nEmpowerment Zone status to the entire county. This inclusive approach \nrecognizes that the economic hardship and population out-migration are \nissues that the entire region must confront, and, as evidenced by their \nsuccessful Round III EZ application, they are attempting to confront. I \nbelieve the challenges faced by Aroostook County are significant, but \nnot insurmountable. This legislation would make great strides in \nimproving the communities and business in northern Maine, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  With regards to the latter bill that I am offering today, I believe \nall Empowerment Zone communities need 15 years to reverse years of \ndownward spiraling that originally effected their economies. I have \nlong supported Empowerment Zone incentives and I believe that these \ntargeted tax incentives provide struggling communities the best chance \nfor sustained, long lasting economic renewal.\n  In 1994, Congress designated the first Empowerment Zones setting \n2009, a 15-year time frame, as the date that these tax incentives would \nexpire. The 2009 expiration date of Empowerment Zone status was held \nfirm for Round II communities designated in 1997, and the Round III \ncommunities designated in 2002. As a result of the expiration date some \ncommunities such as Aroostook County, which was designated in 2002, are \ngranted as few as 7 years to use tax incentives to overturn decades of \ndecline and economic neglect.\n  Unfortunately, Aroostook's economic problems will not be fixed within \nthe 7 short years this area qualifies for Empowerment Zone tax \nincentives. Instead a long-term and lasting commitment of at least 15 \nyears is necessary to help Aroostook communities work their way to \nstronger economic prosperity. Many communities, such as Aroostook \nCounty, that were unable to qualify for Empowerment Zone status until \n2002, are in dire need of the long-term 15-year window in which to \naddress their stubborn causes of poverty.\n  Businesses operating within Empowerment Zones receive a 20 percent \nwage credit for the first $15,000 they pay in wages to local residents. \nOther tax incentives encourage businesses and industries to further \ncommit to these communities. Companies with businesses in Empowerment \nZones are eligible for an additional $35,000 worth of 179 business \nexpensing--making these long-term business obligations more attractive, \naffordable and likely. Empowerment Zones are also eligible for expanded \ntax exempt financing for building the infrastructure communities need \nto attract long-term developers and business partners.\n  To qualify for Empowerment Zone status, communities develop \ncomprehensive strategic plans that depend on these tax incentives to \nhelp them transform their economies. Each community's plan focuses on \nestablishing long-term partnerships among private businesses, non \nprofits, state, local, and federal government agencies to help develop \nthe local economy. Together these parties use the community's strategic \nblue print to implement interconnected projects that address the \nfactors creating the area's economic sickness. These types of projects \nconcentrate on building much-needed business and industrial \ninfrastructure, developing an educated workforce, and diversifying \nlocal economies away from a reliance on one employer or industry.\n  Through the Aroostook Partnership for Progress, and the businesses \nworking in the Empowerment Zone, the County is making significant \nprogress--the factors causing poverty in this rural part of Maine \ncannot be eradicated quickly. Aroostook County's strategic plan will \ntake time to implement as infrastructure, industry and other \ninitiatives produce greater economic capabilities and diversification. \nThough Aroostook County is working valiantly to overcome the factors \ncausing their economic plight, they will need more than seven years to \novercome 40 years of difficulties. I know that there are many other \nstruggling Round II and Round III Empowerment Zone communities, such as \nAroostook, who need the maximum, in order to reverse the poverty and \nunderdevelopment also plaguing those areas.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the urgency of making a long-term \npledge to communities using Empowerment Zone incentives to work its way \nout of long-term poverty. I hope that each Senator will support the \ncommunities in their states, currently undertaking the painful process \nof economic transformation, by supporting passage of this economic \ndevelopment bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of each bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 942\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Olympia Snowe, in introducing legislation that will expand the \nborders of the Aroostook County Empowerment Zone to include the entire \nCounty so that the benefits of Empowerment Zone designation can be \nfully realized in northern Maine.\n  The Department of Agriculture's Empowerment Zone program addresses a \ncomprehensive range of community challenges, including many that have \ntraditionally received little federal assistance, reflecting the fact \nthat rural problems do not come in standardized packages but can vary \nwidely from one place to another. The Empowerment Zone program \nrepresents a long-term partnership between the federal government and \nrural communities so that communities have enough time to implement \nprojects to build the capacity to sustain their development beyond the \nterm of the partnership. An Empowerment Zone designation gives \ndesignated regions potential access to federal grants for social \nservices and community redevelopment as well as tax incentives to \nencourage economic growth.\n  Aroostook County is the largest county east of the Mississippi River. \nYet, despite the impressive character and work ethic of its citizens, \nthe County has fallen on hard times. The 2000 Census indicated a 15 \npercent loss in population since 1990. Loring Air Force Base, which was \nclosed in 1994, also caused an immediate out-migration of 8,500 people \nand a further out-migration of families and businesses that depended on \nLoring for their customer base.\n  In response to these developments, the Northern Maine Development \nCommission and other economic development organizations, the private \nbusiness sector, and community leaders in Aroostook have joined forces \nto stabilize, diversify, and grow the area's economy. They have \nattracted some new industries and jobs. As a native of Aroostook \nCounty, I can attest to the strong community support that will ensure a \ncontinued successful partnership with the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Designating this region of the United States as an Empowerment Zone \nwill help build its future economic prosperity. However, the \nrestriction that the Empowerment Zone be limited to 1,000 square miles \nprevents all of Aroostook's small rural communities from benefitting \nfrom this program. Aroostook covers some 6,672 square miles but has a \npopulation of only 74,000. Including all of the County in the \nEmpowerment Zone will guarantee that parts of the County will not be \nleft behind in the quest for economic prosperity. It does little good \nto have a company move from one community to another within the County \nsimply to take advantage of Empowerment Zone benefits.\n  Senator Snowe and I introduced this legislation in both the 108th and \n109th Congresses. In fact, we were successful in getting this \nlegislation passed in the Senate by attaching it to the fiscal year \n2004 Agriculture Appropriations bill. Unfortunately, this language was \nremoved during conference negotiations with the House. Senator Snowe \nand I remain committed to bringing the benefits of the Empowerment Zone \ndesignation to all of Aroostook County's residents and will work to \npass this legislation in both chambers during this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 945. A bill to ensure that college textbooks and supplemental \nmaterials are available and affordable; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when we talk about college affordability, \nthe discussion typically focuses on tuition costs, Pell grants and \nstudent loans. But we cannot talk about college affordability without \nalso including college textbook costs in the same conversation.\n  Picture a bright, hard-working college student at the beginning of a \nnew term. The student, who comes from a family of modest means, has \nmanaged to pay for tuition through a combination of grants, \nscholarships, student loans and part-time work. The student goes to her \ncollege bookstore to buy her textbooks. She walks out of the bookstore \nwith her textbooks and wonders how she will be able to pay the $500 \ncharge she just put on her credit card to buy the required books for \nher classes.\n  According to GAO, college textbook prices have risen an average of \nsix percent each year since 1987 and at twice the rate of annual \ninflation over the last two decades. Textbook prices have been \nfollowing increases in tuition and fees. Since December of 1986, \ntextbook prices have increased by 186 percent and tuition and fees grew \nby 240 percent. GAO found that the primary contributing factor is the \ninvestment publishers have made to develop and produce supplemental \nmaterials such as CDs and Web-based tutorials.\n  The cost of textbooks and supplies as a percentage of tuition and \nfees depends on the type of institution the student is attending. GAO \ndetermined that the average estimated cost of books and supplies for \nfull-time freshman students at four-year public schools was $898 in \n2003, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At two-year \npublic institutions, where the average student is more likely to be \nlow-income, the average estimated cost was even higher due to lower \ntuition and fees at these schools. A first-year student at a two-year \nschool spent a comparable amount--$886 on average, but that is nearly \nthree-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees. Students at public two-\nyear schools are trying to find an economical way to pursue higher \neducation, but could easily be sidelined by high textbook costs.\n  What can be done to keep textbooks affordable for college students? \nPublishers, schools and bookstores can take any number of steps to help \nkeep the cost of textbooks down. Schools, and in particular, \nprofessors, have tremendous power to help cut down the overall cost of \ntextbooks. I was shocked to learn that many professors do not know the \nretail price of the textbook they are choosing for their class. The \nearlier a bookstore receives textbook information from a professor, the \ngreater the ability of the bookstore to obtain cheaper used versions of \nthe required text.\n  There are other actions that publishers and professors can take to \nhelp keep down the cost of textbooks, and that is why I am introducing \nthe bipartisan College Textbook Affordability Act, cosponsored by \nSenator Coleman.\n  First, the bill requires transparency. Publishers must provide the \nprice of a textbook in writing whenever a publisher's representative \nprovides information on a textbook to a professor. The professor must \nalso be provided the history of revisions for a textbook or \nsupplemental material and whether the textbook or supplement is \navailable in an alternative format, such as paperback, one- or two-\ncolored editions, and loose-leaf editions. Publishers insist that \naccess to such information is readily available to professors. If this \nis truly the case, then this bill will simply codify what publishers \nclaim is already their industry's normal practice and would not be an \nundue burden placed on the industry.\n  Under the bill, textbooks and supplemental materials that are sold as \na bundle must also be sold separately. The GAO report found that \ninstructors are often unaware that the course materials they have \nchosen will be sold as a bundle.\n  The legislation also requires schools to do their part in managing \ntextbook costs for students. Schools are required to include the \ninternational standard\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nbook number, or ISBN number and the retail price of all required and \noptional materials in the course schedule for the upcoming term. This \nrequirement would help ensure that bookstores receive book orders in \ntime to stock up on any available used books and would provide students \nwith plenty of time to search for lower-priced textbooks via \nalternative sources such as online booksellers or other students.\n  When asked, schools must also provide bookstores with access to the \ncourse schedule, ISBN numbers for required and optional course \nmaterial, the maximum student enrollment for a course and the current \nenrollment numbers. Access to this information would allow bookstores \nto better estimate the amount of inventory they should maintain for \neach course. A school in my home state, Illinois State University, \nrecognized the importance of giving students and bookstores early \naccess to such information. ISU's online course schedule provides \nstudents with ISBN numbers, and bookstores are given access to course \nenrollment numbers as well as required and optional course materials.\n  Combined, these actions can help drive down the cost of textbooks and \nhelp make college more affordable for students. The college \naffordability conversation cannot focus only on raising federal grants \nand lowering student loan interest rates. There is no question that \nfederal aid has not kept up with rising college costs. However, we must \nalso look at why college costs, including textbook costs, continue to \nincrease year after year.\n  I have heard stories of students, especially community college \nstudents, who decide to drop a semester or a year because they simply \ncannot afford the textbooks. This is just unacceptable. Textbook costs \nare a part, and in some cases a large part of college costs, and we \nmust do what is within our power to ensure that students do not put \ntheir education on hold just because they cannot afford to buy the \ntextbooks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 945\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``The American National Red \n     Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 1802. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Substantive changes to the Congressional Charter of The \n     American National Red Cross have not been made since 1947.\n       (2) In February 2006, the board of governors of The \n     American National Red Cross (the ``Board of Governors'') \n     commissioned an independent review and analysis of the Board \n     of Governors' role, composition, size, relationship with \n     management, governance relationship with chartered units of \n     The American National Red Cross, and whistleblower and audit \n     functions.\n       (3) In an October 2006 report of the Board of Governors, \n     entitled ``American Red Cross Governance for the 21st \n     Century'' (the ``Governance Report''), the Board of Governors \n     recommended changes to the Congressional Charter, bylaws, and \n     other governing documents of The American National Red Cross \n     to modernize and enhance the effectiveness of the Board of \n     Governors and governance structure of The American National \n     Red Cross.\n       (4) It is in the national interest to create a more \n     efficient governance structure of The American National Red \n     Cross and to enhance the Board of Governors' ability to \n     support the critical mission of The American National Red \n     Cross in the 21st century.\n       (5) It is in the national interest to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors as a governance and strategic \n     oversight board and for The American National Red Cross to \n     amend its bylaws, consistent with the recommendations \n     described in the Governance Report, to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors and to outline the areas of its \n     responsibility, including--\n       (A) reviewing and approving the mission statement for The \n     American National Red Cross;\n       (B) approving and overseeing the corporation's strategic \n     plan and maintaining strategic oversight of operational \n     matters;\n       (C) selecting, evaluating, and determining the level of \n     compensation of the corporation's chief executive officer;\n       (D) evaluating the performance and establishing the \n     compensation of the senior leadership team and providing for \n     management succession;\n       (E) overseeing the financial reporting and audit process, \n     internal controls, and legal compliance;\n       (F) holding management accountable for performance;\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\n       (G) providing oversight of the financial stability of the \n     corporation;\n       (H) ensuring the inclusiveness and diversity of the \n     corporation;\n       (I) providing oversight of the protection of the brand of \n     the corporation; and\n       (J) assisting with fundraising on behalf of the \n     corporation.\n       (6)(A) The selection of members of the Board of Governors \n     is a critical component of effective governance for The \n     American National Red Cross, and, as such, it is in the \n     national interest that The American National Red Cross amend \n     its bylaws to provide a method of selection consistent with \n     that described in the Governance Report.\n       (B) The new method of selection should replace the current \n     process by which--\n       (i) 30 chartered unit-elected members of the Board of \n     Governors are selected by a non-Board committee which \n     includes 2 members of the Board of Governors and other \n     individuals elected by the chartered units themselves;\n       (ii) 12 at-large members of the Board of Governors are \n     nominated by a Board committee and elected by the Board of \n     Governors; and\n       (iii) 8 members of the Board of Governors are appointed by \n     the President of the United States.\n       (C) The new method of selection described in the Governance \n     Report reflects the single category of members of the Board \n     of Governors that will result from the implementation of this \n     title:\n       (i) All Board members (except for the chairman of the Board \n     of Governors) would be nominated by a single committee of the \n     Board of Governors taking into account the criteria outlined \n     in the Governance Report to assure the expertise, skills, and \n     experience of a governing board.\n       (ii) The nominated members would be considered for approval \n     by the full Board of Governors and then submitted to The \n     American National Red Cross annual meeting of delegates for \n     election, in keeping with the standard corporate practice \n     whereby shareholders of a corporation elect members of a \n     board of directors at its annual meeting.\n       (7) The United States Supreme Court held The American \n     National Red Cross to be an instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it is in the national interest that the \n     Congressional Charter confirm that status and that any \n     changes to the Congressional Charter do not affect the rights \n     and obligations of The American National Red Cross to carry \n     out its purposes.\n       (8) Given the role of The American National Red Cross in \n     carrying out its services, programs, and activities, and \n     meeting its various obligations, the effectiveness of The \n     American National Red Cross will be promoted by the creation \n     of an organizational ombudsman who--\n       (A) will be a neutral or impartial dispute resolution \n     practitioner whose major function will be to provide \n     confidential and informal assistance to the many internal and \n     external stakeholders of The American National Red Cross;\n       (B) will report to the chief executive officer and the \n     audit committee of the Board of Governors; and\n       (C) will have access to anyone and any documents in The \n     American National Red Cross.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) charitable organizations are an indispensable part of \n     American society, but these organizations can only fulfill \n     their important roles by maintaining the trust of the \n     American public;\n       (2) trust is fostered by effective governance and \n     transparency, which are the principal goals of the \n     recommendations of the Board of Governors in the Governance \n     Report and this title;\n       (3) Federal and State action play an important role in \n     ensuring effective governance and transparency by setting \n     standards, rooting out violations, and informing the public; \n     and\n       (4) while The American National Red Cross is and will \n     remain a Federally chartered instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it has the rights and obligations consistent with \n     that status, The American National Red Cross nevertheless \n     should maintain appropriate communications with State \n     regulators of charitable organizations and should cooperate \n     with them as appropriate in specific matters as they arise \n     from time to time.\n\n     SEC. 1803. ORGANIZATION.\n\n       Section 300101 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``a Federally chartered \n     instrumentality of the United States and'' before ``a body \n     corporate and politic''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by inserting at the end the \n     following new sentence: ``The corporation may conduct its \n     business and affairs, and otherwise hold itself out, as the \n     `American Red Cross' in any jurisdiction.''.\n\n     SEC. 1804. PURPOSES.\n\n       Section 300102 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following paragraph:\n       ``(5) to conduct other activities consistent with the \n     foregoing purposes.''.\n\n     SEC. 1805.
