Mr. President, the underlying FAA bill that came out \nof the Commerce Committee had wide bipartisan support. The provisions \nthat came out of the Finance Committee that are directly related to \naviation financing have wide bipartisan support.\n  This bill was on a fast track to passage and to improving airline \nsafety in our country. Unfortunately, our friends across the aisle \nbogged it down with extraneous provisions that do nothing to improve \nairline safety and that do not belong on this bill.\n  And then, to prevent any changes to those provisions, they used a \nprocedure that used to be rare to block amendments and improvements to \nthe bill. So rather than quickly passing an airline safety bill that \nhas broad bipartisan support, our friends on the other side have \ndecided it is more important to fight for a few pet projects.\n  Rather than quickly finish the bill and move on to gas prices, they \nhave decided to dig in and fight for a few extra provisions for a few \nextra Senators. The right choice is clear: We should quickly pass the \nbipartisan aviation-related portions of the FAA bill and move on to \nlegislation that addresses the high price Americans are paying at the \npump.\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\n  Republicans put forward an energy proposal, a plan that gets at the \nroot of the problem rather than at increased dependence on OPEC. The \nRepublican plan would increase the supply of American energy and \nbolster American jobs while lowering our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Meanwhile, Democratic suggestions for addressing high gas prices \nranged from driving slower to more frequent oil changes. This is a \ndebate we are eager to have. One wonders if the reason our friends are \nstalling on the FAA bill is that they are worried about exposing the \nfact that they have no plan for gas prices.\n  But Americans who are paying close to $4 a gallon for gasoline do not \nparticularly care which party comes up with the idea; they would like \nsome action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3752-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CYCLONE DEATHS IN BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today because there is a family \nin Kentucky that has lost their beloved son in this time of war. SGT \nChristopher T. Heflin of Paducah, KY, was killed on November 16, 2004, \nduring combat operations in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq. He was 26 \nyears old.\n  For his valor in service as a U.S. marine, Sergeant Heflin earned \nseveral medals, awards and decorations, including the Navy and Marine \nCorps Commendation Medal, two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, \nthe National Defense Service Medal, two Meritorious Masts and the \nPurple Heart.\n  Sergeant Heflin's mother, Meleasa Ellis, still remembers well the day \nChris told her he intended to enlist in the Marine Corps. ``When he was \na senior [in high school], he came home [and] said, `Mom, I need to \ntalk to you,' '' she says. `` `I want to join the Marines,' he said. I \nsaid why? His response: `I want to serve my country.' ''\n  Before the Marines, there was football, Chris's first love as a \nchild. He started playing in sixth grade and by high school had become \nthe starting center on the team, wearing the No. 50 jersey.\n  ``He was a young man who led by example . . . . He played center and \nwas always one of the hardest-working players I had,'' says Jeff Sturm, \nChris's head football coach at Reidland High School in Paducah. ``He \nwas just a quality young man. I just hate to see it happen, but I'm \nproud that he was over there defending his country. That's the way he \nled his life.''\n  Growing up, Chris also was a member of the National Hockey League \nAssociation of Ohio and of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Paducah. He had \nan afterschool job at Taco John's. He enjoyed riding his four-wheeler, \nwhich he called his ``country Cadillac,'' and he had recently taken up \ndeer hunting.\n  The vigorous life suited Chris, who was always on the go. ``If he sat \nstill, it was just because he had to eat,'' remembers his brother Cory \nHeflin. ``If I had any problems, I could come to him. He was always \nthere if I needed someone to talk to. We always stuck together. Now \nhe's going to a better home.''\n  Cory and other family members also remember how active Chris was in \nvolunteer work. His favorite program was the Marine Corps Reserves' \nToys for Tots, which collects toys for needy children at Christmas. \nChris made sure to do his part every year.\n  ``He missed a lot of Thanksgivings with us to make sure the kids had \nChristmas,'' his mother Meleasa recalls. ``During Thanksgiving, he was \nhelping wherever he was with Toys for Tots; he had a passion for kids. \nHe would have been a great dad someday.''\n  Chris graduated from Reidland High School in 1997 and signed up with \nthe Marine Corps 5 days afterwards. He would go on to serve with them \nfor nearly 8 years. By the time he deployed to Iraq, Chris was assigned \nto the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, 1st \nMarine Expeditionary Force, based at Camp Pendleton, CA.\n  One of his first assignments put him behind a desk. Chris \ncommunicated his displeasure to his friend, the Reverend Larry \nDavidson, the man who had baptized Chris when he was a young teenager. \n``He said that was not what he wanted to be here for,'' the Reverend \nDavidson says. ``He wanted to be on the battlefield.''\n  Chris would move on to spend 3 years training reservists in weapons \nand equipment use in Moundsville, WV. While there, he worked with John \nNanny, commandant of the Wheeling, WV, Marine Corps League.\n  Chris ``was a Marine's Marine,'' John says. ``He was always gung-ho \nand fired up about what he did.''\n  In June 2004, Chris was deployed to Iraq in support of Operation \nIraqi Freedom. His mother Meleasa remembers the day Chris gave her the \nnews, in April 2004.\n  Meleasa says Chris ``told me he was leaving for Iraq. I could do \nnothing but weep,'' Meleasa says. ``He told me, remember the reason I \njoined the Marines? I have to go and fight for our country. He fought \ntill the last day, November 16, 2004.''\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with the Heflin family after the tragic \nloss of this brave Marine. We are thinking of Chris's mother Meleasa \nEllis; his brothers, Cory Heflin, Josh Hicks, and Derek Ellis; his \ngrandparents, Marvin and Marie Salsbury; his aunts and uncles, Lisa and \nPete Witenberger and Tim and Diane Salsbury; and many other beloved \nfamily members and friends.\n  More than 200 people turned out for Chris's funeral at the Mount Zion \nBaptist Church, officiated by Chris's friend, the Reverend Davidson. \nLater, at the Woodlawn Memorial Gardens cemetery, Chris was laid to \nrest with a 21-gun salute.\n  Two marines folded the flag that had draped over his casket and \npresented it to his brother Derek, who is also serving in the Marine \nCorps as a lance corporal.\n  When Chris was a small child, his grandfather, Marvin, would take him \nfishing. Chris had so much fun that when the visits were over, he would \ntell his mother to go get his clothes and bring them back to his \ngrandparents' house so he could stay with them.\n  Marvin still remembers the last time he spoke to his grandson, just \nbefore Chris deployed to Iraq. ``Son, I want to ask you something,'' \nMarvin said. ``Are you right with the Lord?''\n  ``Yes, Pa, I am,'' Chris replied, using the nickname for his \ngrandfather he had used since childhood.\n  The loss that the Heflin family has suffered can never be fully \nhealed. But it is my hope that every person who hears Chris's story is \ninspired by and draws strength from it.\n  The little boy Marvin once took fishing grew up to become a man, a \npatriot and a marine who stepped forward to serve his country. This \nSenate salutes SGT Christopher T. Heflin's service,\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\nand we will forever honor his sacrifice. Our Nation is richer today for \nwhat he did on behalf of freedom's cause.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the opening \nremarks of the Republican leader.\n  The Senate is going to vote this afternoon on cloture on the FAA \nmodernization bill. This is an extremely important piece of \nlegislation. It is bipartisan. We agreed unanimously last week to go to \nthis bill. It has been stalled on procedural motions ever since. This \nis a critical piece of legislation that all of us know we need to get \nto. I will be speaking later this morning on that bill. But I wanted to \naddress the remarks of the Republican leader in particular, who said \nthe Republicans were going to block the motion to invoke cloture this \nafternoon because of ``extraneous measures'' in the bill.\n  I remind my colleagues, the majority leader was on the floor of the \nSenate last week offering numerous alternatives to the Republican side \nto allow them to offer amendments, to allow them to move forward on \nthis bill, to come to some agreement to move forward.\n  It is disappointing to hear they still object. Of the extraneous \namendments, one has to do with the highway trust fund and the fact that \nwe are out of money and need to address that issue. It is addressed in \na bipartisan way in this bill. It is badly needed for roads, bridges, \nand highway construction, and it is a responsibility with which we \nshould proceed. The other one has to do with reimbursing New York for \nmoney from 9/11. This is not controversial. It was agreed upon after 9/\n11.\n  The budget the President sent to us says it is necessary, and it is \nin this bill because it is important that we get that done and move it \nforward. This legislation allows us the opportunity to do so.\n  These are not controversial issues. It is important that we move \nforward on this legislation. I hope our colleagues will agree to do \nthat this afternoon.\n  Finally, I heard this morning that our Republican colleagues say that \nDemocrats aren't going to deal with the gas tax issue. I assure \neveryone, we understand this issue. When we go home and see gas prices \nnearing $4 a gallon, when we hear from truck drivers and people who are \ntrying to get to work or to grocery stores, the price is really hurting \nthem. We are doing everything we can on this side--and have been--to \ntry to move us forward in a way that addresses this crisis, but we \nrecognize there are no short-term, easy, quick fixes. We know the same-\nold, same-old of promising drilling that would not produce anything for \n10 years or giving away more money to the oil companies as an incentive \nis not the right way to get constituents to a place where they believe \ngas prices are again affordable. We are in the process of putting \ntogether a comprehensive piece of legislation that the Democratic \nleader will announce this week. I look forward to having our colleagues \non the other side move forward with us on that comprehensive package to \naddress the gas price issue facing our constituents.\n  With that, we will be now moving to a period of morning business. I \nlook forward to addressing the Senate later on the FAA authorization \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3753-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about \nthe nomination process, to be followed by Senators Cornyn and Kyl.\n  The situation is desperate at the present time, as the Senate has \nreverted to a longstanding policy in the last 2 years where the White \nHouse is controlled by one party and the Senate by another. The \nnominees of President Bush are being inappropriately blocked. During \nthe course of the last 2 years of the Clinton administration, there \nwere 15 circuit judges confirmed, 57 district judges, contrasted with \nonly 7 circuit judges confirmed during the last 2 years of the Bush \nadministration, and 38 district judges. For the entire 8 years, \nPresident Clinton has 65 circuit confirmations contrasted with only 58 \nfor President Bush. President Clinton had 305 district confirmations \ncontrasted with only 241.\n  Regrettably, this has been the pattern for the past 20 years--in the \nlast 2 years of President Reagan's administration, when the Senate was \ncontrolled by Democrats; in the last 2 years of President Bush the \nfirst; and in the 6 years Republicans controlled the Senate during \nPresident Clinton's administration.\n  The issue has been raised by Democrats about the inappropriate \nblocking by Republicans of the Clinton administration. I have agreed \nwith them. I voted to confirm the Clinton judges who were qualified. \nThe action taken was not appropriate, and I disagreed with my caucus. \nBut now my caucus is right.\n  An agreement had been reached--a good-faith agreement, so to speak--\nby leadership to confirm three circuit judges between now and Memorial \nDay. The Democrats had chosen three nominees: Judge Helene White, Mr. \nKethledge, and Justice Agee, who are really out of turn. It would be \nmuch more appropriate to take up Judge Conrad who has been waiting 290 \ndays for a hearing; Mr. Matthews, who has been waiting 240 days for a \nhearing; or Mr. Keisler, who has been waiting 675 days for a committee \nvote.\n  The chairman obviously has the right to make the selection on the \ncalendar, but it is important to note that this selection was made \nwithout any consultation with the Republicans, which is a sharp shift \nin practice from what happened during the last Congress when I chaired \nthe committee and Senator Leahy was ranking. The White House wanted the \nconfirmation hearings of Chief Justice Roberts to start on August 29. I \nhad serious questions about the wisdom of doing that and consulted with \nSenator Leahy extensively. Senator Leahy was totally opposed. I made \nthe decision to start the hearings after Labor Day, after due and \nappropriate consultation with the Democrats.\n  Similarly, on the nomination of Justice Alito, the White House wanted \nthe confirmation completed by Christmas. Again, I had severe concerns \nabout hurrying the process. I consulted extensively with Senator Leahy, \nand then I made the decision to start the hearings in January. Let the \nrecord show after the confirmations were completed successfully, \nPresident Bush agreed with the judgment to hold the hearings when they \nwere scheduled. That is the sort of comity which is indispensable if \nthis body is to function.\n  There are grave concerns raised about the scheduling of the \nconfirmation of Judge Helene White because, simply stated, there is not \nenough time to do it and do it right. Judge White was nominated on \nApril 15, less than a month ago. Her questionnaire was not received \nuntil April 25. The FBI investigation was not begun until April 25. The \nABA report cannot be completed until May 19 at the earliest. After \nJudge White's hearing, which is scheduled hastily for May 7, the \ncommittee typically leaves the record open for 1 week, which would \nclose the record on May 14. If there are questions for the record, \nJudge White would have 1 week to answer those questions, which would \nbring us to May 21. If the nomination is held over for a week, that \nwould put us\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\ninto June. Assuming the nomination is not held over for a week, that \nleaves only 2 days before May 23 for the committee to review her \nanswers, schedule and hold a committee vote, and for the full Senate to \nvote on her nomination. No circuit court nominee has had hearings prior \nto their ABA report being received. The ABA report is not expected \nuntil at least May 19.\n  In the past, the Democrats have been very vocal in opposing this kind \nof a schedule. When the schedule was set for Peter Keisler 33 days \nafter his nomination, the Democrats cited the concern that the Keisler \nhearing should not be held so quickly in advance of the ABA \nrecommendations: ``We should not be scheduling hearings for nominees \nbefore the Committee has received their ABA ratings,'' all of which is \nviolated here.\n  Senator Schumer said:\n\n       So let me reiterate some of the concerns we expressed about \n     proceeding so hastily on this nomination. First, we have \n     barely had time to consider the nominee's record. Mr. Keisler \n     was named to this seat 33 days ago. So, we are having this \n     hearing with astonishing and inexplicable speed.\n\n  Well, this hearing is even more astonishing and even more \ninexplicable. When we do not follow regular order, we tend to get into \ntrouble. The appropriate course would be to move to the nominations of \nJudge Conrad and Mr. Matthews in the Fourth Circuit where there is a \njudicial emergency.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3754-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3754-S3756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FILIBUSTERING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I want to comment briefly about what I consider the \ndisintegration of the standing of the Senate as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. There was a time, when someone wanted to filibuster, \nthat they had to stand up and speak. The Democrats brought to the floor \nlegislation to alter the Supreme Court decision which cut short the \nstatute of limitations on women's pay. I voted for cloture to take up \nthat issue. The issue came and went in the course of a few hours one \nday. Under the traditional rules of the Senate, when a matter is \nraised, it is presented. It is argued. If someone opposes and wants to \nobject and filibuster, they have to speak.\n  The cost of a filibuster today is very cheap. All you have to do is \nsay: I am going to filibuster. Then there is a cloture vote, and 60 \nvotes are not obtained, and the issue goes away.\n  That is not the way the Senate has traditionally functioned. If the \nDemocrats had been serious about trying to change the rule that the \nSupreme Court handed down, which I thought was a bad decision--bad on \nthe law, and it certainly can be changed by legislation--they would \nhave argued the matter. They would have compelled opponents to come to \nthe Senate floor and oppose the matter. There would have been a public \ndebate. Had there been an extended debate, the American people would \nhave understood the wrong Supreme Court decision and insisted the \nCongress take corrective action.\n  Similarly, we have found the Senate has now been overwhelmed by \nprocedural motions on filling the tree which preclude any meaningful, \ntraditional Senate approach to our function where Senators should be \nable to offer amendments at any time on any issue. Senator Reid, who \nnow has the distinction of having the record on filling the tree the \nmost times, has it in heavy competition. Senator Mitchell established a \nnew record in the 103rd Congress with nine. Senator Lott tied him in \nthe 106th Congress with nine. Senator Frist tied him in the 109th \nCongress with nine. But Senator Reid is now the champion.\n  The problem with filling the tree is that Senators are precluded from \ncoming to the floor and offering amendments. The American people do not \nunderstand what is happening in the Senate because nothing is happening \nin the Senate. Last week we had one cloture vote at 5:30 on Monday. We \ndidn't vote on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday--one vote, and \nnot a peep in the news media about the inactive Senate. So what we are \nseeing--and I intend to speak at length on this at a later date--is the \ndisintegration of what the Senate is supposed to be.\n  If legislation is needed to change the statute of limitations on \nenforcing women's employment rights for equal pay, let the Senate take \nit up and debate. If we are on the FAA Act, let's have Senators come \nforward and consider it.\n\n  It is time we declared a truce on the judge issue. It has been \nexacerbated continuously over the last 20 years. It is time for a truce \nbecause the American people are caught in the crossfire.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a survey of the filling \nof the tree, compiled by CRS, be printed in the Record. I urge my \ncolleagues to study it to see how the business of the Senate has been \nthwarted, stymied, and eliminated by this procedural, inappropriate \nactivity.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  TABLE 1.--INSTANCES WHERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FLOOR AMENDMENT WERE LIMITED BY THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER OR HIS\n                   DESIGNEE FILLING OF PARTIALLY FILLING THE ``AMENDMENT TREE'': 1987-2008 \\1\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Congress & Years           Senate Majority Leader        Measure(s)             Notes & Citations\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n100th (1987-1988)..................

Mr. President, I wish to join my distinguished colleague, \nthe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, in talking about the \nimportance of moving judicial nominations through the Senate.\n  I also, though, wish to start by briefly mentioning a couple numbers. \nThe first is $3.61. This is the average price of a gallon of gasoline \nin America today. The next number I would like to show my colleagues is \n743. That is how many days it has been since Speaker Pelosi said she \nwould--if elected Speaker--how long ago she said the Democrats would \noffer their commonsense plan for bringing down prices of gasoline at \nthe pump. I would note we continue to wait for that commonsense plan, \nand Americans across this country are waiting for Congress to do \nsomething about it.\n  I would note last Friday I joined a number of my colleagues, \nincluding the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and others in \nintroducing a plan we think will help bring down the price of gasoline \nat the pump. Our colleagues, not surprisingly, may disagree. But we are \nwaiting for their plan, all these 743 days. I think the American people \nare wondering and watching and wondering why we have not acted and why \nSpeaker Pelosi, in particular, has not followed through on her \ncommitment made more than 2 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3756-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3756-S3758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this morning, in North Carolina, Senator \nJohn McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for President of the \nUnited States, is giving a very important speech. He may be speaking \neven as I am speaking. But he is talking about the role of judges in \nour Government. I think it is a very important speech. I hope our \ncolleagues and the American people will pay close attention to what \nSenator McCain is saying when he talks about the important role Federal \njudges play in our American Government.\n  I hope Senator Obama and Senator Clinton will likewise take the \nopportunity, at the first chance they have, to talk about their \nphilosophy, about the types of judges they believe should be nominated \nby the next President of the United States, were they to have that \nprivilege and that opportunity.\n  Five years ago, on April 30, 2003, I, along with nine other of the \nnewest Members of the Senate, wrote a letter on this issue to Senator \nFrist and Senator Daschle, the respective leaders of our parties. That \nletter was important not only because it was a bipartisan statement \nacknowledging the judicial confirmation process was broken and needed \nfixing but also important because it called, on a bipartisan basis, by \nthe newest Members of the Senate, for a clean break or as we called it, \na fresh start when it came to the issue of judicial confirmations and, \nnotably, we said to ``leave the bitterness of the past behind us.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would like to read from a passage in that letter, \nsigned by we 10 freshmen at the time. In 2003, we wrote to our leaders:\n\n       In some instances, when a well qualified nominee for the \n     federal bench is denied a vote, the obstruction is justified \n     on the ground of how prior nominees--typically, the nominees \n     of a previous President--were treated. All of these \n     recriminations, made by members on both sides of the aisle, \n     relate to circumstances which occurred before any of us \n     [actually] arrived in the United States Senate. None of us \n     were parties to any of the reported past offenses, whether \n     real or perceived. None of us believe that the ill will of \n     the past should dictate the terms and direction of the \n     future.\n\n  Unfortunately, 5 years later, when it comes to judicial nominations, \nthe grievances of the past are still dictating the terms and direction \nof the future when it comes to judicial nominees. There is still time \nfor that fresh start we called for, still time for a clean slate but, \nunfortunately, no signs that is likely to occur in the current \nenvironment.\n  So it will likely come to pass once again that last year's and the \nprevious year's grievances will be used again, not without some \njustification, by Senate Republicans to justify the obstruction of a \nfuture Democratic President's judicial nominees, which shows the death \nspiral we are involved in when it comes to not taking care of the \nNation's work, not allowing an up-or-down vote of judicial nominees on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  When it comes to judicial nominations, the Senate is supposed to be, \nas Senator Specter said, the world's greatest deliberative body. But it \noften acts more like the Hatfields and the McCoys, or perhaps, for \nthose who remember Huck Finn, the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, \nwho do not know how the feud began but, nonetheless, continue to \nescalate the violence.\n\n  Let's step back and consider the basic facts. Right now across \nAmerica there are 46 Federal judicial vacancies--12 on the circuit \ncourt of appeals, 34 on the district courts. Of these 46 vacancies, 13 \nare considered ``judicial emergencies,'' including a handful on the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals,\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\nwhere a full 33 percent of the bench is vacant because we in the Senate \nhave not done our job.\n  The simple fact of the matter is, thus far, during President Bush's \nfinal 2 years in office, we have seen a record-low number of Federal \njudges approved by the Senate.\n  Since our friends on the other side of the aisle took over the Senate \nin 2007, a total of only 7 circuit court nominees have been approved--\nand only one this year. It would be most unfortunate and indeed, I \ndaresay, precedent setting if this Senate set this new low-water mark.\n  For my part, I have been pleased to work with the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, to gain confirmation of the last \ntwo Texans to be nominated and confirmed to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Most recently, I appreciated the chairman's cooperation and \nassistance in confirming Catharina Haynes to the Fifth Circuit.\n  But despite my appreciation, I must also express my regret that Ms. \nHaynes is the only circuit nominee confirmed this year. I would not be \nfulfilling my oath of office if I did not press for fair treatment not \nonly for judicial nominees who come from my State, Texas, but for my \ncolleagues' home State nominees as well.\n  There are many other critical judicial positions that demand our \nimmediate action. I mentioned the Fourth Circuit, which serves the \nStates of Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and West \nVirginia.\n  The Fourth Circuit is currently operating, as I indicated, with one-\nthird less than a full complement of judges on the bench. That is why \nthe Judicial Conference has called this a judicial emergency. The \nSenate can and must act to alleviate this strain and this denial of \naccess to justice on behalf of the people of those States, who are \ndenied access to justice because there are simply not enough judges who \nhave been confirmed to sit and hear their cases.\n  The Judiciary Committee is poised to act this Thursday on Justice \nStephen Agee of Virginia, a Fourth Circuit nominee, and it should at \nthe very least move forward with the nominations of other Fourth \nCircuit nominees who have the support of both home State Senators.\n  Even the Washington Post, in December 2007, decried the situation on \nthe Fourth Circuit saying:\n\n       [T]he Senate should act in good faith to fill vacancies--\n     not as a favor to the president but out of respect for the \n     residents, businesses, defendants and victims of crime in the \n     region the 4th Circuit covers.\n\n  I am greatly disappointed the Judiciary Committee has been so slow to \nact on these important nominations. I would ask the chairman again to \npush forward with hearings and give the nominees an opportunity for an \nup-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  There is no doubt the American people deserve, and our very concept \nof American Government requires, qualified judges who understand the \nproper role of a judge, which is not to be another branch of the \nlegislature dispensing their view of justice, sort of on an ad hoc \nbasis, but, rather, judges who believe their job is to interpret and \nenforce the Constitution, not to make up the law as they go along.\n  As such, we should exercise due diligence to properly review \nnominees. But the constitutionally mandated process of advice and \nconsent should be done expeditiously, and debates on these nominees \nshould be done openly, as the Senator from Pennsylvania suggested.\n\n       We have before us numerous well-qualified nominees who have \n     offered themselves to serve our citizens. We must endeavor to \n     minimize the role of partisan politics in judicial \n     nominations, and we should work harder to ensure the judicial \n     vacancies are filled in a more timely manner.\n\n  I know my time is up, and I know the distinguished Senator from \nArizona is here to speak, perhaps on the same subject. But I am glad \nSenator McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, is speaking on this \nimportant issue today. I repeat my hope that Senator Obama and Senator \nClinton would address this very important responsibility of the next \nPresident of the United States. But I would submit, again, it is our \nresponsibility to promptly move on these nominations and to give these \nnominees a fair up-or-down vote. That has not been happening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2003.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: As the ten newest members \n     of the United States Senate, we write to express our concerns \n     about the state of the federal judicial nomination and \n     confirmation process. The apparent breakdown in this process \n     reflects poorly on the ability of the Senate and the \n     Administration to work together in the best interests of our \n     country. The breakdown also disserves the qualified nominees \n     to the federal bench whose confirmations have been delayed or \n     blocked, and the American people who rely on our federal \n     courts for justice.\n       We, the ten freshmen of the United States Senate for the \n     108th Congress, are a diverse group. Among our ranks are \n     former federal executive branch officials, members of the \n     U.S. House of Representatives, and state attorneys general. \n     We include state and local officials, and a former trial and \n     appellate judge. We have different viewpoints on a variety of \n     important issues currently facing our country. But we are \n     united in our commitment to maintaining and preserving a fair \n     and effective justice system for all Americans. And we are \n     united in our concern that the judicial confirmation process \n     is broken and needs to be fixed.\n       In some instances, when a well qualified nominee for the \n     federal bench is denied a vote, the obstruction is justified \n     on the ground of how prior nominees--typically, the nominees \n     of a previous President--were treated. All of these \n     recriminations, made by members on both sides of the aisle, \n     relate to circumstances which occurred before any of us \n     arrived in the United States Senate. None of us were parties \n     to any of the reported past offenses, whether real or \n     perceived. None of us believe that the ill will of the past \n     should dictate the terms and direction of the future.\n       Each of us firmly believes that the United States Senate \n     needs a fresh start. And each of us believes strongly that we \n     were elected to this body in order to do a job for the \n     citizens of our respective states--to enact legislation to \n     stimulate our economy, protect national security, and promote \n     the national welfare, and to provide advice and consent, and \n     to vote on the President's nominations to important positions \n     in the executive branch and on our nation's courts.\n       Accordingly, the ten freshmen of the United States Senate \n     for the 108th Congress urge you to work toward improving the \n     Senate's use of the current process or establishing a better \n     process for the Senate's consideration of judicial \n     nominations. We acknowledge that the White House should be \n     included in repairing this process.\n       All of us were elected to do a job. Unfortunately, the \n     current state of our judicial confirmation process prevents \n     us from doing an important part of that job. We seek a \n     bipartisan solution that will protect the integrity and \n     independence of our nation's courts, ensure fairness for \n     judicial nominees, and leave the bitterness of the past \n     behind us.\n           Yours truly,\n         John Cornyn, Lisa Murkowski, Elizabeth Dole, Norm \n           Coleman, Lamar Alexander, Mark Pryor, Lindsey Graham, \n           Saxby Chambliss, Jim Talent, John E. Sununu.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire how much time is remaining on \nthis side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Texas and would note, \nas he did, my colleague from Arizona, John McCain, is making an \nimportant statement today respecting the need to confirm good judges \nfor our court of appeals and Federal district courts--something which \nhe will be committed to when he is President of the United States.\n  Our friends around the country might be wondering: What exactly is \ngoing on around here? Why are we talking about the need to confirm \njudges? It is a good question. The answer is this: It is interesting \nthat in most of the Presidencies--in fact, in the last four \nPresidencies--in the last 2 years of the Presidency, the other party is \nin charge of the Senate. You had that situation with Ronald Reagan; \nwith George Bush, the 41st President; with Bill Clinton; and with the \ncurrent President Bush. In each case, the other party was in charge of \nthe Senate the last 2 years of their Presidency.\n  Now, on the average, between 15 and 17 circuit court judges have been \nconfirmed in the last 2 years, even though it is the other party in \ncharge of the Senate. That is because we have a responsibility under \nthe Constitution to act on the nominees the President, regardless of \nparty, has made.\n  That is his job, and this is our job. Both of us have to do our jobs. \nIt would not be appropriate for the Senate to simply sit on our hands \nand not act on the nominees of the President, even though he may be of \nthe other party.\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\n  So between 15 and 17 nominees of the President have been confirmed \neach of the last 2 years for these last Presidencies. But, \nunfortunately, that is not the case with the current President. We are \nnot on track to get that number confirmed. In fact, we have only had \nsix confirmed.\n  That is why our leader, Senator McConnell, sought to have an \nagreement with the majority leader to try to get more circuit judges \nconfirmed. An agreement was reached that at least three judges would be \nconfirmed by the end of this month.\n  Now, what is interesting is that up to now, there has been sort of a \nsense that: Well, it is not possible to get very many judges confirmed. \nIt takes a long time, and there is a lot of process involved. But what \nthis latest agreement demonstrates, as Senator Specter, who spoke \nearlier, pointed out, is that when the majority party wants to, it can \nact very quickly to confirm judges. In fact, it can move very quickly.\n  That is what Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, is now doing because, unfortunately, he does not want to \ntake the judges who are in the queue and get those judges considered by \nthe committee on the floor of the Senate and voted on by the Senate. He \nhas judges that he would rather get considered, but they were way \nbehind in the process. So he is speeding them up, getting them through \nthe process very quickly, in breach of what had been the policy in the \npast.\n\n  Nevertheless, he is moving them along very quickly with an intention, \nI gather, to try to comply with this agreement and get them confirmed \nby the end of the month. That is a good thing in the sense that we will \nget three more circuit court nominees.\n  I suspect it does illustrate that the Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate can act quickly when we want to get these confirmations \naccomplished. But that will leave us several more judges who have been \npending a long time. That will leave us the months of June, July, and \nSeptember, at least, when we can confirm additional nominees. The \nquestion will be, what will happen then? Will we act with similar \nalacrity?\n  We have one judge nominee, Peter Keisler, who has been pending for \nalmost 2 years now. His hearing has been held. All he has to do is come \nbefore the committee. That will take 1 or 2 weeks at the most, and he \ncould be on the floor of the Senate. We have other nominees from the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals, four nominees pending in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Judge Robert Conrad and Steve Matthews are ready for \nhearings. Mr. Rod Rosenstein of Maryland could be ready but is being \nblocked by the two Senators from his State. Judge Steven Agee had a \nhearing last week.\n  So there are judges in the queue who could be dealt with. There is no \nreason to hold them back except a possible desire not to get them \nconfirmed or politics. I don't know what is behind it. There is no \nreason not to move forward with these nominees.\n  The Washington Post, no big supporter of the President, said \nrecently, after we confirmed one court of appeals nominee:\n\n       That should be only the beginning. . . .In the past two \n     years, the Senate has confirmed seven nominees to the Court \n     of Appeals; 16 such nominees were confirmed during President \n     Bill Clinton's final two years in office.\n       It appears unlikely that Democratic Senators will match \n     that number, but they should at least give every current \n     nominee an up-or-down vote and expeditiously process the \n     nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, \n     where five of the court's 15 seats are vacant.\n\n  That was an editorial entitled, ``Judges, and Justice, Delayed: The \nSenate Needs To Move Faster On Court Nominations,'' of April 15, 2008. \nThat is obviously very true. There is no reason these other judges \ncannot be considered as well. When we ask the question, what is really \ngoing on, it is that the chairman of the committee apparently is \ndesirous of picking and choosing which nominees move forward. It is not \na matter that the nominees cannot move forward.\n  In one case, or in two or three cases, they are ready to have the \nhearings. In one case, the hearing has already been held. So it is \nliterally only a matter of a week or two before those nominees could be \nbrought to the Senate floor. As illustrated by the current process, to \nget these other judges confirmed by Memorial Day, it is clear that when \nwe want to we can accelerate the process and get the job done.\n  I will close by noting that regarding the nominee who has been \npending now for almost 2 years, Peter Keisler, the Washington Post had \nthis to say:\n\n       Peter Keisler was nominated in 2006 to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the DC Circuit; his confirmation hearing was in \n     August of that year. It is a travesty that he has yet to get \n     a vote from the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Here, I will interpose, what is the holdup? Going back to the \neditorial:\n\n       Mr. Keisler, who was chief of the Justice Department's \n     Civil Division before joining a private law firm, earns \n     plaudits from the right and left for stellar intellect and \n     his judicial demeanor. Democrats have held up Mr. Keisler's \n     nomination over a squabble about whether the DC Circuit needs \n     12 full-time judges. That dispute is over: Congress \n     eliminated the 12th seat this year. Mr. Keisler should be \n     confirmed forthwith.\n\n  So, clearly, we have nominees who should be confirmed. They are in \nthe queue waiting. They could be easily taken up this week or next \nweek. Their hearings need to be held. They need to be brought to the \nSenate floor and I urge my colleagues to work with us to move this \nprocess forward so these important nominees can be considered by the \nfull Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3758-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3758-S3760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAA MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the FAA Modernization Act, which we are \ndebating in the Senate today, makes critical improvements that will \nensure our aviation system is safe and efficient. That will put us on a \npath to modernizing our air traffic control system.\n  Now, in a short while, early this afternoon, the Senate will vote on \nwhether we will finish this bill and send it to conference or whether \nRepublicans are again going to refuse to work with us and force us to \ntake this bill off the Senate floor.\n  I hope we are going to vote to move forward this afternoon. My \ncolleagues on the Commerce and Finance Committees worked very hard on \nthis important bill because it is critical to our Nation's economy that \nour aviation system work smoothly. We have some serious problems that \nwe need to address.\n  Our air travel infrastructure is aging fast. It needs to be updated. \nThe bill before us will help us modernize our aviation system to ensure \nthat it continues to be the safest in the world.\n  We also have to take action to help carriers deal with rising fuel \ncosts and, of course, to protect our passengers by reducing flight \ndelays and cancellations.\n  Unfortunately, as we speak this morning, the Senate is essentially \ndeadlocked. Republicans say they object to certain tax provisions, even \nthough this bill, I remind everyone, was supported overwhelmingly when \nit was marked up in the Finance Committee. But our Republican \ncolleagues insist that we strip out every provision that isn't directly \nlinked to aviation. If that isn't done, they say they are going to \nfilibuster this bill and keep us from ever getting to a final vote on \nit.\n  The majority leader has said time and again that he would welcome \namendments to the bill, but Republicans have refused. Instead of \nworking with us to come to an agreement on the points they oppose, they \nare going to block the whole bill.\n  What is most unfortunate about the Republican filibuster today is \nthat this is a vitally important piece of legislation. Although my job \nas chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee is to \ndeal with appropriations, not authorizations, I can also tell you that \nthis FAA bill is not just a bill that would be nice to have, it is a \nbill we must have.\n  Some of our most important aviation authorities expire at the end of \nthis June. That means by the end of next month, if this bill is not \nenacted, the FAA will no longer have the authority to spend money out \nof the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.\n  Every penny that has been appropriated for purchasing and \nmodernization at the FAA is paid for out of that fund. So if this bill \ndoesn't become law at the end of next month, billions of dollars in \nprojects at the FAA are going to grind to a halt.\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\n  If this bill doesn't become law, all of the employees who work on \nthose projects will be told to stay home because the agency would not \nbe able to pay them.\n  Mr. President, that is not all. Republican obstruction of this bill \nwould cost billions of dollars in capital projects at our Nation's \nairports. The entire Airport Improvement Program, or AIP, would be shut \ndown, and billions of dollars in critical safety improvements at \nairports across the country would go unspent.\n\n  Finally, our ability to collect ticket taxes from air travelers in \norder to fund our trust fund will run out. That would push the FAA's \nprimary source of funding closer to bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, these are not just small things. These programs ensure \nthat airplanes and airports operate safely, and nobody can argue that \nsafety would not be harmed if we shut down the ability of the FAA to \nmodernize its long-outdated radar infrastructure.\n  I wish to talk about one of the nonaviation provisions that the \nRepublicans say is a reason they are standing in the way of this \nimportant critical piece of legislation. I want to tell you why I \nbelieve it is critical to keep it in this legislation. The provision I \nam referring to addresses an urgent problem with the highway trust \nfund.\n  If we don't act now, the highway trust fund will go bankrupt sometime \nnext year. If that happens, it will put a stop to Federal road projects \nacross our entire country. That means bridge improvements, turn lanes, \nhighway widenings, and countless projects would no longer get the \nFederal funding that has been promised. These are vital projects to all \nof our communities. They ensure that our highways are safe. They are \nessential to commerce and economic development.\n  It is critical to every State in our Nation and everybody who drives \non our Federal highway system that we find a way to keep this trust \nfund solvent.\n  I have been sounding the alarm over this looming disaster for almost \n2 years. We are at a point now where we have to find a fix to ensure \nthat we don't have to make disastrous cuts in our highway spending next \nyear.\n  Very early in this Congress, both Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley committed in writing to myself and my ranking member, Senator \nBond, that they would make this fix that is now contained in this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to Senator Bond and myself be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2007.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the \n         Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related \n         Agencies, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the \n         Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related \n         Agencies, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Murray and Bond: Meeting the funding \n     obligations laid out in SAFETEA-LU is of vital importance to \n     our nation's transportation system. According to the recent \n     CBO projections, the Highway Trust Fund shows a shortfall of \n     several billion dollars in fiscal year 2009, the last year of \n     SAFETEA-LU. The Senate Finance Committee is dedicated to \n     finding the necessary revenues to keep the Highway Trust Fund \n     whole for the life of the current authorization. We are \n     actively working on several options to accomplish this task.\n       We appreciate this opportunity to share our commitment to \n     meeting the nation's transportation needs.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Max Baucus,\n       Chairman.\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       Ranking Member.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in the tax portion of the aviation bill, \nChairman Baucus and Senator Grassley are keeping their word. This \nprovision in this bill authorizes that there will be enough money to \ncontinue highway projects under SAFETEA-LU--the Federal transportation \nplanning bill.\n  As I said, this addresses an urgent need. If the highway trust fund \nprovision is stripped from this bill, my subcommittee could be required \nto cut highway spending for 2009 by $14 billion just to keep the trust \nfund out of bankruptcy next year. That will represent a cut of more \nthan one-third in a single year.\n  I think all of our colleagues should know exactly what is being put \nat risk if the highway trust fund provisions were to be stripped out of \nthis bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table that has been prepared by the \nFederal Highway Administration be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION--FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION--COMPARISION OF DISTRIBUTION OF OBLIGATION\n

The agency's table shows all of us the amount of money \neach and every State will see cut next year if the highway trust fund \nwere not fixed and if we are required to fix it through the \nappropriations process for 2009. No State will be spared. Look up your \nown State. Texas will lose $822 million. Kentucky will lose $175 \nmillion. Minnesota will lose $125 million. Maine would lose $44 \nmillion. The list goes on. Look up your State and learn what is at risk \nif we don't vote to move this bill forward and solve this problem.\n  I remind my colleagues that the provisions in this bill do not fix \nthe trust fund on the long-term basis. The fix that is in this bill \nwill only be sufficient to keep the highway trust fund in the black \nthrough 2009. But cutting this provision would not just mean States \nwould lose the ability to make urgent road improvements, it would also \nmean a loss of a half million jobs across our Nation.\n  Many of my colleagues have talked about the terrible impact felt in \nthe construction sector by the recent economic slowdown. Some have \ncalled for economic stimulus proposals to get the sector back on its \nfeet.\n  I have to say, stripping the highway trust provision out of this bill \nwill have the exact opposite effect. It will mean layoffs at a time \nwhen our economy badly needs help. So I hope our colleagues take that \ninto consideration when we vote this afternoon on whether to move \nforward on this bill.\n  In addition, I hope my colleagues remember that earlier this year we \nlearned some disturbing news about the FAA's handling of safety \ninspections at Southwest Airlines. We learned that the FAA had not \nreviewed Southwest's system for complying with certain agency safety \ndirectives since 1999. That revelation caused a great deal of concern \nabout the FAA's safety inspections across the country, with very good \nreason. Those inspections are important because they help our airlines \nand the FAA discover potential problems and address them before there \nis a tragedy.\n  But when Congress began looking into the problem, we found it was \nmuch more extensive. Last month, at a hearing with the Acting FAA \nAdministrator, Robert Sturgell, and the Department of Transportation \ninspector general, I learned for well over 5 years the FAA had not \nexamined whether Southwest was using the right safety systems for \ncertain maintenance requirements.\n  Now, you can imagine I was concerned to hear about that. So I asked \nhim how many other airlines had missed safety inspections. Mr. Sturgell \ncould not answer me. Well, I asked him to get it back to me. I finally \nreceived an answer. The FAA now tells us it has failed to perform \ndozens of mandatory inspections at seven other major air carriers.\n  In fact, the FAA now says it has missed more than 100 of these \nrequired safety inspections at major airlines. Mr. Sturgell said that \npart of the reason might be ``inadequate resources.'' Well, I am not \nsure how that could be. I have been working, along with my colleagues, \nto increase funding for FAA inspections for the last 7 years--in fact \nand this is true of my appropriations subcommittee, whether I have been \nchairman or my Republican colleagues have been chairman, for the last 4 \nyears. We have provided more funding for more safety inspectors than \nthe FAA has ever requested of us. So this is a funding issue? The FAA \nhasn't been honest about the true needs of its agency.\n\n  Now, I know Congress has been doing its part to build the inspection \nworkforce without the benefit of a request from the FAA, and as a \nresult, we have hundreds more inspectors across the country than the \nFAA has ever requested. Either way, I have serious concerns because the \nagency has insisted that the airlines must be the ones to guarantee the \nsafety of their operations, and it is said that FAA inspectors are best \nused to ensure that the airlines have assistance to do the job. Now we \nare being told that the FAA is years behind in inspecting those very \nsystems.\n  The lesson from the Southwest debacle is that these safety \ninspections matter. They are one of the best indicators of whether an \nairline has its act together when it comes to maintenance and safety \ncompliance. Clearly, the FAA needs to bring more focus and leadership \nto meeting its own self-imposed deadlines, and we will be looking for \nquarterly reports and answers on this as we move forward.\n  So with all of these safety concerns as a backdrop, this afternoon we \nare now facing a filibuster from our Republican colleagues who want to \nbring down the FAA safety authorization bill. We have a bill before us \nthat clearly offers us a chance to make a difference for safety, for \nour airlines, for our passengers, for our highways, and for our \neconomy. We are talking about a bill that ensures the safety of our air \ntravel. This is a critically important bill and, by the way, until \nrecently a bipartisan one. But now we are hearing that the Republicans \nwant to wage their 68th filibuster on a bill that is important to all \nof us.\n  We have the ability to move forward. I urge our Republican colleagues \nto work with us and to not obstruct this bill this afternoon because \nanyone who has stood in an endless line at an airport or had their \nflight canceled or wanted to have important highway improvements done \nis counting on us to do the job. So I urge my colleagues to negotiate \ninstead of blocking progress, and I hope they will work with us to do \nthis quickly as we move to the bill today.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first I wish to thank Senator Murray for \nher comments. I couldn't agree with her more. I know the people of \nMaryland are very much concerned about the FAA reauthorization bill and \ngetting it done. Passenger safety is critically important to the people \nof Maryland and this Nation. Modernizing our air system is very \nimportant. I thank Senator Murray for the comments she made.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3761-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n                         JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Presidentt, I wish to first respond, if I might, to \nthe comments Senator Kyl made in regard to consideration of judicial \nappointments.\n  Of course, one of the most important responsibilities each one of us \nin the Senate has is to deal with confirmation of judges who have \nlifetime appointments to the Federal bench. It seems to me the \nRepublicans are criticizing the Democratic leadership because sometimes \nthey think we move too slowly, and now they are criticizing us for \nmoving too fast on nominations. I don't quite understand it.\n  I hope the public will look at the record. When President Clinton was \nPresident of the United States, when he left office, there were 32 \nvacancies on the circuit courts of this Nation. Today, that number \nstands at 12. We have moved the confirmation process forward. I think \nwe have done it in the appropriate manner.\n  I would also point out that there have been three circuit court \njudges who have had some controversy surrounding their confirmations in \nwhich there was opposition by Democrats, but at no time did Democrats \ndelay the consideration of those nominations on the floor. They came \nup, they were voted on, there was never a filibuster, and there was \nnever an effort made to slow it down. In fact, on one judicial \nappointment that was voted for on this floor, it was the Republicans \nwho asked for the delay so they could get the necessary votes to get \nthe nomination out of committee. So I think the record speaks for \nitself as to the consideration of judicial appointments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3761-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I think it is ironic that the Republican \nwhip used this opportunity to talk about delaying judicial appointments \nwhen the Republicans are in their 68th filibuster in this Congress. \nSixty-eight filibusters. The most recent, of course, is the Federal \nAviation Administration Reauthorization Act, the bill that is on the \nfloor right now that we will have a chance to vote on later today. We \nhave been on this bill for over a week without a vote because the \nRepublicans are filibustering it. This is a bill which is critically \nimportant to the people of this Nation--first and foremost because of \nsafety. I think Senator Murray pointed this out very clearly.\n  We need to implement the next generation of an air transportation \nsystem that was recommended in 2004. We still haven't implemented that. \nThis legislation provides $290 million annually to modernize our \nsatellite-based system. I am told there are some automobiles that have \nmore sophisticated guidance systems or satellite identification systems \nthan our planes. We need to do a better job.\n  We have a bill that was crafted in a bipartisan way in our committee \nthat has come forward. Let's consider it on the floor for the sake of \nthe people of this Nation--for their safety. We know that every year \nmillions and millions more people are flying. Air traffic is up. We \nneed to modernize our system for the safety of the people of this \ncountry.\n  We need more safety inspectors; we certainly know that from what has \nhappened this year with the number of aircraft that were not properly \ninspected. This bill will provide the wherewithal in order to make sure \nwe carry out the inspections in the best interests of the people of \nthis Nation.\n  I am sure people are very aware of their fellow citizens being \nstranded on runways for up to 11 hours without being tended to. This \nlegislation provides for a passengers bill of rights so that we have \nsome basic protection for those who travel by air in this country.\n  It is important for our entire country, but let me just point out \nwhat it means in Maryland.\n  We have 20 million passengers who go through the Baltimore/Washington \nInternational Thurgood Marshall Airport, adding $5.1 billion to the \neconomy of my State of Maryland. I could talk about the essential air \nservice which affects one community in my State, the Hagerstown \nRegional Airport. That is in this bill.\n  My point is that this bill is a comprehensive bill that affects every \npart of our country, and it deserves a vote on this floor.\n  Hagerstown Regional Airport is critically important to the economic \ndevelopment of the people of that region, and the central air service \nwhich is extended in this legislation allows it to become the economic \nstimulus for additional growth in the Hagerstown area. So there is a \nlot depending upon this bill moving forward.\n\n  Yes, later today we are going to have a vote. It is a very simple \nvote. It is a vote on whether we are going to move forward on the \nlegislation or we are going to allow the filibuster to continue--the \n68th filibuster the Republicans have initiated in this Congress.\n  Majority Leader Reid has made it clear that if the Republicans or any \nMember of the Senate doesn't like a provision in the bill, they can \noffer an amendment to take it out. We will have a vote on that \namendment. There is no effort being made here to stop debate. What we \nare trying to do is take up a bill, not spend a full week in doing no \nwork on the floor because we are in a filibuster. Let's end this \nfilibuster, let's take up the amendments, let's vote on the amendments, \nand let the majority rule on this very important subject. That is what \nwe are asking for today.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. It has enjoyed bipartisan support. The \npublic wants us--Democrats and Republicans--to work together on issues \nthat are critically important to the future of our country. Air traffic \nand passenger safety is critically important to the future of America. \nSo I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan differences and allow us \nto let democracy work. Allow us to vote on the issues. Allow us to \nbring forward this critically important bill to the people of this \ncountry. We will have a chance to do that later today, and I hope that \nthe necessary Members of this body will vote to put aside their \npartisan differences and allow us to have a vote for the sake of the \nsafety of the people of this Nation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3761-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is an interesting situation in \nwhich we find ourselves today.\n  I guess I have to say last week was the most frustrating week I have \nspent in the Senate in my 24 years here. We are discussing an aviation \nbill which has highway provisions. We are discussing, for example, in \nthe Presiding Officer's State, the need for essential\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\nair service, shown by its loss of Frontier Airlines, and my State there \nis a similar situation and other States are in similar situations.\n  We are also talking about the fact that airlines are not being run in \na safe enough manner. We are talking about the fact that we are just \nbehind Mongolia in terms of our air traffic control system, in terms of \nits relevance to the modern age. It is a very scary situation.\n  Last week, we did not hold a single vote. We were on the aviation \nbill all week, but we did not have a single vote on aviation. I find \nthat interesting, and I find it profoundly depressing, and, to a \ncertain extent, it defines what the American people find so inadequate \nabout Congress or, in this case, the Senate.\n  We have ideas, people work very hard, they work long hours, staff \nworks particularly long hours, we negotiate, Members negotiate, we come \nto what we think is an agreement, and then days go by and nothing \nhappens.\n  I repeat, I have never been through a situation where we have been on \na bill which is this important and where 1 billion passengers are going \nto be using this air traffic system in 2015 and they are going to be \nusing it on basically a ``Polaroid camera'' technology system. We have \nnot had crashes. We did have one in Kentucky, but it is a little bit \nsimilar to post-9/11: Unless you have crashes that attract lots of \ncameras, people begin to lose interest. If there is anything not to \nlose interest in, it is not only the war on terror, but it is also \naviation safety.\n\n  I repeat, we had all last week devoted to the aviation bill. We had \none vote over the course of 5 days. That vote was a procedural vote--\nnot the kind of thing that raises you out of your seat with excitement. \nOther than that, we did not vote on one aviation issue for the entire \nweek.\n  When Senator Lott and I began this process a long time ago, we \noperated in a completely bipartisan manner. Senator Hutchison and \nmyself were doing the same thing. We wanted to work together. We had \nworked together before on the aviation subcommittee. We had operated in \na bipartisan manner. Senator Reid wanted to bring the FAA \nreauthorization bill to the floor. It was timely. It was important. I \nworked very hard, from my point of view, to compromise.\n  I have a very large problem with the fact that high-end corporate \njets and personal jets that may have one or two people on them, plus \nstacks of sandwiches and goodies, take the same amount of time for the \nair traffic controllers to navigate through the skies as some airplane \nthat have 300 people aboard. A plane which is headed somewhere in \nAmerica with people who have all kinds of work they have to do. Some \nare on vacation, because we are at that time of year, but most people \nare traveling because they have to travel--they have to go to a \nmeeting, they have to be somewhere, they have to visit somebody sick in \ntheir family.\n  What is interesting is the general aviation community is paying for \nabout 3 percent of the entire cost of the air traffic control system--3 \npercent, which means the commercial airlines are paying 97 percent. Yet \nthe general aviation community dominates the skies at any given moment. \nThere are an average of 36,000 planes in the skies during the day, and \ntwo-thirds of them are likely to be general aviation.\n  Of course, as soon as I said that, every Senator got 1,500 telephone \ncalls from high-end jet users. I was on the Commerce Committee. We had \nto work this out with the Finance Committee. I worked with the Finance \nCommittee, and we came up with a system that didn't put that kind of \nburden on the general aviation system.\n  My provision, which they said was really quite a horrendous thing to \nconsider, was when a 737 or GV or GVIII takes off, they have to pay a \n$25 fee. If they flew to Bonn, which has this system already, \nobviously--all of Europe does--if they returned, they would have to pay \nanother $25 fee. That would be a total of $50.\n  They began to talk about the end of general aviation as we know it. I \nstood back, aghast, at the sense of perspective in all of this. What \nthey very well know is in general aviation we excluded 90 percent of \nall general aviation aircraft from this provision--crop dusters in \nMontana up to King Airs, everything was excluded; everything. Single-\nengine planes that doctors and lawyers fly to calm their nerves and get \ntheir heads in order--all those are excluded. Only the high-end jets--\nrich people, big corporations, big planes getting the full attention of \nthe air traffic control system would have had to pay the fee in my \nprovision.\n  I negotiated this provision with Senator Baucus, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. He had a different perspective on this issue. \nBecause he has superb staff and he himself is very good, I understood I \nwas not going to get anywhere with my approach--which is a very small, \nlittle item in all of this. So I backed off from my approach and I \neliminated this horrendous, Draconian, Attila the Hun-type $25 fee that \nit would actually take should the Presiding Officer own a G-8, that he \nwouldn't have to pay that. He simply would not have to pay that. He \ncould just go right off and fly to Bonn and not pay that $25. So I \nbacked off on that.\n  Then everything began to come together, and I was really encouraged \nthat the full Senate could reach an agreement once the Commerce and \nFinance Committee bills were reconciled, and this appeared to be \nhappening. But, on the other hand, there were other issues, so I got \ntogether with Senator Hutchison, and our staffs got together.\n  Actually, it was Leader Reid who came up with a very smart idea. The \nidea, Senator Hutchison told me, was of interest to her. She said that \nsounds pretty good. It was the following: All aviation taxes, keep them \nbut raise nothing on commercial airlines. Why? Because you have to hold \nthem harmless because they are broke--some are in chapter 11, some in \nchapter 7--whatever it is they are in a mess. Keep the highway funding \nprovisions. There are those who believe it is pretty important. It \ncreates a lot of jobs. But strike the tax increases to pay for the \nhighway funding, to use general funds--revenues to pay for highway \nspending. Keep the bonds for New York. Keep railroad bonds. Strike tax \nincreases to pay for bonds.\n  We take sort of the extraneous financial parts of the aviation bill, \nwhich do not deal directly with aviation--and therefore you could say: \nWhat are we doing this for? You know you want money in the highway \ntrust fund. I do. We do in West Virginia. The Presiding Officer's \npeople do in Montana. We agreed to say, as we did with the alternative \nminimum tax--the Republicans voting along with that--that we would do \nthese things, but we would not pay for them. That warmed my heart \nbecause it struck me that we were approaching a deal.\n  Then we agreed--that is, between Senator Hutchison and myself--to \nstrike the pension provision, which affected American Airlines and a \ncouple of others, on the basis that it was already settled law. It had \nbeen settled last year. It was the law of the land, and you don't just \nremove it.\n  Then there was kind of a return offer. It started out with no New \nYork bonds. The New York bonds are in the President's budget. They are \npart of the commitment the U.S. Government and the President of the \nUnited States made to the State of New York after the 9/11 attacks. So \nthat seemed to be something that could be done. But a lot of people, \nevidently, don't like New York--it would appear to be that way--so they \nsaid we have to get rid of those New York things. They also wanted to \nchange the railroad bonds from tax credit bonds to tax-exempt bonds. \nThat is cheaper. Maybe we can live with that. Working with Finance, we \ncould likely work out a deal on railroad bonds, though railroads are \nnot aviation, but they are a serious matter. That would probably be \nworked out. However, New York bonds we were told are simply off the \ntable. That will affect rather deeply one New York Senator I can think \nof, who has a way of expressing himself quite strongly on this issue. \nBut other than that, it seemed to me that everything could get pretty \nwell worked out.\n\n  The problem was I had not heard from Senator Hutchison, and none of \nmy staff had. We didn't really know, therefore, what she was thinking. \nShe had said: That seems like a pretty good idea. Then we get back this \nother proposal, which complicates things.\n  Now I understand that Senator Hutchison, the Republican leader, \nSenator McConnell, are in conversation. I\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\npray--I earnestly pray that they are in conversation right now about \nwhat to do about this because I really don't want to spend the next \nweek not voting, and I really don't want to come to a cloture vote this \nafternoon which cannot possibly pass because, in more or less uniform \nfashion, the other party votes against it.\n  That is my sense of where we are at the moment. A number of people \nhave come down and spoken about the bill. They have spoken usefully. \nBut the important thing was that we chose not to act. We simply chose \nnot to act. I reiterated that our aviation system is on the brink of \ncollapse. Our air traffic system cannot handle the burdens of today, \nmuch less tomorrow.\n  I repeat my oft-used example of landing at Washington National \nAirport the other day and it was just wall-to-wall people, from one end \nof the airport to the other. I really couldn't figure that out what it \nwould look like in about 5 more years and when we were soon going to \nhave 300 or 400 million more people using this airport. What would it \nlook like? How could it expand? What do air traffic control people do? \nIn the meantime, the commercial airline industry is losing billions of \ndollars, and the increasing cost of fuel could force additional \nbankruptcies, and that means even more widespread job losses. If we do \nnot pass this bill, essential air service disappears. Airport \nimprovement development programs, which all rural States depend on with \nevery fiber in their body, will disappear. And our constituents whom, \nthe last I heard, we represent, we would be saying to them: You go \nahead and wait for 9 hours or 2 days, a lot of cancellations, and that \nis really OK because we can't agree as between the two sides.\n  I am boggled by the concept of us ignoring a problem so huge for so \nlong--just in the past week, much less in the last 10 to 15 years. \nCompromise is the essence of the Senate. I had hoped and I truly \nbelieved that we could make the necessary compromises to move this \nbill. I still hope that. I am always optimistic.\n  I compromised, as I said, on what are to me a number of really basic \ncore issues in order to move this important legislation forward. \nSenator Baucus and I had a number of serious policy differences over \nhow to fund the modernization of our air traffic control system, but \nbecause of the urgency of the legislation and our good working \nrelationship, we reached agreement. Why? Because we had to. I only wish \nour colleagues shared this sense of urgency.\n  People sometimes have their particular parts of a bill which they \nraise to sort of a sainted status.\n  They are called amendments. And if you are a floor manager of a bill, \nyou are trying to pass a bill. On the other hand, if you are an \nindividual Member of the Senate and you have a particular issue that \nyou care about and you put it up as an amendment, and it becomes your \nbill. Actually, it is an amendment, but if that amendment passes and it \nis not agreeable to others, then the whole bill fails. That is not the \nway democracy is meant to work.\n  Now, I have very high regard for Senator Hutchison, and I really do \nbelieve we can work out all of the aviation-related amendments to this \nbill in a bipartisan fashion. I will not give up on that. I never give \nup on anything.\n  We cannot work out the disagreements over nonaviation issues but, \nthen again, maybe we can. As I have indicated, I will come back to this \nbill at a moment's notice. It should not take a crisis or a major \naccident, a bankruptcy that strands tens of thousands of passengers, or \na long hot summer for this bill to be considered.\n  I will say also that Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens want to \ncontinue this as soon as we can. So I do urge my colleagues to take the \nlong view. At the appropriate time I will urge them to vote for \ncloture. In the mean time, I stand here as manager of the bill without \nmuch going on. And I have gotten accustomed to that, but I have not \ngotten to like it any more.\n  There are no amusing aspects to it nor, most importantly, for the \nairlines and the people who travel on them. So since I am here alone, \nand not challenged by any others, I will continue to make some other \nremarks, and I will talk about aviation safety because I haven't \nsufficiently had an opportunity to discuss this. It is a speech that I \nwould either give this afternoon or this morning. So why not give it \nthis morning when I am sure I can give it all.\n  Aviation safety provisions are obviously at the core of our \nlegislation to reauthorize the FAA and are fundamental to the public's \nfaith in our aviation system. The FAA is responsible for overseeing the \nlargest and most complex aviation system in the entire world.\n  I am proud to say our country is a global leader in aviation safety. \nBut as I have cautioned before over the last months, that reputation \nhas come under serious doubt and there are always numbers to be looked \nat underneath--you know, a number of accidents, and the FAA's lax \noversight of Southwest Airlines has cast a serious pall over the \nagency's ability to execute its core mission.\n  Around that is the safety of the Nation's aviation system. \nUnfortunately, the agency's casual oversight of Southwest does not \nappear to be an isolated incident, despite the agency's claims to the \ncontrary. Just the other day the front pages of our Nation's newspapers \ndescribed another potential FAA coverup, this time on runway safety \nviolations. And nobody has thought about that very much. That simply is \nairplanes taxiing on runways either to get to the terminal, or to get \naway from the terminal, and to get into the air. So air traffic \ncontrollers do not just look up in the sky, they have to look down on \nthe runways. I know the FAA states it is working to address each new \nproblem that becomes public. But with each new story, we have more \nquestions than answers about the agency's commitment to the ability to \naddress pressing safety issues.\n  At an aviation subcommittee hearing several weeks ago on this issue, \nI called for the Secretary of Transportation and the White House to \nengage on this issue. And I would actually make a point here. I am not \naware of any White House involvement on any of these issues about \naviation at any point.\n  I have not talked to anybody from the White House nor has any staff. \nThey are just watching it happen. There is a pattern to this, but the \npattern in this case is a cruel one because it is sort of deliberately \ncondemning. I think it is fairly well understood that much of what \nhappens on the Senate floor emanates from directions from the White \nHouse.\n  So I call for the Secretary of Transportation and the White House to \nengage on the issue. The administration issued a number of statements \nand committed to undertaking serious review of the FAA's safety \noversight.\n  I am still not convinced it appreciates the severity of the \nchallenges facing the FAA. I get the distinct impression the changes \nthe FAA implemented are in response to our actions in the Congress. I \nstill need reassurances that the senior leadership at the FAA, the DOT, \nand the White House itself recognize the extent of the FAA's problems \nand are committed to rectifying them. I do not think that is \nunreasonable. This is a massive national problem which people take for \ngranted, but they cannot anymore because the system is collapsing.\n  I know many in the FAA and the industry cite the fact that there has \nnot been a fatal airline accident in almost 2 years, and that \nstatistically this is the safest time in the history of aviation to \nfly. That is the kind of statement, as soon as I hear it, I \nautomatically start having darker thoughts because it is much too \nsimplistic and optimistic a statement to make under any situation.\n  They happen to be correct, statistically. I still want to believe and \nbe certain that the United States has the safest and best air \ntransportation system in the world. Although the United States has not \nexperienced a tragic accident since August 2006, the fatal crash of a \ncommuter carrier in Lexington, KY, our aviation nevertheless has \nexperienced a disturbing number of significant safety lapses. Any \nsafety lapse is either inches or feet or seconds away from becoming a \ntragedy.\n  Although the FAA's oversight of airline maintenance has dominated the \nnewspapers and the question of whether their maintenance should be done \noffshore, without particularly rigorous oversight, the number of \nserious runway incursions remains unacceptably\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\nhigh and, as the General Accountability Office has stated, they are \ntrending in a troubling direction.\n  I love that phrase, ``trending in a troubling direction,'' which, out \nof a Government agency, means that you are approaching catastrophe.\n  As I have said, having the safest system in the world does not mean \nit is safe enough. I am deeply concerned that the risk of a \ncatastrophic accident is increasing rather than decreasing. We have all \nread the stories of near misses at our Nation's airports. Let's be \nhonest. Had it not been for the quick thinking and actions of a few \ncontrollers and pilots, our Nation would have had at least one if not \nseveral major accidents claiming the lives of hundreds of people.\n  I do not mean to be overly dramatic or to scare the public, but I am \ngrowing increasingly concerned that our aviation system is operating on \nborrowed time. A National Transportation Safety Board member testified \nbefore our aviation subcommittee of the Commerce Committee earlier this \nmonth, and he stated he believed the next major aviation accident would \nnot likely be in the sky, or some plane crashing into a mountain, it \nwould take place on a runway. That would be the next major accident.\n  Many, including myself, have criticized the agency for being too \nclose to the industry it regulates. Now, that is an easy statement on \nmy part to make, and not fair in its entirety because we have some very \ngood inspectors. We have some very good people in the industry that are \ntrying, and then there are probably weaknesses on both sides. There \ncertainly are weaknesses on both sides.\n  In 1996, to stave off efforts to privatize the FAA Congress accepted \nat that time a provision from both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations so they could operate the FAA more like a business. We \ngave the agency special authority so it could run more like a private \nentity. The theory was that by running it like a business, it would \ncost less to operate. We must recognize that the FAA is not a business; \nit is a Government agency paid for by the people who it may or may not \nbe protecting.\n\n  The FAA does not provide commercial services, it provides public \ngoods, and they are called air traffic control, aircraft certification, \nand safety oversight.\n  We, that is the taxpayers of the United States, pay taxes for these \nservices. This is not a private enterprise matter. We need to start \nthinking about this agency very differently. That is not meant to \ndiminish the people who work for the FAA or run the agency. This is \nsimply a challenge for policymakers.\n  I believe it is a challenge that this bill begins to address. The \nAviation Investment Modernization Act provides the FAA with additional \nneeded resources to do a lot of things. First and foremost, we \nauthorize 200 more safety inspectors. I do not know if that is enough; \nit probably is not, but the FAA has always been overlooked. It is like \nthe Veterans' Administration which was overlooked until somebody wrote \na story in the Washington Post that took this Congress and just shook \nit from head to toe.\n  We will never be the same again with respect to veterans, at least I \npray that we will not. I do not believe we will. So the Appropriations \nCommittee has already substantially increased FAA funding for \ninspectors for this fiscal year. And this bill will give the ability to \ndo more in subsequent years because it is a multiyear bill.\n  I want to take a few minutes and outline the safety provisions in the \nbill that I believe will strengthen the FAA's oversight of airlines. It \nmakes sure the FAA's voluntary disclosure reporting process requires \nthat inspectors verify that the airlines actually took the corrective \nactions they stated they would. That is like a teacher correcting a \nmath test. It is one thing to take a math test; it is another thing to \nhave it looked at and graded. You find out whether you passed.\n  It is very sensitive. It would evaluate if the air carrier had \noffered a comprehensive solution before accepting the disclosure and \nconfirms that the corrective action is completed and adequately \naddresses the problem disclosed. That is sensible. That is in the bill. \nThat is in the bill on which we did not have a single vote all last \nweek, except for one procedural one.\n  It implements a process or second-level supervisory review of self-\ndisclosures before they are accepted and closed. Acceptance would not \nrest solely with one inspector. This is an important statement. So you \ndo not get coziness; inspectors change.\n  It revises the FAA's postemployment guidance to require a cooling off \nperiod of 2 years before an FAA inspector is hired at an air carrier he \nor she had previously inspected. While we do that increasingly, I \ncannot think of a more important place to do it than in the FAA safety \ninspections. It implements a process to track field office inspectors \nand alert the local, regional, and headquarters offices to overdue \ninspections. One of the problems is people get way behind on \ninspections, the airlines do. The FAA does a lot of paperwork. All of \nthe problems with an underfunded agency, which we in the Congress and \nadministrations, both Republican and Democrat, have tended to put in a \nsecondary category.\n  The process must incorporate something called ATOS, the Air \nTransportation Oversight System, reviews to determine full compliance \nwith air worthiness directives at a carrier over a 5-year period that \nincorporates physical inspection of the sample of their aircrafts.\n  It establishes an independent review through the Government \nAccountability Office to review and investigate air safety issues \nidentified by its employees. This develops a new review team under the \nsupervision of the Department of Transportation inspector general; that \nis, the DOT IG who conducts periodic reviews of FAA oversight of air \ncarriers.\n  It requires a comprehensive review of the FAA Academy and facility \ntraining efforts to clarify responsibility and oversight of the program \nat the national level and establishes standards to identify the \nacceptable number of developmental controllers at each facility. That \nis not a Shakespearean paragraph, but I hope the Presiding Officer and \nthe ranking member of the Finance Committee understand what I am \nsaying.\n\n  As a recent New York Times article said:\n\n       One of the most critical challenges in aviation safety is \n     improving safety conditions on our nation's runways.\n\n  I am back at them. Over the past year, we have seen a marked increase \nin the number of serious misses on our Nation's increasingly crowded \nrunways. Again, this legislation includes provisions to reduce the \nnumber of runway incursions. It does so in the following manner:\n  First, the bill requires that the FAA develop a plan for reduction of \nrunway incursions through a review of all commercial airports and \nestablishes a process for tracking and investigating both runway \nincursions and operational errors that includes random auditing of the \noversight process. That is not Shakespearean either, but it is \nprecisely accurate, and it is what needs to be done. It directs the FAA \nto create a plan for the deployment of an alert system designed to \nreduce near misses.\n  This alert system must notify both air traffic controllers and flight \ncrews about potential runway incursions. The establishment of this \nsystem is one of the NTSB's highest aviation safety priorities.\n  In addition, the bill requires a number of other safety provisions, \nincluding a provision to reduce the flammability of airplane fuel \ntanks. This was identified as the direct cause of the TWA 800 crash \nwhich occurred over a decade ago. I know the issue is a priority for \nSenator Schumer.\n  Improving the safety of our Nation's aviation system is one of the \nmost paramount objectives of this bill. I believe we have made \nsubstantial progress with respect to this objective. I look forward to \nfurther debate on the safety provisions, as Senators come to the floor. \nI welcome any input that might improve these sections of the bill, but \neven more importantly, that might actually get us to a point where we \ncan vote on a bill.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nRepublican speaker be Senator Vitter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are in a situation where a couple \nhours from now we will have a vote. I am sure people across the country \nwatching this debate might be wondering what is going on, on this \nFederal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill. I would like to \nshed some light on where we are. As I shed some light, I wish to \nrespond to some of the fiction that has taken the guise of debate.\n  On Wednesday of last week, two Senators, one Republican and one \nDemocrat--Senator Hutchison and Senator Durbin, respectively--offered \nan amendment to strike a provision in the substitute amendment then \nbefore the Senate. The substitute then pending was the product of \nextensive staff negotiations and Member discussions between two \ncommittees with jurisdiction over the Federal Aviation Administration \nprogram. The two committees were the Finance Committee, on which I \nserve, and the Commerce Committee, on which I do not serve.\n  People who may not understand how the Senate works or does not may \nwonder what the situation is. I would like to explain there are certain \nelementary things about the Senate that are fundamental. First, nothing \ngets done in the Senate that is not somewhat bipartisan because of the \nbenefit of debate for minorities to hold up legislation until things \nare accommodated--meaning compromise. It is often difficult to get one \ncommittee's Republicans and Democrats together to get agreement to \nbring something to the floor that can get passed. It is difficult to \nget Republicans and Democrats on one committee together, but then we \nhave the added benefit of the Commerce Committee getting together for a \ncompromise, and then working out compromises between the Finance \nCommittee and the Commerce Committee makes it doubly or, in a triple \nmanner, difficult to get things done on the Senate floor. So we have \ntwo committees that reach accommodation bringing a bill to the floor. \nAfter it gets here, then it runs into trouble.\n  The Finance Committee's involvement in this is determining the \naviation excise taxes, and it controls the airport and airway trust \nfund. We have to raise revenue. Without that money, there would not be \nmuch the Federal aviation program could ever accomplish. On the other \nhand, the Commerce Committee develops all the policy and all the \nprograms that involve airports and aviation. So that is how you get two \ncommittees working together to get a bill to the floor. The Finance \nCommittee works out its differences between Republicans and Democrats \non financing. The Commerce Committee works out its differences between \nDemocrats and Republicans on the policy of airports and aviation. Then \nyou have to get these two committees together to move things to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Last year, the Commerce Committee acted first. The Finance Committee \nacted a few weeks later. The Finance Committee, as part of its \ncompromises, addressed airline pensions. We have heard many arguments \npro and con about the merits of the Finance Committee provision. I \naddressed the merits myself at length last week so I will not repeat \nthem now. But in a few moments I wish to respond to some of the points \nmade by opponents of the Finance Committee provision.\n  As I said earlier, the substitute that was before the Senate until \nlast Thursday was a product of a compromise between the Finance \nCommittee and the Commerce Committee. Under that compromise, the \nFederal Aviation Subcommittee chairman and ranking Republican were \nmanaging the bill. They were, however, at a minimum, under the \nobligation to consult with the Finance Committee chairman who is \nSenator Baucus of Montana and the ranking member who happens to be this \nSenator with respect to Finance Committee matters in that substitute. \nThat compromise and understanding was violated when the Democratic \nfloor manager unilaterally modified the substitute. Under the rules of \nthe Senate, he had that right. The modification was directly adverse to \nthe interests of the Finance Committee members' compromise among \nthemselves. So the managers breached that compromise, plain and simple. \nThat compromise was breached.\n  What matters worse is the Democratic leader backstopped the \nDemocratic floor manager's violation of the Commerce-Finance Committee \ncompromise by filling the amendment tree. Basically, for those \nwatching, that means nothing is going to be brought to the Senate floor \nas an amendment without the unanimous consent of somebody who has that \nresponsibility on the other side of the aisle. So with tremendous power \nin one person, what we call the amendment tree is filled.\n  Now, we all know the proponent of the amendment, the Democratic whip, \nhas a lot of power. That power was displayed when the offending narrow \npension provision I have already referred to--the pension provision the \nFinance Committee was trying to correct--was airdropped into a \nconference report on Iraq spending last year. There were no hearings. \nThere was no markup. There was no committee process. There was no \ntransparency, just airdropped in a war supplemental conference \ncommittee report, something that everybody knew was going to pass and \nbe signed by the President. So airdropped, wam, bam, here it is, take \nit or leave it, special interest provisions cooked up in the offices of \nleaders of the Democratic caucus. It is not the way we ought to \nlegislate.\n  We have been told that by people on the other side of the aisle many \ntimes. I wish to make reference to at least one of those times. I seem \nto recall a lot of outrage when these kinds of narrow provisions were \nairdropped into a conference report when we Republicans were in the \nmajority. No one was louder than the proponent of the amendment that \nwas last week on the Senate floor than the Democratic whip. If we had a \nC-SPAN checker, you could roll the tape back a few years. But I will \nhave to settle because I am not going to roll C-SPAN back to \ndemonstrate the inconsistency of what is going on here, for a New York \nTimes article I wish to refer to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 11, 1997]\n\n           Senate Repeals Tax Break for the Tobacco Industry\n\n                          (By Lizette Alvarez)\n\n       In another resounding setback for the tobacco industry, the \n     Senate voted overwhelmingly today to repeal a $50 billion tax \n     break for the industry that was slipped into the tax cut \n     legislation just before it was passed in July.\n       The repeal amendment, sponsored by Senators Susan Collins, \n     Republican of Maine, and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of \n     Illinois, passed by a vote of 95 to 3. It would delete a one-\n     sentence provision in the tax package that permitted tobacco \n     producers to subtract $50 billion from the amount they would \n     pay under a proposed legal settlement with a group of state \n     attorneys general.\n       Senator Durbin hailed the vote as a sign that the tobacco \n     industry's sway was waning on Capitol Hill.\n       ``The overwhelming vote sends a clear message, first to the \n     tobacco companies: Don't try this type of backroom deal and \n     deception in the future,'' Mr. Durbin said. ``It is really an \n     example of the old school of politics, the old style of \n     politics.''\n       As the Senate was dealing a blow to cigarette makers, top \n     White House officials were engaged in a debate over how to \n     approach the proposed nationwide tobacco accord. Some of \n     President Clinton's closest advisers were pushing him to \n     issue a strong endorsement of the $368.5 billion tobacco \n     proposal, while others--including Vice President Al Gore and \n     top officials of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services--were urging a more moderate approach in which the \n     President would spell out his goals without embracing a \n     specific legislative plan for achieving them.\n       Tension within the Administration over the agreement is not \n     likely to be resolved until next week, when Mr. Clinton is \n     expected to decide whether to back the proposed tobacco \n     agreement, which has powerful critics among public health \n     experts and Democrats in Congress.\n       Today's vote on the $50 billion tax provision indicates \n     that whichever course the President adopts, a sweeping \n     settlement with the tobacco industry will not be enacted \n     until it faces months of scrutiny in Congress.\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\n       Public health advocates began a last-ditch round of \n     lobbying to persuade Mr. Clinton to reject the settlement, \n     which was negotiated by state attorneys general, plaintiffs' \n     lawyers and tobacco industry representatives.\n       Dr. David A. Kessler, former Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs, met with top White House aides and members of Congress \n     today to urge them to reject the proposed settlement in favor \n     of a $1.50-a-pack tax on cigarettes.\n       Dr. Kessler maintained that substantial price increases \n     were the only proven means of reducing smoking by teen-agers. \n     He was preparing to testify before a Senate committee on \n     Thursday that the proposed settlement amounted to a bailout \n     of the tobacco industry and would not significantly reduce \n     minors' use of tobacco.\n       The tax provision repealed today in the Senate would have \n     effectively allowed tobacco companies to save $50 billion on \n     the proposed settlement by claiming a dollar-for-dollar \n     credit on a 15-cent cigarette tax increase. The tax was \n     approved in July by Congress to underwrite health care for \n     children.\n       Although the Collins-Durbin amendment won near unanimous \n     support in the Senate today, its survival depends on two \n     things: passage of the massive appropriations bill, to which \n     the amendment is attached, and the House's agreement to go \n     along with the provision.\n       But the support that the amendment received today, even \n     among senators from many tobacco-growing states, is likely to \n     force the issue in the House, Senator Durbin said.\n       Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester, has \n     offered a companion bill in the House. ``We're going to make \n     sure we prevail in one form or another form,'' she said.\n       Today's vote is also a sign of the escalating frustration \n     and impatience with the tobacco industry's tactics at a time \n     when the industry is working to rehabilitate its image, \n     lawmakers said today. The provision was inserted in the tax \n     bill at the last minute, members said, to stave off \n     discussion and debate.\n       The three Senators who voted against the amendment were \n     Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lauch Faircloth and Jesse \n     Helms of North Carolina, all Republicans. Both Kentucky and \n     North Carolina are large tobacco-producing states.\n       No one has yet stepped forward to claim authorship of the \n     tax provision that was repealed today.\n       Senator Durbin, who characterized the tax provision as an \n     ``orphan,'' added that ``people said it appeared \n     mysteriously.'' and was still expressing astonishment over \n     how it materialized at the last minute.\n       The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi; \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia; the White House chief of \n     staff, Erskine B. Bowles, and the chief White House lobbyist, \n     John Hilley, all approved its insertion in the tax cut bill. \n     They were the last ones at the table in the final \n     negotiations over the balanced budget and tax-cutting \n     agreement.\n       Today, Senator Lott voted to repeal the credit.\n       Mr. Lott's press secretary, Susan Irby, said there was \n     never a secret conspiracy to keep the $50 billion credit \n     under wraps, noting that it was present in the tax cut bill \n     the weekend before it was voted on. ``This garbage about \n     something being slipped in and it being a one-sided agreement \n     is poppycock,'' Ms. Irby said.\n       For the tobacco industry, today's vote was one of several \n     recent setbacks. Last week the Senate reversed an earlier \n     decision and agreed to earmark $34 million to pay for a \n     crackdown on illegal sales of cigarettes to underage youths.\n       The pressure was also stepped up on Tuesday by Senators Tom \n     Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Connie Mack, Republican of \n     Florida. The two announced that they planned to introduce \n     legislation to prevent tobacco companies from writing off \n     one-third of the billions they would have to pay under the \n     settlement.\n       The bill would funnel the money to the National Institutes \n     of Health to help pay for research on cancer, emphysema and \n     other diseases linked to smoking.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is dated September 11, 1997. That article deals with \na very successful effort on the part of the present Senate Democratic \nwhip to remove any extraneous matter that had been airdropped into a \nconference report on a popular tax relief bill by the then-Republican \nmajority of the Senate. The offensive measure was a tax credit for \npayments made by tobacco companies in the tobacco court settlement. The \nDemocratic whip successfully repealed that airdropped provision. I \nhappened to think he did the right thing then because I supported his \nefforts. The Democratic whip noted his victory by saying, quoting from \nthe New York Times article of September 11, 1997:\n\n       Don't try this type of backroom deal and deception in the \n     future. It is really an example of the old school of \n     politics, the old style of politics.\n\n  That is a quote from the very same person who is involved in this \neffort we are speaking about now and that we will be voting on this \nafternoon.\n  The distrust of the public for the old school of politics, the old \nstyle of politics, is something the junior Senator--not the senior \nSenator but the junior Senator from Illinois has eloquently raised on \nthe Presidential campaign trail.\n  To be bipartisan, I might say, the senior Senator from Arizona, also \na candidate for the Presidency, has also touched a nerve about the old \nschool of politics and the old style of politics as well.\n  The Democratic whip was right 12 years ago. I agreed with him 12 \nyears ago. I voted with him 12 years ago. Unfortunately, with respect \nto this airdrop pension provision, the old school of politics, the old \nstyle of politics was applied.\n  Now, what do I mean? In this case, old school, old style power \npolitics was at play. A powerful member of the Democratic leadership, a \nkey member of the Appropriations Committee, did an end run around the \nFinance Committee and also the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee.\n  Forget about the nearly yearlong conference negotiations that went on \nto get a pension bill passed in 2006 as well. It was bipartisan and \ninvolved the work of two committees, which I have spoken to--that it is \noften difficult to get one committee together without getting two \ncommittees going in the same direction. Forget about the nearly \nyearlong conference negotiations on that pension bill. Forget about all \nthe hearings the House and Senate tax-writing and labor committees held \non pension reform in the year 2006. Forget about the delicate \ncompromise worked out on the way the funding rules affected airlines.\n  All of a sudden none of that mattered. The Democratic whip noted his \nvictory. None of that mattered. So, consequently, here we are: a person \nwho 11 years ago found fault with the majority party airdropping \nsomething--in other words, stuffing something--in conference without \ndebate, without hearings, without committee markup, doing the same \nthing 10 years later.\n  What he was able to successfully correct in 1997, we are trying to \ncorrect now. We have obstacles put in the way: things such as having a \nvery unusual compromise worked out, junked by the managers of the bill, \nand backed up by an amendment tree being filled so nobody can get a \nvote on issues that ought to be voted upon. Compromises that were \nworked out in 2006 ought to be maintained and backed up, as they \noverwhelmingly passed at that particular time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the FAA \nreauthorization bill and a crucial issue that affects not only the \nentire airline industry--and is, therefore, at the center of this \neffort--but also it dramatically affects every Louisiana family, every \nAmerican family struggling to pay its bills; that is, sky-high energy \nprices, including dramatically increasing prices at the pump.\n  I was very much looking forward to bringing up this issue with others \nand bringing up Vitter amendment No. 4648 to the FAA reauthorization \nbill to try to move forward in solving this issue. It is really a \nshame, in my opinion--and I think I am joined by many others in that \nconclusion--that the majority leader has filled up the amendment tree \nand shut down all amendments to this important bill.\n  This is an important matter: FAA reauthorization, the health of the \nairline industry and aviation. This is an important issue: sky-high \nenergy prices. Of course it affects the aviation industry, but it \naffects all of Americans' pocketbooks as well.\n  In that context, I think it is particularly a shame the majority \nleader would shut down all amendments and shut down this important and \nhealthy debate. But even though my amendment, and so many others \ngermane to this topic, will not be able to be heard and voted upon, I \ndid want to take the floor to outline those amendment ideas and to try \nto further the important discussion and debate.\n  When we think about energy prices, how to stabilize them, how to \nlower\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nthem, I start with economics 101. I start with the very first rule of \neconomics I ever learned, the very basic rule that all of us think of \nin economics; that is, the law of supply and demand. So as with the \nprice of any other commodity, if you are talking about energy, a good \nway to try to stabilize prices and bring them down over time is to work \non two things: decreasing demand and increasing supply.\n  Again, economics 101 would tell you if you can do that--if you can \nshift both of those curves, shifting the demand curve by decreasing \ndemand, shifting the supply curve in the opposite direction by \nincreasing supply--you not only stabilize but you bring down prices.\n  It seems to me we should all be coming together in a bipartisan \nspirit to do both. I am eager to do both. I support proposals to do \nboth.\n  There are at least three fundamental ways to help decrease demand on \noil and gas specifically; that is, to conserve, to increase efficiency, \nand to move toward alternative fuels. Our energy picture is so dire, so \nchallenging, we cannot pick one of the three. We need to do all three \naggressively, just as we also need to work aggressively on the supply \nside.\n  So I support and will continue to aggressively support measures that \nmake sense in terms of conservation, in terms of increasing efficiency, \nand in terms of promoting, moving toward alternative fuels. Those all \nlessen the demand on oil and gas.\n  But too often we get in this stale debate in the Congress, this stale \ndeadlock, where one side of the political fence only wants to attack \none side of the problem, and the other side of the political fence only \nwants to attack the other side of the problem, when our energy picture \nis so dire we clearly need to do both. So as we attack that demand \nside, let's not ignore the supply side either. As we move to a new \nalternative energy future, let's not ignore the fact that we will be \ndealing with oil and gas and depending on it significantly for many \nyears to come. So let's turn to the supply side too, to increase our \nsupply as we try to decrease demand to stabilize and bring down prices.\n  My amendment, Vitter amendment No. 4648, would do just that. I will \noutline that in a minute.\n  Before I do, though, let me express regret that so many of the \nsuggestions, so much of the push, at least rhetorically in political \ndebate and campaigning on the Democratic side, seems to ignore all \nthese lessons, seems to not think or care about demand, not think or \ncare about supply, not think or care about the issue and doing \nsomething about it. It just seems to be designed to go after the \neasiest and biggest political target in sight, which is the big oil \ncompanies, specifically by proposing dramatic tax increases on big oil.\n  Now, if some dramatic tax increase on big oil would move us down the \npath of solving our energy challenge, I would look at it very \nseriously. The fundamental problem I have with it is that it does not \nsolve anything and, in fact, it almost certainly makes the problem \nworse.\n  There are two versions of this same political push to just attack the \neasiest and the biggest political target in sight. First of all, there \nis a proposal that we have actually voted on several times, and we have \nblocked several times, that would do away with certain incentives for \noil companies to go into deep water, explore, and produce more energy. \nIt would also do away with certain royalty relief designed to do the \nsame thing.\n\n  Now, make no mistake about it, these tax incentives are in place to \npush companies--small, medium, and large--to go into deeper water, more \ndifficult terrain, and extract more energy from the ocean bed to supply \nus with more energy. It seems beyond debate, in my opinion, that doing \naway with those incentives and that royalty relief will heighten the \nbar, will make it more difficult for any company--small, medium, or \nlarge--to do just that. So as we are trying to increase supply, this \nwould do just the opposite and decrease supply.\n  Maybe it makes some people feel good because we are whipping up on \nsome oil companies. Maybe it earns votes and earns favor with voters, \nparticularly in an important primary election season. But I think \naround here we should perhaps ask the question: Does it do anything to \nsolve our energy picture? And the answer is no. The answer is also no \nbecause there is nothing to prevent companies from passing on that tax \nincrease to consumers. So just while we are trying to give consumers \nsome relief at the pump, we would almost certainly be passing a tax \nincrease that would be passed on to them in part or in whole and up the \nprices at the pump.\n  Now, the other popular version of this same political attack is a \nvery old idea, dusted off, and apparently given new life this election \nseason; that is, the windfall profits tax. Oil companies make way too \nmuch money. They have exorbitant, outrageous profits, so the argument \ngoes, so we are going to attack, we are going to tax that windfall \nprofits.\n  Just as an example, the leading Democratic candidate for President, \nour colleague, Senator Barack Obama, has such a proposal to tax the \nprofits made based on a price of oil over $80 a barrel. So we figure \nwhat that is on the part of any oil producer. That affects a lot of \ncompanies, not just big oil but medium and smaller producers, and for \nany profit associated with the price of oil over $80 a barrel, we are \ngoing to stick a big tax on that and bring that into the Federal \nTreasury.\n  Well, again, the fundamental problem with that, in my mind, is it \ndoes nothing to solve our energy problem and almost certainly makes \nthat energy problem worse. It does nothing to increase supply. It \nalmost certainly does something to decrease supply by making it less \nproductive, less profitable for energy companies to go after more \nsupply.\n  There are other problems as well. The first problem is the misnomer, \nwindfall profits tax. The reported profits of the major oil companies \nare enormous for a very simple and basic reason: the size of the \ncompanies and the size of their activity is enormous. But, of course, \nas any economist would tell you, if you want to analyze a level of \nprofit, you need to define it as a percentage of sales, as a percentage \nof assets--some percentage number like that--not a gross number which, \nof course, is going to be very large if you are dealing with an entity \nor a set of activities that is very large.\n  The fact is, when you look at that issue, when you look at oil and \ngas companies' profits as a percentage, it is very much in line with \nAmerican business. The last figures we have are for the full calendar \nyear 2007. In that calendar year 2007, oil and gas companies' profits \nwere 8.3 percent.\n  Now, how does that compare? Well, for all of the U.S. manufacturing \nsector--a sector we always decry as in decline and being outsourced and \nin decline historically--that profit was 7.3 percent for 2007. If you \ntake out U.S. auto companies--which are hurting, which have a much \nlower figure--then U.S. manufacturing was 8.9 percent. So, in fact, oil \nand gas companies are almost exactly in between all U.S. manufacturing, \nand all U.S. manufacturing except auto. It is reasonable to take out \nauto because they are in such dire circumstances. So they are not \nwindfall profits at all.\n  Another important question to ask is, where these profits--whether \nthey are normal or anything else--go because if we are going to stick a \nbig tax on them, perhaps we should ask whom we are really taxing.\n  There is some notion out there, fueled by these political attacks and \nthis pandering in an election year, that, well, of course, the only \nfolks we are affecting are the executives at the big oil companies. \nBut, of course, the facts are fundamentally different.\n  As this chart shows, profits of energy companies, oil and gas, go to \na wide array of Americans, which today, thanks to the growth and \nvibrancy of our stock market and our investment opportunities, affects \nalmost every single American. Yes, of course, corporate management owns \nsome of their companies--about 2 percent. Most of the rest is owned by \na wide array of Americans through IRAs, through other institutional \ninvestors, through mutual funds, and, perhaps most significantly, \nthrough pension funds--27 percent. That means about 129 million pension \nfund participants own these companies and would be taxed and attacked \nby these proposals. Those accounts are worth an average of $63,000. \nTwenty-\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\neight million of those pension fund accounts are for public employees--\nthat includes teachers and police and fire personnel, soldiers, \ngovernment workers--and each of those accounts represents a public \nservant who owns part of that energy industry. A good example is the \nNew York State Teachers' Retirement System. They report that 6.6 \npercent of their domestic equity holdings were in energy companies in \n2004, the last year for which we could get figures. That includes $1.5 \nbillion in Exxon and $500 million in Chevron. That is in large part 27 \npercent who own these big, bad companies that some would attack and try \nto tax into oblivion--average Americans all across America through \npension funds, through mutual funds, through IRAs, through other \ninstitutionalized investment.\n  Now, again, let me return to the basic point. If we want to try to \nreally solve our energy picture, stabilize and bring down the price, \nincluding the price at the pump, maybe we should focus on that \neconomics 101 lesson. Maybe we should decrease demand with a more \nsensible policy to conserve, to increase efficiency, to move to \nalternative fuels, and at the same time maybe we should increase \nsupply. That is what my amendment, the Vitter amendment No. 4648, is \nall about--to attack that very important supply side. We need to do \nboth. We need to do all of these things at the same time, but we cannot \nexclude one side of the equation or the other.\n  The Vitter amendment to this FAA bill would pose a very simple \nsolution to attack the supply side and increase supply domestically in \na far more aggressive fashion. The amendment would establish a trigger \nin the law pegged at a certain level of the price of oil per barrel. \nThat level would represent a 190-percent increase in the price per \nbarrel since 2006. That comes out to just short of $126 per barrel. \nNow, unfortunately, of course, the price has been rising dramatically \nfor many months, and we are not too shy of that right now. We are \nroughly at $120 per barrel. But at this trigger, under the Vitter \namendment, if we reach and pass the trigger--about $126--then certain \naspects of our Federal law would change.\n  Specifically, we would allow exploration and production in Federal \nwaters, the Outer Continental Shelf off any State that wants to get \ninto that activity. I want to emphasize that last phrase because it is \nvery important. We would allow that activity in the Outer Continental \nShelf but only if the host State--the State off whose shores the \nactivity would happen--wants that activity to happen. Then and only \nthen, if the Governor, with the concurrence of the State legislature, \nsays, yes, we want to allow this activity, we would allow energy \nproduction in those waters.\n  We would also demand something else that is very important in terms \nof fairness and equity and good Federal policy. We would expand upon \nthe revenue-sharing precedent we set about a year and a half ago when \nwe opened new waters in the eastern gulf. That was a very important \nprecedent, a very good energy policy, in my opinion, upon which we \nshould build and expand.\n  So under this Vitter amendment, if the trigger is pulled, if States \nsay, yes, we want to allow this oil and gas activity, we would allow \nthat to happen. But the host State would recoup a very significant \npercentage of the revenue to stay in that State's coffers; \nspecifically, 37.5 percent. That is precisely the figure we passed into \nlaw for new areas of the gulf that are being developed now because of \nthe action we took about a year and a half ago.\n  In addition to that 37.5 percent, we would also have revenue sharing \nfor the Federal fund for conservation--12.5 percent. That is an \nimportant part of the revenue-sharing precedent we set a year and a \nhalf ago as well.\n  Finally, the Vitter amendment would allow host States to distinguish, \nif they would like, between exploration production activity for natural \ngas and exploration production activity for oil. Some States, \nparticularly on the eastern seaboard, would probably act immediately to \nallow that activity for natural gas. But there is still concern about \nenvironmental issues with regard to oil. While I might disagree with \nthem, while I might disagree with those concerns because I believe we \nhave the technology in place to do all of that in a very careful, \nsensitive, and responsible way, we should leave that up to the States \nso those host States can, in fact, make the choice and they can choose \nnatural gas or they can choose oil or they can choose both under the \nVitter amendment.\n\n  Now, unlike these other proposals--mostly tax proposals that have \nnothing but political motivation behind them and that do nothing at all \nto change the supply picture for the better, to change the demand \npicture, and to actually stabilize and bring down energy prices--this \nproposal would do something to improve that situation.\n  Resource estimates in those areas of the Outer Continental Shelf that \nare now off limits, that the Vitter amendment could open up if the host \nState wants that activity to happen, those resource estimates are \nstaggering: the Atlantic OCS, 3.82 billion barrels of oil and 36.99 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas; the central and eastern Gulf of \nMexico which is now off limits, 3.65 billion barrels of oil and 21.46 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas. That is not counting what we have \nrecently put on the table. The Pacific Outer Continental Shelf, 10.37 \nbillion barrels of oil and 18.02 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. \nThat is enormous total resources of almost 18 billion barrels of oil \nand 76.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. That is enough oil to \npower 40 million cars and to heat 2 million households for 15 years. It \nis enough natural gas to heat 16 million households for almost 20 \nyears. Now, that would actually do something about our energy picture. \nThat would actually expand supply and therefore help stabilize and \nbring down price.\n  Is it the only thing we need to do? Absolutely not. As I said at the \nvery beginning, our energy challenge is so great that we need to break \nout of this stale debate where one side of the political fence wants to \ndo one set of things only--basically, to decrease demand--and the other \nside of the political fence wants to focus on one set of policies \nonly--to increase supply. The simple fact is we need to do all of the \nabove. We need to start immediately. We need to do it aggressively \nbecause it is only doing all of these things at once that will \nadequately address our energy challenges, that has a chance to \nstabilize and bring down prices, including the prices that rocked the \nairline industry and are a huge factor in aviation--we are talking \nabout the FAA bill here on the floor now--and, of course, including the \nprices all Louisianans and all Americans pay at the pump.\n  For once, let's come together as a Senate and do all of those things. \nLet's really think about what can actually have an impact on price. \nLet's move beyond the politics of the moment, which is always to beat \nup on an easy and big political target such as the oil companies, and \nlet's ask the question: Does that have any impact for the consumer? \nDoes that have any impact in terms of our energy future? Let's do the \nsorts of things, such as the Vitter amendment, that can actually help \nthe consumer and increase our energy independence.\n  Again, it is with great regret that I realize I am not able to \nactually call up this amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill right \nnow. This is a vitally important topic. Whatever you think about it, \nwhatever proposal you put out, certainly we can all agree that energy \nprices are enormously important for all Americans, for the country, and \ncertainly we can all agree that it is an enormously important issue \nthat goes to aviation as well as other sectors of our economy.\n  In that light, I think it is particularly regrettable that Senator \nReid, the majority leader, has filled the amendment tree and therefore \nshut down the entire amendment process before it even began on a major \nbill on the Senate floor. The Senate floor is supposed to be renowned \nfor an open amendment process. Yet we have amendments about the key \nissue facing Americans today--energy prices--and we can't offer a \nsingle one. There is something wrong here. There is something out of \nkilter. That is not the Senate I was told about with an open amendment \nprocess, open debate, with great, virtually unlimited opportunity. That \nis not what the American people expect of Congress--to actually debate\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\nand act on real issues that they care about, and certainly that \nincludes energy prices. So it is regrettable that we don't have a fair \nopportunity on the FAA bill to do just that. I hope we will have those \nopportunities very soon.\n  I understand there may be an energy bill that is moved to the floor \nsoon on the Senate side, perhaps as early as next week. I hope that \nwill yield an open, fair opportunity for the sort of open debate and \nopen amendment process that is supposed to be the hallmark of the \nSenate. If we are given that open, fair opportunity then, as it is \nbeing denied now, I will certainly bring this proposal forward again \nbecause, unlike a lot of the rhetoric flying around, unlike the tax \nincrease proposals which I believe will increase the price at the pump \nand decrease supply, I believe these proposals I have presented could \ndo just the opposite. They could be an important step forward in \naddressing our energy future and the more immediate need to stabilize \nand bring down energy prices for all Americans.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Eliminating Barriers to Cancer Research\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, yesterday, at the James Cancer Hospital at \nOhio State University in Columbus, OH, our State capital, I announced \nlegislation to eliminate needless barriers to cancer research.\n  I was joined by Dr. William Carson, by Dr. James Thomas, by patients, \nand by nurses, who do the research and the clinical care for patients \nduring these clinical trials. Many have worked on this issue with \nCongresswoman Deborah Pryce, a Congressional Republican.\n  Merle Farnsworth, a lymphoma patient from Beverly, OH, shared an \nemotional story about cancer clinical trials meaning hope--and possibly \na lifesaving cure--for him and millions of patients like him.\n  The goal of both the House and Senate versions of this legislation is \nsimple: to finally identify cures for this merciless killer.\n  So many of us have been touched by cancer. We all know--all of us, I \nguess, in this room right now--someone with cancer and have lost \nsomeone to cancer or we know someone living with cancer.\n  Focusing on cancer yesterday at James Cancer Hospital reminded me of \nwhat is at stake when we are fighting for broader access to health \ncare. We are fighting to promote and enable early detection of \nchildhood cancers, such as Hodgkin's Disease, leukemia, and bone \ncancer, and to ensure that every woman can receive mammograms and pap \ntests.\n  We are fighting to diagnose cancers as soon as possible, which is the \nkey to saving lives. We recognize everyone should be able to get these \npreventive measures, regardless of where they live or how much they \nearn.\n  We recognize a woman with breast cancer without insurance is 40 \npercent more likely to die than a woman with breast cancer with \ninsurance.\n  We need a health care system that is affordable and inclusive, where \ninsurance companies follow through on providing coverage to those who \nneed it.\n  No American should be driven into bankruptcy by a catastrophic \nillness such as cancer. And no one should be denied access to clinical \ntrials because insurance companies all too often try to drop them from \ncoverage.\n  Last year, Sheryl Freeman, a retired schoolteacher, and her husband \nCraig from Dayton visited my office in Washington. Sheryl had multiple \nmyeloma. Sheryl and Craig brought to my attention the problems they \nwere having with their insurance company.\n  Sheryl was a retired schoolteacher and was covered under Craig's \ninsurance plan. Craig has been a Federal employee for 20 years. When \nSheryl enrolled in a clinical trial to save her life, her insurance \ncompany would not cover the routine costs of her care. If she had not \nenrolled in the clinical trial, they would have covered the costs of \nher care.\n  She enrolled in the clinical trial. The insurance company, for all \nintents and purposes, dropped her from providing routine care for her.\n  In addition to her clinical trial in Columbus, Sheryl needed to visit \nher oncologist in Dayton, about 1 hour 45 minutes away, at least once a \nweek for standard cancer monitoring, which included blood tests and \nscans. But her insurance company would not cover these services if she \nenrolled in a clinical trial.\n  Sheryl wanted to take part in a clinical trial because she hoped it \nwould help her, that it might save her life, give her more time, and \nfurther cancer research. But rather than devoting her energy toward \ncombating cancer and participating in a clinical trial, Sheryl spent \nthe last months of her life haggling with her insurance company. The \ndelays and the denials from her insurance company probably affected her \ntreatment and her survival. Sheryl died on December 9, 2007.\n  The story could have ended differently. Sheryl and Craig should not \nhave had to sacrifice their precious time together trying to get the \ncare she deserved, the care she paid for when she signed up for health \ninsurance. People invest in insurance when they are healthy so they \nhave financial protection when they are sick. It is meant to cover the \ncosts of unanticipated health care needs.\n  Whether a coverage exclusion such as this one, which denies payment \nfor unanticipated health care needs, is written into an insurance \ncontract, it is still a scam.\n  Unfortunately, Sheryl and Craig are not alone. This is happening \nacross Ohio. It is happening in the Presiding Officer's State of New \nJersey, and it is happening in all 50 States. Some 20 percent of cancer \npatients who attempt to enroll in a clinical trial face the same \nproblem with their insurance companies.\n  It is because of stories such as these I am introducing the Access to \nCancer Clinical Trials Act this week. Similar legislation is on its way \nto getting passed in the Ohio State Legislature. The Governor plans to \nsign that bill immediately.\n  My bill and Congresswoman Pryce's bill in the House ensures this \nprotection nationally. The bill simply obligates health plans to pay \nfor routine care costs when a cancer patient enrolls in a clinical \ntrial, something, frankly, we should not have to tell the insurance \ncompanies to do. But when they drop coverage for people who signed up \nfor a clinical trial, it is what we have to do.\n  These are costs, as I said, that would normally be covered if a \ncancer patient were not participating in a clinical trial.\n  The legislation is specific in its definition of routine care costs \nand follows the Medicare definition.\n  The bill will ensure that cancer patients and their caregivers can \nuse their valuable time together to fight the disease instead of the \nredtape of insurance companies.\n  In order to fight cancer and make progress, we need to further \nscientific advancement, not create barriers for patients who want to \nparticipate in lifesaving research.\n  I am grateful to Merle Farnsworth for yesterday so courageously and \npassionately sharing his story with us and the public. I am grateful to \nthe nurses who do their clinical care and practice their research for \nthese patients in these clinical trials. I am grateful to Sheryl and \nCraig for their courage in sharing their story. Their two children \njoined us yesterday in bringing this issue to my attention.\n  Sheryl was already very sick when she visited Washington, DC, and I \nimagine it was not easy for her to be traveling, but she did. She saw \nhow important this issue was. I will keep the Freemans in mind as I \nadvocate to get this bill passed. I will work hard on this legislation \nso no one has to go through the kind of experience the Freemans had and \nthe kind of experience Mr. Farnsworth had.\n  Instead of fighting their cancer, too many Americans are forced to \nfight their insurance company in the late\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\nstages of their disease. That has to stop. That is why this legislation \nis so very important.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Supplemental Funding\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I came to the Senate floor \nto express my concern that Congress had yet to act on the President's \nfiscal year 2008 request for supplemental funding to support our troops \nand our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. At that time, I also expressed \nmy displeasure with the majority's intention to bypass the \nAppropriations Committee in writing the supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  Two weeks later, little appears to have changed. Little has changed, \nexcept that we are 2 weeks deeper into the fiscal year, and we are 2 \nweeks closer to the date when accounts that support our Armed Forces \nand our diplomatic corps begin to run dry.\n  The majority leader is apparently sanguine about the status of the \nsupplemental because last Thursday, he said:\n\n       I think we'll do our best to finish this before the \n     Memorial Day break, but if we don't, it's no big deal. \n     There's money there.\n\n  The leader then went on to say:\n\n       I don't know why there is a rush to judgment. This is \n     moving along quite rapidly. We're not behind schedule. \n     Everything's fine.\n\n  Exactly what is ``moving along quite rapidly''? No markup of the \nsupplemental has been officially scheduled in either the House or the \nSenate. There are continued reports of imminent action in the other \nbody, but no bill has been introduced. No bill or report has been \ncirculated to Senate committee members in anticipation of a markup. \nThere is nothing for Members to look at, nothing for Members to \nconsider or to draft amendments to.\n  A week ago, Republican members of the Appropriations Committee in the \nSenate wrote to Chairman Byrd to express our concern about the \ncommittee being bypassed entirely. I am pleased that the chairman \nconcurred in the sentiments expressed in that letter and has stated his \nintention to hold a committee markup this week. I am certain that has \nbeen his preference all along.\n  In my memory, I cannot think of any instance where the committee did \nnot mark up a supplemental such as this. I think the chairman has been \nfighting valiantly to maintain some semblance of regular order, but it \nis apparent he is meeting resistance from the joint leadership.\n  That is a shame. We should take advantage of the collective expertise \nand experience of the members of the Appropriations Committee and bring \nthat knowledge to bear on the supplemental.\n  I am sorry to say it remains uncertain whether a markup will take \nplace, and if a markup does occur, it remains uncertain whether the \ncommittee's work product will be considered by the full Senate.\n  In the House, it appears the committee will be bypassed altogether. \nYet even with that step being skipped, there is still no definite \nschedule for House floor action. There apparently have been discussions \nby House and Senate staff in an effort to sort of ``precook'' \nagreements on the various chapters of the bill, but there has been \nlittle substantive involvement by the minority in those discussions. \nVery few Members have been involved at all, to my knowledge.\n  The fact is the Appropriations Committee could have marked up the \nsupplemental several weeks ago, and the Senate likely could have passed \nthe bill by now. We should be in conference with the House already and \nbe well on our way to negotiating a conference report to be sent to the \nPresident. But instead, we wait. We wait for more closed-door meetings \nbetween and among the Democratic leaders. We wait for more rumors about \nwhat extraneous legislative matter is or is not part of the draft being \ncompiled by the majority. And all but a handful of Members wait for an \nopportunity to shape the bill.\n  I am a member of the Committee on Agriculture and was appointed as a \nconferee on the farm bill. That conference has met at least seven times \nin recent weeks. There have been countless additional meetings among \ncommittee principals. It has been a grueling effort, it has been messy, \nand it remains uncertain whether the President will ultimately sign the \nconference report once it is presented to him. But we can be fairly \nconfident that the conference report will at least reflect the \ncollective will of Congress and it will be the process of a reasonably \ntransparent process.\n\n  At this point, I cannot say that about the supplemental. Eventually, \nwe will approve and the President will sign a supplemental bill. I am \nconfident that ultimately we will not allow our Armed Forces and our \ndiplomatic corps to go wanting for resources. My concern is that the \nmajority's approach to the supplemental places political tactics and \nstrategy ahead of the need for inclusive, timely, and transparent \naction.\n  Contrary to the majority leader's assertion, it is a big deal if we \ndo not get this bill done by Memorial Day. It is a big deal, not \nbecause the U.S. Army will run out of ammunition on June 1 but because \nour inaction will represent an unnecessary and completely avoidable \nprocess failure on the part of the Congress. It will say to our Armed \nForces that we are willing to draw out this process as long as \npossible, even though we know the likely outcome. We are willing to \nforce the Department of Defense to issue advance furlough notices, \ndelay contract awards, and make inefficient funding transfers in order \nto keep the money flowing--all because congressional leaders spent \nthese last several weeks devising artful parliamentary schemes rather \nthan simply advancing the bill through the committees, onto the House \nfloor, onto the Senate floor, and into conference.\n  The April 28 edition of Roll Call included an article by Don \nWolfensberger titled ``Have House-Senate Conferences Gone the Way of \nthe Dodo?'' I commend that article to my colleagues and ask unanimous \nconsent to have a copy printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. Wolfensberger reminds us of the promises made by the \nSenate leadership in 2006 as part of their ``honest leadership and open \nGovernment'' reform plank. Conference meetings were to be open to the \npublic, and members of the conference committee were to have a public \nopportunity to vote on all amendments. Copies of conference reports \nwere to be available to Members and posted publicly on the Internet 24 \nhours before consideration. Bills were to be developed following full \nhearings and open subcommittee and committee markups and were to come \nto the floor under procedures that allow open, full, and fair debate.\n  These practices have been followed in some cases. I mentioned the \nfarm bill already as an example of a conference committee in action. \nBut procedures governing the conference process and the markup process \nare only relevant if there actually is a conference committee or there \nactually is a committee markup.\n  As noted in Mr. Wolfensberger's article, the number of instances in \nwhich major legislation has been dealt with outside the conference \nprocess has increased markedly in this Congress. The supplemental \nappears destined to become another example. I gather that we are to \nreceive the bill from the House in the form of three amendments to a \ndormant version of the fiscal year 2008 Military Construction \nappropriations bill. As I have already noted, it is not certain whether \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee will act on some, all, or none of \nthese amendments or whether the leader intends for there to be an \nopportunity for Senators to offer amendments on the floor. A conference \ncommittee appears out of the question.\n  It is not easy to be the Speaker of the House or the majority leader \nof the Senate. Individuals elected to those positions are subjected to \nenormous pressures. They are besieged constantly by colleagues, \nconstituents, and outside interests with an array of often conflicting \ndemands. In an effort to resolve those competing demands, it is\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\ntempting to centralize decisionmaking, construct processes that \nminimize uncertainty, and generally try to eliminate the untidiness of \nthe legislative process.\n  A handful of Members and staff are empowered at the expense of the \nrank and file in both bodies and, by extension, the people whom the \nrank and file represent. On occasion, such tactics are successful. But \nover time, these practices tend to become abusive and often result in a \nmessier, more protracted process than would have been the case if more \ntraditional procedures had been followed.\n  For the sake of our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan, I hope the \nprocess the majority has chosen for the supplemental does not put us \nany further behind than we already are. But in the 2 weeks since I last \ncame to the floor to speak about the supplemental, little has occurred \nto inspire such hope.\n  Our men and women in the field are waiting. We do need to finish this \nbill by the Memorial Day recess. It is a big deal.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Apr. 28, 2008]\n\n        Have House-Senate Conferences Gone the Way of the Dodo?\n\n                         (By Don Wolfensberger)\n\n       In June 2006, House and Senate Democratic leaders rolled \n     out their ``New Direction for America,'' a campaign platform \n     to take back control of Congress. The ``Honest Leadership and \n     Open Government'' reform plank, at Page 22, included the \n     promise to require that ``all [House-Senate] conference \n     committee meetings be open to the public and that members of \n     the conference committee have a public opportunity to vote on \n     all amendments [in disagreement between the two houses].'' \n     Moreover, copies of conference reports would be posted ``on \n     the Internet 24 hours before consideration (unless waived by \n     a supermajority vote).''\n       The minority Democrats' justifiable complaint was that \n     majority Republicans often shut them out of conference \n     committee deliberations after a single, perfunctory public \n     meeting was held to minimally satisfy House rules (aka ``the \n     photo op''). After that meeting, all that is necessary to \n     file a conference report is the signatures of a majority of \n     conferees from each house. No formal meeting or votes on \n     final approval are required; nor does the majority even need \n     to consult the minority before finalizing an agreement.\n       Once they took over Congress in January 2007, House \n     Democrats abandoned their promises of public votes in \n     conference meetings on amendments in disagreement and of 24-\n     hour advance Internet availability of conference reports. \n     Nevertheless, they did adopt some palliative House rules \n     changes on the opening day of the 110th Congress that at \n     least appear to move conference committees in the direction \n     of a more deliberative and participatory public process.\n       The new rules require: (a) that all conferees be given \n     notice of any conference meeting for the resolution of \n     differences between the houses ``and a reasonable opportunity \n     to attend''; (b) that all provisions in disagreement be \n     ``considered as open to discussion at any meeting''; (c) that \n     all conferees be provided ``a unitary time and place with \n     access to at least one complete copy of the final conference \n     agreement for the purpose of recording their approval (or \n     not)'' by affixing their signatures; and (d) that no \n     substantive change in the agreement be made after conferees \n     have signed it.\n       The Parliamentarian's footnotes to the rules for conference \n     reports indicate that the rules are not enforceable if all \n     points of order are waived against the reports, as is \n     routinely done by a special rule from the Rules Committee. \n     Nevertheless, conference committee chairmen (or vice \n     chairmen) could still be punished by the House adopting a \n     question of privilege resolution for willful disregard of \n     these modest requirements. This is because a blanket waiver \n     of the rules only protects the conference report. It is not a \n     retroactive pardon for malfeasance in the management of the \n     conference.\n       Unfortunately, these well-intentioned new rules have no \n     relevance when the bicameral majority leadership decides to \n     bypass going to conference altogether, and instead negotiates \n     final agreements behind closed doors. And this is happening \n     with increasing frequency, sometimes even over the \n     public protests of committee chairmen who have been \n     excluded from leadership negotiations.\n       To determine just how serious the practice of bypassing \n     conferences has become, I compared action on major bills \n     through March of the second session in both this Democratic \n     110th Congress and the preceding Republican-controlled 109th. \n     (A major bill is defined here as one originally considered \n     under a special rule in the House.)\n       Of major bills approved by the House and Senate that \n     required some action to resolve differences between the two \n     versions, 11 out of 19 (58 percent) were settled by \n     conferences in the current Congress compared with 18 out of \n     19 (95 percent) in the previous Congress.\n       Put another way, the current 110th Congress has been \n     negotiating eight times as many bills as the 109th Congress \n     outside the conference process. This is done by using the \n     ``pingpong'' approach of bouncing amendments between the \n     houses until a final agreement is achieved.\n       Among the major bills in this Congress that have bypassed \n     conference consideration are the energy independence bill, \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program, Iraq-Katrina \n     supplemental appropriations, terrorism insurance, the \n     consolidated appropriations act and the tax rebate/stimulus \n     legislation.\n       While the conference bypass approach is just as legitimate \n     under the rules as going to conference (and sometimes \n     advisable when there are only minor differences to iron out), \n     the procedure is more suspect when used on major bills on \n     which numerous substantive disagreements exist between the \n     houses. That is when House and Senate leaders are more likely \n     to directly intervene, rendering committee chairmen less \n     relevant to the process.\n       Senate minority Republicans are not entirely blameless in \n     this development. At times they have brought pressures to \n     avoid conferences, under threat of filibuster, in order to \n     better ensure the retention of provisions in which they have \n     a vested interest. However, House and Senate Democratic \n     leaders have been just as culpable in wanting to skip \n     conferences to produce outcomes most beneficial to their \n     party.\n       While it is too early to declare House-Senate conferences \n     as extinct as the dodo, it is not too early to move them onto \n     the parliamentary endangered-species list. It is one more \n     sign of the decline of the committee system and its \n     attributes of deliberation and expertise. It is especially \n     troubling because the lack of conference deliberations shuts \n     out majority and minority Members alike from having a final \n     say on important policy decisions. Party governance must be \n     better balanced against participatory lawmaking. Both parties \n     need to recognize this.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in my \ncapacity as the ranking member of the Senate aviation subcommittee. I \nwould like to take a few minutes to discuss the Senate FAA \nreauthorization bill and the substitute on which we will be voting \nlater this afternoon and respond to some of the recent remarks that \nhave been made on this process.\n  The lack of progress last week and the parliamentary action of \nfilling the amendment tree are very disappointing to me. Today, for the \n19th time this session, we will be asked to vote on cloture on a bill \nwe have not even had open to amendment. In the present situation, we \nare being asked to vote on cloture before we have cast a single vote on \nan amendment. What the leader is doing is blocking amendments, \npreventing debate, forcing a cloture vote, and hoping the Republicans \nvote against it. Then press releases will be sent out blaming \nRepublicans for obstructionism. But I have to say, what is obstruction? \nI don't think most Americans would define obstruction as insisting that \nan FAA bill; that is, the Federal Aviation Administration, not include \nunnecessary and imprudent tax increases, even worse retroactive tax \nincreases, unrelated to aviation.\n  I have suggested several options in an attempt to produce an FAA \nreauthorization package upon which most Members could agree. But those \nsuggestions have been turned down by the other side. Unfortunately, \nthis bill is being bogged down by trying to make it an omnibus tax and \nspecial projects package.\n  It is so important that we pass an aviation bill. That is why I have \nintroduced S. 2972, which is currently at the desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ted Stevens be added as a \ncosponsor of S. 2972.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the text of S. 2972 is identical to \nthe substitute we worked on last week. It is the bill that came out of \nthe Commerce Committee with complete bipartisanship, but it does not \ninclude the unrelated and extraneous tax provisions. It does have \naviation taxes that came out of the Finance Committee to which all of \nus agreed. It does not have all of the other tax provisions that have \nnothing to do with aviation--some of which are retroactive--and have \nnothing to do with FAA.\n  I have also conveyed to my friends and colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee that I am supportive of moving forward on a bill that would \nreplenish the highway trust fund. I think we could all agree on that. \nBut this is a workable FAA reauthorization bill, and it is very \nimportant to me because of\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\nthe important role of aviation in our country and in my home State.\n  In Texas alone, aviation accounts for nearly 60,000 jobs and over $8 \nbillion in total economic output. In addition, we are also home to 2 of \nthe top 10 busiest airports in the Nation. We have 23 commercial \nservice airports and over 300 general aviation airports. Beyond \ninfrastructure, we are also the proud home of two legacy airlines, \nAmerican and Continental, and the home State of the predominant low-\ncost carrier Southwest. My State has a dynamic aviation footprint and a \nsubstantial interest in the future of this challenged industry.\n  Since the year 2000, the U.S. airline industry has gone through its \nmost fundamental restructuring since Congress deregulated the industry \nin the late 1970s. We all know so well the horrific impact of 9/11 and \nwhat happened to the industry after that, and that is still affecting \nit today. Put on top of that the high fuel prices which are affecting \naviation even more than regular gasoline at the pump and you have a \nsituation in which we have an industry that is really teetering on the \nbrink of disaster.\n  Since taking over as leader of the aviation subcommittee earlier this \nyear, I have worked closely with my friend and colleague Senator Jay \nRockefeller. We have developed a bill upon which all of us agreed, with \nthe complete support of Senator Inouye, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and Senator Stevens, the vice chairman. We have worked \nhard to develop a package that would foster air traffic modernization, \ndoing it without doing damage to the commercial airline industry and \nwith the complete support of the general aviation community. We \nproduced a bill that was bipartisan with the support of our committee.\n  Here are some of the important provisions in the bill we produced:\n  It has important safety and passenger protections. The U.S. \ncommercial aviation industry is experiencing the safest year in our \nhistory. However, recent high-profile aviation safety incidents have \ngiven the public some concern. In response, the committee has crafted \nseveral new safety initiatives in the substitute, based on the \nrecommendation of the Department of Transportation inspector general.\n  The new package ensures the FAA's voluntary disclosure reporting \nprocess requires inspectors to verify that the airlines actually took \nthe corrective actions they stated they would, evaluate if an air \ncarrier has offered a comprehensive solution before accepting the \ndisclosure, and confirm that the corrective action is completed and \nadequately addresses the problem disclosed.\n  The bill implements a process for second-level supervisory review of \nself-disclosures before they are accepted and closed. Acceptance would \nnot rest solely with one inspector.\n  It revises post-employment guidance to require a ``cooling off'' \nperiod of 2 years before an FAA inspector is hired at an air carrier he \nor she previously inspected. I personally would like to see that \nextended beyond 2 years to 3 or 4 years. If we had an amendment \nprocess, that would have been one of my amendments.\n  The bill implements a process to track field office inspectors and \nalert the local, regional, and headquarters offices to overdue \ninspections.\n  It establishes an independent review through the Government \nAccountability Office, the GAO, to review and investigate air safety \nissues identified by its employees.\n  It develops a national review team under the supervision of the \nDepartment of Transportation inspector general to conduct periodic \nreviews of FAA's oversight of air carriers.\n  It develops a plan for the reduction of runway incursions through a \nreview of all commercial airports and establishes a process for \ntracking and investigating both runway incursions and operational \nerrors that includes random auditing of the oversight process.\n  I am a former Vice Chairman of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard. I understand the crucial mission of the FAA in overseeing the \nNation's airlines and aviation system.\n  Aviation safety and the public trust that goes along with it is the \nbedrock of our national aviation policy. We cannot allow the \ndegradation of service to the flying public.\n  I believe the bill we crafted in the Commerce Committee that is part \nof the substitute that I would agree with today, and all that is in the \nbill I have introduced but without the extraneous provisions that have \nnothing to do with aviation.\n  The other part of the bill that is in what the Commerce Committee \nproduced and is in my substitute as well is the timely issue of \nconsumer protections or a passenger bill of rights. The substitute \nincludes several crucial reforms directed at making the airlines more \naccountable and responsive to passengers.\n  The managers' amendment would incorporate several additional \nprotections to strengthen airline service requirements. The DOT would \nreview and approve the contingency service plans of every air carrier. \nThe Secretary could disapprove an airline's plan and return it to the \ncarrier with the option for modification and resubmittal, and the DOT \nthen would be authorized to establish minimum standards for such \ncontingency plans. It would require a mandate that such contingency \nplans are to apply to aircraft that are delayed, whether on departure \nor arrival.\n  Now, we have all heard stories about people who have been stranded on \nairplanes for 5 hours without any food service, without the opportunity \nto use the facilities.\n  That is cruel and unusual punishment. I myself have been on airplanes \nthat have been delayed 2 hours and more, and I know it is very \nuncomfortable for passengers. That is why we included in this bill \nrequirements that airlines either have a plan that is approved by the \nDepartment of Transportation or there would be a 3-hour maximum or the \npassengers could get off; the establishment of an Advisory Committee \nfor Aviation Consumer Protection would also be put in this bill.\n  It would advise the Department of Transportation on carrying out air \nservice improvements and what would be necessary to make them better. \nThe committee would be comprised of four members to be appointed by the \nSecretary with a requirement to report to Congress annually over a 2-\nyear period on its recommendations to the Department of Transportation \nto improve this service and an explanation of the Department's action \non each of the recommendations.\n  So these are some of the important provisions in the Commerce \nCommittee bill. They are in the bill that would be before us, and they \nwould be in the bill I would like to see us pass that I have introduced \nand is being held at the desk.\n  The substitute also addresses rural air service funding challenges by \nincluding additional funding for the Essential Air Service Program for \nour smaller underserved communities at $175 million annually. These \nfunds would go a long way toward improving access for our most rural \ncommunities, communities that had air service, commercial air service, \nin the past but lost that after deregulation.\n  As I stated last week, I hope my colleagues will appreciate the \nmonths of stalled negotiations that took place in trying to move this \nlegislation forward. There is a very good balance in the Senate bill \nregarding FAA financing and labor-related provisions. If the Senate \nwants a final bill, we need to preserve that balance without including \nhighly controversial unrelated provisions that many people would agree \ndo not belong in an FAA bill dealing with aviation.\n  We have an opportunity to pass FAA legislation this week. The bill I \nhave introduced with Senator Stevens would be everything the Commerce \nCommittee passed on a bipartisan basis and the provisions of the \nFinance Committee report on aviation taxes that would go toward \nmodernization.\n  It does not include the controversial pension provision that changes \nthe previous law this Congress has passed and affects some of our \nairlines in a way that could be so destructive as to possibly bring \nthat air carrier down. It does not include all the taxes that were put \nin, all the projects, all the earmarks that have nothing to do with \naviation.\n  It is simply the Senate bipartisan bill on aviation and the Finance \nCommittee package that deals with aviation. We could pass this bill and \nsend it to the President and the President would sign this bill. He \nwould sign the bill Senator Stevens and I have put\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\nforward. He will not sign the bill that would be put forward by my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Rockefeller.\n  There are provisions of that bill that would not allow this bill to \ngo forward at all, period, because there are policy matters unrelated \nto aviation that more than 41 people in this Senate will object to \nputting on an aviation bill.\n  So I think we have a way forward. I have introduced a bill that I \nbelieve could get the majority of the votes in the Senate. It would be \nsigned by the President, and it would do all that I have mentioned \nrelating to aviation safety improvements, passenger bill of rights, it \nwould modernize our air traffic control system, it would keep the \nbalance in the system we all agree we should have between air carriers \nand commercial airports, general aviation and general aviation \nairports.\n  It is a good bill. We have a way forward. We have made agreements we \ncan all agree would push the bill forward. But the substitute we are \ngoing to vote cloture on without the process of amendments being open \nis not that bill. There is no reason for the Commerce Committee bill on \naviation to take on all these taxes and special interest projects that \nhave nothing to do with aviation.\n  If those projects can stand on their own, let's vote on those \nprojects alone. The Finance Committee has many vehicles on which they \ncan put their legislation. But to try to put nonaviation taxes on an \naviation bill is going to bring this bill down.\n  I hope we will not allow that to happen. We will vote no on cloture. \nCloture probably will not be given because it is not an aviation bill \nwe are going to be voting on. But we have an aviation bill. Let's vote \non that one. Let's vote on the bipartisan bill from the Commerce \nCommittee and the taxes from the Finance Committee that relate to \naviation and let's move forward. I think we can do it.\n  This is the Senate. We can work on a bipartisan basis. My colleagues, \nSenator Rockefeller and I and Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens and \nthe members of our committee have done an incredibly good job of \nbringing that balance together. So I hope we will not waste that effort \nand that we will be able to put up as one of the accomplishments of \nthis session of Congress an FAA reauthorization bill that modernized \nour system, that created a passenger bill of rights, that created a \nsafety program that further enhanced a good program, that included war \nrisk insurance, a bill that balances all the aviation interests of our \ncountry, which are so important to our economic viability.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the situation parliamentarywise?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.R. 2881 is pending, with amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there any time agreement at the present time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a vote scheduled at 2:30.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the bill, not in morning business.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Lew Williams, Jr.\n\n  Our young State, Alaska, this past weekend lost one of our greatest \n20th century pioneers when Lew Williams, Jr., the publisher emeritus of \nthe Ketchikan Daily News, died while vacationing in Scottsdale, AZ.\n  Through his six decades in Alaska journalism, Lew brought news to \nmuch of southeast Alaska through a series of newspapers which he edited \nand owned. Five southeast Alaska towns were home to Lew Williams. \nJuneau was the first, when, as an 11-year-old boy, he delivered the \nEmpire, the paper on which his dad was a reporter. Wrangell was next. \nHis dad was the new editor-owner of the Wrangell Sentinel, and Lew \nbecame his 15-year-old apprentice. Later, after Navy service in World \nWar II, Lew bought the paper from his father. Next the beautiful town \nof Petersburg, AK, claimed Lew when he and his bride Dorothy bought the \nPetersburg Press. From that time on, Dorothy remained his partner in \nnewspapering, along with helping Lew to set the path that has been \nfollowed by his own three children.\n  In 1966, Lew took over the editorship of the Ketchikan Daily News \nand, a decade later, he and Dorothy bought that paper, settling in for \nthe long run and spending the rest of his life in Ketchikan.\n  When the Daily Sitka Sentinel fell on hard times after major \nmechanical problems and a fire in 1969, Lew offered assistance to the \nbeleaguered owners. That assistance turned into ownership of that paper \nalso. But in 1975, he sold the Sentinel to the Poulsons, a young couple \nwho had been hired to be editors. Thad Poulson was a former reporter in \nJuneau and an AP representative in Juneau. He remains with the Sitka \npaper today.\n  Despite his close ties to these five towns in our State's beautiful \nsoutheastern panhandle, Lew was truly a man for all of Alaska.\n  He was one of my close friends, and I mourn his passing.\n  Early in the 1950s, when the larger southeast daily newspapers were \nagainst Alaska statehood, Lew Williams joined the small weeklies in our \nfight to become the 49th State. The concerns that faced Alaska as a \nterritory, and later as a State, Lew adopted as his concerns. No matter \nwhere the problem was in our 586,000 square miles, Lew Williams became \nacquainted with it and tried to do something about the problem. Whether \nthe issue was minerals or timber, fisheries or lands, hundreds of other \nmatters, Lew wrote clearly and forcefully in his paper, as editor, to \nhelp his readers understand the solutions he believed were best for all \nAlaska and Alaskans.\n  Critics who may have disagreed with his stand on any issue were \nunanimous in their praise for his writings. His columns were carried in \npapers throughout our State and many throughout the Nation, and they \nhave continued to run, until a few weeks ago, in what we call \nAnchorage's Voice of the Times which is printed as an op-ed in the \nAnchorage Daily News.\n  Although Lew's paper, the Ketchikan Daily News, is the smallest daily \nin Alaska, with a weekend edition also, Lew was in the forefront when \nit came to technology. He beat out what we call ``the big boys'' in the \nlarger towns when he was the first to offer offset printing and color \nand among the first with newsroom computers. Along the way, Lew \ncollected dozens of honors for his papers throughout the Nation and for \nhis community service. He served on boards ranging from the chambers of \ncommerce to fish and game advisory boards, school boards, and the \nRotary. He was appointed to the board of regents of our University of \nAlaska. He was a member of the blue ribbon task force for the Alaska \nNational Interest Public Lands Act--we call it ANILCA--which was passed \nin 1908, and he served on the Alaska Judicial Council and the board of \ngovernors of the Alaska Bar Association, although he was not a lawyer.\n  And ``there's more,'' as the television commercial says. Lew founded \nthe Alaska Newspaper Association. He was named businessman of the year \nfor Alaska a few years ago. He founded the Southeast Alaska Conference \nand for 29 years was an adult leader of Boy Scouts.\n  These honors pale beside Lew's greatest gift to our State, and that \nis his three children who grew up in newspaper offices. What a tribute \nto their dad that they adopted his profession and are carrying it on. \nLew III, Tena, and Kathy, his children, accepted the reins from their \ndad in 1990. But he still remained in that office and he gave his time \nto finish writing and editing a 700-page book called ``Bent Pins and \nChains,'' a history of Alaska through its newspapers. He had begun this \nwith the late historian wife of the publisher of the Anchorage Times, \nEvangeline Atwood, for anyone who is interested in Alaska. Alaskans are \nfortunate that the vibrant Williams younger generation carries on Lew \nWilliams' commitment to good reporting, fine writing, dedication to \ncommunity service, and making Alaska the greatest place in the United \nStates to live.\n  Those of us who knew Lew Williams, who shared opinions and laughs and\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\ndisappointments and triumphs and many wonderful days, are among the \nluckiest of Alaskans. I always looked up Lew Williams when I was in \nKetchikan, and he always had some news and advice for me. I usually \nfollowed it.\n  We do have the knowledge we could not have had delivered to us \nthrough a better, more loyal friend. I have to say, it is tough to lose \na friend like Lew. The joy he brought to my life and to my family's \nlife and to so many others cannot be measured in a statement of this \nkind. I tell the Senate that everyone makes a statement like this. Not \noften do we make a statement pertaining to someone who had so much to \ndo with our lives and what we have done. When I first decided to run \nfor the Senate, I went to Ketchikan to talk to Lew Williams to see if \nhe agreed. That was back in 1962. I have known Lew Williams and Dorothy \nand the children for a long time. Catherine and I send our love and \ndeepest sympathy. We know our friend and their loved one is gone, but \nhe will not be forgotten by any of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that recent editorials and comments about my \nfriend Lew Williams be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Newsman Lew Williams Jr. Dies at 83\n\n       Ketchikan.--Ketchikan Daily News publisher emeritus \n     Llewellyn ``Lew'' M. Williams, Jr., 83, died Saturday in \n     Scottsdale, Ariz.\n       Williams was a pioneer Alaska journalist, active in \n     newspaper, state and local affairs for more than 60 years. He \n     died while vacationing in Arizona, four days after he had \n     been due to return home to Ketchikan.\n       He and his wife, Dorothy, published newspapers in Wrangell, \n     Petersburg, Sitka and Ketchikan.\n       They were the first to switch an Alaska newspaper from the \n     hot-type method of printing to photo offset, which later \n     became used universally in the industry.\n       They were the first to switch an Alaska afternoon daily \n     newspaper to morning publication. They created a successful \n     weekend edition for the Ketchikan Daily News while other \n     small dailies in Alaska remained five-day publications. The \n     Williamses were Alaska pioneers in adapting electronics to \n     newspaper production.\n       In 1965, Lew Williams was a founder of the Alaska Newspaper \n     Publishers' Association, forerunner to today's Alaska \n     Newspaper Association. He served terms as president of each \n     organization and served a term as director of the regional \n     Allied Daily Newspaper Association.\n       The Williamses purchased the Ketchikan Daily News from the \n     Paul S. Charles family in 1976, after managing the newspaper \n     for 10 years. They sold their interest to their children, Lew \n     III, Kathy and Tena Williams, after Williams retired as \n     publisher in 1990.\n       Williams was born in Spokane, Wash., Nov. 26, 1924, to Lew \n     M. Williams Sr. and Winifred (Dow) Williams, who met while \n     both were reporters for Tacoma newspapers. The Williams \n     family moved to Juneau in 1935, where the elder Williams \n     worked for the Juneau Empire. In 1939, the senior Williamses \n     purchased the Wrangell Sentinel.\n       After serving as a sergeant in the paratroops in World War \n     II, Lew Jr. ran the Sentinel for the family. He married \n     Dorothy M. Baum in Mitchell, Neb., on July 2, 1954.\n       The couple purchased the Petersburg Press and acquired the \n     Wrangell Sentinel from the senior Williamses when they \n     retired.\n       They sold both newspapers to Alaska Airlines President \n     Charles Willis, and bought the Daily Sitka Sentinel and an \n     interest in the Ketchikan Daily News. They sold the Sitka \n     paper to Thad and Sandy Paulson to concentrate on publishing \n     the Ketchikan paper when they bought out the Charleses. \n     Although the Petersburg Press was suspended after he sold it, \n     Lew Williams helped the Petersburg Pilot get started. All \n     newspapers he and his wife ran were successful businesses and \n     community leaders.\n       Williams was a lifetime member of Petersburg Elks Lodge No. \n     1615, the American Legion and Pioneers of Alaska.\n       Williams served on the Wrangell School Board, as mayor of \n     Petersburg and on numerous state boards, among them the \n     Alaska Judicial Council, the Board of Governors of the Alaska \n     Bar Association and the Board of Regents of the University of \n     Alaska. He served on boards under every state governor \n     through 1999. He served three years as the first secretary of \n     the Petersburg Fish and Game Advisory Board when Alaska took \n     control of fish and game with statehood.\n       He was a past president of Rotary, served 29 years as an \n     adult leader in the Boy Scout program, and was active in \n     Democratic Party politics when Bill Egan was governor. For \n     his public service, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of \n     humanities by the University of Alaska Southeast.\n       As a writer, Williams was noted for his strong editorials \n     and weekly columns. He continued writing his column, ``End of \n     the Week,'' up until his death, and occasionally contributed \n     editorials. He continued to provide background material to \n     Daily News editorial writers, because of his lengthy service \n     in and extensive knowledge of public affairs. His advice was \n     sought not only by reporters and editors at the newspaper, \n     but also by municipal and state leaders.\n       In 2006, he published ``Bent Pins to Chains: Alaska and its \n     newspapers,'' a book he wrote with the late Evangeline Atwood \n     that is described on its dust jacket as ``a journalism \n     course, including a history of Alaska under the American \n     flag.''\n       He believed the editorial was the heart and strength of any \n     newspaper. He editorialized for Alaska statehood, for \n     creation of the state ferry system, for the trans-Alaska \n     pipeline, for power development, in support of the timber and \n     fishing industries, and for airports, harbors and roads.\n       As a community booster, he was active in chambers of \n     commerce and was a founder and first secretary of the \n     regional Southeast Conference. He was named Citizen of the \n     Year by both the state chamber and the Greater Ketchikan \n     Chamber of Commerce in the early 1980s, and named Alaskan of \n     the Year in 1991 by the nonprofit Alaskan of the Year \n     organization, based in Anchorage.\n       Williams was a dedicated family man, who in his early days \n     enjoyed hunting and fishing on the Stikine River. After \n     retirement, he liked to vacation with family in Arizona.\n       He is survived by his wife, Dorothy; daughters, Christena \n     and Kathryn; son, Lew III and daughter-in-law, Vicki; \n     granddaughters, Kristie, Jodi and Melissa Williams; and \n     great-grandson, Milan Browne, all of Ketchikan; sisters, \n     Susan Pagenkopf of Juneau and Jane Ferguson of California; \n     and by cousins in Alaska and Washington.\n       At his request, no service is scheduled. Messinger \n     Mortuaries of Scottsdale is in charge of cremation.\n       The family suggests memorials to the First City Council on \n     Cancer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 An Alaskan Original Dies in Scottsdale\n\n       The Voice of The Times lost a great friend and favorite \n     columnist on Saturday when Ketchikan newsman Lew M. Williams \n     Jr., died at 83 in Scottsdale, Ariz., his vacation home.\n       Lew was the retired publisher of the Ketchikan Daily News \n     and active in journalism and Alaska's civic life for more \n     than 60 years. He worked on various newspaper jobs as a youth \n     and began his journalism career on a full-time basis after \n     service as a paratrooper sergeant in World War II.\n       He first ran the Wrangell Sentinel for his family, worked \n     at the Sitka Sentinel and the old Petersburg Press, and \n     managed the Ketchikan Daily News for 10 years before buying \n     it in 1976. His daughter, Tena, is now the Ketchikan \n     publisher, taking over when he retired.\n       He was a principal author of ``Bent Pins to Chains,'' a \n     comprehensive history of the newspaper business in Alaska. He \n     researched and wrote the book after taking over the original \n     research done by the late Evangeline Atwood, who was an \n     Alaska historian and widow of Robert B. Atwood, publisher of \n     The Anchorage Times and another giant of Alaska journalism.\n       Most long-time Alaska journalists knew him and many can \n     recount personal experiences with him. Most will testify to \n     the friendly and helpful attitude he had toward others in the \n     profession.\n       Lew's death was unexpected and came after sending an e-mail \n     in late April saying he wouldn't be writing columns for a \n     while because he had the flu. His wife, Dorothy, insisted he \n     see a doctor and they learned just a week before his death \n     that it was cancer.\n       His family gathered in Scottsdale and he was apparently \n     comfortable until the end. By one account he was still \n     tracking the stock market during his last week. With his \n     inquiring and untiring mind, that would be no surprise.\n       Lew's list of good friends includes Sen. Ted Stevens, who \n     is preparing a tribute to him for delivery on the floor of \n     the U.S. Senate on Tuesday.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that the Federal Aviation \nAdministration reauthorization is the pending business before the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is a bipartisan bill that Senator Rockefeller of \nWest Virginia, Senator Hutchison of Texas, and many others worked on \nvery long and hard. We voted unanimously to go forward with this bill \nlast week. This is long overdue. It is to modernize the air traffic \ncontrol system, to establish a basic set of rights for airline \npassengers, and so many other things that are included in this bill, to \nmove the technology of air traffic control forward so America can be on \nthe same page as many other developed nations that have found more \nefficient, safer ways to guide aircraft. You would think that sort of \nthing would be nonpartisan when it came to the floor of the Senate. I \nam sorry to say we haven't had much luck.\n  If Senators were paid by the vote, last week we would have been on \nshort rations. We had one vote last week. We all came out and \nceremoniously showed\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\nup one time on the floor of the Senate to vote and leave.\n  I kind of thought when I ran for the Senate there was something \ninvolved such as debate, deliberation, that Senators would come forward \nand offer amendments, and other Senators who disagreed might debate \nthose amendments and maybe even offer an amendment of their own. It is \nlike the Senate was once portrayed in the movies. That is the Senate of \n``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' and so many other great depictions of \nSenate activity. But not this Senate; we are in a different mode. We \nare in the filibuster mode, imposed on us by the Republican minority.\n  In the history of the Senate, looking back over 200 years, the \nmaximum number of filibusters in any 2-year period is 57. That is an \neasy number to remember. Now, unfortunately, in this Senate session, as \nwe go into the second year, the Republican minority has broken that \nrecord. We have now had 69 filibusters, and we are not even halfway \nthrough this year. Some speculate there will be over 100 filibusters \nbefore this session comes to an end.\n  That is unfortunate because a filibuster basically means the Senate \nstops. Any Member can stand up, object, and stop the Senate. Then it \ntakes a motion to be filed and some 30 hours to pass before you vote on \nthat motion and start up again, if you are lucky enough to get 60 \nvotes. The Republican minority knows this. So time and time and time \nagain they have started filibusters and caused us to file motions for \ncloture to try to get to an issue.\n  Now, for an outsider watching the Senate, they might say: What \ndifference does it make? Why don't you all get over it and try to get \nsomething done? Well, unfortunately, we are not having any luck at \nthat. The Republican minority has now reached new heights--or new \ndepths--depending on your point of view when it comes to applying the \nfilibuster.\n  We have a technical corrections bill that comes around once in a \nwhile when we have drafting errors in bills, and we have to change the \nspelling and grammar. We had a big highway bill. It was a huge bill. \nThen, over time, people looked at it and said: Wait a minute, that \nshouldn't have said ``road,'' it should have said ``avenue.'' The \nspelling is wrong or the punctuation. Let's put these technical \ncorrections in. The Republicans filibustered the bill--a bill such as \nthat they filibustered.\n  One of the Republican Senators got up on the floor and said: Well, \nthere were some things in there we objected to. Well, the way it \nworks--at least by most tradition in the Senate--is if you object to \nsomething, you file a motion to strike that section. You debate it. \nThere is a vote. The Senate moves to the next consideration. That is \nthe orderly process but not the approach being used by the Republican \nminority. Their approach: Initiate a filibuster. Tie up the Senate. \nMake us burn 30 hours doing nothing, with as few votes, as few \namendments, as few bills as possible. Why? Well, several reasons.\n  First, they like the world as it currently exists. They do not \nbelieve improving aviation safety is worth the effort on the floor to \ntry to work together. Time and again, they have stopped efforts in \nprogress because they do not want us to have, I guess, a record to \npoint to that shows we have achieved something.\n  Finally, they are afraid of controversial votes. I had the good \nfortune, many years ago, to serve with a Congressman from Oklahoma \nnamed Mike Synar. Mike Synar was a real character. He was a throwback. \nHe invited controversy. He welcomed it, and it eventually did him in. \nHe lost a Democratic primary. He managed to anger enough people that it \ndid not work. But he was a character. He used to say: If you don't want \nto fight fire, don't be a firefighter. If you don't want to vote on \ncontroversial issues, don't run for the House or, I might add, the \nSenate.\n  Unfortunately, on the Republican side, they do not want to vote on \nanything, and they do not want to face anything that might be \ncontroversial. So they file filibuster after filibuster.\n  So we had hoped last week this bill, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration bill, would be different--modernizing air traffic \ncontrol, making our skies safer, making sure our planes are well \ninspected. That seems to me to be an issue that is not a Republican or \nDemocratic issue.\n  So last week, the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, came to the \nfloor and said to the Republican side: If you have amendments, let's \nsee them and let's get going. Let's start dealing with those \namendments. If they relate to the Federal Aviation Administration, \nlet's bring them up, let's debate them, let's vote on them.\n  We had hoped, since we had this ``exhausting'' week last week, where \nwe voted one time, that maybe the Republicans would have time to come \nup with a list of amendments they wanted to come forward with. But I am \nafraid the majority leader's invitation to offer amendments was \ndeclined by the other side, and here we are stuck in the middle of \nanother filibuster.\n  They tell us what is haunting them is a project in this bill that \nrelates to the city of New York. My colleague and friend, Senator Chuck \nSchumer, and Senator Clinton, are pushing for something in New York \nwhich they feel the President has promised. In fact, the President \nincluded it in his budget.\n  Some Republican Senators do not like it. They do not want it in \nthere. Well, they certainly have the right to offer to strike it. We \ngive them that opportunity. But because this lingering resistance to \nthe bill is there, they will not let us move forward.\n  I was optimistic that maybe after a long weekend we could finally \nmake some progress, that the Republican Members would come forward, \noffer some amendments, and start to debate the bill. Well, the weekend \nis over and we are in Tuesday of this week and nothing is happening. \nThat is regrettable.\n  There is a portion of this bill that was in the original substitute \nwhich has now been removed, which I thought we put behind us last week. \nIt was a measure related to airline pensions. I assumed at some point \nwe would revisit it. I was surprised when my good friend, the ranking \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Grassley of Iowa, took \nto the floor earlier today to reopen the debate.\n  Senator Grassley said a provision in the original substitute \namendment last week would have in some way corrected a provision I had \nsupposedly, in his words, ``airdropped'' into a conference report last \nyear, as a result of smoky, backroom dealing and that the Finance \nCommittee was trying to right a wrong.\n  I would like to set the record straight. I do like Chuck Grassley. I \nrespect him. We have worked on things together. We come from adjoining \nStates. We have been traveling on airplanes together for 20 years-plus. \nThere are times when we do see eye to eye and work very closely. His \nleadership on a bipartisan basis on the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram was one of the better moments in this Congress. But on this \nparticular one, I have to say I think Senator Grassley is wrong.\n  Why would we be debating airline pensions or why should people care? \nIf you work for an airline, of course you care. But when you take a \nlook at, overall, what is going on here in America, I think everybody \ncan understand what we are up against.\n  On this chart is a list of airlines which declared bankruptcy \nrecently: Frontier, 6,000 employees out of work; ATA, 2,230 employees \nout of work; Skybus, 450 employees; Aloha, 1,900 employees; EOS, 450 \nemployees.\n  This is an alarming trend, as more airlines declare bankruptcy and \npeople lose their jobs.\n  Also, many of these people have lost at least some measure of \nsecurity when it comes to their retirement. So when we talk about \nairline pensions in today's climate, where our economy has slowed to a \ncrawl, we can understand why this is an issue which we should handle \nvery carefully.\n  In considering the Pension Protection Act of 2005, the original \nSenate bill provided near parity for airlines. What we were trying to \ndo in this country was to say to companies all across the board: You \npromised your employees when they came to work for you, if they worked \nlong enough, they could retire and have a pension. Keep your word. Make \nsure there are enough funds set aside so you can fund their pensions \nwhen they retire.\n  So we got into this debate and realized for most companies in America \ncertain standards would work, but in one industry--the airline \nindustry--it\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\nwas a little more difficult because they were struggling. After 9/11, \nmany airlines went into bankruptcy, many were on the edge of \nbankruptcy, and most were barely getting by. So we created a provision \nin the bill in how we dealt with airlines when we talked about this \nPension Protection Act.\n  The original bill provided near parity for all airlines, giving all \ncarriers 14 years to catch up in underfunding in their defined benefit \npensions. The Senate passed an amendment by voice vote--Senator Isakson \noffered it--that would have provided even more benefits to the airline \nindustry in the way they funded their pensions--again maintaining \nsomething close to parity among airlines. We knew we had an industry \nthat was in a delicate situation. We wanted to protect their employees. \nWe did not want to go too far, too fast. The Isakson amendment gave us \na way most of us felt was reasonable.\n  When the conference report for the bill was finalized, the near \nequality for the airlines was destroyed. In its place, there was a huge \ndisparity in the funding rules for some airlines compared to the rules \nthat even the airlines they competed against had to follow. The \nconference committee had changed the will and decision of the Senate \nand decided to pick winners and losers among airlines.\n  It was interesting, as soon as that came back, there was a lot of \nfloor activity and floor debate and colloquy among Senators about that \nprovision. For example, Senator Kennedy came to the floor and said:\n\n       Quite frankly, I was disappointed that we didn't treat \n     American and Continental Airlines more fairly in the final \n     recommendations. Without moving ahead at this time on the \n     pension legislation, we have the prospects of one of the \n     major airlines dropping their pension program, with more than \n     150,000 workers losing their pensions.\n\n  You see, that is what the issue came down to. As airlines were facing \ntough times, some went into bankruptcy, and the first casualty in the \nbankruptcy was their pension plan. Historically, many companies in \nAmerica offered a defined benefit pension plan, which meant if you \nworked a certain number of years and contributed, when you retired, you \nknew what you would receive in a pension. It was defined: how much each \nmonth, whether a cost of living adjustment would apply.\n  As airlines went into bankruptcy, that was one of the first \ncasualties. They said: We can no longer accept that responsibility for \nfuture retirees. We are going to go into a defined contribution plan, \nknown as 401(k)s and similar tax models in order to fund their future \npensions. That limited the contribution of the company and left some \nuncertainty for the employee in retirement. But that was what happened. \nAs airlines went into bankruptcy, the defined benefit pension plans \nfell by the wayside and the defined contribution plans took their \nplace.\n  When all the smoke had cleared, there were five airlines that \nmaintained their original basic defined benefit pension plans: American \nAirlines; Continental; Hawaiian; Alaskan; and Piedmont, which was \nassumed by US Airways. So these were companies that avoided bankruptcy \nand said: We are going to try to keep our airlines competitive. We are \nnot going to dump the pension plans of our employees, and we are going \nto try to hang on. I think those companies did a brave thing and the \nright thing and the best thing for their employees.\n  Unfortunately, when it came to the law being passed by Congress, we \ngave better treatment to those airlines that went into bankruptcy and \nbasically froze their pension plans and would not allow others to come \ninto them. So it was a decision in that conference report which favored \nsome airlines over others.\n  Senator Enzi spoke to this provision when he said on the floor:\n\n       I am a little disappointed in the language from the House \n     bill because it fails to treat all the legacy airlines \n     equally. . . . The Senate bill gave amortization extensions \n     to all four legacy airlines . . . but under the House bill, \n     frozen plans receive 17 years to amortize their plan debt and \n     an interest rate of 8.85 percent. . . . I prefer the language \n     of the Senate passed bill. . . . I am very sorry that the \n     House did not see fit to accept the Senate language, as it \n     was the result of many and long negotiations.\n\n  I had made a statement on the floor as well.\n  Senator Hutchison of Texas addressed the then-majority leader, Bill \nFrist, a Republican of Tennessee, and said: I hope you know we are \ngoing to basically return to this. We can't leave it where some \nairlines are treated more favorably than others. It creates a \ncompetitive advantage in a very competitive marketplace. Senator \nHutchison spoke for many of us when she said that.\n  Before the majority leader could even respond to her, other Senators, \nsuch as Senators Voinovich, Cornyn, and Inhofe, joined in, in support \nof Senator Hutchison.\n  Senator Frist, the then-Republican majority leader, said:\n\n       . . . I can promise the Senators that I will continue to \n     work with them on this issue after we return from the August \n     recess.\n\n  Now fast forward to the middle of 2007 and nothing had been done. So \nSenator Hutchison and I took a small step to improve the situation by \nadding language to a supplemental appropriations bill that gave the \nairlines left behind in the original bill a bit more fairness in the \nrules.\n  I am troubled when my friend, Senator Grassley, characterizes this as \n``dark of the night activity.'' There was fair warning that the \noriginal pension bill did not solve the problem and created some real \nfundamental unfairness, fair warning that many Senators on both sides \nof the aisle wanted to revisit this issue. So it does not strike me as \nsome underhanded or backroom deal. We let Senator Grassley and all \nother Senators know this was an unresolved issue. Well, they came back \nthis year and wanted to change the rules again, penalizing even more \nairlines, such as American Airlines that had avoided bankruptcy, was \npaying into their defined benefit plans, and had funded their pension \nplans well beyond 100 percent. American Airlines, for example, has \nfunded their pension plan to the level of 115 percent. So even in a \ntough economy they are able to do this.\n\n  Now, we have warned Senator Grassley and others if they are not \ncareful, we could find other airlines facing bankruptcy. It is pretty \ncommon knowledge what is going on. This chart shows what has happened \nto airline losses in the first quarter of this year. Delta has lost \n$274 million; American Airlines, $328 million; and United, $537 \nmillion. United, my hometown airline in Chicago, announced they may \nhave to lay off 1,000 people because of its losses.\n  Where do these losses come from? Well, it comes from the cost of jet \nfuel, as this chart shows. Airlines struggling with fierce competition \nnow have jet fuel costs spiking, as we can see, at a time when they are \nstruggling to survive, and these jet fuel costs are coming right off \nthe bottom line. So as motorists are angry about gasoline prices and \ntruckers are angry about diesel costs, airlines facing jet fuel costs \nare showing record losses as we go into this.\n  I make this part of the Record because it is fair warning to all of \nus to be very careful when we are changing the law as related to \nairlines. It might not take much to push some over the edge into \nbankruptcy. I don't think America and its economy will be stronger if \nwe have fewer airlines. I think it is far better for us to move toward \nequitable treatment of all airlines and some sensitivity to the \neconomic realities they face.\n  As of last week, we removed this contentious provision from the bill. \nAs I said, I was a little surprised that Senator Grassley wanted to \nrevisit this issue again today, but I feel just as strongly this week \nas I did last week. I think what the committee had proposed would have \nbeen fundamentally unfair and would have created a hardship on many of \nthese airlines that are struggling to survive.\n  In just a short time now the Senate will vote on a cloture vote as a \nresult of the 69th Republican Senate filibuster of this session, a \nrecordbreaking number of efforts to slow down and stop legislation--\neven this bill, a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. One would think this bill would rise above the partisan \ndivisions in this Chamber. But last week, or the week before, we even \nhad a filibuster--a Republican filibuster--of a veterans health \nbenefits program. So it appears they are going to filibuster everything \nthat is moving or everything that tries to move on the floor of the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\n  I see Senator Rockefeller has returned. As chairman of the aviation \nsubcommittee, he has done a great job on this bill. I am certainly \ngoing to support his efforts. I think they will move us forward in the \nworld of airline safety.\n  If there is no one else seeking recognition at this point, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I think everyone on this side of the \naisle has made perfectly clear, we do not oppose moving forward with an \nFAA modernization bill. In fact, we would be more than happy to move \nforward on the aviation provisions of the Commerce Committee and \nFinance Committee titles of the bill that are on the Senate floor.\n  The ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee, Senator Hutchison, \nhas been on the Senate floor for a week flagging the extraneous, \nnonaviation-related provisions in the Finance Committee package as a \nproblem. She has called repeatedly on the majority bill manager to join \nher in seeking to remove these extraneous controversial provisions and \nmove forward with a clean FAA bill. Unfortunately, the majority has not \naccepted her offer to date, and so we find ourselves in a stalemate. I \nthink this is unfortunate and unnecessary. But there is a way to pass \nthis bill in a bipartisan way if our colleagues will only take yes for \nan answer.\n  So bearing that in mind, I have indicated to the other side that I \nwould propose a unanimous consent agreement.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 2972, a bill to reauthorize and modernize the \nFederal Aviation Administration. I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements related to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nwould ask the Senator to modify his request and include an amendment \nwhich includes all of the provisions of my pending amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I assume that would put \nus right back in the same place we are now. I will not restate what I \nsaid earlier. But it was my hope, following the advice of the senior \nSenator from Texas, and our expert on this issue, that we would simply \ntake up and pass those portions of the bill that seemed to be \nnoncontroversial.\n  The proposal of the Senator from West Virginia puts the controversial \nmeasure back before us, upon which we will have the cloture vote \nshortly. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the minority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at the risk of asking someone on the \nRepublican side, isn't there such a thing as a motion to strike? Could \nwe not bring this bill up and you could move to strike the provisions \nyou don't like, and we could have a debate on the floor and actually \nhave a vote and actually get this bill moving forward? Isn't that where \nwe were last week when this ground to a halt and nothing has changed? \nWhat is wrong with, if you don't like a provision of the bill, moving \nto strike it? I ask that question through the Chair if any Republican \nis willing to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is to proceed to a vote at 2:30.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am happy to go to the vote. But the \nproblem is we don't have the opportunity to amend and strike. That has \nbeen taken away from us by the majority. The bottom line is we should \ngo to a vote, reject this bill, and we should go back to the drawing \nboard with the Commerce Committee, to a bipartisan bill for FAA \nreauthorization.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     amendment No. 4627 to H.R. 2881, the FAA reauthorization.\n         Harry Reid, Jay Rockefeller, Barbara Boxer, Kent Conrad, \n           Patrick J.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 4627 to H.R. 2881, the FAA reauthorization bill, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked on the Rockefeller substitute amendment \nNo. 4627.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous that the cloture motion on \nH.R. 2881 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Rockefeller substitute to H.R. 2881, the Aviation \nInvestment and Modernization Act. Aviation is a central element of our \nglobalized economy. The United States is the world's leader in \naviation, and if we are to maintain this position, we must invest the \nproper resources.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Rockefeller for bringing together \ndiverse interests and crafting a measure that will bolster oversight of \nthe Federal Aviation Administration's, FAA, safety system, provide \nguaranteed funding to modernize the air traffic\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\ncontrol system, strengthen passenger protections, and fund air service \nto small communities throughout the Nation.\n  I am very proud of the efforts of Senator Rockefeller and the members \nof the Senate Commerce Committee. The Commerce Committee provisions in \nthe substitute before us represent a well-crafted effort that enjoys \nbipartisan support.\n  The substitute before us represents a rare opportunity to \nsignificantly shape the future of the national air transportation \nsystem, and therefore, ensure our standing will remain at the forefront \nof the aviation industry.\n  The actions we take to reauthorize the FAA will affect the public for \ndecades to come. Legislation to reauthorize the FAA is long overdue, \nand it is vital that we pass this bill that addresses the challenges \nfacing our Nation's aviation system. We must ensure that the national \nairspace system continues to serve the public effectively, and at the \nsame time, we must move forward aggressively with modernization to make \ncertain we do not inhibit our economic growth.\n  The Nation's existing air transportation system is already stretched \nto its limits. Current passenger traffic has exceeded all previous \nrecords and is expected to exceed 1 billion passengers per year within \nthe next decade.\n  To accommodate this growth in a safe and cost-effective manner, we \nmust increase capacity by expanding our airports, modernizing our air \ntraffic control, ATC, system, and most importantly, ensuring the FAA \nhas the resources and staffing required to provide effective oversight \nof the most complicated airspace system in the world.\n  Recent events highlight the cracks developing in our air \ntransportation system. Domestic air carriers are being crippled by the \nhigh price of fuel. Seven airlines have declared bankruptcy since the \nbeginning of the year, and early reports indicate the industry has lost \nbillions of dollars in the first quarter of this year alone.\n  Most disturbing, however, are the lapses in the FAA's safety \noversight system that have been recently highlighted. Over the past few \nmonths, air carriers cancelled thousands of flights, leaving passengers \nstranded after the FAA belatedly discovered air carriers had not \nperformed required safety inspections. Congress must take the necessary \nsteps to ensure that the safety of the U.S. aviation system is never \ncompromised.\n  With our Nation's aviation system at a critical juncture, I urge my \nfellow Members to close debate on the Rockefeller substitute and adopt \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as one of the Senate's commercially \nlicensed pilots, I wish to talk about an issue near to my heart--\nflying. As many in this Chamber know, I have flown thousands of hours, \nI attend the well-known AirVenture aviation event in Oshkosh, WI, every \nyear, and I have even recreated Wiley Post's trip around the world.\n  Today, I am here to acknowledge a group of people who share my love \nof flying--volunteer pilots and nonprofit, charitable associations \ncalled Volunteer Pilot Organizations, VPOs, that provide resources to \nhelp these self-sacrificing pilots serve people in need. I have \nintroduced an amendment, S.A. 4606, to provide much needed liability \nprotection to these pilots and nonprofit organizations. My legislation \nis supported by the American Red Cross, the General Aviation \nManufacturers Association, and many volunteer pilot organizations \nthroughout the Nation.\n  Unfortunately, the majority has used a procedural tactic to restrict \nmy ability to offer this amendment to the bill we are currently \ndebating, the FAA Reauthorization Act. However, I would like to take \nthis opportunity to discuss my amendment and to encourage my colleagues \nto join me in seeking to pass basic liability protection for volunteer \npilots into law at the first opportunity.\n  There are approximately 40 to 50 VPOs in the United States--ranging \nfrom small, local groups to large, national associations. Air Charity \nNetwork, ACN, is the Nation's largest VPO and has seven member \norganizations that collectively serve the entire country and perform \nabout 90 percent of all charitable aviation missions in the United \nStates. ACN's volunteer pilots provide free air transportation for \npeople in need of specialized medical treatment at distant locations. \nThey also step in when commercial air service is not available with \nmiddle-of-the-night organ transplant patient flights, disaster response \nmissions evacuating special needs patients, and transport of blood or \nblood products in emergencies.\n  ACN and its more than 8,000 volunteer pilots use their own planes, \npay for their own fuel, and even take time from their ``day'' jobs to \nserve people in need. These Good Samaritans provided charitable flights \nfor an estimated 24,000 patients in 2007 and their safety record is \nphenomenal. In more than 30 years of service, the pilots of ACN have \nflown over 250,000 missions covering over 80 million miles and have \nnever had a fatal accident.\n  Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, ACN aircraft were the \nfirst to be approved to fly in disaster-response teams and supplies. \nSimilarly, in 2005, ACN pilots flew over 2,600 missions after \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, reuniting families torn apart by the \ndisaster and relocating them to safe housing. Their service was \ninvaluable to thousands of people.\n  My own State of Oklahoma is served well by a number of volunteer \npilot organizations, including Angel Flight South Central and Angel \nFlight Oklahoma. On a daily basis, they selflessly serve my \nconstituents by flying individuals to get surgeries and treatments.\n  I would like to share comments from two of my constituents with you. \nAngela Looney, from Norman, OK, says that, ``I could not have received \nthe care I've gotten without Angel Flight. No one in Norman or anywhere \nin Oklahoma could perform my surgery. I had to get to M.D. Anderson.'' \nTonya Dawson, from Broken Arrow, OK, travels with Angel Flight to \ntreatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. She reports, ``The \npilots are great. I can't say enough good things.''\n  Despite this goodwill, there is a loophole in the law that subjects \nthese heroes and charitable organizations to frivolous, costly \nlawsuits. Currently, although volunteer pilots are required to carry \nliability insurance, if they have an accident, the injured party can \nsue for any amount of money. It would be up to a jury to decide on an \namount. If that amount is higher than the liability limit on a pilot's \ninsurance, then the pilot risks being held personally responsible, \npotentially bringing him or her financial ruin.\n  Additionally, the cost of insurance and lack of available nonowned \naircraft liability insurance for organizations since the terrorist \nattacks of September 11 prevents VPOs from acquiring liability \nprotection for their organizations, boards, and staff. Without this \ninsurance, if a volunteer pilot were to have an accident using his or \nher own aircraft, everyone connected to the organization could be \nsubject to a costly lawsuit, despite the fact that none of those people \nwere directly involved with the dispatch of the flight, the pilot's \ndecisions, or the aircraft itself.\n  Exposure to this type of risk makes it difficult for these \norganizations to recruit and retain volunteer pilots and professional \nstaff. It also makes referring medical professionals and disaster \nagencies like the American Red Cross less likely to tell patients or \nevacuees that charitable medical air transportation is available for \nfear of a liability suit against them. Instead of focusing on serving \npeople with medical needs, these organizations are spending time and \nresources averting a lawsuit and recruiting volunteers.\n  In order to close this costly loophole, I have introduced Senate \namendment 4606. My amendment expands the Volunteer Protection Act of \n1997, which was passed into law to increase volunteerism in the United \nStates, to protect from liability volunteer pilot organizations, their \nboards, paid staff, nonflying volunteers, and referring agencies, \nshould there be an accident. It also provides liability protection for \nindividual volunteer pilots over and above the liability insurance that \nthey are currently required to carry.\n  My amendment will go a long way to help eliminate unnecessary \nliability risk and allow volunteer pilots and the charitable \norganizations for which they fly to concentrate on what they do best--\nsave lives.\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Senate amendment No. 4606 printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR VOLUNTEER PILOT NONPROFIT \n                   ORGANIZATIONS THAT FLY FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT AND \n                   TO PILOTS AND STAFF OF SUCH NONPROFIT \n                   ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Section 4 of the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 (42 \n     U.S.C. 14503) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(4)--\n       (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n     (i) and (ii), respectively;\n       (B) by striking ``the harm'' and inserting ``(A) except in \n     the case of subparagraph (B), the harm'';\n       (C) in subparagraph (A)(ii), as redesignated by this \n     paragraph, by striking the period at the end and inserting \n     ``; or''; and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) the volunteer--\n       ``(i) was operating an aircraft in furtherance of the \n     purpose of a volunteer pilot nonprofit organization that \n     flies for public benefit; and\n       ``(ii) was properly licensed and insured for the operation \n     of such aircraft.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) by striking ``Nothing in this section'' and inserting \n     the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     nothing in this section''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Exception.--A volunteer pilot nonprofit organization \n     that flies for public benefit, the staff, mission \n     coordinators, officers, and directors (whether volunteer or \n     otherwise) of such nonprofit organization, and a referring \n     agency of such nonprofit organization shall not be liable for \n     harm caused to any person by a volunteer of such nonprofit \n     organization while such volunteer--\n       ``(A) is operating an aircraft in furtherance of the \n     purpose of such nonprofit organization;\n       ``(B) is properly licensed for the operation of such \n     aircraft; and\n       ``(C) has certified to such nonprofit organization that \n     such volunteer has insurance covering the volunteer's \n     operation of such aircraft.''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to explain my vote \nagainst the motion to invoke cloture on the Rockefeller substitute \namendment No. 4627 to H.R. 2881, the Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act.\n  There are many aviation-related provisions in the substitute \namendment which are of critical importance to both the Nation and my \nState, including: $290 million per year to modernize the air traffic \ncontrol system; a $15.8 billion authorization of funds for the Airport \nImprovement Program; a requirement that airlines post the on-time \nperformance of chronically delayed flights on their Web sites; a $175 \nmillion authorization of funds for Essential Air Service, EAS, to rural \nareas; and an extension of EAS eligibility for Lancaster, PA; and \nsafety improvements related to the FAA's oversight of aircraft \ninspections. The legislation also includes nonaviation provisions to \nrestore the solvency of the highway trust fund, which is a matter of \ncritical importance, and to provide tax credit bonds for high-speed \nrail service, a measure that I helped put together. For these and other \nreasons, I believe it is imperative that the Senate act on this bill.\n  However, I do not believe it would be appropriate to act on it \nwithout necessary and proper debate, and that is precisely what a vote \nfor cloture on the substitute amendment would have represented. The \nSenate was precluded from having any meaningful or traditional debate \non this legislation due to a decision to fill the so-called ``amendment \ntree'' so that no other amendments could be freely debated and \nconsidered. I filed two amendments to this bill, one attempting to \naddress overscheduling of airline flights and one prohibiting \nunnecessary flights over residential areas, which I was precluded from \noffering. I believe my amendments address critically important issues \nthat deserve the attention and consideration of the Senate, and I am \ntold that other Senators hold similar sentiments with respect to \namendments they intended to pursue.\n  On February 15, 2007, I introduced a resolution which would prohibit \nthis abhorrent practice of filling the ``amendment tree'' so that the \nSenate can conduct its business. In the absence of this much-needed \nreform, I voted against cloture on the substitute amendment, not \nbecause I fail to recognize the importance of the provisions contained \ntherein, but because the Senate was effectively blocked from offering \nand debating any amendments to improve it.\n  It is my hope that the chairman and ranking members of the relevant \ncommittees can work out an agreement that will allow this bill to come \nback before the Senate, and with it a process for its consideration \nthat will allow for the kind of meaningful and traditional debate \nfitting of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3779-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3779-S3784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nFLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand now there will be a period of \n30 hours of debate on the motion to proceed. My understanding is--and \nmy friend and colleague from Alabama will\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\ncorrect me if I misspeak at all--over this evening people are going to \nbe discussing the various amendments that can be offered.\n  We have actually had meetings with a number of our colleagues who \nhave amendments they want to offer on this bill. Our sincere hope is \nall of these amendments will be considered. I have been informed, \nSenator Shelby has by the authors of these amendments, their intention \nis to take whatever limited amount of time they need to make their \ncase.\n  So my hope tomorrow is we will be able to vitiate the 30 hours, get \nright to the bill in the morning, and then move forward on these \nvarious ideas that are going to be offered by our colleagues, with the \ngoal in mind of completing the work on this legislation hopefully by \ntomorrow.\n  There are a number of amendments out there, but I think as the \nauthors of these amendments have indicated, they will not necessarily \ntake a lot of time for debate.\n  Let me also take advantage, if I can, in offering to our colleagues \non this side of the aisle--we have heard from several members. Senator \nLandrieu has some strong interest in this legislation but others may as \nwell. I have asked them to come forward if they would, either this \nafternoon or early this evening, and let our staffs know what these \namendments are so we can go over them with them and try to set up some \norderly process by which we can consider the amendments over the course \nof business tomorrow as well.\n  I make this request of our colleagues who have amendments to the \nFlood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act: Would you please let us \nknow as soon as possible what those amendments are so we can consider \nthem, or at least set up a timeframe for you to offer them on the \nfloor.\n  With that in mind, let me offer some initial thoughts, if I can. \nFirst, let me thank the majority leader. We are here today because the \nmajority leader has created some time for us to do this. This is an \ninterest in which all of us should have a deep concern and deep \ninterest; I note with obvious importance my colleague from Alabama and \nothers in the Gulf State areas.\n  Flood insurance is a critical issue for the coastal region of the \ncountry as well as other areas. This is a vitally important piece of \nlegislation we are considering, S. 2284. It is the Flood Insurance \nReform and Modernization Act of 2007. As I have indicated, it is a \nstrong bipartisan bill that enhances the long-term viability of the \nNational Flood Insurance Program, helping to provide critical insurance \ncoverage for millions of homes and business owners throughout the \ncountry.\n  The substitute amendment, which I will offer later, will be offered \nby myself and Senator Shelby, and contains two parts, both of which \npassed the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs with the \nsupport of every member of the committee, Republican and Democrat. The \nsubstitute amendment contains the flood insurance reform package \nexactly as was passed by the committee as well as a bill to establish a \nCommission on Natural Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance.\n  This is a very important issue, I might point out to Members. The \nunanimous votes on these bills clearly show the importance of flood \ninsurance and the strength of the bill we are considering.\n  Senator Shelby and I have joined to urge our colleagues to support \nour efforts to strengthen flood insurance for three key reasons. The \nfirst reason is this bill provides much needed relief to hard-working \nAmericans who have paid flood insurance premiums for years and through \nno fault of their own will face new stiff premium increases to reduce \nthe massive debt owed by FEMA as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, \nand Wilma.\n  This bill is fiscally responsible, No. 2, and greatly reduces the \nexposure of the Federal taxpayer under the flood program. No. 3, this \nbill creates environmentally sound flood policy which is needed to \npreserve our Nation's most precious natural resources.\n  I want to touch on each of these three points because I think too \noften we get so into the details we miss the larger picture that is \ninvolved with a piece of legislation such as this. This bill is \ncomplicated and it makes a number of significant reforms, but taken all \ntogether, it contains key policies that truly help millions of our \nfellow citizens.\n  As I said, this bill is needed to provide relief for those who \nsuffered flood losses as a result of the 2005 hurricanes. These home \nand business owners did exactly what they were supposed to do. They \npurchased flood insurance and paid premiums--some had done so for \ndecades--to cover their losses in the event of a flood. If we lay the \nentire $17 billion debt now owed by FEMA at their feet, we will force \nmany of them out of the program. To pay the interest on the debt alone, \nrates would have to nearly double, and they would have to increase many \ntimes over to make a dent in that debt.\n  Skyrocketing premiums will create massive disincentives to purchasing \nflood insurance at exactly the time we need to encourage participation. \nAt this time of increased hurricane activity, our efforts should be \nfocused on getting as many people to purchase flood insurance as \npossible, so they will be able to rebuild after a storm and not have \nthose larger costs be spread out to people across the country.\n  Discouraging the purchase of flood insurance would also increase the \nfuture liability of the American taxpayer. Those who flood will be \nunderinsured or have no insurance at all, and they will turn to the \nFederal Government for disaster assistance.\n  Prior to the inception of the National Flood Insurance Program, that \nis exactly what happened year after year after year. After severe \nflooding in the 1950s, Congress established the National Flood \nInsurance Program because there was no private flood insurance and the \nlack of coverage resulted in significant Federal disaster aid payments.\n  The flood program was designed to provide insurance while requiring \nsafer development so people were better protected from nature's wrath. \nAnd while we are now looking at a significant debt, I want to \nunderscore the fact that the flood program has historically been self-\nsustaining, paying claims, for the most part, through premiums.\n\n  Hurricane Katrina, and the storms that followed, devastated the \nentire gulf region and produced flooding unlike any other storm in our \nlifetime. Millions of people were driven from their homes and over \n1,800 people were killed.\n  There was no mechanism in the Federal flood program to pay for the \nlosses of the magnitude experienced in the 2005 storms, so it borrowed \nfunds from the U.S. Treasury to meet those obligations and ensure that \nfamilies in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Alabama could \nrebuild.\n  We are now faced with a choice, to forgive the debt so that flood \ninsurance continues to be available to home and business owners \nthroughout the country or substantially raise premiums on all \npolicyholders, an action which would hurt the very people who are \ntrying desperately to rebuild their lives after these hurricanes. The \nbill before us makes what I believe is the right choice.\n  The second reason this bill is necessary is that it establishes \nfiscally responsible policies to ensure that flood insurance will \ncontinue to be available, while reducing the likelihood that taxpayers \nwould be on the hook for those flood losses. This bill strengthens \nflood insurance so the next time a hurricane hits, whether it be in \nMississippi, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Connecticut, or any other State \nthat borders on our coasts, flood claims can be paid without relying on \ntaxpayer funds across the country.\n  It does this by requiring flood insurance in additional at-risk \nareas, moving the program toward actuarial soundness and requires the \nprogram to build up reserves to pay for losses. These changes will help \nguarantee additional premium income while maintaining affordability for \nmost homeowners.\n  As I also indicated, this bill contains environmentally sound flood \npolicies. These reforms, especially to the flood mapping program, will \nallow communities, homes, and business owners throughout the country to \naccurately assess their flood risk and will encourage responsible and \nenvironmentally friendly development decisions.\n  Communities cannot make decisions to protect fragile areas along our \ncoasts and riverbeds if maps are not accurate and risks are unknown. \nThe\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\nmapping provisions contained in this bill ensure that flood maps will \nbe accurate, up to date, and readily available. No longer should \ncommunities and homes and business owners have to rely on outdated and \ninaccurate information.\n  Senator Reed of Rhode Island is to be commended for his work on the \nmapping provisions of this bill that are critical to the flood \ninsurance program.\n  This is a strong and needed bill which will extend the flood \ninsurance program for 5 additional years, put it in a financial \nposition to be able to continue to make flood insurance available to \nthe millions of families at risk throughout our Nation, while at the \nsame time reducing the risk of taxpayer assistance.\n  I want to take a moment to let my colleagues know of the range of \nsupport for this bill. This is a very diverse and somewhat unique \ncoalition of organizations that has come out in support of this piece \nof legislation. These organizations, I believe, are worth mentioning \nbecause of their diversity.\n  We have the support of the following: The Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, the American Insurance Association, the Council for Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the \nDefenders of Wildlife, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Financial \nServices Roundtable, Freedom Works, Friends of the Earth, the National \nAssociation of Mutual Insurance Companies, the National Wildlife \nFederation, the Property Casualty Insurers of America, the Reinsurance \nAssociation of America, and Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n  That is not normally a coalition you put together around a piece of \nlegislation, covering the financial services industry as well as \nenvironmental groups and consumer groups as well.\n  I commend all of them for working with us, going through the long \nprocess of developing this bill in the way we figure comprehensively \ndeals with this issue. I realize these groups are not normally united \nin the support of a single piece of legislation, but they have all come \nout in favor of a reasonable, balanced approach that we have taken to \nthe flood insurance program.\n  As I said earlier, the substitute amendment we will be offering also \nestablishes a Commission on Natural Catastrophe Risk Management and \nInsurance. There has been a good deal of discussion about adding wind \nand other risks to the flood insurance program. These are arguments \nhard to answer because there is a very strong and legitimate claim to \nbe made.\n  However, it was the judgment of the Banking Committee that while \nthese ideas have merit--and I strongly indicate and support that--they \ndeserve further study so we can understand the implications of what a \nmajor shift would be in this program and how the natural catastrophes \nare insured.\n  To that end, the committee unanimously passed legislation to \nestablish a blue ribbon commission that would in very short order \nexamine the availability and affordability of natural catastrophe \ninsurance and make recommendations posthaste to the Congress and to the \nadministration on whether, how, and to what extent additional Federal \naction in this area would be appropriate. Until we have that \ninformation, I honestly could not stand before my colleagues and give \nthem any idea of the magnitude of the cost of this program. We would \nliterally be in the dark entirely if we tried to expand it. That is not \nto suggest there is not legitimacy to the request. But we ought to deal \nwith it in as thoughtful a manner as we can so we are not here again \nnext year or the year after, once again forgiving debt, trying to come \nup with another program to deal with the result of a massive infusion \nof taxpayers' dollars to deal with disasters with which people are \ncoping. To that end the committee unanimously passed the legislation to \nestablish this commission.\n  What is clear is that millions of Americans, some of whom were \ndevastated by hurricanes, have seen increased premiums and constrained \navailability of insurance. We are all committed to doing everything we \ncan to ensure that people at risk are able to insure their homes and \nbusinesses. We believe this commission will provide the information we \nneed to undertake that effort in a sensible and effective way.\n  I thank Senator Shelby and his staff who worked so closely with us on \nthis bill. Senator Shelby has been a very strong advocate of flood \ninsurance. Under his leadership and chairmanship of the committee, the \nBanking Committee passed a similar bill in the last Congress. I also \nthank Senators Reed of Rhode Island, Bunning, and Carper for their work \non the legislation, particularly on the flood insurance portion. The \nstatus quo on flood insurance is not an option. Families in every State \nrely on flood insurance to rebuild when they are flooded out. The \nnational flood insurance program must be reformed and strengthened. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation so that our constituents \ncan continue to rely on a strong and stable national flood insurance \nprogram.\n  I urge colleagues who have amendments and ideas to offer to this \nlegislation to please let us know of these ideas immediately so we can \nconsider them and put them in a proper order for consideration when we \nresume consideration of the legislation tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the managers' \namendment. It is a bill that combines the Flood Insurance Reform Act of \n2008 with the Catastrophic Commission Act of 2008 that Senator Dodd has \njust outlined. Senator Dodd and I worked very closely to develop this \nimportant legislation in the Banking Committee, which the Senate \nBanking Committee, by the way, unanimously passed last year.\n  The legislation places the national flood insurance program on a \nstronger financial footing because it requires those living and working \nin areas vulnerable to flooding to assume more of the financial risk, \nas it should be. The bill also addresses many other structural and \nfiscal weaknesses in the program itself.\n  In addition, the managers' amendment creates a commission to study \nthe current market for catastrophic insurance. The results of this \ncommission should provide Congress with a factual basis for future \nlegislative action, if we deem it necessary.\n  To fully appreciate the need for significant reform of the national \nflood insurance program, we must first consider the program's history. \nThe flood insurance program was established in the Congress in 1968 to \nprovide policyholders with some insurance for flood-related damage. The \nintent of the program was to generate enough revenue through premium \ndollars to prevent taxpayers from paying for flood-related losses \nduring an average flood loss year. At the inception of this program, \nCongress included explicit subsidies for business properties and homes \nknown as preflood insurance rate map or pre-FIRM structures. It was \ndetermined that it was not fair for the owners of such structures \nimmediately to pay actuarial prices because they received no notice \nregarding the new mandatory purchase rules.\n  That said, it was also believed that many, if not all, of the pre-\nFIRM structures would quickly become ineligible for the subsidies. For \nthis reason, Congress never included a subsidy elimination mechanism. \nThis oversight has had significant financial consequences for the \ncurrent flood insurance program.\n  More than 40 years later, a large number of these properties still \nreceive explicit subsidies. Many of these properties have made the \ngreatest claims on the program after suffering repetitive losses. In \nfact, the Congressional Budget Office has valued the explicit subsidy \nfor grandfathered homes at $1.3 billion per year. There are other key \nfactors beyond the poorly designed financial structure of the program \nthat need to be addressed. For example, the size of the program has \nexpanded exponentially since its inception. In 1978, 10 years after the \nprogram started, the program had 1.4 million policyholders and $50 \nbillion in risk exposure. Today there are more than 5 million \npolicyholders and over $1 trillion in risk exposure.\n  Finally, the maps used to determine the rates for the program are \nlargely out of date just about everywhere. Antiquated maps do not \nrepresent accurately the risk that covered structures face.\n  Without up-to-date maps and, hence, an accurate risk assessment, \nprice is\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\nsimply reduced to guesswork. Often these guesses have been too low, and \nthe taxpayers have been forced to make up the difference, oftentimes to \nvery wealthy people. This program currently generates $3 billion in \npremiums, spends roughly $1 billion on administration, and has a \nliability exposure of more than $1 trillion. Let me repeat that. The \nprogram has a liability exposure of more than $1 trillion. In fact, the \nfinancial deficiencies of the program are so great that the Government \nAccountability Office placed it on a list of high-risk programs because \nit does not generate enough money to cover its liabilities.\n  Furthermore, Robert Hunter, who is recognized as one of the key \nindividuals in getting the program started, has stated:\n\n       The integrity of the program [must be] restored . . . [or] \n     consideration must be given to ending this . . . hopelessly \n     administered program.\n\n  Mr. Hunter was with the Consumer Federation of America for many \nyears. Mr. Hunter's prescription for restoring the program's integrity \nis requiring greater mitigation efforts and moving toward actuarial \nsoundness. This is what we have attempted to do today.\n  I recognize that reforming the flood insurance program presents the \nCongress with difficult choices. We could end the program, we could \ndramatically increase fees on program beneficiaries, or we could do \nnothing. Each of those choices would be unacceptable. That is why \nSenator Dodd and I have crafted a bill that addresses what we believe \nare the most significant financial weaknesses of the program without \ndismantling its core features. We struck a realistic balance between \nthe needs of the program's beneficiaries and the taxpayers on the hook \nfor the program's shortfalls.\n  The legislation before us strengthens the program by immediately \neliminating subsidies on vacation homes, businesses, and severe \nrepetitive-loss properties. It then paves the way for eliminating all \nsubsidies in the future. It proceeds in such a way, however, that \nrecognizes immediate elimination of all subsidies is not prudent \nbecause flood maps will not be updated for some time.\n\n  To address the mapping deficiencies, the bill creates stringent \nstandards that the program must use to complete the map modernization \nprocess. Once we have the most accurate and up-to-date flood mapping \npossible, homeowners will better understand and mitigate their risks.\n  The program will also transition to more accurate pricing. In \naddition to eliminating subsidies, the bill requires State-chartered \nlending institutions to maintain flood insurance coverage for all \nmortgages located within the 100-year flood plain. It increases \nenforcement tools available to bank regulators at both the Federal and \nState levels by requiring escrow of flood insurance premiums throughout \nthe life of the mortgage. The civil monetary penalties that regulators \nmay levy against lenders for failure to comply are also increased. The \nbill creates a mandatory reserve fund to cover the cost of unusual \nevents. This provision is intended to limit future reliance on the \nAmerican taxpayer. The bill requires a rulemaking to ensure that the \n``write your own'' carriers are being reimbursed solely for their \nexpenses.\n  Finally, the legislation creates a commission that Senator Dodd \noutlined earlier to study the effects of natural disasters on our \ninsurance system. The commission must report its findings within 9 \nmonths.\n  Some have suggested that we should add wind insurance coverage to the \nalready bankrupt Federal flood insurance program. I remind my \ncolleagues of certain facts: The Insurance Information Institute \nestimates that by adding wind as a covered peril, the program will take \non an additional $14 to $19 trillion worth of risk exposure. In \naddition, a Towers-Perrin report indicates that adding wind coverage to \nthe flood program could lead to an additional annual program deficit as \nhigh as $1 billion.\n  Both of these studies point out exactly why we should have a complete \nunderstanding of all of the facts before we even contemplate expanding \nthe Federal Government's role as an insurance provider.\n  Before I conclude, I will take a moment to recognize Senator Bunning \nfor all of his efforts to reform this program for the past several \nyears. As Senator Dodd did, I also recognize Senator Jack Reed of Rhode \nIsland and his staff for their efforts to create accurate and up-to-\ndate flood maps which are essential for this program in the future. \nLastly, I thank my colleague, Senator Dodd, chairman of the committee, \nand his staff for their efforts in crafting this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I repeat something I said earlier: Reform of the program involves \ntough choices. We must make these tough choices, however, if this \nprogram is going to survive. For the good of the program beneficiaries \nand the taxpayer, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, this week the Senate will consider the \nreauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program. Today, I have \nfiled an amendment to this reauthorization legislation which is of \ncritical need, not only to the gulf coast but to the entire country. My \namendment would add a multiple peril insurance provision to create a \nnew option in the National Flood Insurance Program of offering coverage \nof both wind and flood risk in one policy.\n  The proposal would require premiums for this new coverage to be risk-\nbased and actuarially sound, so that the program would be required to \npay for itself. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated \nthat the multiple peril program:\n\n        . . . would increase premium receipts and additional \n     claims payments by about the same amount--resulting in no \n     significant net budgetary impact.\n\n  By covering wind and flood risk in one policy, the multiple peril \noption would allow coastal homeowners to buy insurance and know that \nhurricane damage would be covered regardless of whether that damage is \ncaused by wind or water.\n  It has been just over 2\\1/2\\ years since Hurricane Katrina hit the \ngulf coast with its 30-foot storm surge and winds over 125 miles an \nhour. Katrina was the most devastating natural disaster ever to hit \nNorth America.\n  The people of Mississippi and Louisiana have made great progress in \nrebuilding the communities along the gulf coast. Everyone knows the \nFederal Government's response was not perfect, but the Government and \nthis Congress have done a lot to help to rebuild communities, homes, \nbusinesses, and lives along the gulf coast.\n  As much as the Government and this Congress have done, there is still \nmore work to be done. There are still too many destroyed homes left \nuninhabited, too many slabs of concrete that represent all that is left \nof what used to be homes and businesses. A major contributing factor to \nthis problem is the cost and availability of insurance. Since the day I \nbecame a Member of this body, the cost of insurance has become an issue \nI continually hear about. As I stated in my maiden speech, if you can't \ninsure it, you can't build it or finance it. It is that simple. The \nproblem is harming the efforts of small businesses to rebuild and grow \nand succeed, and it is driving rental rates beyond affordability. It is \nincreasing the cost of home ownership and, in many cases, making it \nimpossible for people who lost their homes to Katrina to rebuild.\n  Congress needs to act to find a workable solution to this problem, \nand the National Flood Insurance Program reauthorization gives us an \nopportunity to do so. I say this not only for the good of the people of \nMississippi and Louisiana but also for every single American taxpayer \nand for every person who lives along the American coastline.\n  This is not just an issue for the gulf coast. From Bar Harbor, ME, to \nBrownsville, TX, millions of Americans live on a coastline in the path \nof future hurricanes. As the Biloxi Sun Herald noted this week in an \neditorial in support of my amendment:\n\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\n\n       More than half of the Nation's population lives within 50 \n     miles of a coastline, and 50 miles is well within harm's way \n     when a major storm makes landfall.\n\n  We have not always had a national flood insurance program. In 1968, \nCongress was forced to act to address the problems associated with \nflooding from hurricanes. Now the same problem that led to the National \nFlood Insurance Program is happening with wind. As it did in the past, \nCongress needs to act to address the problem. The National Flood \nInsurance Program was created because insurance companies quit offering \ncoverage for flood damage caused by hurricanes. With competing wind and \nflood policies, the same has happened to wind insurance in these same \nareas.\n  Wind versus water--that is the debate which still occurs today in \ncourtrooms on the Mississippi gulf coast between insurance companies \nand storm victims. It is a debate that necessitated the multibillion-\ndollar supplemental appropriations package this body approved after \nKatrina. Unless Congress changes the law, the wind versus water debate \nwill result in a multibillion-dollar supplemental appropriations \npackage after the next big hurricane wherever in the United States it \nmay land. This is driving more and more homeowners and business owners \ninto a State-sponsored wind pool, which is required to provide \ncoverage. But this is not a reasonable long-term solution because too \nmuch risk is being placed in too small of a pool. What was initially \nconceived to be the last resort has now become the only resort for many \nMississippians living along the gulf coast. The reality is that State \nwind pools, especially in my home State of Mississippi, are unable to \nspread the risk to balance the claims.\n  As the Government Accountability Office has pointed out, these \ncompeting wind and flood policies provide a conflict of interest in \ndetermining who is responsible to pay these claims. The flood insurance \ncompanies say it was wind. The wind insurance companies say just the \nopposite. Because of this, my constituents on the gulf coast are paying \nthousands of dollars to the State wind pool. That doesn't count flood \ninsurance or homeowners insurance on top of that.\n  The picture I am painting here is quite clear: The unaffordability of \ninsurance is driving people from their homes.\n  Some of my colleagues may point out that every homeowner can purchase \nwind insurance. I would argue that, as a practical matter, they cannot. \nAs I mentioned before, this is not just a Mississippi problem, nor is \nit just a gulf coast problem. For instance, in Massachusetts, since \n2003, 10 insurance companies have dropped homeowner coverage in the \nCape Cod coastal area. This affects approximately 44,000 homeowners in \nMassachusetts. The Massachusetts State insurance backstop is now \ninsuring 44 percent of the market.\n  I hope my colleagues from the following States, in addition to \nMississippi and Louisiana and Massachusetts, will pay attention to this \ndebate. States such as New York, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, \nFlorida, Alabama, and Texas have all experienced the same problem. In \nNorth Carolina, for example, the State insurance plan known as the \n``BEACH Plan'' saw its liability increase over 260 percent in just 4 \nyears. I assure you, I would prefer that the private market write these \npolicies, but this simply is not happening. Every day, more and more \nliability is being thrust upon the shoulders of the States.\n\n  To help address this problem, the best solution available is to allow \nhomeowners to purchase wind and flood insurance coverage in the same \npolicy. This would spread the risk outside of defined State borders and \nwould ensure available, affordable, and total insurance for coastal \nhomeowners. That is exactly what my multiple peril insurance amendment \ndoes.\n  Multiple peril insurance will allow property owners to buy both wind \nand flood coverage from the National Flood Insurance Program. \nResidential coverage would be $500,000 for structures and $150,000 for \ncontents and the loss of use. For nonresidential, it would be $1 \nmillion for structures and $750,000 for contents and business \ninterruption.\n  Under this amendment, property owners would be able to buy insurance \nand know in advance that hurricane damage would be covered without \ndisputes over the cause of damage. No longer would home and business \nowners have to go to court to try to prove it was either wind or it was \nwater that destroyed their property.\n  The premiums for this new single coverage would be risk-based and \nactuarially sound, according to the terms of my legislation. The CBO \nhas agreed that the program will, over the long run, pay for itself.\n  Windstorm insurance would be available under my amendment only where \nlocal governments adopt and enforce the international building code or \nequivalent building standards. This Federal multiple peril program will \nspread risk geographically to form a stable insurance pool, compared to \nState pools that cover only a small area.\n  Again, I state this issue doesn't just impact the gulf coast. It \nimpacts most directly the 55 percent of our country's population that \nlives within 50 miles of a hurricane-prone coastline.\n  Beyond that, however, this is a good-government issue that affects \nevery single taxpayer. Multiple peril coverage would also protect the \ntaxpayers by saving them from having to pay for another giant emergency \nrelief package the next time a hurricane hits. It is not a question of \nif but when it happens and, I might add, where it happens again.\n  With the legislation before us, the reauthorization of the National \nFlood Insurance Program, we have been provided an opportunity to take \naction to begin to correct this inequality. I believe my multiple peril \namendment is a good start.\n  I realize there are several philosophies about solving the coastal \ninsurance crisis, and I am not wedded to any single approach. I would \nsimply point out that this amendment has already been adopted by the \nHouse of Representatives in an amendment offered by my friend and \nformer colleague, Representative Gene Taylor of Mississippi. What I am \ncommitted to is providing my constituents relief before the next \nhurricane hits. I do not believe Congress should take over the entire \nprivate market of all insurance. I believe in free market principles, \nand I believe Congress should look seriously at the State-by-State rate \nregulatory structure that forces insurers to set their rates on the \nbasis of geographical boundaries within individual States in which they \nare admitted to do business. I believe Congress should consider other \nthoughtful proposals such as the one being advanced by the St. Paul \nTravelers Insurance Company, which would allow limited rate regulation \nrelief for the purpose of creation of a coastal band. This is simply \none of a number of good ideas that deserve consideration. But the \nstatus quo does not work, and that is what we have an opportunity to \ncorrect this week.\n  Some of my colleagues will argue against my amendment for a number of \nwhat they see as problems. Very seldom is legislation error-free or \nexactly correct at the outset, and my amendment is no different. We \nshould not, however, let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n  I ask my colleagues to remember all of the places along the coast of \nNorth America and perhaps invite them again to visit Hancock County, in \nmy State of Mississippi, ground zero, where Katrina made landfall, and \nsee for themselves why action is needed now and why we should not miss \nthis opportunity on the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance \nProgram.\n  This amendment is badly needed. At the appropriate time during \nconsideration of amendments, I will urge my colleagues to adopt the \namendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to support the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Mississippi. The amendment of Senator \nWicker will benefit not only constituents in Mississippi but anyone who \nlives in the path of future hurricanes.\n  Two-and-a-half years ago, the most devastating natural disaster in \nthe history of our country, Hurricane Katrina, made landfall on the \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama coasts. The devastation that was \ncaused was indescribable.\n  The people of our State have made significant and impressive progress \ntoward recovery since that fateful day, August 29, 2005, but there is \nstill much\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nwork to be done. There are far too many vacant lots and empty slabs \nthat remain around our gulf coast for our recovery to be considered \ncomplete.\n  Mississippians are appreciative of the assistance the Federal \nGovernment has provided to aid in their recovery from Hurricane \nKatrina. However, a significant additional opportunity to assist that \nrecovery will have been lost if the issue of affordable wind insurance \nis not addressed.\n  One of the most significant impediments to the recovery of the \nMississippi gulf coast is the availability of affordable homeowners \ninsurance. There are many coastal residents who simply cannot afford to \ninsure their homes, and homes cannot be rebuilt until they have secured \ninsurance.\n  One of the most expensive components of these homeowners insurance \npremiums is coverage for damage caused by wind.\n  Most coastal Mississippians are currently being forced to buy their \nwind coverage from the State-run wind pool. This wind pool is necessary \nbecause the private insurance industry has largely discontinued selling \nwind policies in these coastal communities.\n  So a program that was designed as an insurer of last resort has \nbecome the only available option. Those who are able to buy coverage \nfrom this State wind pool have found their premiums increased \ndramatically over the last 2 years.\n  Unfortunately, this is a shortsighted solution. There is simply too \nmuch risk, in too small of a pool, concentrated into a small geographic \narea. This is not a problem that is unique to Mississippi. Most State \nwind pools face the same problem of not being able to spread the risk \nwide enough to avoid an overwhelming loss in the event of a significant \nhurricane.\n  I wish to be clear. This is not only an amendment for those who were \nimpacted by Hurricane Katrina. This amendment would benefit millions of \nAmericans who live on our vast coastlines and face the potential of a \nfuture catastrophic hurricane.\n  This amendment would allow homeowners to buy insurance and know in \nadvance of the storm that they will be covered without a prolonged \ndispute over whether the damage was caused by wind or water.\n  This wind coverage will be available only where local governments \nenforce strict building standards to minimize future loss. The premiums \nfor this coverage would be actuarially sound and would not expose the \nFederal Government to undue financial risk.\n  A great deal of thought has gone into my recommendation of this \namendment. I urge a vote in support of the amendment. If private \ninsurers or the State-run wind pools could adequately address this \nproblem, then I would not as vigorously advocate the Federal Government \nexpanding its role in the business of insurance.\n  But Senator Wicker's amendment provides the best available solution \nfor this very serious problem.\n  As the 2008 hurricane season approaches, I believe we should not miss \nthis opportunity to address this growing problem. The Wicker amendment \nprovides us with the best opportunity to make certain affordable wind \ninsurance is available for those living near our coastlines.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey pertaining to the introduction of S. 2980 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CASEY. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been very patient today. I so wanted \nto come to the floor, after the FAA bill was destroyed, wiped out by \nthe Republicans not letting us go to that legislation, one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation we could deal with. The reason I had to \ncalm myself down, I listened to a number of Republican Senators say: \nWell, if we could have offered amendments. I did everything I could to \nallow people to offer amendments: Agree to a list of amendments; could \nwe see your amendment; we will take down the tree; we will do anything \nyou want; offer amendments.\n  Finally, I spoke to one of the Republican leaders. I said: It is \nobvious the only reason you are not supporting this is because of the \nNew York money, the final installment of the $20 billion promised the \ncity of New York, the State of New York, by the President of the United \nStates, George Bush. I said: It is in the President's budget.\n  One of the Republican leaders said: We still oppose it.\n  Then, if that were not enough, we now come to an important piece of \nlegislation, flood insurance. This is a result of what happened in \nKatrina and the other devastating floods we have had in this country in \nrecent years. Insurance companies have gone broke. Individual companies \nhave gone broke. Individual homeowners have suffered significantly. So \nafter months of working on this piece of legislation on a bipartisan \nbasis--Senators Dodd and Shelby are the ones who worked to get the bill \nhere--we bring the bill to the floor. We file cloture on a motion to \nproceed so we can start offering amendments. It passes 90 to 1. We have \nbeen waiting since 3 o'clock today to start legislating. People are \nwaiting to offer amendments. I can't imagine how the Republicans can \nsleep at night, stopping this country from legislating on most \nimportant issues. They act as if it is not important. So in the morning \nI am going to come here, and we are going to ask consent if we can \nstart legislating on this bill, or do we have to wait until 9 o'clock \ntomorrow night until the 30 hours runs out before we can start \nlegislating on flood insurance. We are going to finish flood insurance \nthis week. If we have to work Thursday night, Friday, Saturday, and \nSunday, we are going to finish this bill.\n  People will have an opportunity to offer amendments. Maybe they can't \nstart offering amendments until 9 o'clock tomorrow night, but if that \nis the case, then we are going to start working at 9 o'clock tomorrow \nnight so people can offer their amendments, because tomorrow is \nWednesday. We wasted all day today not being able to offer amendments. \nI am told there are only a couple amendments people want to offer--\nthree or four. It is an issue of whether this legislation should \ninclude also wind. That is an issue we can debate and vote on. But we \nare going to make a decision sometime tomorrow as to when we file \ncloture, whether we do it Thursday and have a Saturday cloture vote, do \nit tomorrow and have a Friday cloture vote. We are going to finish this \nbill this week.\n  We have so much to do. We have the farm conference coming. We have \nthe consumer product safety conference coming. We have to do the \nbudget. We have the supplemental appropriations bill and a number of \nother measures we have to do.\n  I hope we can start moving to allow people to offer amendments. It \nseems not a very good legislative process dictated by the minority, the \nRepublicans, when you pass something 90 to 1, and they still hold it \nup.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3784-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

VANDERGRIFT\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service and \nsacrifice of Marine 1Lt Matthew Vandergrift, of Littleton, CO. \nLieutenant Vandergrift was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 10th Marine \nRegiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, out of \nCamp Lajeune, NC. He was recently killed in Basra, Iraq, by a bomb that \nexploded near his humvee. He was 28 years old.\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\n  Those who knew Matthew Vandergrift describe him as a true patriot, \ncommitted to his country, his family, his friends, and to helping those \naround him. He was full of energy and laughter, and was always looking \nfor the next adventure.\n  Matthew grew up in Austin, TX, and attended Texas A University, \nwhere he graduated with honors in 2005. He was a member of the Corps of \nCadets and Naval ROTC at Texas A, majored in international business, \nand had a 4.0 grade point average.\n  When he became a marine in 2005, Matthew joined a proud family \ntradition of military service. His father was a major in the Marine \nCorps, his younger brother Barrett is an Air Force helicopter pilot, \nand his great uncle was GEN Alexander Vandergrift, a World War II Medal \nof Honor recipient and the 18th Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  When he was killed, Lieutenant Vandergrift was in the middle of a \nyear-long deployment that began last August. Tasked with helping train \nIraqi security forces, his team of four marines lived and patrolled \ntogether with 50 Iraqis. They were performing sweeps in Basra in an \nattempt to calm violence, root out pockets of insurgents, and stand up \nan Iraqi unit that could take charge of the security responsibilities \nin the area. It was a dangerous mission in one of the most dangerous \nplaces in Iraq. But it was also a vital mission, and one that demanded \nthe smarts, courage, and character for which Lieutenant Vandegrift was \nknown.\n  Each of our men and women in uniform is a patriot--they stand up at \nthe call of their country and assume the task of service. But Matthew \nVandergrift was also a patriot in a broader sense. Frances Wright, one \nof America's most famous lecturers, reminds us that patriotism is not \nsimply one's love and dedication to country. Patriotism, she observes, \nis a virtue that characterizes an individual's commitment to the public \ngood, to the preference of the interests of the many to the interests \nof the few, and to the love of liberty. ``A patriot,'' she told an \nIndiana crowd on July 4, 1828, ``is a useful member of society, capable \nof enlarging all minds and bettering all hearts with which he comes in \ncontact; a useful member of the human family, capable of establishing \nfundamental principles and of merging his own interests, those of his \nassociates, and those of his nation in the interests of the human \nrace.''\n  We cannot count the hearts that Lieutenant Vandergrift touched nor \nthe lives he bettered--that knowledge rests in the memories of those \nwho knew him and served with him--but we may hope to emulate his model \nof patriotism. It is no easy task. It is rare that a man puts himself \non the line for his country and for those with whom he served with such \ncourage, with such heart, and with such a smile, as Matthew.\n  Lieutenant Matthew Vandergrift's stature in life is matched only by \nthe depth of his sacrifice--and the void he leaves behind. To Matthew's \nfamily, I know no words that can ease the pain of losing a son or a \nbrother. I hope that in time you will find consolation in the pride you \nmust feel for Matthew's service and for the joy he brought to all who \nknew him. He was a patriot and a hero. His country will always honor \nhis sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3785-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CELEBRATING NATIONAL SALVATION ARMY WEEK\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to share my enthusiasm for a \ncelebration that is soon to take place across America, National \nSalvation Army Week. The Salvation Army has been serving and enriching \nAmerican communities for over 125 years. Since 1954, when President \nEisenhower declared the first National Salvation Army Week, local units \nand State divisions have used this time to celebrate the charitable \nwork they have accomplished and call attention to forthcoming projects. \nIt is a time of heightened activism for the organization and its \nmembers. But this week is also an opportunity, a chance for us to thank \nthe corps' members for the wonderful gifts of servanthood and \nvolunteerism they have shown.\n  I recognize the many lives the Salvation Army has touched through its \nimportant work, and I am deeply thankful for the men and women who \noffer their time and energy in realization of its cause.\n  Furthermore, I am especially pleased to note that several Indiana \ncommunities will be host to their own festivities in honor of this \noccasion.\n  In Chesterton, IN, a public concert will be held on Saturday, May 17, \nwith a performance by the Chicago Brass Band. In Bloomington, \ninterested parties will be able to partake in ``Donut Day'' on May 13 \nand a family Block Party on May 15. Columbus, IN, will fly the \nSalvation Army flag over its city hall for the entire week. \nIndianapolis will witness a ``Ramp to Camp'' fundraiser organized to \nsend at-risk youth to summer camps. Fort Wayne-based Salvation Army \nvolunteers will hold a Thank-a-Thon. New Albany, IN, will be the site \nof several open house events. The list continues; these are just a few \nof the many noteworthy events that I am confident will be a time of joy \nand fellowship for participants.\n  I hope you will join me in extending best wishes and fine weather \nupon all those involved in this year's National Salvation Army Week, \nMay 11 to 17.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3785-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3785-S3786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AGRICULTURAL TEMPORARY WORKERS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, every spring season brings many demands \non the time of farmers and ranchers in my home State of Wyoming.\n  They are busy tending to their livestock, newly born calves and \nlambs, and planting their crops. Many of them rely on the H-2A program \nto find seasonal and temporary skilled workers to assist them in their \ntime-honored work.\n  This program is vital to Wyoming's agricultural industry. That is why \nI joined my friend Senator Enzi in asking the Department of Labor to \nextend the public comment period on its proposed rule changes to the \nprogram.\n  Many Wyoming employers have not had an opportunity to fully review \nthe proposed changes. I recognize that improvement in the program is \nneeded. We must improve its efficiency for both workers and employers.\n  Recently, there was a very thoughtful editorial which was printed in \nthe Wyoming Livestock Roundup on April 12.\n  The editorial was written by Bryce Reece. Bryce is the executive \nvice-president of the Wyoming Woolgrowers Association and I believe he \ndoes a terrific job of summing up the feelings of all Wyoming farmers \nand ranchers.\n  I recommend it to my colleagues and ask that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Comment Quickly on Immigration Reform\n\n                            (By Bryce Reece)\n\n       Apparently frustrated with Congress and its lack of action \n     regarding our immigration laws, the Bush administration has \n     decided to reform some aspects of our system \n     administratively.\n       On Feb. 13 the Department of Labor (DOL) issued a 47-page \n     proposal to amend regulations regarding nonimmigrant workers \n     employed in temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs. \n     Contractual enforcement of nonimmigrant workers and employer \n     responsibilities are also addressed. These proposed changes \n     would supposedly ``re-engineer'' the process by which \n     employers may obtain temporary labor certification from the \n     DOL for use in petitioning the Department of Homeland \n     Security (DHS) to employ a nonimmigrant worker in H-2A \n     (agricultural temporary worker) status.\n       Workers from outside the U.S. are not only vital to Wyoming \n     and the nation's sheep industry, but are becoming \n     increasingly important to all of Wyoming's livestock \n     industry. As importantly, they are vital to all of U.S. \n     agriculture. As the DOL noted in its proposal, ``Data from \n     the National Agricultural Worker Survey (NAWS) . . . shows \n     that in 2006, 19 percent of all agricultural workers were \n     first-time U.S. farm workers.'' Among the new workers, 85 \n     percent were foreign-born and 15 percent were U.S. citizens. \n     A new worker is defined as anyone with less than a year's \n     experience.\n       Legally bringing in workers from outside of the United \n     States is a laborious, tedious, time-consuming and expensive \n     proposition. This statement has become increasingly true \n     since 9/11. Increased and heightened security has made the \n     process a bureaucratic and administrative maze, one that many \n     employers are on the verge of abandoning. Faced with the \n     increased difficulty of compliance, smothering and draining \n     regulations and a seemingly endless parade of federal \n     bureaucrats throwing up roadblocks, it's hard for people in \n     the countryside trying to run a business and do things right.\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\n       A lack of U.S. workers interested in or seeking employment \n     in agriculture has compounded the problem. While those in \n     agriculture have seemed to be ``crying in the wilderness'' \n     about this worker shortage, some have been listening. Senator \n     Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) recently highlighted the unique \n     labor needs of agriculture and the importance of foreign \n     labor in a September 2006 floor statement: ``We have one \n     million people who usually work in agriculture. I must tell \n     you they are dominantly undocumented. Senator Craig pointed \n     out the reason they are undocumented is because American \n     workers will not do the jobs. When I started this I did not \n     believe it, so we called all the welfare departments of the \n     major agriculture counties in California and asked--can you \n     provide agricultural workers? Not one worker came from the \n     people who were on welfare who were willing to do this kind \n     of work.''\n       The program, which is most commonly used in Wyoming for \n     bringing in foreign workers, is called the ``H-2A Program.'' \n     The H-2A worker visa program provides a means for U.S. \n     agricultural employers to hire foreign workers on a temporary \n     basis. They fill a labor niche that cannot be met in the U.S. \n     The H-2A program is vital to the western sheep industry; \n     and, it is the H-2A program that has become a nightmare \n     for agricultural producers looking to bring foreign \n     workers to the U.S. legally. It is the H-2A program that \n     the DOL is proposing to modify and ``fix.''\n       Senator Larry Craig (R-Idaho) summarized the problem this \n     way: ``[T]his economic sector, more than any other, has \n     become dependent for its existence on the labor of immigrants \n     who are here without legal documentation. The only program \n     currently in place to respond to a lack of legal domestic \n     agricultural workers, the H-2A guest worker program, is \n     profoundly broken. Outside of H-2A, farm employers have no \n     effective, reliable assurance that their employees are legal. \n     We all want and need a stable, predictable, legal workforce \n     in American agriculture. Willing American workers deserve a \n     system that puts them first in line for available jobs with \n     fair market wages. All workers should receive decent \n     treatment and protection of fundamental legal rights. \n     Consumers deserve a safe, stable, domestic food supply. \n     American citizens and taxpayers deserve secure borders and a \n     government that works. Last year, we saw millions of dollars' \n     worth of produce rot in the fields for lack of workers. We \n     are beginning to hear talk of farms moving out of the \n     country, moving to the foreign workforce. All Americans face \n     the danger of losing more and more of our safe, domestic food \n     supply to imports. Time is running out for American \n     agriculture, farm workers, and consumers. What was a problem \n     years ago is a crisis today and will be a catastrophe if we \n     do not act immediately.''\n       In the proposal out for comment, DOL claims its purpose in \n     re-engineering the H-2A program and the resulting outcomes \n     will be:\n       Simplify the process by which employers obtain a labor \n     certification.\n       Increase employer accountability to further protect against \n     violations of program and worker standards.\n       Efficiencies in program administration that will \n     significantly encourage increased program participation, \n     resulting in an increased legal farm worker labor.\n       U.S. workers will be better protected from adverse effects \n     when they are competing with workers who are legally present \n     in the U.S. and who are subject to all of the requirements of \n     the H2-A program.\n       Institute a new auditing process to verify that employers \n     have, in fact, met their responsibilities under the H2-A \n     program.\n       Alter the current H2-A housing inspection procedures.\n       The devil is always in the details, however, and we have \n     identified several areas within the proposed changes where \n     more harm than good could occur. Several agricultural groups \n     have joined forces to analyze and prepare comments on these \n     proposed changes.\n       The WWGA is asking all agriculture supporters and \n     particularly employers who currently, or may in the future, \n     utilize the H-2A program, to comment. Comments can be \n     submitted electronically, which is the quickest and least \n     expensive method.\n       For those wishing to secure a copy of the proposed changes, \n     they can be found at http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/\ncomponent/main?main=DocketDetail=ETA-2008-0001 (click on \n     one of the icons in the first row under ``views'').\n       With comments due on a very short timeline, April 14, we \n     have posted helpful information including sample comments on \n     our website at www.wyowool.org. Diane Carpenter in our office \n     and I would also be glad to answer questions from those \n     submitting comments on this tremendously important effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3786-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, please join me as we celebrate Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month this May.\n  Asian Pacific American Heritage Month was originally established as \nAsian Pacific American Heritage Week in 1977 by a congressional \nresolution. In 1992, Congress expanded the week into a month to \nrecognize the countless contributions that Asian Pacific Islander \nAmericans have made to our country.\n  The month of May is significant to the Asian and Pacific Islander \nAmerican, APIA, community because it coincides with two important \nmilestones in APIA history: the arrival of the first Japanese \nimmigrants to the U.S., in May of 1843, and the contributions of \nChinese workers toward building the transcontinental railroad, which \nwas completed in May of 1869.\n  The APIA community is one of the fastest growing populations in the \nUnited States. With nearly 15 million residents and growing, APIAs \ncontribute greatly to every aspect of life in America, just as they \nhave throughout our history.\n  This year's Asian Pacific American Heritage Month theme is \n``Leadership, Diversity, Harmony--Gateway to Success.'' As the Senator \nfrom California, which has 5 million APIA residents, I am working hard \nto address the many issues of importance to the APIA community, such as \nhuman rights, immigration reform, education, and health care.\n  As the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East \nAsian and Pacific Affairs, I have been working on issues such as peace \nand stability in East Asia and the Pacific, human rights issues, \nenvironmental protection, and the economy.\n  I hope you visit my Asian Pacific American Heritage Month web feature \nto learn more about how the APIA community has shaped our Nation's \nhistory. I hope that you will find this information useful and that you \nwill celebrate the rich diversity that is America's greatest strength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3786-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3786-S3787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               CELEBRATING SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS BASEBALL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 50th anniversary of the San Francisco Giants in San \nFrancisco, CA.\n  After relocating from New York to San Francisco, San Francisco Giants \npitcher Ruben Gomez threw the historic first pitch from the mound at \nSeals Stadium in San Francisco on April 15, 1958 and 23,448 \nenthusiastic fans watched the Giants defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers 8-0 on \nthat special day 50 years ago. San Francisco was now home to a part of \nour national pastime.\n  After two seasons at Seals Stadium, the Giants moved to Candlestick \nPark in 1960. Home to the Giants for 40 seasons, Candlestick Park is \nlocated on the San Francisco Bay and carried the reputation for being \none of the coldest, windiest, and foggiest ball parks in all the \ncountry. Despite these less than favorable playing conditions, \nCandlestick Park stood strong on one of the most frightening days in \nSan Francisco history: October 17, 1989. Candlestick Park was packed \nwith 62,000 fans before Game 3 of the 1989 Bay Bridge Series between \nthe San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics, when the 7.1 Loma \nPrieta earthquake struck. Thankfully, Candlestick Park withstood the \ntrembler and no one in attendance was injured.\n  In 2000, the Giants left Candlestick Park and relocated to the brand \nnew Pacific Bell Park in downtown San Francisco. Now known as AT \nPark, the classically designed ballpark offers picturesque views of the \ncity and bay. Today, the home of the San Francisco Giants is widely \nregarded as one of America's most beautiful stadiums.\n  In their first 50 years in San Francisco, the Giants have been a \nmodel of excellence on the field. In addition to capturing three \nNational League pennants, several members of the National Baseball Hall \nof Fame have donned the trademark orange and black colors of the \nGiants: Willie Mays, Juan Marichal, Orlando Cepeda, Gaylord Perry and \nWillie McCovey. The San Francisco Giants have been a great source of \nentertainment and pride to their legion of loyal fans over the past \nhalf century.\n  In addition to their achievements on the field, the San Francisco \nGiants baseball club is also committed to serving their community \nthrough a variety of community service programs. From the Giants \nCommunity Fund,\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nwhich supports summer baseball leagues for low-income children \nthroughout northern California, to the ``Read to Win'' program which \nencourages children to keep reading throughout the summer months, the \nSan Francisco Giants baseball club is actively assisting baseball fans \nand their families throughout northern California.\n  I congratulate the San Francisco Giants on their many accomplishments \nover the past 50 years in San Francisco. I send my best wishes for \ntheir next 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3787-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF DOVER AIR FORCE BASE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I congratulate Dover Air \nForce Base and all the men and women who serve there for winning the \nCommander In Chief's Installation Excellence Award for 2008.\n  This prestigious award honors military installations for their \noutstanding service and dedication, and exemplary support of their \nmissions. In the 23 years that this award has been given, Dover Air \nForce Base is the first Air Mobility Command to ever win this award.\n  This is a great honor not only for Dover Air Force Base, but for all \nof us in Delaware who are enormously proud of the base and all the \ndedicated men and women who serve there.\n  This highly coveted award recognizes the excellent working, living \nand recreational facilities for those men, women and families stationed \nat the base.\n  For Dover and for Delaware this means winning it all, like winning \nthe Super Bowl or winning the NCAA championship. It is like a home run \nwith the bases loaded. I could not be more pleased or proud of the men \nand women serving at Dover.\n  I am honored that our Delaware facility serves as a national example \nof how quality installations enable better mission performance and \nenhance the quality of life for military men and women and their \nfamilies by providing quality working, housing and recreational \nconditions.\n  I would also like to recognize the other winners of this year's \naward: Fort A.P. Hill, Bowling Green, VA; Marine Corps Base, Camp \nPendleton, San Diego, CA; Naval Base Coronado, San Diego, CA; and \nDefense Supply Center Richmond, Richmond, VA.\n  Once again, it is my honor to congratulate the men and women of Dover \nAir Force Base for their service and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3787-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN HONOR OF DETECTIVE RONALD GARLAND\n\n Mr. CARPER.

His great efforts ultimately lead to the prosecutions of \nthese culprits in Federal court.\n  Detective Garland's concern for the children in our community and his \nwillingness to go above and beyond the call of duty has garnered our \ngreat respect and admiration.\n  I salute Detective Garland as a hero for keeping our children safe, \nand I urge others to follow his brilliant example. His determination \nand meticulous investigative work are truly commendable.\n  Detective Garland is truly a hero for the State of Delaware and for \nour entire Nation and its children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3787-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING MICHAEL P.

Price on his 40th anniversary as executive \ndirector of Goodspeed Musicals in East Haddam, CT.\n  Since assuming the role of executive director in 1968, Mr. Price has \nproduced more than 200 musicals, including 63 world premiere \nproductions. Sixteen of the musicals Mr. Price premiered at Goodspeed \nMusicals ultimately made their way to Broadway, including now world-\nfamous productions such as ``Shenandoah'' and ``Annie.''\n  During his 40 years of service at Goodspeed Musicals, Mr. Price has \nshared his talent and vision with more than 5,000 actors, directors, \nmusicians, and technicians and has touched the lives of 4 million \ntheatergoers, captivating and inspiring audiences of all ages.\n  Goodspeed Musicals' commitment to the advancement of musical theater \nis world renowned, and the theatre is considered by many to be the \n``Home of the American Musical.'' Goodspeed is also the only theatre in \nAmerica to have received two Tony Awards for Excellence in Theatre, \nonce in 1980 and again in 1995. These tremendous distinctions are \nthanks, in no small part, to the leadership, talent, and dedication of \nits Executive Director.\n  Mr. Price's dedication to the arts and the community extends well \nbeyond the walls of Goodspeed Opera House. Mr. Price currently serves \nas chairman of the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism and \nwas the longest serving Connecticut arts commissioner.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nColumbia Pacific Building and Construction Trades Council on their \n100th anniversary. The Columbia Pacific Building and Construction \nTrades Council represents 25 different crafts across the entire \nconstruction spectrum, including: asbestos workers, boilermakers, brick \nand stone masons, cement masons, carpenters, electricians, elevator \nconstructors, glaziers, ironworkers, laborers, linoleum and carpet \nlayers, millwrights, operating engineers, painters and tapers, pile \nbucks, plasterers, plumbers, pipe fitters and steamfitters, roofers, \nsheet metal workers, sprinkler fitters and teamsters. The men and women \nwho fill these jobs are some of the most impressive workers I have \nseen, devoted not only to their job, but to the safety of their \ncoworkers.\n  The Columbia Pacific Building and Construction Trades Council is \ncommitted to the highest level of professionalism. These building \nexperts have honed their skills through years of practice, starting \nwith an extensive apprenticeship and journey level program. The \nColumbia Pacific Building and Construction Trades Council is known for \nits apprenticeship program, recognized as one of the best in the \ncountry. It is this professionalism that the men and women of the \nbuilding and construction trades learn early on and continue to \ndemonstrate throughout their careers.\n  This Nation will continue to grow and prosper because of our \nunrivaled workforce. However, workers of this caliber can only be \nproduced in the proper work environment. The Columbia Pacific Building \nand Construction Trades Council ensures that workers have a voice. They \nstress the importance of providing a fair wage to those in the building \nand construction trades. Further, the council advocates for safe \nworking conditions and ensuring Americans are trained workers to meet \nour country's 21st century needs.\n  I am very proud to stand on the Senate floor today and commemorate \nthe men and women of the Columbia Pacific Building and Construction \nTrades Council. Those of us from frontier states are born with the \nknowledge that we stand on the edge of wilderness. Since the time of \nthe Oregon Trail, we have known civilization to rest on the shoulders \nof skilled craftsmen like the Columbia Pacific Building and \nConstruction Trades. And now,\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\nlike then, we owe them our debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3788-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING UNIT 70 OF THE AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I recognize American Legion \nAuxiliary Unit 70 out of Judith Gap, MT. Judith Gap is a small town in \ncentral Montana with less than 200 residents, but they have a vibrant \ncommunity where the American Legion plays a key role. The legion \nsupports a whole host of activities, from supporting veterans \nthroughout Montana to throwing local poppy-themed dinners. They provide \na great deal for the area, and I ask unanimous consent that the full \nactivities record of American Legion Auxiliary Unit 70 of Judith Gap, \nMT, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Activity Report of the Judith Gap American Legion Auxiliary\n\n       I would like you to become acquainted with the American \n     Legion Auxiliary, Unit No. 70 of Judith Cap. It is located \n     between what is called the Gap between the little Belt \n     Mountains, and the Big Snowy Mountains. It is referred to as \n     the ``Gap'' and is close to the center of Montana. The \n     ``Gap'' is well known for the terrific winds and snows that \n     close the road from all directions. The ``wind farm'' on the \n     prairie a few miles south of town attests to the presence of \n     wind.\n       It is also known for the many activities of the American \n     Legion Auxiliary. I encourage you to visit our town. We have \n     a school, two churches, grocery store, gas station, cafe, \n     post office, American Legion Hall, fire station, and two \n     bars. We are not BIG like New York City, but we too, are on \n     the map.\n       Our members are proud to be a part of the largest patriotic \n     organization in the world. We are a ``goal'' unit, and have \n     kept this rating for many years. We really believe in \n     encouraging our eligible girls to join as junior members. \n     Without our youth becoming involved, any organization will \n     die. Like so many worthwhile things, it takes time and \n     effort. We are proud that a member's son only four years old \n     can recite the Pledge of Allegiance and can sing America The \n     Beautiful. Our youth present Old Glory at basketball games \n     and sing the Star Spangled Banner.\n       I will relate to you a ``bird's eye'' view of what we do:\n       Surely everyone has seen the red crepe-paper poppies that \n     are made by our veterans. The little red poppies are \n     distributed in May. The money contributed goes to help our \n     veterans. School students enter the poppy poster contest to \n     remember and honor our veterans. Awards are given to the \n     winners. School students write Americanism essays. Awards are \n     given to the winners. We contribute to our Mt. V.A. hospitals \n     and V.A. facilities at Ft. Harrison, Glendive, Miles City, \n     Columbia Falls, and to the V.A. Clinics in Montana.\n       We have parties for the Legion's birthday, the Americanism \n     Program, the Mental Health Center, We gave gifts to our WWII \n     lady veteran, and to our ``adopted veteran''.\n       We donated to Freedoms Foundation, Spirit of Youth, \n     Children's Miracle Network, Oloha Scholarship, Girls State, \n     Child Welfare, Community Service, emergency fund, Chapel of \n     four Chaplains, and the U.S.O.\n       We send Christmas cards, easter cards, phone cards, care \n     packages, and neck coolers to our troops. We collect and send \n     coupons to the receiving centers for the use of Veterans \n     families.\n       We write letters to our Congressmen to ask them to support \n     bills for veterans benefits, and to prevent flag desecration.\n       The many activities and programs that we accomplish means \n     we have to make money (oh no. we do not counterfeit) we have \n     a ``fund raiser''. Our main fund raiser is the Memorial Day \n     Dinner. While the legionnaires are performing their ceremony \n     at the cemetery (yes, the wind is blowing and they are \n     holding on to the big American Flag with all of their might) \n     we ladies are getting the dinner ready. The poppy posters \n     made by our students, decorate the hall, poppy centerpieces \n     are on the table, and a basketfull of poppies is in place to \n     receive contributions and to wear a poppy. All has gone well.\n       We are thankful for all the help we get to finance our \n     programs. The local radio station announces the Memorial Day \n     Dinner--free! The local newspapers publish our meetings and \n     the pictures of Girls State delegates and alternates--free! \n     We have much to be thankful for and are thankful for much.\n       There is no better feeling, than the feeling we have when \n     we have accomplished the task we set out to do. Through our \n     activities, we have shown we honor and respect our veterans. \n     We shall always remember their sacrifices that have enabled \n     us to live in a free nation, where we are able to express our \n     belief in God, and love of our Country, The United States of \n     America.

A bill to create a Federal cause of action to determine \nwhether defamation exists under United States law in cases in which \ndefamation actions have been brought in foreign courts against United \nStates persons on the basis of publications or speech in the United \nStates; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am introducing the Free Speech \nProtection Act of 2008 to address a serious challenge to one of the \nmost basic protections in our Constitution. American journalists and \nacademics must have the freedom to investigate, write, speak, and \npublish about matters of public importance, limited only by the legal \nstandards laid out in our First Amendment jurisprudence, including \nprecedents such as New York Times v. Sullivan. Despite the protection \nfor free speech under our own law, the rights of the American public, \nand of American journalists who share information with the public, are \nbeing threatened by the forum shopping of defamation suits to foreign \ncourts with less robust protections for free speech.\n  These suits are filed in, and entertained by, foreign courts, despite \nthe fact that the challenged speech or writing is written in the U.S. \nby U.S. journalists, and is published or disseminated primarily in the \nU.S. The plaintiff in these cases may have no particular connection to \nthe country in which the suit is filed. Nevertheless, the U.S. \njournalists or publications who are named as defendants in these suits \nmust deal with the expense, inconvenience, and distress of being sued \nin foreign courts, even though their conduct is protected by the First \nAmendment.\n  The impetus for this legislation is litigation involving Dr. Rachel \nEhrenfeld, a U.S. citizen and Director of the American Center for \nDemocracy, whose articles have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the \nNational Review, and the Los Angeles Times. She has been a scholar with \nColumbia University, the University of New York School of Law, and \nJohns Hopkins, and has testified before Congress. Dr. Ehrenfeld's 2003 \nbook, Funding Evil: How Terrorism is Financed and How to Stop it, which \nwas published solely in the United States by a U.S. publisher, alleged \nthat a Saudi Arabian subject and his family financially supported al \nQaeda in the years preceding the attacks of September 11. He sued \nEhrenfeld for libel in England, although only 23 books were sold there. \nWhy? Because under English law, it is not necessary for a libel \nplaintiff to prove falsity or actual malice as is required in the U.S.\n  Dr. Ehrenfeld did not appear, and the English court entered a default \njudgment for damages, an injunction against publication in the United \nKingdom, a ``declaration of falsity'', and an\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\norder that she and her publisher print a correction and an apology.\n  Dr. Ehrenfeld sought to shield herself with a declaration from both \nFederal and State courts that her book did not create liability under \nAmerican law, but jurisdictional barriers prevented both the Federal \nand New York State courts from acting. Reacting to this problem, the \nGovernor of New York, on May 1, 2008, signed into law the ``Libel \nTerrorism Protection Act.'' Congress must now take similar prompt \naction. I note that the person who sued Dr. Ehrenfeld has filed dozens \nof lawsuits in England. There is a real danger that other American \nwriters and researchers will be afraid to address this crucial subject \nof terror funding and other important matters. England should be free \nto have its own libel law, but so too should the U.S. England has \nbecome a popular venue for defamation plaintiffs from around the world, \nincluding those who want to intimidate our journalists. The stakes are \nhigh. This legislation is important.\n  This legislation creates a Federal cause of action and Federal \njurisdiction so that Federal courts may determine whether there has \nbeen defamation under U.S. law when a U.S. journalist, speaker, or \nacademic is sued in a foreign court for speech or publication in the \nU.S. The bill authorizes a court to issue an order barring enforcement \nof a foreign judgment and to award damages.\n  Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of expression of \nideas, opinions, and research, and freedom of exchange of information \nare all essential to the functioning of a democracy. They are also \nessential in the fight against terrorism.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for working with me on this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY:\n  S. 2980. A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to improve access to high quality early learning and child \ncare for low income children and working families, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our children \nand, more specifically, children from low-income and working families \nacross the United States who need a good start in life and who need \nhigh-quality childcare each and every day while their parents must earn \na living.\n  I believe that here in America every child is born with a bright \nlight shining inside them, and it is our job as Senators to do \neverything we can, everything we can, to keep that light shining ever \nbrightly.\n  A child's potential may be limited or boundless, but whatever it is, \nevery child deserves the opportunity to become the person they were \nborn to be. Here in America, every child deserves high-quality \nchildcare and early education.\n  High-quality childcare gives low-income working families peace of \nmind while they work. Unfortunately, for the last 7 years, Federal \nfunding for childcare has been essentially frozen. The neglect of \nFederal funding for childcare during this administration has been \nunconscionable. What this means is families have been locked out of \naccess to high-quality providers. It means hundreds of thousands of \nchildren across the country have been put on waiting lists for \nchildcare because there simply is not enough funding to provide enough \nslots.\n  Working parents struggle to find childcare that will be healthy, \nsafe, and affordable. They worry every day about finding quality care. \nFor so many families, this is a very personal issue, especially, of \ncourse, for mothers. I remember a mother to whom I spoke in \nPennsylvania 10 years ago who was worried about being able to afford \nchildcare for her children. She said something I will never forget. She \nsaid because of the worry about childcare, she had a knot in her \nstomach. I think a lot of families closely identify with and understand \nwhat she was talking about.\n  These are parents who must work. They must therefore leave their \nchildren in care that often does not meet all their needs because it is \nthe only choice they can afford.\n  Here are the facts. The facts show an enormous unmet need in America \nwhen it comes to childcare. A couple of points: 365,000 children in \nAmerica are on waiting lists. In my home State of Pennsylvania, almost \n8,000 children are on waiting lists. Across the country, 13.5 million \nchildren who are eligible, eligible for Federal childcare assistance, \ndo not get it. That is an abomination. That is an embarrassment. It is \na black mark on America.\n  Let me say that number again: 13.5 million children who are eligible \nfor childcare assistance are not getting it. The population of my home \nState of Pennsylvania is a little less than 12.5 million. So if that \ngroup of children who are eligible but not getting the childcare \nassistance, if that were considered a State, it would be about the \nfifth largest State in the country.\n  So 13.5 million children who should be getting help are not getting \nit through our childcare system.\n  Childcare providers working hard every day caring for and educating \nour children are barely paid above the poverty level, with little or no \nbenefits. The average wage for a childcare worker is $9.05 an hour, \nwhich on an annual basis works out to $18,820, barely above the poverty \nlevel. Yet we charge them with the responsibility of caring for and \nnurturing and educating so many of our children.\n  Finally, the last fact: parents must struggle to afford childcare and \nface impossible choices between losing their jobs or leaving their \nchildren in less-than-ideal care. I believe the price for holding down \na good-paying job should not be problems with and worries about \nchildcare.\n  Low-income families also spend much higher percentages of their \nincome on childcare, often bringing that family to the breaking point. \nThis is all wrong. Our priorities are literally upside down.\n  That is why I am announcing today a bill I introduced today, the \nStarting Early, Starting Right Act. The Starting Early, Starting Right \nAct. I will go through a couple of the provisions.\n  In summary. First of all, my bill on childcare will move hundreds of \nthousands of children on State waiting lists into high-quality \nchildcare. The bill will meet the needs of underserved children such as \nEnglish language learners, children with developmental disabilities and \nother special needs, children living in very poor communities, and \nchildren in rural areas, to ensure we reach children most in need of \nhigh-quality childcare.\n  Next, our bill will ensure States will visit and monitor childcare \nproviders on an announced as well as unannounced basis every year. \nFourth, our bill will require childcare providers who are licensed or \nregistered to participate in 40 hours of training before they work with \nchildren as well as 24 hours on an ongoing annual basis.\n  Next we will expand parents' access to high quality childcare \nopportunities by requiring States to pay childcare providers rates \nbased upon the actual and current cost of care, what advocates know to \nbe the 75th percentile level.\n  Finally, it encourages States to exceed this rate for special \npopulations of children with greater needs. This bill will improve \naccess to high quality care for infants and toddlers by setting aside \n30 percent of the bill's funding for this underserved group of \nchildren. Finally, this bill will provide greater funding for quality \ninitiatives and encourage more States to adopt quality rating \nprovisions to improve the quality of their programs. Quality rating \nimprovement systems, known by the acronym QRIS, such as the successful \nprogram in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania STARS program, give providers \nbenchmarks as well as resources to continually improve the quality of \ncare.\n  I wanted to share one story before I conclude, a story about the \npowerful impact of high quality childcare on children and families. \nThis story was shared with our office by a childcare provider from \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania about a family I will not identify to respect \ntheir privacy. One of the children was a 3-year-old boy. I will call \nhim, for purposes of this presentation, Sammy. Sammy started in \nchildcare along with his older sister and younger brother when his \nmother was evicted from her house following divorce. Sammy's father did \nnot pay child support but, luckily, Sammy's grandmother took them in. \nThey all lived in a tiny two-bedroom apartment.\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nDropoffs at the childcare center were difficult for this young child. \nWith all the recent changes and trauma in his life, he was scared about \nhis mother leaving. His mother would apologize to the staff, saying she \nnever worked before and the children were not used to childcare.\n  The childcare worker always assured Sammy's mother that it was no \nproblem and that no apologies were necessary. Unfortunately, a few \nweeks later, Sammy's mom showed up one day in tears. She confided to \nthe childcare worker that she had not been able to find a job and was \nnow so desperate she had to use food stamps. She had gone to the store \nby bus, getting there through the public transit system. The cashier \ntreated her disrespectfully. Because of that, she was understandably \nhumiliated, and she began to feel hopeless and afraid she would never \nfind a job to support her three children. But at that moment, when that \nmother was at her greatest need and when the family was in need, the \nchildcare center in southeastern Pennsylvania rallied around this \nmother and her children. Over the next 2 years the staff of the center \nencouraged and supported her while she found a job, went back to \nschool, and eventually moved out of her mother's house into an \napartment of her own.\n  Her oldest daughter was very successful and attended school with the \ncenter through first grade. She was then evaluated for the gifted \nprogram when she went to public school and second grade. The youngest \nson blossomed and made it through family growing pains with little \ndifficulty. Finally, Sammy had some problems, but they were able to get \nthe help needed because of the generosity and commitment of the people \nwho worked in this childcare center. During that time the staff, led by \nthe director, helped raise money for Christmas presents, doctors' \nbills, and Sammy's mother's application to take her pharmacy \nassistant's license exam.\n  When this childcare worker left the center, Sammy's mom told her what \na profound difference the staff at the center had made in her life and \nin the lives of her children. Like so many in our country, this group \nof skilled, caring, and professional early childhood educators made it \npossible for this family to overcome so many obstacles.\n  The childcare worker told our staff recently:\n\n       [Sammy] is the kid I think about when people ask me why I \n     do what I do.\n\n  That is what that childcare worker said about her commitment to the \ncare of children and to that child and his family. This is what quality \nchildcare can mean in the real world to a struggling family. It may be \nthe difference between literally failure and success for countless \nfamilies. Sometimes it can mean sheer survival. This is one example of \nchildcare providers and families such as Sammy's all across the \ncountry. These are quiet victories we never hear much about, but they \nare literally life changing in impact.\n  Increasing funding for childcare is not only the right thing to do, \nit is the smart thing, especially for at-risk children and children \nfrom low-income families. Research shows that high quality childcare \nhelps low-income children enter school ready to succeed. One study \nfound that children in high quality childcare demonstrated greater \nmathematical ability and thinking and attention skills and had fewer \nbehavioral problems than any other children in second grade. I won't \nput the entire report in the Record, but the title of that first study \nis ``The Children of the Cost, Quality and Outcome Study Go to \nSchool.'' This is a June 1999 report by the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles, and Yale University. Several \nothers have mentioned this, but other studies have shown that low-\nincome children who enroll in high quality early care and education \nprograms score higher on reading, vocabulary, math, and cognitive \ntests, and are less likely to be held back a grade or to be arrested as \na youth, and are more likely to attend college than their peers who do \nnot enroll in such programs.\n  Although the peace of mind for parents that comes from knowing their \nchildren are well cared for cannot be measured, the impact on stable \nemployment can. Studies show that parents who receive childcare \nassistance are much more likely to remain in the workforce. The study I \nrefer to that made these findings is a briefing paper by the Economic \nPolicy Institute which is entitled ``Staying Employed After Welfare.'' \nThe subheading is ``Work supports and job quality vital to employment \ntenure and wage growth.''\n  Finally, there is no question that starting early and right is truly \nthe right thing to do. The evidence supporting high quality childcare \nis overwhelming and irrefutable. The evidence tells us we can keep that \nbright light alive in the heart and soul of every child. We can give \nthem what they need to get a good, solid start in their lives, if only \nwe make that choice to support high quality childcare, if only we make \nthat a priority.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this bill, the Starting \nEarly, Starting Right Act. As of now nearly 50 national and State \norganizations across the country have endorsed this legislation. They \nknow, as so many of us do, that investing in early care for children is \nthe right and the smart thing to do. It is time we put our focus and \npriorities back where they belong, on our children. In doing so, it \nwill help every child become the person they were born to be.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 2982. A bill to amend the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to \nauthorize appropriations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nbipartisan Runaway and Homeless Youth Protection Act of 2008 along with \nSenator Specter, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. \nThis legislation would reauthorize and improve the Runaway and Homeless \nYouth Act, RHYA. The programs authorized during the past 30 years by \nthe RHYA have consistently proven critical to protecting and giving \nhope to our Nation's runaway and homeless youth.\n  The prevalence of homelessness among young people in America is \nshockingly high. The problem is not limited to large cities. Its impact \nis felt strongly in smaller communities and rural areas as well. It \naffects our young people directly and reverberates throughout our \nfamilies and communities. That this problem continues in the richest \ncountry in the world means that we need to redouble our commitment and \nour efforts to safeguard our Nation's youth. We need to support the \ndedicated people in communities across the country who work to address \nthese problems every day.\n  On April 29, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to focus \nthe Senate's attention on these problems and to identify and develop \nsolutions to protect runaway and homeless youth. It was the first \nSenate hearing on these matters in more than a decade. We heard from a \ndistinguished panel of witnesses, some of whom spoke firsthand about \nthe significant challenges that young people face when they have \nnowhere to go.\n  Our witnesses demonstrated that young people can overcome harrowing \nobstacles and create new opportunities when given the chance. One \nwitness went from living as a homeless youth in his teens to earning \ntwo Oscar nominations as a distinguished actor. Another witness is \nworking with homeless youth at the same Vermont organization that \nenabled him to stop living on the streets and is on his way to great \nthings. Our witness panel gave useful and insightful suggestions on how \nto improve the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to make it more \neffective. We have included many of these recommendations in our bill.\n  The Justice Department estimated that 1.7 million young people either \nran away from home or were thrown out of their homes in 1999. Another \nstudy suggested a number closer to 2.8 million in 2002. Whether the \ntrue number is one million or five million, young people become \nhomeless for a number of reasons, ranging from abandonment to running \naway from an abusive home to having no place to go after being released \nfrom state care. An estimated 40 to 60 percent of homeless children are \nexpected to experience physical abuse, and 17 to 35 percent experience \nsexual abuse while on the\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nstreet, according to a report by the Department of Health and Human \nServices. Homeless youth are also at greater risk of mental health \nproblems. While many receive vital services in their communities, \nothers remain a hidden population, on the streets of our big cities and \nin rural areas like Vermont.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act is the way in which the Federal \nGovernment helps communities across the country protect some of our \nmost vulnerable children. It was first passed the year I was elected to \nthe Senate. We have reauthorized it several times since then, and \nworking with Senator Specter and Senators on both sides of the aisle, I \nhope that we will do so again this year. While some have tried to end \nthese programs, a bipartisan coalition has worked to preserve and \ncontinue the good that is accomplished through them. I remember Senator \nSpecter's efforts early in his Senate career to preserve these programs \nwhen he chaired the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Juvenile \nJustice. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and the programs it funds \nprovide a safety net that helps give young people a chance to build \nlives for themselves, and helps reunite youngsters with their families. \nGiven the increasingly difficult economic conditions being experienced \nby so many families around the country, it is time to recommit \nourselves to these principles and programs.\n  Under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, every State receives a \nBasic Center grant to provide housing and crisis services for runaway \nand homeless youth and their families. Community-based groups around \nthe country can also apply for funding through the Transitional Living \nProgram and the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach grant program. \nThe transitional living program grants are used to provide longer-term \nhousing to homeless youth between the ages of 16 and 21, and to help \nthem become self-sufficient. The outreach grants are used to target \nyouth susceptible to engaging in high-risk behaviors while living on \nthe street.\n  Our bill makes improvements to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act \nreauthorizations of past years. It doubles funding for States by \ninstituting a minimum of $200,000, which will allow states to better \nmeet the diverse needs of their communities. This bill also requires \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to develop performance \nstandards for grantees. Providing program guidelines would level the \nplaying field for bidders, ensure consistency among providers, and \nincrease the effectiveness of the services under the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act. In addition, our legislation develops an incidence \nstudy to better estimate the number of runaway and homeless youth and \nto identify trends. The incidence study would provide more accurate \nestimates of the runaway and homeless youth population and would help \nlawmakers make better policy decisions and allow communities to provide \nbetter outreach.\n  In my home State of Vermont, the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and \nHomeless Youth, the New England Network for Child, Youth, and Family \nServices, and Spectrum Youth and Family Services in Burlington all \nreceive grants under these programs and have provided excellent \nservices. In one recent year, the street outreach programs in Vermont \nserved nearly 10,000 young people.\n  The overwhelming need for services is not limited to any one state or \ncommunity. Many transitional living programs are forced to turn away \nyoung people seeking shelter. We heard testimony of an exemplary \nprogram within blocks of our nation's Capitol that has a waiting list \nas long as a year. This is unacceptable. The needs in our communities \nare real, and reauthorizing the law will allow these programs to expand \ntheir enormously important work.\n  These topics are difficult but deserve our attention. Finding \nsolutions to this growing problem is an effort we can all support. I \nthank Senator Specter for joining with me and urge all Senators to \nsupport prompt passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2982\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand and \nenhance veterans' benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation requested by \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as a courtesy to the Secretary. \nExcept in unusual circumstances, it is my practice to introduce \nlegislation requested by the Administration so that such measures will \nbe available for review and consideration.\n  The Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2008 consists of several \nprovisions addressing a range of VA care and services. Title I entails \nadjustments to education benefits currently offered by VA. Title II \naddresses disability claims adjudication, memorials affairs, insurance \nand specially adapted housing. Title III addresses health care matters, \nincluding nursing home care, contract-care payment, personnel pay and \ndisclosure of private information and medical records. Title IV \naddresses VA police officers and VA medical facility leases.\n  Title I of the bill would make several administrative and \nhousekeeping changes to VA's education programs, allowing for faster \nand more efficient claims adjudication. Among other changes, this title \nwould eliminate the requirement that a student file an application with \nVA upon changing his or her program of study while remaining enrolled \nat the same school and eliminate the requirement that wages must be \nearned in order to participate in VA's full-time on-job training, OJT, \nprogram.\n  Title II would make changes to disability claims adjudication, \nmemorial affairs, insurance and specially adapted housing. \nSpecifically, it would explicitly authorize VA to stay temporarily its \nadjudication of a pending claim before a VA regional office or the \nBoard of Veterans' Appeals, when a Federal Circuit appeal on the \nrelevant issue is pending. It would also authorize the Board to decide \ncases out of docket-number order when a case has been stayed or when \nthere is sufficient evidence to decide a claim, but a claim with an \nearlier docket number is not ready for decision. This title of the bill \nwould also extend full-time and family SGLI coverage to Individual \nReady Reservists.\n  Title III pertains to health care matters, including nursing home \ncare, contract-care payment, personnel pay and disclosure of private \ninformation and medical records. It would make permanent VA's authority \nto provide non-institutional extended care services either directly, by \ncontract, or by another provider or payor. It would also extend VA's \nobligation to provide nursing home care to veterans with a service-\nconnected disability rated at 70 percent or greater until December 31, \n2013, and VA's authority to establish non-profit research corporations \nthrough the same date. This title would also repeal requirements that \nVA produce certain reports and make permanent VA's authority to assign \nenrollment priority category 6 to those veterans who participated in \nchemical and biological warfare testing at DOD's Deseret Test Center \nfrom 1962 to 1973.\n  The fourth and final title of this bill would permit VA police \nofficers to carry firearms and conduct investigations of crimes that \noccurred on VA property, while off VA property in an official capacity. \nIt also would increase the uniform allowance of VA police officers, to \nensure they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for uniform maintenance. \nFinally, it would raise the threshold for congressional authorization \nfor major medical facility leases from $600,000 to $1,000,000.\n  I am introducing this bill for the review and consideration of my \ncolleagues at the request of the Administration. As Chairman of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I have not taken a position on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2984\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     The United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (VA) requests that the bill be referred \n     to the appropriate committee for prompt consideration and \n     enactment.\n       VA's draft bill contains four titles that address \n     improvements to education, health care, and other benefits, \n     as well as other miscellaneous matters. Enclosed please find \n     a section-by-section analysis, which includes cost estimates.\n       The provisions of title I dealing with education matters \n     would eliminate the requirement that certain institutions \n     report to VA any credit granted a student for prior training, \n     modify the waiting period before affirmation of enrollment in \n     a program pursued exclusively by correspondence, eliminate \n     the requirement that an individual report to VA for approval \n     a second change of program pursued while enrolled at the same \n     institution, and eliminate the wage-earning requirement for \n     self-employment on-job training.\n       Title II of the draft bill deals with miscellaneous \n     provisions that would permit VA to stay temporarily its \n     adjudication of claims while awaiting pending court \n     decisions, clarify that the Board of Veterans' Appeals may \n     decide certain cases out of docket-number order, permit VA to \n     furnish a memorial headstone or marker for certain deceased \n     surviving spouses of veterans, make permanent VA authority to \n     contract for medical disability examinations, modify \n     servicemembers' group life insurance coverage, permit VA to \n     provide Temporary Residence Assistance grants to certain \n     active-duty servicemembers, and designate the office required \n     to be established by the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 644(k)) as the Office of Small Business Programs.\n       Title III addresses a number of significant health care \n     matters. One of the major provisions would authorize the \n     Secretary to require that recipients of, and applicants for, \n     medical care and services provide their health-plan contract \n     information and social security numbers upon request. This \n     would allow VA to enhance revenue collection from health \n     insurance carriers and ensure the accurate identification \n     of medical care applicants by a single unique identifier, \n     thus facilitating VA medical care eligibility \n     determinations.\n       Other key provisions of title III would provide for several \n     needed program extensions, including the Department's mandate \n     to provide nursing home care to veterans with service-\n     connected disabilities of 70 percent or greater and to those \n     who need such care for the treatment of a service-connected \n     disability. Another provision of title III would allow VA to \n     establish additional nonprofit research corporations. There \n     is also a measure to extend VA's authority to conduct its \n     audit-recovery program, which assists in identifying \n     erroneous payments or overpayments made under fee-basis \n     contracts or other medical services contracts. The audit \n     program has achieved notable success in the amounts \n     recovered. All of these are important authorities that should \n     not be allowed to lapse.\n       We also propose to amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7332 to allow VA \n     providers to disclose information related to a patient's \n     treatment of drug abuse, alcoholism and alcohol abuse, \n     infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, and sickle \n     cell anemia to that patient's authorized surrogate when the \n     patient lacks decision-making capacity but has not expressly \n     authorized the release of that information to that surrogate. \n     The terms of the provision are very narrowly drawn to permit \n     disclosure of this information only when clinically relevant \n     to the treatment decision that the surrogate is being asked \n     to make and are consistent with widely-accepted ethical \n     standards for informed consent. In its report, Disclosing \n     Patients' Protected Health Information to Surrogates \n     (February 2005), VHA's National Ethics Committee concluded \n     that, in light of significant legal protections now in place \n     regarding employment discrimination based on personal health \n     status and the confidentiality of personal health \n     information, the current section 7332 prohibition against the \n     disclosure of clinically-relevant medical information to \n     surrogate decision makers is no longer justifiable. Moreover, \n     the Committee concluded that 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7332 places \n     clinicians in the ethically untenable position of being \n     required to obtain informed consent from the surrogate \n     decision maker on behalf of a patient who lacks decision-\n     making capacity, while being unable to disclose to the \n     surrogate this significant clinical information without which \n     there can be no full and informed consent.\n       Key provisions of Title IV of the draft bill would make \n     long-needed improvements to VA's Security and Law Enforcement \n     Program, and enable our police officers to more fully perform \n     all of the duties required of their law enforcement \n     positions.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that \n     transmission of this legislative package is in accord with \n     the President's program.\n       An identical letter has been sent to the President of the \n     Senate.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     James B. Peake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3801-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3801-S3802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 551--CELEBRATING 75 YEARS OF SUCCESSFUL STATE-BASED \n                           ALCOHOL REGULATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Barrasso) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 551\n\n       Whereas, throughout the history of the United States, \n     alcohol has been consumed by the people of the United States \n     and has been regulated by government;\n       Whereas, before the passage of the 18th amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States (commonly known as \n     ``National Prohibition''), abuses and insufficient regulation \n     resulted in irresponsible overconsumption of alcohol;\n       Whereas the passage of the 18th amendment, which prohibited \n     ``the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating \n     liquors'' in the United States, resulted in a dramatic \n     increase in illegal activity, including unsafe black market \n     alcohol production, a growth in organized crime, and \n     increasing noncompliance with alcohol laws;\n       Whereas the platforms of the 2 major political parties in \n     the 1932 presidential campaign advocated ending National \n     Prohibition by repealing the 18th amendment;\n       Whereas, on February 20, 1933, the second session of the \n     72nd Congress submitted to conventions of the States the \n     question of repealing the 18th amendment and adding new \n     language to the Constitution requiring the transportation or \n     importation of alcoholic beverages for delivery or use in any \n     State to be carried out in compliance with the laws of that \n     State;\n       Whereas, on December 5, 1933, Utah became the 36th State to \n     approve what became the 21st amendment to the Constitution of \n     the United States, making the ratification of the 21st \n     amendment the fastest ratification of a constitutional \n     amendment in the history of the United States and the only \n     ratification of a constitutional amendment ever decided by \n     State conventions pursuant to Article V of the Constitution;\n       Whereas alcohol is the only product in commerce in the \n     United States that has been the subject of 2 constitutional \n     amendments;\n       Whereas Congress's reenactment in 1935 of the Act entitled \n     ``An Act divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate \n     character in certain cases'', approved March 1, 1913 \n     (commonly known as the Webb-Kenyon Act) (27 U.S.C. 122), and \n     the enactment of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 \n     U.S.C. 201 et seq.), section 2004 of Aimee's Law (27 U.S.C. \n     122a) (relating to 21st amendment enforcement), the Sober \n     Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act (Public Law 109-\n     422; 120 Stat. 2890), and annual appropriations to support \n     State enforcement of underage drinking laws demonstrate a \n     longstanding and continuing intent on the part of Congress \n     that States should exercise their primary authority to \n     achieve temperance, the creation and maintenance of orderly \n     and stable markets with respect to alcoholic beverages, and \n     the facilitation of the efficient collection of taxes;\n       Whereas the legislatures and alcoholic beverage control \n     agencies of the 50 States have worked diligently to implement \n     the powers granted by the 21st amendment for 75 years and to \n     ensure the creation and maintenance of State-based regulatory \n     systems for alcohol distribution made up of producers, \n     importers, wholesale distributors, and retailers;\n       Whereas the development of a transparent and accountable \n     system for the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages, \n     an orderly market, temperance in consumption and sales \n     practices, the efficient collection of taxes, and other \n     essential policies have been successfully guided by the \n     collective experience and cooperation of government agencies \n     and licensed industry members throughout the geographically \n     and culturally diverse Nation;\n       Whereas regulated commerce in alcoholic beverages annually \n     contributes billions of dollars in Federal and State tax \n     revenues and additional billions to the United States economy \n     and supports the employment of millions of people in the \n     United States in more than 2,500 breweries, distilleries, \n     wineries, and import companies, more than 2,700 wholesale \n     distributor facilities, more than 530,000 retail outlets, and \n     numerous agricultural, packaging, and transportation \n     businesses;\n       Whereas the United States system of State-based alcohol \n     regulation has resulted in a marketplace with unprecedented \n     choice, variety, and selection for consumers;\n       Whereas members of the licensed alcoholic beverage industry \n     have been constant partners with Federal and State \n     governments in balancing the conduct of competitive \n     businesses with the need to control alcohol in order to \n     provide consumers in the United States with a safe and \n     regulated supply of alcoholic beverages; and\n       Whereas members of the licensed alcoholic beverage industry \n     have created and supported a wide range of national, State, \n     and community programs to address problems associated with \n     alcohol abuse, including drunk driving and underage drinking: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates 75 years of effective State-based alcohol \n     regulation since the passage of the 21st amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States;\n       (2) commends State lawmakers, regulators, law enforcement \n     officers, the public health\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\n     community, and industry members for successful collaboration \n     in achieving a workable, legal, and successful system for the \n     distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages;

Con. Res. 79\n\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE began as a civil and human rights \n     organization in 1968 in the wake of the devastating Detroit \n     riots, and was cofounded by the late Father William T. \n     Cunningham, a Roman Catholic priest, and Eleanor M. Josaitis, \n     a suburban housewife, who were inspired by the work of Dr. \n     Martin Luther King, Jr.;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE is committed to bringing together \n     people of all races, faiths, and economic backgrounds to \n     overcome injustice and build racial harmony, and it has grown \n     into one of the largest nonprofit organizations in Michigan;\n       Whereas the Focus: HOPE mission statement reads, \n     ``Recognizing the dignity and beauty of every person, we \n     pledge intelligent and practical action to overcome racism, \n     poverty and injustice. And to build a metropolitan community \n     where all people may live in freedom, harmony, trust, and \n     affection. Black and white, yellow, brown and red, from \n     Detroit and its suburbs of every economic status, national \n     origin and religious persuasion we join in this movement.'';\n       Whereas one of Focus: HOPE's early efforts was to support \n     African-American and female employees in a seminal class \n     action suit against the American Automobile Association \n     (AAA), resulting in groundbreaking affirmative action \n     commitments made by AAA;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE helped to conceive and develop the \n     Department of Agriculture's Commodity Supplemental Food \n     Program, which has been replicated in more than 32 States, \n     and through this program, Focus: HOPE helps to feed \n     approximately 41,000 people per month throughout southeast \n     Michigan;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has revitalized several city blocks in \n     central Detroit by redeveloping obsolete industrial \n     buildings, beautifying and landscaping Oakman Boulevard, \n     creating pocket parks, and rehabilitating homes in the \n     surrounding areas;\n       Whereas, since 1981, Focus: HOPE's Machinist Training \n     Institute has been training individuals from Detroit and \n     surrounding areas in careers in advanced manufacturing and \n     precision machining and has produced nearly 2,300 certified \n     graduates, providing an opportunity for minority youth, \n     women, and others who are often underrepresented in such \n     careers to gain access to the financial mainstream and learn \n     in-demand skills;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has recognized that manufacturing and \n     information technologies are key to the economic growth and \n     security of Michigan and the United States, and is committed \n     to designing programs to encourage the participation of \n     underrepresented urban individuals in those critical sectors;\n       Whereas, in 1982, Focus: HOPE initiated a for-profit \n     subsidiary for community economic development purposes and is \n     now designated with Federal HUBZone status (as defined in \n     section 3(p) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p));\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE created Fast Track, a pioneering skill-\n     enhancing program designed to help individuals improve their \n     reading and math competencies by a minimum of 2 grade levels \n     in 4 to 7 weeks;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's training and education programs have \n     moved more than 9,600 individuals out into the workforce \n     since the inception of those programs and have job placement \n     rates significantly above the national average;\n       Whereas, in 1987, Focus: HOPE reclaimed and renovated an \n     abandoned building and opened it as the Focus: HOPE Center \n     for Children, which now has served nearly 6,000 children of \n     colleagues, students, and neighbors with quality child care, \n     including\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\n     latchkey, summer camp, early childhood education, and other \n     educational services;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE, through an unprecedented cooperative \n     agreement between the Departments of Defense, Commerce, \n     Education, and Labor, established a national demonstration \n     project, the Center for Advanced Technologies, which \n     integrates hands-on manufacturing training and academic \n     learning and educates advanced manufacturing engineers and \n     technologists at internationally competitive levels;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE partnered with 5 universities and 6 \n     industry partners, formerly known as the Greenfield \n     Coalition, to design a unique 21st century curriculum that \n     resulted in students receiving associate's degrees in \n     manufacturing technologies from Lawrence Technological \n     University, or bachelor's degrees in engineering technology \n     or manufacturing engineering from Wayne State University or \n     the University of Detroit Mercy, respectively;\n       Whereas, due to the unique educational pedagogy at Focus: \n     HOPE's Center for Advanced Technologies, the starting salary \n     of its graduates is higher than the national average of \n     graduates with the same degree from other universities;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has made outstanding contributions in \n     increasing diversity within the traditionally homogenous \n     science, math, engineering, and technology fields, 95 percent \n     of currently enrolled degree candidates are African-American, \n     and the Center for Advanced Technologies is one of the top \n     programs in the United States for graduating minorities with \n     bachelor's degrees in manufacturing engineering;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's unique partnership with the \n

Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Stabenow, in introducing a resolution today honoring the 40th \nanniversary of Focus: HOPE. This resolution was initiated in the House \nby Representative John Conyers and cosponsored by the entire Michigan \nCongressional delegation.\n  Focus: HOPE, a civil and human rights organization, was founded by \nthe late Father William T. Cunningham and Eleanor Josaitis in the \naftermath of the 1967 Detroit riots in one of Detroit's most \neconomically depressed areas. This outstanding organization has \nestablished itself as an integral part of the history and fabric of \nsoutheast Michigan. The mission of Focus: HOPE is ``to use intelligent \nand practical action to fight racism, poverty and injustice'' and that \nmission is as important today as it was when the organization was \nfounded in 1968.\n  Over the ensuing 40 years, Focus: HOPE has sought to effect positive \nchange in southeast Michigan. I have been honored to witness and take \npart in the evolution of this fine organization. Education and job \ntraining has been at the core of these efforts. By bringing together \nbusinesses, foundations, government and individuals in the community, \nFocus: HOPE has truly made a difference in Detroit and across the state \nof Michigan and has grown into one of the largest nonprofits in the \nState. Focus: HOPE has sought to meet the needs of southeast Michigan \nin a comprehensive fashion through a number of highly successful \nprograms, including the Machinist Training Institute, the Center for \nAdvanced Technology, the Fast Track program, the Center for Children \nand the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.\n  Real and meaningful change comes from sustained and committed \nservice. Over the past 40 years, Focus: HOPE has embodied this \nprinciple and, along the way, has touched many lives in Southeast \nMichigan in a profound way. Equipping individuals with the ability to \ncompete and thrive in workplaces that are increasingly technologically \nadvanced is central to its mission. The reward has been thousands of \nheartwarming success stories from those who have benefitted from the \nmany services Focus: HOPE provides.\n  This momentous occasion will be marked by several celebrations, \nincluding one in the Mansfield Room of the Capitol later today. I know \nmy colleagues join me in congratulating each individual that has \ncontributed to the success of Focus: HOPE from its inception. I wish \nthe organization many more years of successful and committed service to \nthe community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/06/senate-section/article/S3803-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3803-S3804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n       SA 4656.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Flood Insurance Reform and \n     Modernization Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flood insurance claims resulting from the hurricane \n     season of 2005 will likely exceed all previous claims paid by \n     the National Flood Insurance Program;\n       (2) in order to pay the legitimate claims of policyholders \n     from the hurricane season of 2005, the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency has borrowed over $20,000,000,000 from the \n     Treasury;\n       (3) the interest alone on this debt, is almost \n     $1,000,000,000 annually, and that the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency has indicated that it will be unable to pay \n     back this debt;\n       (4) the flood insurance program must be strengthened to \n     ensure it can pay future claims;\n       (5) while flood insurance is mandatory in the 100-year \n     floodplain, substantial flooding occurs outside of existing \n     special flood hazard areas;\n       (6) recent events throughout the country involving areas \n     behind man-made structures, known as ``residual risk'' areas, \n     have produced catastrophic losses;\n       (7) although such man-made structures produce an added \n     element of safety and therefore lessen the probability that a \n     disaster will occur, they are nevertheless susceptible to \n     catastrophic loss, even though such areas at one time were \n     not included within the 100-year floodplain; and\n       (8) voluntary participation in the National Flood Insurance \n     Program has been minimal and many families residing outside \n     the 100-year floodplain remain unaware of the potential risk \n     to their lives and property.\n\n     SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In this title, the following definitions \n     shall apply:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n       (2) National flood insurance program.--The term ``National \n     Flood Insurance Program'' means the program established under \n     the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4011 et \n     seq.).\n       (3) 100-year floodplain.--The term ``100-year floodplain'' \n     means that area which is subject to inundation from a flood \n     having a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any \n     given year.\n       (4) 500-year floodplain.--The term ``500-year floodplain'' \n     means that area which is subject to inundation from a flood \n     having a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in \n     any given year.\n       (5) Write your own.--The term ``Write Your Own'' means the \n     cooperative undertaking between the insurance industry and \n     the Flood Insurance Administration which allows participating \n     property and casualty insurance companies to write and \n     service standard flood insurance policies.\n       (b) Common Terminology.--Except as otherwise provided in \n     this title, any terms used in this title shall have the \n     meaning given to such terms under section 1370 of the \n     National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4121).\n\n     SEC. 104.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Commission on Natural \n     Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the \n     United States in 2005, caused, by some estimates, in excess \n     of $200,000,000,000 in total economic losses;\n       (2) many meteorologists predict that the United States is \n     in a period of increased hurricane activity;\n       (3) the Federal Government and State governments have \n     provided billions of dollars to pay for losses from natural \n     catastrophes, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic \n     eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, droughts, \n     and other natural catastrophes;\n       (4) many Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to \n     obtain and afford property and casualty insurance coverage;\n       (5) some insurers are not renewing insurance policies, are \n     excluding certain risks, such as wind damage, and are \n     increasing rates and deductibles in some markets;\n       (6) the inability of property and business owners in \n     vulnerable areas to obtain and afford property and casualty \n     insurance coverage endangers the national economy and public \n     health and safety;\n       (7) almost every State in the United States is at risk of a \n     natural catastrophe, including hurricanes, earthquakes, \n     volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, \n     droughts, and other natural catastrophes;\n       (8) building codes and land use regulations play an \n     indispensable role in managing catastrophe risks, by \n     preventing building in high risk areas and ensuring that \n     appropriate mitigation efforts are completed where building \n     has taken place;\n       (9) several proposals have been introduced in Congress to \n     address the affordability and availability of natural \n     catastrophe insurance across the United States, but there is \n     no consensus on what, if any, role the Federal Government \n     should play; and\n       (10) an efficient and effective approach to assessing \n     natural catastrophe risk management and insurance is to \n     establish a nonpartisan commission to study the management of \n     natural catastrophe risk, and to require such commission to \n     timely report to Congress on its findings.\n\n     SEC. 203. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a nonpartisan Commission on Natural \n     Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance (in this title \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 204.

and\n       (D) the costs of natural catastrophes to Federal and State \n     taxpayers;\n       (11) the present and long-term financial condition of State \n     residual markets and catastrophe funds in high-risk regions, \n     including the likelihood of insolvency following a natural \n     catastrophe, the concentration of risks within such funds, \n     the reliance on post-event assessments and State funding, and \n     the adequacy of rates;\n       (12) the role that innovation in financial services could \n     play in improving the affordability and availability of \n     natural catastrophe insurance, specifically addressing \n     measures that would foster the development of financial \n     products designed to cover natural catastrophe risk, such as \n     risked-linked securities;\n       (13) the need for strengthened land use regulations and \n     building codes in States at high risk for natural \n     catastrophes, and methods to strengthen the risk assessment \n     and enforcement of structural mitigation and vulnerability \n     reduction measures, such as zoning and building code \n     compliance;\n       (14) the benefits and costs of proposed Federal natural \n     catastrophe insurance programs (including the Federal \n     Government providing reinsurance to State catastrophe funds, \n     private insurers, or other entities), specifically addressing \n     the costs to taxpayers, tax equity considerations, and the \n     record of other government insurance programs (particularly \n     with regard to charging actuarially sound prices);\n       (15) the ability of the United States private insurance \n     market--\n       (A) to cover insured losses caused by natural catastrophes, \n     including an estimate of the maximum amount of insured losses \n     that could be sustained during a single year and the \n     probability of natural catastrophes occurring in a single \n     year that would inflict more insured losses than the United \n     States insurance and reinsurance markets could sustain; and\n       (B) to recover after covering substantial insured losses \n     caused by natural catastrophes;\n       (16) the impact that demographic trends could have on the \n     amount of insured losses inflicted by future natural \n     catastrophes;\n       (17) the appropriate role, if any, for the Federal \n     Government in stabilizing the property and casualty insurance \n     and reinsurance markets;

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has a history of catastrophic natural \n     disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, flood, fire, \n     earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions;\n       (2) although catastrophic natural disasters occur \n     infrequently, they will continue to occur and are \n     predictable;\n       (3) such disasters generate large economic losses and a \n     major component of those losses comes from damage and \n     destruction to homes;\n       (4) for the majority of Americans, their investment in \n     their home represents their single biggest asset and the \n     protection of that investment is paramount to economic and \n     social stability;\n       (5) historically, when a natural disaster eclipses the \n     ability of the private industry and a State to manage the \n     loss, the Federal Government has stepped in to provide the \n     funding and services needed for recovery;\n       (6) the cost of such Federal ``bail-outs'' are borne by all \n     taxpayers equally, as there is no provision to repay the \n     money and resources provided, which thereby unfairly burdens \n     citizens who live in lower risk communities;\n       (7) as the risk of catastrophic losses grows, so do the \n     risks that any premiums collected by private insurers for \n     extending coverage will be insufficient to cover future \n     catastrophes (known as timing risk), and private insurers, in \n     an effort to protect their shareholders and policyholders (in \n     the case of mutually-owned companies), have thus \n     significantly raised premiums and curtailed insurance \n     coverage in States exposed to major catastrophes;\n       (8) such effects on the insurance industry have been \n     harmful to economic activity in States exposed to major \n     catastrophes and have placed significant burdens on existing \n     residents of such States;\n       (9) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma struck the United \n     States in 2005, causing over $200,000,000,000 in total \n     economic losses, and insured losses to homeowners in excess \n     of $50,000,000,000;\n       (10) since 2004, the Congress has appropriated more than \n     $58,000,000,000 in disaster relief to the States affected by \n     natural catastrophes;\n       (11) the Federal Government has provided and will continue \n     to provide resources to pay for losses from future \n     catastrophes;\n       (12) when Federal assistance is provided to the States, \n     accountability for Federal funds disbursed is paramount;\n       (13) the Government Accountability Office or other \n     appropriate agencies must have the means in place to confirm \n     that Federal funds for catastrophe relief have reached the \n     appropriate victims and have contributed to the recovery \n     effort as efficiently as possible so that taxpayer funds are \n     not wasted and citizens are enabled to rebuild and resume \n     productive activities as quickly as possible;\n       (14) States that are recipients of Federal funds must be \n     responsible to account for and provide an efficient means for \n     distribution of funds to homeowners to enable the rapid \n     rebuilding of local economies after a catastrophic event \n     without unduly burdening taxpayers who live in areas seldom \n     affected by natural disasters;\n       (15) State insurance and reinsurance programs can provide a \n     mechanism for States to exercise that responsibility if they \n     appropriately underwrite and price risk, and if they pay \n     claims quickly and within established contractual terms; and\n       (16) State insurers and reinsurers, if appropriately \n     backstopped themselves, can absorb catastrophic risk borne by \n     private insurers without bearing timing risk, and thus enable \n     all insurers (whether State-operated or privately owned) to \n     underwrite and price insurance without timing risk and in \n     such a way to encourage property owners to pay for the \n     appropriate insurance to protect themselves and to take steps \n     to mitigate against the risks of disaster by locally \n     appropriate methods.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are to \n     establish a program to provide a Federal backstop for State-\n     sponsored insurance programs to help homeowners prepare for \n     and recover from the damages caused by natural catastrophes, \n     to encourage mitigation and prevention for such catastrophes, \n     to promote the use of private market capital as a means to \n     insure against such catastrophes, to expedite the payment of \n     claims and better assist in the financial recovery from such \n     catastrophes.\n\n     SEC. 103. QUALIFIED REINSURANCE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of this division only, a \n     program shall be considered to be a qualified reinsurance \n     program if the program--\n       (1) is authorized by State law for the purposes described \n     in this section;\n       (2) is an entity in which the authorizing State maintains a \n     material, financial interest;\n       (3) provides reinsurance or retrocessional coverage to \n     underlying primary insurers or reinsurers for losses arising \n     from all personal residential lines of insurance, as defined \n     in the Uniform Property & Casualty Product Coding Matrix \n     published and maintained by the National Association of \n     Insurance Commissioners;\n       (4) has a governing body, a majority of whose members are \n     public officials;\n       (5) provides reinsurance or retrocessional coverage to \n     underlying primary insurers or reinsurers for losses in \n     excess of such amount that the Secretary has determined \n     represents a catastrophic event in that particular State;\n       (6) is authorized by a State that has in effect such laws, \n     regulations, or other requirements, as the Secretary shall by \n     regulation provide, that--\n       (A) ensure, to the extent that reinsurance coverage made \n     available under the qualified reinsurance program results in \n     any cost savings in providing insurance coverage for risks in \n     such State, such cost savings are reflected in premium rates \n     charged to consumers for such coverage;\n       (B) require that any new construction, substantial \n     rehabilitation, and renovation insured or reinsured by the \n     program complies with applicable State or local government \n     building, fire, and safety codes;\n       (C) require State authorized insurance entities within that \n     State to establish an insurance rate structure that takes \n     into account measures to mitigate insurance losses;\n       (D) require State authorized insurance and reinsurance \n     entities within that State to establish rates at a level that \n     annually produces expected premiums that shall be sufficient \n     to pay the expected annualized cost of all claims, loss \n     adjustment expenses, and all administrative costs of \n     reinsurance coverage offered; and\n       (E) encourage State authorized insurance and reinsurance \n     entities within that State to establish rates that do not \n     involve cross-subsidization between any separate property\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\n     and casualty lines covered under the State authorized \n     insurance or reinsurance entity; and\n       (7) complies with such additional organizational, \n     underwriting, and financial requirements as the Secretary \n     shall, by regulation, provide to carry out the purposes of \n     this division.\n       (b) Transitional Mechanisms.--For the 5-year period \n     beginning on the date of enactment of this division, in the \n     case of a State that does not have a qualified reinsurance \n     program for the State, a State residual insurance market \n     entity for such State shall be considered to be a qualified \n     reinsurance program, but only if such State residual \n     insurance market entity was in existence before such date of \n     enactment.\n       (c) Precertification.--The Secretary shall establish \n     procedures and standards for State and regional reinsurance \n     programs and the State residual insurance market entities \n     described in subsection (b) to apply to the Secretary at any \n     time for certification (and recertification) as qualified \n     reinsurance programs.\n       (d) Reinsurance To Cover Exposure.--This section may not be \n     construed to limit or prevent any insurer from obtaining \n     reinsurance coverage for insured losses retained by insurers \n     pursuant to this section, nor shall the obtaining of such \n     coverage affect the calculation of the amount of any loan \n     under this division.\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Rules \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 5493 and the \nSenate now proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5493) to provide that the usual day for paying \n     salaries in or under the House of Representatives may be \n     established by regulations of the Committee on House \n     Administration.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering on behalf \nof myself and Senator McConnell addresses technical issues with respect \nto the ``cooling-off period'' for senior staff members.\n  Under title 18 and the Senate rules, staff members whose salary is \nabove a certain threshold are prohibited from lobbying the Senate for a \nperiod of 1 year. One of the reforms in S. 1, the ethics reform bill we \nenacted last year, was to broaden the scope of the ban--senior staff \nmembers who were previously prohibited from lobbying individual Senate \noffices for a year are now prohibited from lobbying the entire Senate.\n  However, we have been made aware of an unintended consequence of the \nlaw: some junior staff members who receive salary bonuses over a period \nof 2 months are inadvertently covered by the lobbying ban, which is now \neven more sweeping. The Reid-McConnell amendment addresses this problem \nby providing that a staff member whose\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\nsalary is above the threshold for only 2 months will not be covered by \nthe ban, even if those 2 months--for example, July and August--have an \naggregate of more than 60 days.\n  Our amendment also makes the criminal law and Senate Rule XXXVII \nconsistent. Both the law and the rule will now look back over the same \ntime period, i.e., 1 year before an employee's termination, and the \nthreshold will be the same, i.e., more than 2 months. Post-employment \nrestrictions will thus be clearer to staff and the public, as well as \neasier to administer.\n  Under 2 U.S.C. 60c-1, Members, officers, and employees of the Senate \nare paid on a semimonthly basis: generally, the 20th of every month for \nthe period of the 1st through the 15th and the 5th of the succeeding \nmonth for the period of the 16th through the end of the month. Thus, \nthe language ``two months'' is intended and shall mean in the Senate \nequal to four pay periods. If an employee were to be paid above the \nthreshold amount for more than four pay periods, for example, for four \nand any part of a fifth pay period, he or she would be covered by the \nrestrictions of both the law and the rule.\n  Mr. President, the amendment is at the desk, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be considered and agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4712) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To propose a technical amendment relating to Senate pay \n                                periods)\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on May 6 of this year by the President \nof the United States:\n  Tax Convention with Iceland (Treaty Document No. 110-17).\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with the accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe Convention Between the Government of the United States of America \nand the Government of Iceland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and \nthe Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, and \naccompanying Protocol, signed on October 23, 2007, at Washington, D.C. \n(the ``proposed Treaty''). The proposed Treaty would replace the \nexisting income tax Convention with Iceland that was concluded in 1975 \n(the ``existing Treaty''). Also transmitted for the information of the \nSenate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the \nproposed Treaty.\n  The proposed Treaty contains a comprehensive provision designed to \nprevent so-called treaty shopping. The existing Treaty contains no such \nprotections, resulting in substantial abuse of the existing Treaty's \nprovisions by third-country investors. The proposed Treaty also \nreflects changes to U.S. and Icelandic law and tax treaty policy since \n1975.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe proposed Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.
