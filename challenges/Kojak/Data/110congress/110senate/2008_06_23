The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address the \nissues on legislation which is coming from the House of Representatives \namending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  The issues on which the Senate will vote on the House bill involve \nvery fundamental questions of constitutional rights versus the war on \nterrorism. We have legislation which has come from the House of \nRepresentatives which would grant retroactive immunity to the telephone \ncompanies on a showing that the companies receive written requests from \nthe Government saying the program was legal.\n  At the outset, I recognize the telephone companies as good citizens. \nBut the test of whether what has been done is legal is not determined \nby the assertion by the Government to the telephone companies that the \nprogram is legal. That determination can only be made by the courts on \nevaluation of congressional authority under article I, which has been \nexercised in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, since \namended, contrasted with the President's article II powers as Commander \nin Chief. That test has not been waived.\n  I submit the historians will look back upon the period of time from \n9/11 to the present and beyond as the greatest expansion of executive \nauthority in the history of the country. I believe additional law \nenforcement tools were necessary. In my capacity as the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, I led the fight for the PATRIOT Act re-\nauthorization on this floor to give law enforcement broader power.\n  But, at the same time, I have expressed my deep concern that there be \na determination by the courts as to whether the warrantless wiretapping \nis valid under the Constitution. We have seen great stress laid upon \nthe provision in the House measure that the exclusive means for \nwiretapping will be provided by the statute. But that does not stop the \nPresident from asserting his authority under article II of the \nConstitution.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 has a similar \nprovision of exclusivity, but that did not stop the President from \ninitiating the Terrorist Surveillance Program which was kept secret for \nyears from the Congress. The President has a sound constitutional \nargument that you cannot amend the Constitution by statute; you cannot \ntake away the President's constitutional authority by a statute, but it \nis up to the courts to strike the balance and to make that \ndetermination.\n  Regrettably, Congress and the efforts which we have made have, I \nsubmit, been totally insufficient. We have had the so-called signing \nstatements as an expansion of executive authority, and Congress has \nbeen unable to assert its authority under the Constitution on the \nlegislation we send to the President. The Constitution is plain. Each \nHouse passes legislation. There is a conference report, and it is sent \nto the President and presented. Then the President has the option of \neither signing or vetoing.\n  But a practice has arisen in the past, very extensively used by this \nadministration, to put in signing statements which are at material \nvariance--that really directly contradict what is in the legislation. \nThere may be some justification for a signing statement on some minor \nmatters on an administrative level, but in my formal statement I go \ninto a couple of examples on a controversy on enhanced interrogation, \nor so-called torture, which passed the Senate 90 to 9.\n  In a celebrated meeting between Senator McCain and President Bush, \nthey reached a compromise. Then when the legislation went to the \nPresident, the President issued a signing statement saying that he had \nthe authority to disregard it under his powers as Commander in Chief, \narticle II authority.\n  In a similar vein on the PATRIOT Act re-authorization, we put in \nrestrictions on what the law enforcement officials could do, negotiated \nwith the administration, signed into law by the President, and again a \nstatement was made that if the President chose to exercise his \nconstitutional authority, article II power, he felt free to do so.\n  I introduced legislation to give the Congress standing to go to court \nto challenge these signing statements. The legislation has not gotten \nvery far because of the impossibility of overriding a veto and because \nof the concern as to whether the constitutional standard of the case \nand controversy would be met. So here we have the unfettered practice \nof these signing statements as an example of executive authority.\n  Second, the Supreme Court review of the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram and habeas corpus has been inadequate. In the Detroit case, the \nFederal court finding the Terrorist Surveillance Program \nunconstitutional was appealed to the Sixth Circuit. After lengthy \ndelays, the Sixth Circuit reversed the Detroit Federal court on the \ngrounds of lack of standing. Then, again, after months of delay, the \ncase went to the Supreme Court of the United States which, again, \ndenied certiorari.\n  The issue of standing has sufficient flexibility, as demonstrated by \nthe dissent in the Sixth Circuit, that the Supreme Court could have \ntaken up the issue. The question on the Terrorist Surveillance Program \npresents the sharpest conflict of our era on the clash between the \nPresident's authority under article II as Commander in Chief and the \nauthority of Congress to enact statutes, as we did under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n  Similarly, on habeas corpus, notwithstanding the Rasul decision, the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Boumediene essentially \ndisregarded the holding of the Supreme Court in Rasul when the Circuit \nCourt for the District of Columbia said the decision by the Supreme \nCourt turned on a statutory interpretation.\n  Habeas corpus is provided for in two ways under our law: No. 1, it is \ndescended from the Great Writ, the Magna Carta, of 1215, and it is \nembodied in our constitutional law as made plain by Justice Stevens in \nRasul. And there is also a statutory provision for habeas corpus. In \nthe Military Commissions Act, the Congress modified the statutory \nprovision, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia saw \nfit to say that once the statute was changed, habeas corpus didn't \napply--really flying in the face of what the holding was in Rasul.\n\n  Finally, a protracted period of time later, in Boumediene, the \nSupreme Court reinstated habeas corpus as it was bound to do based upon \nthe clear holding of Rasul and the long history of the issue.\n  Congress has similarly been ineffective in curtailing executive \nauthority in the National Security Act of 1947, which requires the \nPresident to notify the intelligence committees of both the House and \nSenate, and for protracted periods of time the executive branch ignored \nthat requirement. Only when the confirmation of General Hayden as \nDirector of CIA came up was\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\nthere some compliance with that requirement.\n  The Judiciary Committee, during my tenure as chair, sought to bring \nin the telephone companies, sought to issue subpoenas to find out what \nthe telephone companies were undertaking. On that situation, as I have \nsaid on the floor of the Senate, Vice President Cheney personally went \nbehind my back to talk to Republican members of the Judiciary Committee \nwithout talking to me at any stage. That effort was made because the \ntelephone companies, unlike the executive branch, unlike the \nPresident--the telephone companies do not have executive privilege.\n  Similarly, the Senate defeated my amendment on the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act which would have substituted the \nGovernment for the telephone companies as the parties defendant. There \nwas a way that the telephone companies could have been recognized for \ntheir good citizenship and held harmless by having the Government step \ninto their shoes. But that amendment was defeated.\n  I submit the case for this determination has a very important \ndimension beyond the customary doctrine of separation of powers because \nwe are asked to give retroactive immunity to something while we don't \neven know on the record the full import of what is involved. The \nwarrantless wiretapping, the data mining by the telephone companies is \nknown only to some Members of Congress. It is not known to the public. \nI intend to offer an amendment which will require that the district \ncourt--the House bill now lodges jurisdiction in the district court to \nmake the determination on the legality of FISA--my amendment will call \nfor the district court to make the determination as to whether what has \nbeen done by the telephone companies is constitutional.\n  The ultimate vote on this matter is a tough one. There are quite a \nnumber of provisions in the House bill which are protective of civil \nliberties. I have detailed them in my formal written statement. So when \nI come to a balance as to voting for the bill or not, my inclination is \nto vote in favor of the bill because of the importance of the ongoing \nactivities of the telephone companies, notwithstanding my deep concern \nfor civil rights. But there is a much better alternative, and that much \nbetter alternative would have been to have substituted the Government \nfor the telephone companies as the party defendant or, now, to submit \nthe question of constitutionality to the district court.\n  My vote was misunderstood on the Military Commissions Act. When I had \nled the fight to retain habeas corpus in that bill, it was defeated 51 \nto 48--but we later voted for the bill because of its recognition of \nthe applicability of the Geneva Conventions and other important parts \nof the bill. I said at the time that because of the severability \nclause, the Supreme Court of the United States would reinstate habeas \ncorpus--which, of course, in the past couple of weeks, we know the \nSupreme Court has done.\n  We are dealing here, essentially, with very subtle and very nuanced \nprovisions. There are very tough judgments to be made in the \nlegislative context. The war on terrorism is still on the front burner. \nWe do not know what is going to come next.\n  So that any time there is a balance as to what we ought to do, \nbecause of the value which I think is present from this data-mining and \nthe work done by the telephone companies, I think it ought to be \nmaintained. But where we have an option of doing it in a constitutional \nway, either by sunshine or by submitting it to the court, that is the \npreferable course of conduct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of a detailed statement \nsummarizing my position and a draft amendment be printed in the Record \nso my colleagues will have an opportunity to review both my written \nstatement and my oral presentation of the proposal for an amendment \nwhich I intend to offer when the bill comes up.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Floor Statement on FISA\n\n       The Senate is coming to a critical vote on our duty to \n     exercise our most fundamental constitutional obligation on \n     separation of powers: to strike the appropriate balance \n     between the war against terrorism and protecting civil \n     rights. We are asked by the House of Representatives to \n     approve their bill on amending the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act, a bill which gives retroactive immunity to \n     the telephone companies that facilitated warrantless \n     surveillance, but does not require a judicial determination \n     that the government's program was constitutional.\n       It is totally insufficient to confer immunity merely \n     because the companies received written requests from the \n     government saying the program was legal. While it is true \n     that the standard of review has been changed from ``abuse of \n     discretion'' to ``substantial evidence'' in this bill, the \n     real question is ``substantial evidence'' of what? Only that \n     the President authorized the program and the government sent \n     written requests to the companies assuring them it was legal. \n     The court is not required to find that the requests were \n     lawful, or that the surveillance itself was constitutional.\n       The provision that the legislation will be the exclusive \n     means for the government to wiretap is meaningless because \n     that specific limitation is in the 1978 Act and it didn't \n     stop the government from conducting the warrantless Terrorist \n     Surveillance Program with the telephone companies' \n     assistance. The bill leaves the President with his position \n     that his Article II powers as commander in chief cannot be \n     limited by statute. That is a sound constitutional argument, \n     but only the courts can ultimately decide that issue, and \n     this bill dodges the issue by limiting judicial review.\n       The constitutional doctrine of separation of powers has \n     been mangled since 9/11. I believe that, decades from now, \n     historians will look at the time between 9/11 and the present \n     as the greatest expansion of unchecked executive power in the \n     history of the country. I believe that much, if not most, of \n     that power was necessary to fight terrorism and I led the \n     fight as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee to expand law \n     enforcement powers under the PATRIOT Act. I also offered \n     numerous pieces of legislation designed to bring the \n     Terrorist Surveillance Program under federal court review and \n     to ensure that vital intelligence gathering could continue \n     with appropriate oversight. In the 109th and 110th \n     Congresses, I introduced several versions of the National \n     Security Surveillance Act (first introduced on March 16, \n     2006), the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and \n     Enhancement Act (with Senator Feinstein, first introduced on \n     May 24, 2006), and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Oversight and Resource Enhancement Act (first introduced on \n     November 14, 2006).\n       There has to be a check and balance. The Congress has been \n     totally ineffective, punting to the courts and then seeking \n     to limit the courts' authority as the House of \n     Representatives is now doing. The problem is compounded by \n     the fact that the Supreme Court had ducked and delayed \n     deciding where the line is between Congressional authority \n     under Article I and presidential authority under Article II.\n       Let me document the ineffectiveness of Congress:\n       (1) Signing Statements: The constitution is explicit that \n     Congress sends legislation to the president who has only two \n     options: sign or veto. Instead on key provisions limiting \n     executive authority, including Senator McCain's amendment--\n     adopted 90 to 9 in the Senate--to ban ``cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading'' treatment of any prisoner held by the United \n     States, and the new PATRIOT Act sections requiring audits and \n     Congressional reporting to ensure the FBI does not abuse its \n     terrorism-related powers to secretly demand the production of \n     records, the President has signed the Congressional \n     presentment and then issued a statement asserting his Article \n     II power to ignore those limitations.\n       My legislation to give Congress standing to challenge the \n     constitutionality of those signing statements has gone \n     nowhere because of three factors: (1) The disinclination of \n     Congress to challenge the president in the context of getting \n     blamed if there were another terrorist attack; (2) the \n     virtual impossibility of overriding a veto; and (3) the \n     doubts by a few that such legislation would satisfy the \n     constitutional requirements of the case and controversy.\n       (2) Requiring Supreme Court Review of the TSP and Habeas: \n     The efforts to get a Supreme Court ruling on the \n     constitutionality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program were \n     ducked by the Supreme Court. The ruling of the U.S. District \n     Court in Detroit holding the Terrorist Surveillance Program \n     unconstitutional was reversed by the 6th Circuit on a 2-1 \n     vote on lack of standing and the Supreme Court denied \n     certiorari. The doctrine of standing has enough flexibility, \n     as demonstrated by the dissent in the 6th Circuit, to have \n     enabled the Supreme Court to take up the most fundamental \n     clash between Congress and the president in our era, if the \n     Supreme Court had the courage to do so.\n       The Supreme Court acted almost as badly on the habeas \n     corpus issue in initially denying certiorari on the D.C. \n     Circuit's decision in Boumediene, which ignored the plain \n     language in Rasul confirming that habeas corpus was a \n     constitutional right, not just one based on legislation which \n     Congress had changed. Only when confronted with the \n     overwhelming evidence on the inadequacy of the Combat Status \n     Review Tribunals did the Supreme Court finally grant a \n     petition for reconsideration on certiorari and ordered the \n     District Courts to grant habeas corpus review after a very \n     long delay.\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\n       (3) Violation of the National Security Act: The Congress \n     was remedy-less to do anything when the President ignored the \n     National Security Act of 1947 which requires notification of \n     programs like the Terrorist Surveillance Program to the House \n     and Senate Intelligence Committees. It was only when the \n     administration needed the confirmation of General Michael \n     Hayden to be Director of the CIA that any effort at \n     compliance was made.\n       (4) Subpoenas for Telecoms: My efforts as Chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee in June 2006 to get information about the \n     telephone companies' warrantless wiretapping were obstructed \n     by an unusual breach of protocol by Vice President Dick \n     Cheney personally when he went behind my back to urge other \n     Judiciary Committee members to oppose my efforts to subpoena \n     the telephone companies which, unlike the administration, \n     could not plead executive privilege.\n       (5) Military Commissions Act: Congress has been docile, \n     really inert, in failing to push back on the executive's \n     encroachment on our authority. My amendment to retain habeas \n     corpus in the Military Commissions Act was defeated 48-51. \n     Meanwhile, the Graham-Levin amendment to the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 passed by the shocking \n     vote of 84-14 despite the fact that it was drafted overnight, \n     had no hearing and virtually no debate with my having only \n     two minutes to speak in opposition. On its face the amendment \n     stripped the Supreme Court of jurisdiction by vesting \n     exclusive jurisdiction with the District of Columbia Circuit. \n     It would be hard to find an amendment on a more important \n     subject given less scrutiny and passed with less thought and \n     in such haste.\n       (6) FISA Substitution Amendment: Similarly, the Senate \n     defeated my amendment to the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act which would have substituted the government \n     for the telephone companies as the defendants in the pending \n     litigation. That would have protected the telephone companies \n     but left the courts to decide if the program was \n     constitutional.\n       The Senate now has the opportunity to provide for judicial \n     review by amending the House Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act bill to authorize the U.S. District Courts \n     to determine the constitutionality of the administration's \n     program before granting immunity to the telephone companies.\n       The case for that determination has an important extra \n     dimension beyond separation of powers. It involves a \n     repugnant factor; namely, that the government had instigated \n     and maintained for many years a secret practice, the scope of \n     which is unknown to the public and known only to some members \n     of Congress. It smacks of Star Chamber proceedings from old \n     England. Now the administration insists on retroactive \n     immunity and the House has complied. It is time the Senate \n     stood up and earned its reputation as the ``world's greatest \n     deliberative body'' and at least demonstrate some courage, if \n     not a full profile, by insisting on judicial review.\n       In offering an amendment for judicial review, I am mindful \n     of the importance of what the telephone companies have been \n     doing on the war against terrorism from my classified \n     briefings. It is a difficult decision to vote for retroactive \n     immunity if my amendment fails, but I will do so, just as I \n     voted for it when my substitution amendment failed because I \n     conclude that the threat of terrorism and the other important \n     provisions in the House bill outweigh the invasion of \n     privacy.\n       I do so with great reluctance because it sets a terrible \n     precedent for the executive to violate the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act, the National Security Act of \n     1947, and the presentment clause of the constitution and then \n     receive a Congressional pardon. It is especially galling \n     since Congress could both protect the telephone companies by \n     substitution and allow the lawsuits to go forward or \n     authorize their continuance by my amendment.\n       I also intend to vote for the bill regardless of what \n     happens to my amendment because of the other important \n     features of the bill. It requires prior court review of the \n     government's foreign-targeted surveillance procedures, except \n     in exigent circumstances (the 7-day exception). Also, the \n     FISA Court must determine whether--going forward--the foreign \n     targeting and minimization procedures satisfy the Fourth \n     Amendment. The bill also requires prior, individualized court \n     orders based on probable cause for U.S. persons when they are \n     outside the country. And, the bill requires a comprehensive \n     Inspector General review of the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program.\n       I know that this nuanced position of fighting retroactive \n     immunity and then voting for the bill will be misunderstood \n     because of the complexity of the issues and the subtleties of \n     my rationale.\n       I have been similarly misunderstood in my castigation of \n     the provisions eliminating statutory habeas corpus and court-\n     stripping in the Military Commissions Act and then voting for \n     the bill. I did so, and gave my contemporaneous reasons, \n     because the Act contained many important provisions, such as \n     implementing the Geneva Conventions in accordance with the \n     Supreme Court's Hamdan ruling. The Act also brought the \n     military commissions within Congressional authorization and \n     the law--something the current bill seeks to do for vital \n     intelligence gathering. I said at the time that the Supreme \n     Court would strike the exclusion of habeas corpus, leaving \n     the rest of the Act intact under the severability clause, and \n     that did happen in Boumediene.\n       It is my hope that my colleagues in the Senate and House \n     too would give a little extra consideration to this issue \n     because it is past time for Congress to assert itself and at \n     least leave the courts free to determine constitutional \n     rights and separation of powers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Draft Amendment\n\n       In section 802(b) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978, as added by section 201 of the Act, strike \n     paragraph (1) and insert the following:\n       ``(1) Review of certifications.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     a certification under subsection (a) shall be given effect \n     unless the court finds that such certification is not \n     supported by substantial evidence provided to the court \n     pursuant to this section.\n       ``(B) Covered civil actions.--In a covered civil action \n     relating to assistance alleged to have been provided in \n     connection with an intelligence activity involving \n     communications that was authorized by the President during \n     the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on \n     January 17, 2007, a certification under subsection (a) shall \n     be given effect unless the court--\n       ``(i) finds that such certification is not supported by \n     substantial evidence provided to the court pursuant to this \n     section; or\n       ``(ii) determines that the assistance provided by the \n     applicable electronic communication service provider was \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Floridians are hurting--\nforeclosures are skyrocketing. According to one estimate, at the end of \nMarch 2008, Florida had nearly 200,000 properties in foreclosure. In \nthe first quarter of 2008, Florida had the second highest total of \nforeclosures, nationwide--up 17 percent from the previous quarter and \n178 percent from last year. Statewide, one in every 97 households \nreceived a foreclosure filing. In May, Cape Coral Ft. Myers, Florida, \nhad the second highest foreclosure rate in the Nation, with one in \nevery 79 homes receiving a foreclosure filing. This crisis isn't \nlimited to subprime mortgages or risky borrowers--it destroys the value \nof entire communities. The ripple effect translates into big losses for \nthe State's economy--an estimated $35.9 billion decrease in home value \nand tax base in Florida.\n  I rise to discuss a bipartisan amendment that have filed with my \ncolleague from Minnesota, Senator Coleman. This amendment provides \ncommonsense relief to homeowners trying to stay in their homes and \navoid foreclosure.\n  Current law imposes a 10 percent penalty for individuals choosing to \nmake an early withdrawal from their retirement savings. There are \nexceptions to this penalty: years ago, we allowed first time homeowners \nto use their retirement savings to help purchase a home. Surely, we can \nagree that in 2008 we should allow homeowners to use a small portion of \ntheir savings to save their home.\n  Our amendment waives the 10 percent penalty for folks wishing to make \nan early-withdrawal to help avoid foreclosure. To be eligible for this \nwaiver, homeowners must have proof that they are participating in a \nGovernment or industry sponsored foreclosure prevention program, like \nHOPE NOW, or the HOPE for Homeowners Program established in the bill we \nare considering today. This benefit is limited to 2 years, and the \nwithdrawal amount is capped at $25,000. Taxpayers will also have 2 \nyears to repay what they borrowed from their retirement savings. This \namendment is fully offset.\n  I received an email from Wayne, who lives in Stuart, FL. Wayne is an \nAir Force Veteran who recently lost his job, and in order to try to \nkeep his home, he liquidated his 401(k) savings and paid the 10 percent \npenalty. The housing bill we are considering today gives tax credits \nfor first time homebuyers to purchase homes, but current tax law \npenalizes folks like Wayne, who are trying their best to save their \nhome, using their own money.\n  In many instances, a home is the greatest single source of wealth for \nAmericans. It makes sense to make a limited exception to allow \nhomeowners to use every tool available to stay in that home, and save \ntheir greatest investment. I encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from Florida to \nspeak on behalf of our amendment to allow homeowners penalty-free use \nof up to $25,000 in retirement funds to keep their house.\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\n  Before I speak to the amendment, I would like to thank, first, the \nchairman of the Banking Committee Senator Dodd and ranking member \nSenator Shelby, as well as the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus and ranking member Senator Grassley for their leadership \nin putting this important bipartisan housing bill together. And, I have \nspecial thanks for Senators Baucus and Grassley for working with us one \nthis important amendment.\n  The need to act to address the housing crisis could not be more \nurgent. In my travels throughout my State, I have seen how the housing \ncrisis is hurting families, communities and the economy.\n  Just to underscore how serious this situation really is for the \nMinnesota economy, we learned last week that more Minnesotans are out \nof work than since 1983. We are talking about construction workers of \nwhich nearly 7,000 have lost a job during the past year.\n  We are talking about folks like Ron Enter and his wife whose small \nbuilding materials business is being devastated by the housing crisis. \nThey have already significantly reduced their workforce and warn of \nmore cutbacks if the housing market does not improve in order to keep \ntheir business going.\n  Bottom-line, our housing woes have spilled over into the rest of our \neconomy, and as a result it is a problem that is undercutting entire \ncommunities and their families.\n  This amendment presents a bipartisan solution that's in the spirit of \nthe cooperation demonstrated by Senators Dodd, Shelby, Baucus, and \nGrassley on this housing package.\n  During my travels and housing town hall forums I have held back home \nin Minnesota, I have met more and more folks who are tapping into their \nretirement savings in a desperate effort to keep their homes--average, \nhard-working folks such as Terri Ross, a nurse, who I met at a housing \ntown hall forum in St. Cloud, where she talked about using her \nretirement savings to keep her home.\n  The problem is that as homeowners across Minnesota and the Nation use \ntheir retirement savings to save their homes, they are getting hit hard \nwith a 10-percent early withdrawal tax penalty.\n  As we are on the verge of passing this bipartisan legislation to \naddress the housing crisis, Senator Nelson and I believe that one more \nway we can responsibly address the housing crisis is to temporarily \nwaive this 10 percent penalty. Given that the Tax Code waives the 10 \npercent penalty for early withdraw from individual retirement accounts, \nIRAs, for first-time home purchases, I believe that it is only fair to \nwaive this penalty for those who want to keep their homes.\n  At the end of the day, we should not penalize homeowners for trying \nto keep a roof over their heads and wanting to remain a part of the \ncommunity they have called home.\n  In an effort to address a point of concern raised by the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut when we were on the floor in \nApril, Senators Nelson and I are proposing that this relief be made \navailable only to those homeowners who participate in government or \nindustry sponsored foreclosure prevention programs such as the HOPE for \nHomeowners Program and FHA Secure. We do agree that it would make good \nsense to ensure that lenders also do their part to help homeowners keep \ntheir homes.\n  And, that is why in this amendment, homeowners could only use this \nrelief in cases where the lenders also provide relief. We believe that \nthis is fair and right. We believe that this modification to our \nprevious proposal will ensure there is, to quote the chairman \n``commensurate responsibility on the part of the lender.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense and much-needed \namendment and thank my colleague from Florida for his great work on \nthis amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/23/senate-section/article/S5953-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5953-S5954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN MORTGAGE SECURITIES\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to speak to an amendment that I will \noffer which will increase the trustworthiness of the Nation's mortgage \nsecurity market by creating the Federal Board of Certification for \nmortgage securities.\n  The recent collapse of Bear Stearns and the huge losses suffered \nthroughout the financial industry demonstrate a catastrophic failure to \naccurately assess the dangers of imprudently made subprime mortgages to \nthe American public and our financial markets. In hindsight, it appears \nthat it was the inability to gauge risk in mortgage-backed securities \nthat caused much of this financial turmoil. For markets to operate \nproperly, it is imperative that they have effective metrics for \ncalculating the level of risk securities pose to investors.\n  The secondary mortgage market has been a largely unregulated \nplayground where poorly underwritten, low-quality loans were sold as \nhigh-quality investment products. Although mortgage-backed securities \ncan be a positive market force, which increases the available pool of \ncredit for borrowers, without an accurate picture of the risk involved \nin each mortgage security, buyers have no idea whether they are buying \na high-risk investment or a safe, secure investment. My legislation \nwould work to curb the excesses of the secondary market, combat future \nattempts at deception, and protect investors by making securitized \nmortgage investments more reliable and trustworthy.\n  The inability of major corporations to properly assess the risk of \nthe mortgage securities they were trading is a problem whose effects \nhave not been confined to Wall Street. To put it simply: When big banks \nsneeze, the rest of America gets a cold. By 2009, more than a trillion \ndollars of the subprime mortgages originated during the housing boom \nwill reset to higher interest rates. Currently, according to the \nMortgage Bankers Association, 43 percent of subprime adjustable rate \nmortgages are already in foreclosure. In my home State of Maine, we are \nstruggling with falling home prices and a record number of \nforeclosures. Some Maine borrowers, with rising monthly payments, are \nunable to refinance out of their predatory loans. Small business \nowners, many already hurt by the economic downturn, are also finding \ncredit tight. The bad economic climate caused by the subprime credit \ncrunch is roiling the stock market causing Americans to loose billions \nin their IRAs and retirement funds.\n  We need to fix this crisis before it gets any worse and make sure it \nnever happens again. Francis Bacon said that ``knowledge is power.'' My \namendment would give investors the knowledge to make intelligent \ncalculations of risk and, as a result, it would give them the power to \ndecide how much risk they could collectively handle.\n  Turning to specifics, my amendment creates the Federal Board of \nCertification, which would certify that the mortgages within a security \ninstrument meet the underlying standards they claim in regards to \ndocumentation, loan-to-value ratios, debt service to income ratios, and \nborrowers' credit standards. The purpose of the certification process \nis to increase the transparency, predictability, and reliability of \nsecuritized mortgage products. Certification would aid in creating \nsettled investor expectations and increase transparency by ensuring \nthat the mortgages within a mortgage security conform to the claims \nmade by the mortgage product's sellers.\n  The proposed Federal Board of Certification would not override any \ncurrent regulations and would not, in any way, stifle any attempts by \nprivate business to rate mortgage securities., This legislation would, \nhowever, create incentives for improving industry rating practices. \nOpen publication of the board's certification criteria would augment \nthe efforts of private ratings agencies by providing incentives for \nincreased transparency in the ratings process. The board's \ncertification would also serve as a check on the industry to ensure \nthat ratings agencies carefully scrutinize the content of mortgage \nproducts before issuing evaluations of mortgage-backed securities.\n  Significantly, the Federal Board of Certification would also be \nvoluntary and funded by an excise tax. Users could choose to pay the \ncosts for the board to rate their security, or they could elect not to \nsubmit their product to the board.\n  We must quickly restore confidence in the U.S. mortgage securities if \nwe are to stabilize our housing markets\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\nand enable families to refinance their expensive loans. To do this, we \nmust certify the quality and content of our mortgage securities and \nenable those markets working again to create liquidity and lending. \nThis is why it is urgent to create the Federal Board of Certification \nfor mortgage securities. This legislation would create a ``good \nhousekeeping seal of approval'' for the mortgage security industry and \ncertify that the mortgage products are in fact what they claim to be. \nAccordingly, I call on Congress to take up and adopt this commonsense \namendment as expeditiously as possible.\n  I encourage my colleagues to strongly support the creation of the \nFederal Board of Certification. This legislation will restore trust in \nU.S. financial markets and mortgage securities which will help American \nbusinesses and ultimately, most crucially, American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/23/senate-section/article/S5954-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5954-S5955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF MICHAEL E. O'NEILL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now ask consent that my next remarks be \nlabeled nomination of Michael E. O'Neill for the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am pleased to submit my very strong recommendation to \nmy colleagues to confirm the nomination of Michael E. O'Neill for the \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. The President submitted \nhis name last Thursday. I had tried to come to the floor to speak at \nthat time but could not do so.\n  I am pleased to do so now. Michael O'Neill has an extraordinary \nrecord. He graduated summa cum laude from Brigham Young University and \nreceived his law degree from Yale Law School. He was editor of the \nArticles and Book Reviews of the Yale Law Journal; and Articles Editor \nof the Yale Journal on Regulation.\n  He served as a law clerk to Judge David Sentelle and clerked for the \nSupreme Court of the United States for Justice Clarence Thomas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his full resume be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Michael E. O'Neill\n\n\n       United States District Court for the District of Columbia\n\n       Birth: 1962, Wisconsin.\n       Legal Residence: Maryland.\n       Education: B.A., summa cum laude, Brigham Young University, \n     1987; J.D., Yale Law School, 1990--Editor of Articles and \n     Book Reviews, Yale Law Journal; Articles Editor, Yale Journal \n     on Regulation.\n       Employment: Law Clerk, Honorable David B. Sentelle, United \n     States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit, \n     1990-1991; Litigation Counsel, Honors Program, Appellate \n     Section, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 1991-\n     1994; Special Assistant United States Attorney, United States \n     Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, 1993; Special \n     Counsel, Detailee from Dept. of Justice, Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, 1994-1996; Law Clerk, \n     Honorable Clarence Thomas, United States Supreme Court, 1996-\n     1997; General Counsel, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \n     Orrin Hatch, 1997-1998; Associate Professor of Law, George \n     Mason University School of Law, 1998-present; Commissioner, \n     United States Sentencing Commission, 1999-2005; Chief Counsel \n     and Staff Director, Senate Judiciary Committee, 2005-2007.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is especially worthwhile to have Mr. O'Neill \nconfirmed because of the example it sets for people who come to \nundertake public service. Mr. O'Neill served on the Judiciary Committee \nfor a protracted period of time. When Senator Hatch was the Chairman, \nhe was special counsel from 1994 to 1996 and general counsel from 1997 \nto 1998, before he became associate professor of law at George Mason \nUniversity School of Law; and he served as chief counsel and staff \ndirector for the 2 years I served as Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I do not need a resume to tell people how competent he is and how \npublic spirited he is and what an outstanding Federal judge he would \nmake.\n  There have been quite a number of situations where people working on \nthe Judiciary Committee have gone on to Federal judgeships. I think it \nis a very healthy thing to have that as a motivation to come for public \nservice. People have come to serve on the Judiciary Committee, leaving \njobs making half a million dollars or more for $100,000. The public \nservice is so important that it is exemplary to give them this \nrecognition to motivate our people to come to take these jobs.\n  One example I would note is Stephen Breyer, who was special counsel \nand chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee back in 1980 for \nthen-Chairman Ted Kennedy. Mr. Breyer was then appointed on the First \nCircuit and is now on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this table be included in the Record \nshowing the movement of people who have served on the Judiciary \nCommittee and the jobs which they have taken in other Federal \npositions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Previous                            Nomination         Date         Date\n             Name                  position(s)          Senator           position       nominated    confirmed\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeryl Howell..................

Madam President, this year marks the celebration of \nthe 200th anniversary of the Diocese of Bardstown, which was \nestablished in Kentucky as one of the oldest dioceses in the country. \nPope Pius VII carved it from one of the oldest dioceses in the New \nWorld.\n  The territory of the Bardstown Diocese once covered a giant swath of \nland, including what are now the States of Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, \nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri, and half of \nArkansas.\n  The Bardstown Diocese was established alongside the dioceses of \nBoston, Philadelphia and New York. Its seat was eventually moved to \nLouisville, Kentucky, and made an archdiocese. But its place in the \nhistory of American Catholicism continues to be a point of pride across \nKentucky.\n  Kentuckians celebrate this bicentennial throughout the year at the \nSt. Thomas Church, considered the ``Cradle of Catholicism'' in the \nBluegrass State and still located in Bardstown. A two-story log house \nthat stands on St. Thomas property is the oldest structure related to \nthe Catholic faith in our region of the United States.\n  Built in 1795 by Thomas and Ann Howard, the property was willed to \nthe church by Mr. Howard in 1810, and it became the first home of the \nSt. Thomas Seminary, the first seminary west of the Alleghenies. It \nlater served as the residence of Bishop Benedict Joseph Flaget, first \nbishop of the Bardstown Diocese.\n  Bishop Flaget and others who worked to establish the Bardstown \nDiocese were pioneers of the land as well as of the spirit. Kentucky \nwas the western frontier of the young United States at that time, and \nfrontier life posed many hardships.\n  But the diocese survived and thrived, and the visit of Pope Benedict \nXVI to the United States earlier this year was timed to coincide with \nits anniversary.\n  Madam President, Kentucky is proud to include one of the oldest \noutposts of faith and freedom in America. I ask unanimous consent that \na story from the Louisville Courier-Journal about the celebration of \nthe Bardstown Diocese's anniversary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Apr. 9, 2008]\n\n Catholics Celebrate Kentucky Bicentennial, Bardstown Events Mark 200 \n                                 Years\n\n                            (By Peter Smith)\n\n       Bardstown, Ky.--Dorothy Ballard and her sister Martha \n     Willett have been coming to St. Thomas Church, considered the \n     ``cradle of Catholicism'' in Kentucky, all their lives.\n       Their parents were married there in 1920, and ``all of the \n     children have been baptized here, made the first Communion \n     here, confirmed here,'' and several of them have been buried \n     from the parish, Ballard said.\n       So they weren't missing yesterday morning's Mass that began \n     a daylong celebration of the bicentennial of the Archdiocese \n     of Louisville, where about 150 people filled the historic \n     brick church.\n       ``I feel real special that I'm part of this celebration,'' \n     Ballard said.\n       Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz presided at the Mass.\n       ``We pause and give thanks to the Lord for these 200 years \n     of blessed presence of the church within our Central \n     Kentucky, and we ask the Lord to continue to bless us as we \n     move forward,'' he said.\n       The archdiocese also marked the bicentennial yesterday with \n     services at the Cathedral of the Assumption in downtown \n     Louisville and at the Basilica of St. Joseph Proto-Cathedral \n     in Bardstown.\n       St. Thomas was chosen to lead off the celebration because \n     the log house that still stands on its property once was the \n     modest capital of frontier Catholicism.\n       Pope Pius VII created the Diocese of Bardstown on April 8, \n     1808, along with those in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. \n     Previously, the diocese of Baltimore had covered the entire \n     new American republic.\n       The Bardstown diocese originally spanned the entire \n     frontier area between the Alleghenies and the Mississippi \n     River, and between the Great Lakes and Tennessee.\n       The seat of the Bardstown diocese eventually was moved to \n     Louisville, which later became an archdiocese. Its original \n     territory is now divided into more than 40 dioceses across 10 \n     states.\n       The Rev. Steve Pohl, pastor of St. Thomas, said he and many \n     parishioners trace their roots to those pioneer days, when \n     Catholic families of English descent migrated from Maryland \n     to Kentucky in search of better land. They were served by \n     priests fleeing persecution that followed the French \n     Revolution.\n       Their settlements in Nelson, Washington and Marion counties \n     gave the region the nickname ``the Holy Land,'' as attested \n     to by such enduring biblical place names as Holy Cross, \n     Gethsemani and Nazareth.\n       St. Thomas is home to a recently restored log home, owned \n     by Catholic farmers Thomas and Ann Howard and given to the \n     church as a base for the growing diocese.\n       The diocese's first bishop, Benedict Joseph Flaget, lived \n     there for several years, and the\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\n     house also was host for Kentucky's first Catholic seminary \n     and the first nuns in the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth.\n       ``I'm really in joy about today,'' said John Cissell, who \n     traces his roots to early Catholic settlers here. His father \n     was long active in the church and is buried in the cemetery \n     on the church grounds.\n       ``I just feel like I'm carrying on a tradition,'' he said.\n       Pohl, whose ancestors also include an early settler, said \n     the parish is holding a reunion this summer of descendents of \n     Maryland Catholics who settled in Kentucky in the early \n     years.\n       Pope Benedict XVI will recognize the bicentennials of \n     Louisville's and other historic dioceses at a Mass at Yankee \n     Stadium in New York on April 20.\n       The archdiocese also plans a large celebration at Slugger \n     Field in Louisville this summer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/23/senate-section/article/S5956-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SALUTE TO ``CORM & THE COACH''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I started looking at the financial \nrelationships between physicians and drug companies several years ago. \nI first began this inquiry by examining payments to individuals who \nserved on FDA's Advisory Boards. More recently, I began looking at \npayments from drug companies to professors at our nation's medical \nschools and more specifically at the payments from Astra Zeneca to a \nprofessor of psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati.\n  I then moved on to look at several psychiatrists at Harvard and Mass \nGeneral Hospital. These physicians are some of the top psychiatrists in \nthe country, and their research is some of the most important in the \nfield. They have also taken millions of dollars from the drug companies \nand failed to report those payments accurately to Harvard and Mass \nGeneral.\n  For instance, in 2000 the National Institutes of Health awarded one \nHarvard physician a grant to study atomoxetine in children. At that \ntime, this physician disclosed that he received less than $10,000 in \npayments from Eli Lilly which makes Straterra, a brand name of \natomoxetine. But Eli Lilly reported that it paid this same physician \nmore than $14,000 for advisory services that year--a difference of at \nleast $4,000.\n  I would now like to report what I have found out about another \nresearcher--Dr. Alan Schatzberg at Stanford. In the late nineties, Dr. \nSchatzberg helped to start a company called Corcept Therapeutics--Dr. \nSchatzberg is a copatent owner on a drug developed by Corcept. That \ncompany applied to the Food and Drug Administration for approval to \nmarket Mifepristone for psychotic depression.\n  Dr. Schatzberg is a well-known psychiatrist and has received several \ngrants from the National Institutes of Health to study Mifepristone. \nWhile Dr. Schatzberg has reported some of his income from Corcept \nTherapeutics to Stanford, he did not report a profit of $109,179 from \nthe sale of 15,597 shares of Corcept stock on August 15, 2005 because \nhe was not required to do that under Stanford's rules.\n  But if it is not required by Stanford, I submit to you that it should \nbe. Why? Because in his Stanford disclosures, Dr. Schatzberg only had \nto report whether he had more than $100,000 of stock in Corcept \nTherapeutics. However, his filings with the U.S. Securities and \nExchange Commission show that he has control of 2,738,749 shares of \nCorcept stock worth over $6 million.\n  In addition, in 2002 Dr. Schatzberg did not report any income from \nJohnson & Johnson, but the company reported to me that it paid Dr. \nSchatzberg $22,000 that year. And in 2004, Dr. Schatzberg reported \nreceiving between $10,000-$50,000 from Eli Lilly. But Eli Lilly \nreported to me that they paid Dr. Schaztberg over $52,000 that year.\n  Before closing, I would like to say that Stanford has been very \ncooperative in this investigation, as have been many of the drug \ncompanies. I ask unanimous consent to have my letter to Stanford \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2008.\n     Dr. John L.

The actions taken by \n     thought leaders, like those at Stanford, often have a \n     profound impact upon the decisions made by taxpayer funded \n     programs like Medicare and Medicaid and the way that patients \n     are treated and taxpayer funds expended.\n       Moreover, and as has been detailed in several studies and \n     news reports, funding by pharmaceutical companies can \n     influence scientific studies, continuing medical education, \n     and the prescribing patterns of doctors. Because I am \n     concerned that there has been little transparency on this \n     matter, I have sent letters to almost two dozen research \n     universities across the United States regarding about 30 \n     physicians. In these letters, I asked questions about the \n     conflict of interest disclosure forms signed by some of their \n     faculty. As you know universities like Stanford require \n     doctors to report their related outside income. But I am \n     concerned that these requirements are sometimes disregarded.\n       I have also been taking a keen interest in the almost $24 \n     billion annually appropriated to the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH) to fund grants at various institutions such as \n     Stanford. Institutions are required to manage a grantee's \n     conflicts of interest. However, I am learning that this task \n     is made difficult because physicians do not consistently \n     report all the payments received from drug companies.\n       To bring some greater transparency to this issue, Senator \n     Kohl and I introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act \n     (Act). This Act will require drug companies to report \n     publicly any payments that they make to doctors, within \n     certain parameters.\n       I am also writing to assess the implementation of financial \n     disclosure policies at Stanford University. In response to my \n     letter of October 25, 2007, Stanford provided me with copies \n     of the financial disclosure reports that Dr. Alan Schatzberg \n     filed during the period of January 2000 through June 2007.\n       My staff investigators carefully reviewed each of Dr. \n     Schatzberg's disclosure forms and detailed the payments \n     disclosed. Subsequently, I asked that Stanford confirm the \n     accuracy of the information. In March 2008, Stanford's Vice \n     Provost and Dean of Research provided clarifications and \n     additional information from Dr. Schatzberg pursuant to my \n     inquiry.\n       In addition to obtaining information from Stanford, I also \n     contacted executives at several major pharmaceutical and \n     device companies and asked them to list the payments that \n     they made to Dr. Schatzberg during the years 2000 through \n     2007. These companies voluntarily and cooperatively reported \n     additional payments that do not appear to have been disclosed \n     to Stanford by Dr. Schatzberg. For instance, in 2002 Dr. \n     Schatzberg did not report any income from Johnson & Johnson, \n     but the company reported to me that it paid Dr. Schatzberg \n     $22,000 that year. And in 2004, Dr. Schatzberg reported \n     receiving between $10,000-$50,000 from Eli Lilly. But Eli \n     Lilly reported to me that they paid Dr. Schatzberg over \n     $52,000 that year.\n       Because these disclosures do not match, I am attaching a \n     chart intended to provide to Stanford a few examples of the \n     data reported to me. This chart contains columns showing the \n     payments disclosed in the forms Dr. Schatzberg filed with \n     Stanford and the amounts reported by several drug and device \n     companies.\n       The lack of consistency between what Dr. Schatzberg \n     reported to Stanford and what several drug companies reported \n     to me seems to follow a pattern of behavior. More \n     specifically, I have uncovered inconsistent reporting \n     patterns at the University of Cincinnati, and at Harvard \n     University and Mass General Hospital.\n\n                     Institutional and NIH Policies\n\n       Let me now turn to another matter that is of concern. \n     Stanford requires every faculty member to make an annual \n     disclosure related to both conflict of commitment (where no \n     financial information is requested), and conflict of \n     interest. As noted to me in your letter dated March 14, 2008, \n     ``It is our obligation to avoid bias in research, including \n     that conducted with federal funds.''\n       Based upon the information provided to me to date, Stanford \n     has a zero dollar threshold for disclosures for research \n     involving human subjects. Faculty members are required to \n     disclose a range of amounts received from outside \n     relationships that are related to a faculty member's research \n     activities (such as participation on advisory boards or \n     boards of directors, or consulting). In most instances, the \n     University's standard for a significant financial interest is \n     whether the faculty member received $10,000 or more in \n     income, holds $10,000 or more in equity for publicly traded \n     companies, or has any equity in the company in the event the \n     company is privately held.\n       Further, federal regulations place several requirements on \n     a university/hospital when its researchers apply for NIH \n     grants. These regulations are intended to ensure a level of \n     objectivity in publicly funded research, and state in \n     pertinent part that NIH investigators must disclose to their \n     institution any ``significant financial interest'' may appear \n     to affect the results of a study. NIH interprets \n     ``significant financial interest'' to mean at least $10,000 \n     in value or 5 percent ownership in a single entity.\n       Again based upon the information provided to me, it appears \n     that Stanford takes failures to report outside income quite \n     seriously. As noted in your correspondence dated March 14, \n     2008, ``It is our obligation to avoid bias in research, \n     including that conducted with federal funds.'' You then \n     described a Stanford investigation conducted in 2006 \n     regarding a researcher who failed to report gifts, meals and \n     trips from a device company. That faculty member was later \n     terminated.\n       Based upon information available to me, it appears that Dr. \n     Schatzberg received numerous NIH grants to conduct studies \n     involving Mifepristone for treating depression. Corcept \n     Therapeutics, a publicly traded company, has applied to the \n     Food and Drug Administration for approval to market \n     Mifepristone for psychotic depression. These grants funded \n     studies during the years 2000 through 2007 that examined the \n     treatment of psychotic major depression using Mifepristone. \n     During these years, Dr. Schatzberg, consistent with \n     Stanford's conflict policy, disclosed to Stanford a financial \n     relationship with Corcept Therapeutics (Corcept) including \n     stock ownership of over $100,000 and payments for activities \n     including its Board of Directors, Advisory Board Membership, \n     consulting, licensing agreements, and royalties. According to \n     his disclosures, these payments were between $50,000 to \n     $100,000 in the years 2003 through 2005, and between $10,000 \n     to $50,000 in the years 2001, 2002, 2006, and 2007.\n       However, it appears based upon the information available, \n     Dr. Schatzberg did not and was not required to report a \n     profit of $109,179 from the sale of 15,597 shares of Corcept \n     stock on August 15, 2005. This transaction is found in his \n     publicly available filings with the U.S. Securities and \n     Exchange Commission (SEC). Earlier that year, Dr. Schatzberg \n     began enrolling an estimated 100 patients for a clinical \n     trial, sponsored by the NIH, to evaluate Mifepristone to \n     treat psychotic depression.\n       Further, while Dr. Schatzberg appropriately disclosed to \n     Stanford that his stock shares were valued at over $100,000, \n     I am not certain that this number captures the stocks' true \n     value. Dr. Schatzberg carries an equity interest in Corcept \n     with over 2 million shares of stock. For instance, as of \n     January 31, 2008, he reported to the SEC that he held \n     2,438,749 shares of Corcept stock, with sole voting power \n     for 2,738,749 shares. On June 12, 2008, Corcept stock \n     closed at $2.24 a share, meaning that his stock is \n     potentially worth over $6 million. Obviously, $6 million \n     is a dramatically higher number than $100,000 and I am \n     concerned that Stanford may not have been able to \n     adequately monitor the degree of Dr. Schatzberg's \n     conflicts of interest with its current disclosure policies \n     and submit to you that these policies should be re-\n     examined.\n       In light of the information set forth above, I ask your \n     continued cooperation in examining conflicts of interest. In \n     my opinion, institutions across the United States must be \n     able to rely on the representations of its faculty to ensure \n     the integrity of medicine, academia, and the grant-making \n     process. And the NIH must rely on strong institutional \n     conflict of interest policies to ensure the integrity of the \n     grant making process. At the same time, should the Physician \n     Payments Sunshine Act become law, institutions like yours \n     will be able to access a database that will set forth the \n     payments made to all doctors, including your faculty members.\n       Accordingly, I request that Stanford respond to the \n     following questions and requests for information. For each \n     response, please repeat the enumerated request and follow \n     with the appropriate answer.\n       1. For each of the NIH grants received by Dr. Schatzberg, \n     please confirm that he reported to Stanford University's \n     designated official ``the existence of [a] conflicting \n     interest.'' Please provide separate responses for each grant \n     received for the period from January 1, 2000 to the present, \n     and provide any supporting documentation for each grant \n     identified.\n       2. For each grant identified above, please explain how \n     Stanford ensured ``that the interest has been managed, \n     reduced, or eliminated.'' Please provide an individual \n     response for each grant that Dr. Schatzberg received from \n     January 2000 to the present, and provide any documentation \n     supporting each claim.\n       3. Did Dr. Schatzberg violate any federal or Stanford \n     policies by not revealing his stock sale in 2005? If not, why \n     not?\n       4. Is Stanford considering any changes in its disclosure \n     policies to more fully capture the degree of a conflict when \n     a faculty member owns shares in a company that are in excess \n     of $100,000?\n       5. Please report on the status of any possible reviews of \n     research misconduct and/or discrepancies in disclosures by \n     Dr. Schatzberg, including what action if any will be \n     considered.\n       6. Please report if a determination can be made as to \n     whether or not Dr. Schatzberg violated guidelines governing \n     clinical trials and the need to report conflicts of interest \n     to an institutional review board (IRB). Please respond by \n     naming each clinical trial for which the doctor was the \n     principal investigator, along with confirmation that \n     conflicts of interest were reported, if possible.\n       7. Please provide a total dollar figure for all NIH monies \n     received annually by Stanford University. This request covers \n     the period of 2000 through 2007.\n       8. Please provide a list of all NIH grants received by \n     Stanford University. This request covers the period of 2000 \n     through 2007. For each grant please provide the following:\n       a. Primary Investigator;\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\n       b. Grant Title;\n       c. Grant number;\n       d. Brief description; and\n       e.

Madam President, earlier this week, I asked Idahoans to \nshare with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and \nthey responded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate.gov to the \nCongressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mike, Thanks for the invitation to vent. Well, that is not \n     what you asked, but here goes. I'm one of those poor widows \n     living on Social Security supplemented by a little bit of \n     freelance writing, and energy costs are increasingly adding \n     to sleepless nights as I worry about how to keep going. Do \n     not cue the violins.\n       I agree with your points on increasing our energy \n     independence, and believe that we are indeed stewards of the \n     earth who will be held accountable by our Creator for how we \n     manage it. I contend that these two points are not mutually \n     exclusive, and who better than the great people of the United \n     States to figure out how to do it.\n       I'm also interested in understanding how futures markets \n     play into the increased cost of gasoline--anything you can \n     tell me about that? Further, how about drastic changes to the \n     red tape required to get nuclear plants up and running?\n       One last thing: If you have any influence with Senator John \n     McCain, please use it to encourage him to come up with an \n     aggressive energy policy post haste and present it to the \n     voters. If ever there were a time, this is it, and he needs \n     all the help he can get from those of us who are supporting \n     him out of common-sense duty rather than devotion. Help, \n     help.\n       Thanks for your ear and I hope this gets to you and not \n     only your staff.\n     Kathy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Mike, My family and I are making choices to limit our \n     expenses as is rational, but we have means and discretionary \n     income to juggle. My wife who is a public school \n     administrator tells a different story regarding some of the \n     pupils she sees right now in her summer school programs. They \n     are showing up to school without breakfast, without a lunch, \n     and no money to even buy snacks. Her schools have not offered \n     free and reduced meals for summer school in the past (did not \n     need to), but are trying desperately to do so now. Their \n     parents, many of whom are working lower-paid jobs, are making \n     very hard choices.\n       Think of the lowest paid tier of workers in our economy. \n     They may not live in comfortable neighborhoods close to their \n     work. Often they drive cars that are affordable up front, but \n     get deplorable gas mileage thereafter. Forget insurance of \n     any kind. In an economy like ours where housing starts and \n     services are down, many of these fathers are working less \n     hours and driving further away to get them. The choices are \n     becoming untenable.\n       I realize that some of the hesitation to address energy in \n     America is part social engineering (which in my opinion is \n     the realm of the passive-aggressive and grossly \n     irresponsible), and part is Washington's age-old reluctance \n     to govern proactively rendering it ineffectual in matters \n     that matter. But, many of your constituents cannot coast \n     through this crisis until it sorts itself out. Worse, the \n     inaction of your colleagues gives\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\n     us very little hope that our crisis is temporary (if nothing \n     changes, nothing changes).\n       A perfect storm is brewing for our economy; government \n     needs to allow the free market and investors opportunities to \n     produce more energy. Aside from ANWR, there are plenty of \n     places in the lower 48 to bring online (as well as refining \n     capacity) to adress this muddle in less than 10 years. Tell \n     your colleagues to lead, follow, or get out of the way!\n       In the short-term we are going to see more foreclosures, \n     dependency on state and federal aid, and hospitals like ours \n     will see bad debt and charity care skyrocket. Not a time for \n     inaction. Thanks for your interest in this cause, I hope you \n     are able to rally the millionaire's club to some kind of \n     rational response.\n     Rev. Mark, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       You and Congress know what needs to be done. Drill now--\n     drill HERE! Join China and Cuba off our own shores and become \n     self reliant again. Start drilling in Anwar. Start drilling \n     in Montana. Start using the resources in Colorado in shale. \n     And build more refineries--and you--CONGRESS--loosen the \n     hurdles that make it impossible for anyone drilling and/or \n     building those refineries we need so desperately--loosen the \n     restrictions that hinder providing alternatives (such as \n     nuclear and solar). Stop wasting time telling ``stories''--\n     and loosen the restrictions that environmentalists have \n     shackled us with! Do your job.\n       Just let us become a self reliant nation again!\n     Dave.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, This is a Republic! We elected you and you \n     fellow Congress men and women to represent us. So far all my \n     family has seen is a lot of incompetency! No one in Congress \n     has done anything to help the situation. Everyone is geared \n     up to their special interests so that they can get re-elected \n     to another term. You guys need to kick the lobbyist out of \n     the halls of Congress and start representing us. My family \n     cannot take trips to see fellow family members, an event that \n     takes place each year, because we cannot afford the fuel \n     costs. Put yourselves in a private room and figure this thing \n     out without any outside forces influencing you. If you cannot \n     do this, resign, and let us find someone who can. I \n     personally do not care if it is nuclear power or Anwar or \n     raising standards for the auto industry or rationing gas. \n     Protect our environment but try to get us out of this mess \n     and solve this problem. You guys are below President Bush in \n     positive polling.\n       Do not you get it???\n     Don, Star.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Sir: My wife and I are retired and had planned to \n     enjoy our retirement years by traveling all over the great \n     state of Idaho and see the attractions we did not have time \n     to see when I was employed. This included taking our boat out \n     on the great lakes and rivers during Idaho's hot summers.\n       Now with the combination of high property taxes in Boise, \n     and high fuel prices, we are unable to realize our retirement \n     dreams. The property taxes are going to force us out of our \n     home in which we have lived for 15 years and the high fuel \n     prices will force us to stay at home.\n       We can no longer afford to take vacations to Yellowstone \n     and the other National Parks. We cannot visit my two sons \n     located in San Francisco and Texas. We cannot afford to drive \n     our diesel truck so our boat towing days in McCall are over \n     with.\n       The do nothing Congress has once again lived up to its name \n     with respect to energy. As you know, the US has huge oil \n     reserves off shore along both coastlines, huge deposits of \n     oil in the the Alaskan arctic, but the useless Congress will \n     not lift a finger to allow for exploration of this oil. This \n     forces us all to be held captive by the Middle East, Mexico, \n     and Venezuela since we are so dependent on their oil. The \n     Democrats in Congress place a higher value on politics and \n     listening to the tree hugger and special interest group \n     minorities than on the wishes of the vast middle class of \n     Americans who want the US to be more self sufficient in oil.\n       We have vast coal reserves which cannot be used for the \n     same reasons.\n       I am opposed to the use of nuclear power due to the nuclear \n     waste disposal problem and Congress reluctance to open Yucca \n     Flats.\n       Please--cannot you do something to allow drilling on our \n     own land to rid us of our dependency on the Middle East?\n           Yours truly,\n     Ed and Carol, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       What's the matter with all the Bozos in Washington? As they \n     sit finely with all of their ``not hard-earned'' tax dollars \n     paying them for what? They sure have screwed up America. \n     Special interests, etc . . . We have our own energy sources \n     right here, right now. Let's use it. . . . NOW!!! The polar \n     bear is on the brink of extinction? I do not think so, since \n     their population has increased from 5000 to 35000 worldwide \n     in the last 25 years. Why we let the elite enviromentalists \n     erode our backbone in America is beyond me. Stupid \n     politicians have no idea what it means to live paycheck to \n     paycheck. I have no idea how I can afford furnace oil for \n     next winter. There is no way I can pay these prices for \n     furnace oil, let alone gasoline for the cars. It gets damn \n     cold here in the winter and last winter lasted like 9 \n     months. Tell those asses sitting on their asses to get off \n     their asses and open up our country to what we have \n     available right here. . . . Do I sound mad?? No kidding. . \n     . . I am sick of politicians being stupid. Time to stand \n     up and take our country back. Time to weed out the enemy \n     within. Time to do what we should do and be self \n     sufficient as a country.\n     Maggie.\n                                  ____\n\n       I could not agree with you more that Congress needs to get \n     moving and do something productive about our country's energy \n     plan. Should we increase our own domestic production--\n     absolutely. ANWR, offshore drilling etc should be used \n     immediately. Enough of the environmentalists blocking every \n     attempt to increase our own production. Nuclear power is a \n     no-brainer. We have the proven technology to produce clean \n     efficient fuel. Again, enough of the environmentalists trying \n     to block every move to store the nuclear waste. How many \n     100's of millions of dollars have already been spent on Yucca \n     Mountain to use it for the safe storage of nuclear waste--\n     let's use it!! Wind and solar are definitely alternatives but \n     being able to produce the quantity of power we need may not \n     be reality. Use them to supplement more reliable sources such \n     as Nuclear.\n       In summary it is time we take back our own country and for \n     Congress to do something--leading, not political bickering, \n     would be a refreshing idea.\n       Thank you\n     Dale, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       We do not want nuclear!!\n       Idaho is already a dumping ground. Nuclear is dirty, dirty \n     energy!\n       Nuclear waste issues must be resolved first.\n       Stick to wind, solar, clean and renewable energy.\n     Yvette.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, Increased domestic oil production or an \n     expanded nuclear energy research are not the best directions \n     for Idaho or the country. If we are talking about the health \n     of our land and people then we should concentrate our \n     research dollars on technical innovation and alternative \n     energies. Just one outcome of technological innovation, the \n     Toyota Prius, has saved more oil in a few years then we would \n     get in over twenty years of drilling in the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge. Idaho has incredible alternative resources \n     available. With thermal waters less than a mile below surface \n     throughout the state, we would be an excellent choice for \n     leading the nation in geothermal energy. We have desert areas \n     of the state where the sun shines almost 365 days a year, and \n     plains areas where we could harvest wind power.\n       We do not need lower gas taxes. We need better public \n     transportation. We need leadership that encourages \n     conservation. We need investment in education and research \n     that has the promise of providing a future for our children \n     that is not dependent on nations who do not have our best \n     interests in mind. We have always had independent minds in \n     Idaho. Lets have clean, sustainable energy independence as \n     well.\n     Patricia.\n                                  ____\n\n       The rate of increase in fossil fuel cost is unprecedented \n     and demonstrates that the current administration and prior \n     congresses have failed the American Citizens and for that \n     matter the world by not properly addressing this issue. The \n     energy crises has been a long time in the making and many \n     good people, much of the scientific community and a rare \n     politician or two (i.e. Al Gore) have been trying to do \n     something.\n       I recently bought a home and am watching a minimum of $100/\n     week in fuel cost going to the moving. This has been going on \n     for a few months and will do so for a few more. I rarely take \n     trips from my home in the Lenore and Orofino area to Lewiston \n     to shop. It is just too expensive. Plus the cost of \n     everything else is ramping up due to the fuel cost increases. \n     It saddens me that so much profit is being realized by a few. \n     The economic profits are being controlled and directed to \n     those who also control the flow of public resources. This is \n     capitalism at its worst.\n       Throughout your career, you have demonstrated an \n     indifference to the problem and have associated yourself with \n     those who mischaracterized environmentalists rather than \n     working with them. Your rating by the League of Conservation \n     Voters is a paltry 13% for this year! Now you want to say you \n     are on the same side. Do you really think we can believe or \n     trust you? The biggest part of conservation is reducing \n     demand--not simply looking to pump up more carbon from \n     fragile environments. I think it would be best if you step \n     aside and allow a new generation of thinkers without your \n     baggage and not linked to pollution-generating industries to \n     take the lead.\n       If you truly want to see all America and the world prosper \n     in the future it will take a commitment on your part, to \n     accept a change in the cultures of people, corporations, and \n     government--away from use-up, me only, and profits as the \n     bottom line, to a sustainable economy within the framework of \n     a sustainable healthy environment. This, obviously, does not \n     detract from a major goal of this nation--the pursuit of \n     happiness. Happiness is a personal issue that is influenced \n     by outside factors. Consumerism has made many people believe \n     that more leads to happiness, but the experience of the last \n     half century should speak for itself. Some of the old values \n     such as free time, time with family and friends, having \n     simple hobbies, pursuing knowledge, etc are all examples of \n     low environmental impact ways to be happy.\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\n       I wish you the best in your retirement and commend you on \n     your career. Encourage your grandchildren to follow a new \n     path.\n     Tom.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a travel writer and photographer, I am usually on the go \n     much of the time. It used to be nothing to travel a day or \n     two by car to go do a story somewhere for one of the many \n     magazines I write for. But now, due to the high cost of \n     gasoline, I've got to really look at the distances I have to \n     travel because of the high cost of gasoline. There are story \n     opportunities I have to turn down not because of the distance \n     itself, but because of the cost of gasoline to cover that \n     distance.\n       I am retired, so it is not about making a lot of money. If \n     my travel costs are less than what I'll be paid for the \n     articles and photography, I'll usually go do the story. It \n     has been like I'm always on vacation. But now, the travel \n     costs are becoming so expensive it's becoming harder every \n     day to except assignments that require extensive driving to \n     destinations to do the articles. My happy style of travel and \n     retirement are coming to a fast close because of gas prices.\n       My dream when I retired in 1998 was to see as much of the \n     United States as possible and be on the road exploring the \n     unique places I never got around to while I was working. I \n     thought I might even do a book like John Steinbeck did, \n     ``Travels With Charlie'', and illustrate it with my \n     photography from around the United States. Well, that is down \n     the tubes as well.\n       Whenever I leave the house to go somewhere, I have to make \n     sure that I get three or four things done on the trip so as \n     not to waste gas. It has become a real struggle. I feel sorry \n     for the people that have to drive far every day to go to \n     work, it has got to be knocking them for a loop with the \n     price of gas what it is.\n     Jerry.\n                                  ____\n\n       I think we desperately need an energy policy that will \n     utilize our own proven oil and gas reserves. I blame congress \n     in part for the current high energy prices due their \n     continually politicizing the adoption of a workable national \n     energy policy.\n     Mel, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I live in Ashton, Idaho, and drive to Idaho Falls to teach \n     at Idaho State University, so the cost of gas matters. Yet, I \n     also welcome the high costs of gasoline if it forces us to an \n     awareness of how destructive burning fossil fuels is and \n     forces us to change. I absolutely oppose more production of \n     fossil fuels, and urge you to take alternative energy sources \n     seriously: wind, solar, and support these with the kind of \n     subsidies you so easily give to agriculture. Above all, it is \n     time to do something about public transportation, especially \n     the restoration of rail services to rural areas, or support \n     for connecting Idaho to Portland/Denver. Give Idaho \n     transportation alternatives, rather than working within the \n     same addiction to automobiles and fossil fuels. My ``story'' \n     is outrage that government has given so little thought to \n     alternatives.\n     Darrell.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, I strongly believe our efforts to \n     address these energy costs should be concentrated on getting \n     more use out of clean, renewable energy that is already \n     available. Most of us could go a great deal further in our \n     energy conservation efforts; incentives might help. There is \n     already a great deal available in wind and solar energy, I \n     think that with incentives to utilize them and research money \n     directed at improving them we can start to establish a \n     sustainable energy usage for the long term.\n       Increasing drilling in the United States will at most give \n     us a few years of additional oil, if that, at the cost of \n     possibly despoiling a beautiful natural zone and damaging \n     critical bird nesting habitat.\n       Increasing our use of nuclear power when we still have not \n     figured out a safe means of dealing with the waste is \n     similarly irresponsible over the long term.\n       I too have felt the high energy prices, but I do not think \n     they should be used as an excuse to increase our efforts in a \n     failed direction that is causing severe damage to the global \n     environment. It is time that we stop and consider how we can \n     move our energy policy in a different direction for our long-\n     term health.\n     Aria, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a substitute teacher for School District #331 in \n     Minidoka County. I have been subbing for 13 years and, until \n     this last year, I worked mostly full days but the occasional \n     half day for teachers who, for various reasons, didn't need \n     to be gone all day. I will no longer go in for half days \n     because it is not economically feasible. We, as subs, are not \n     paid well anyway, and to only get half pay, with gas prices \n     like they are, is not possible anymore. I substitute at the \n     secondary level and there are two schools in Rupert that I \n     work at regularly, Minico High School is about ten minutes \n     away and West Minico Middle School is 20 minutes away. I do \n     not go to Minico or West much any more because of high gas \n     prices. I think we really need to ``drill here, drill now'' \n     because something has got to give. Our wages are not going \n     up! Thank you for caring. . . .\n     Patty, Rupert.\n                                  ____\n\n       We continue to build our economy on oil yet we can not \n     produce enough oil in this country for energy independence. \n     It wouldn't matter if we could, because we are capitalist. We \n     would just sell the oil on the global market.\n       We need to look at our current natural resource and use \n     them to our advantage. Brazil switched to sugarcane ethanol, \n     but corn is not the answer to the United States. Our natural \n     resource is coal and natural gas. We should concentrate on \n     making coal cleaner and switch our economy to electricity \n     powered by coal, hydro, nuclear, and wind (most likely in \n     that order). That is energy independence.

Madam President, today I honor the career of \nJosephine Long, a wonderful woman and extraordinary teacher. Ms. Long \nhas worked in the District of Columbia Public School System for 33 \nyears, touching the lives of hundreds of children. Ms. Long was born in \nRaleigh, NC, and moved to Washington, DC, as a child. She has lived \nhere ever since, raising two daughters and two sons. Ms. Long received \ncertification in early childhood education from both Gallaudet \nUniversity and Prince George's Community College. Since then, Ms. Long \nhas had a positive impact in many classrooms, working for the majority \nof her career with special needs children and for the past 2 years at \nthe School-Within-School at Peabody, a DC public school.\n  Colleagues have long admired Ms. Long for her optimistic attitude and \nthe special concern and attention she gave to her students with special \nhealth concerns. Perhaps Ms. Long's most impressive strength as a \nteacher was the respect she showed her students; she spoke to them and \ntreated them with maturity, sharing her life experiences, recounting \ndaily encounters, and listening intently when they shared their \nthoughts as well. Ms. Long made her students laugh and was always \ngenerous; every day, she shared her lunch cookies among 22 different \nstudents.\n  As both a father and the chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Children \nand Families, I know very well the importance of a quality education. \nWhile many factors contribute to the success of our schools, perhaps \nnone can make more of a difference than a teacher with the ability to \nconnect with her students. Ms. Long did just that for more than 30 \nyears, and I commend her for her dedication to the District of Columbia \nPublic School System. On behalf of all the students she has touched \nover her many years of teaching, I thank her for her unwavering \ncommitment to the education of her students. I congratulate Josephine \non her retirement and wish her only the best in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/23/senate-section/article/S5960-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DANIEL SAFSEL\n\n Mr. KERRY.

I have come to know and respect \nLieutenant\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\nColonel Fortunato over the past 3 years, during which time he served as \nthe congressional liaison for all Army aviation programs. In this \ncapacity, Lieutenant Colonel Fortunato was instrumental in improving \nthe understanding of Senators and staff concerning a myriad of Army \naviation issues, in particular the reinvestment of Comanche helicopter \nfunding to restructure Army aviation for the 21st century, the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, and Army transformation. He was instrumental in \nthe successful authorization and appropriation of the light utility \nhelicopter, armed-reconnaissance helicopter, joint cargo aircraft, \nChinook multiyear, Apache, Black Hawk multiyear and numerous unmanned \naerial vehicle and aviation R projects.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Fortunato escorted numerous congressional \ndelegations to over 20 countries, including 3 to Iraq and Afghanistan. \nI myself was privileged to have him as an escort at my specific request \nfor my own visits abroad and in larger delegations. He worked \ntirelessly to ensure my visits were coordinated with all the relevant \nagencies, military leaders, heads of state and government officials so \nI could focus on the issues that were critical to my service as the \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Air Land Subcommittee. I am \nextremely grateful for the support, friendship and perspective Ed \nprovided me and my staff.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Fortunato's congressional assignment was the \ncapstone to an outstanding career of service to our Nation. He served \nas an aviation officer in numerous command and staff positions. His \noperational assignments began in the famous 101st Airborne Division, \nAASLT, during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm with further \nassignments as part of JTF-Bravo in Honduras, 2nd Infantry Division in \nKorea and the 25th Infantry Division, L, in Hawaii. Lieutenant Colonel \nFortunato then served in a number of program and acquisition positions \nto include program manager for the Army Special Operations Aviation \nRegiment MH-60 Black Hawk fleet and various high level assignments \nwithin the Army Secretariat.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Fortunato holds an MBA from George Washington \nUniversity and a bachelor's of science in business and marketing from \nGeorge Mason University. His military awards include the Legion of \nMerit, Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal, \nParachutist Badge, Pathfinder Badge, Air Assault Badge, the Army \nAviation Association's Order of St. Michael, and he is a Senior Army \nAviator with over 1,100 hours.\n  Son of a soldier, Lieutenant Colonel Fortunato is married to the \nformer Monique Childress of Roanoke, VA. They have two children, \nIsabella, 13, and Edward, 11. I congratulate them on their husband and \nfather's retirement from the Army. The demands of military life are \nsuch that military families also sacrifice and serve the Nation along \nwith their soldier, and I thank Monique, Isabella and Ed for their \nservice.\n  The Army, the Senate, and the Nation are fortunate to have had the \nservice of such a great officer as LTC Ed Fortunato.

I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize his outstanding accomplishments that have \nhelped change our society and improve the way we live every day.\n  A pioneer in modern acoustics, Dr. Bose is founder, chairman and \ntechnical director of the internationally-recognized audio company that \nbears his name, Bose Corporation.\n  Raised just outside Philadelphia, Dr. Bose began his career at the \nage of 13, repairing radios in his basement during WWII.\n  His passion for technology continued at MIT, where he earned \nbachelor, masters and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering. In \n1956, Dr. Bose was asked to join the faculty at MIT, where he taught \nfor 45 years.\n  His research at MIT led to the development of new, patented \ntechnologies. With those patents, he founded Bose Corporation in \nMassachusetts in 1964. He has achieved worldwide acclaim with the \nintroduction of groundbreaking products, including the 901' \nDirect/Reflecting speaker system, customized sound systems for \nautomobiles, and active noise-reducing headphones. Under his \nleadership, 100 percent of profits are reinvested back into the \ncompany, enabling research and advancements in non-audio areas.\n  In 2004, after 25 years of research, he introduced a revolutionary \nsuspension system that combines superior comfort and control in the \nsame vehicle.\n  Dr. Bose has done extensive work for the Armed Forces and NASA. He \nwas named Inventor of the Year in 1987, by the Intellectual Property \nOwners Association and holds numerous patents in the fields of \nacoustics, electronics, nonlinear systems, and communication theory.\n  He is a member of the Audio Hall of Fame, the recipient of a \nDistinguished Service Citation from the Automotive Hall of Fame, and \nhas been inducted in the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame. He is an \nelected member of the National Academy of Engineering and of the \nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n  Congratulations Dr. Bose on being inducted into the National \nInventors Hall of Fame and for your outstanding work at the Bose \nCorporation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/23/senate-section/article/S5961-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/23/senate-section/article/S5961-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/23/senate-section/article/S5961-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on June 23, 2008, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representative, \ndelivered by Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announcing that the \nSpeaker had signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 634.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \ndental insurance for veterans and survivors and dependents of veterans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bill that would \ngive our veterans, surviving spouses, and certain dependent children he \noption to buy dental insurance coverage through the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. My bill is based on a very successful program that \nhas been in place since 1998 for military retirees and their families.\n  Under the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program, TRDP, military retirees are \ngiven the option to purchase dental coverage under a contract managed \nby the Department of Defense. Since the program started, over one \nmillion eligible participants have chosen to buy dental coverage \nthrough this plan, including over 56,000 in my home state of North \nCarolina. Those individuals have access to a network of about 112,000 \ndental plan providers across the nation. Premiums range from $14 to $48 \nper month per person, depending on the region and type of dental plan \nselected. With this kind of success, it seems only fitting that we \noffer the same kind of benefit to our veterans.\n  VA runs the largest integrated health care system in the nation. \nAlthough VA provides dental benefits to the 7.9 million veterans \nenrolled in the health care system, these benefits are either limited \nto a select group of people or can only be provided under very limited \ncircumstances. For example, VA provides comprehensive dental care to \nveterans for 180 days after they leave service; who have service-\nrelated dental conditions; who are in nursing homes and require dental \ncare; or who fall under other very strict guidelines.\n  My bill would supplement this limited coverage by giving veterans and \nsurvivors the option to purchase a more comprehensive dental plan. Of \ncourse, many veterans may have dental coverage through their employers \nor through an individual policy. My bill extends this dental plan \noption to all enrolled veterans.\n  As I mentioned, the bill is modeled after the successful program that \nis now offered to TRICARE retirees. Federal employees also have access \nto a similar benefit option for dental coverage. Like these other \nprograms, this VA program would be entirely voluntary, be financed \nthrough premiums and, most importantly, provide needed coverage from a \nnetwork of dental professionals in local communities.\n  This bill would not replace VA's dental services; it is just another \noption for those who want to have access to group insurance rates that \nthey could not otherwise get on their own. This idea is like the 44 \nyear relationship VA has with Prudential, who provides active duty \nservicemembers and veterans with group life insurance policies. The \nmost important part of the relationship is that servicemembers and \nveterans are well-served and get to reap\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\nthe benefits of group rates and competition.\n  This is a good example of how we can build on innovative and \nsuccessful approaches to improving options for our veterans. I believe \nmy bill is another step in that direction, and I ask my colleagues for \ntheir support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 3180.

Res. 440\n\n       Whereas soil, plant, animal, and human health are \n     intricately linked and the sustainable use of soil affects \n     climate, water and air quality, human health, biodiversity, \n     food safety, and agricultural production;\n       Whereas soil is a dynamic system which performs many \n     functions and services vital to human activities and \n     ecosystems;\n       Whereas, despite soil's importance to human health, the \n     environment, nutrition and food, feed, fiber, and fuel \n     production, there is little public awareness of the \n     importance of soil protection;\n       Whereas the degradation of soil can be rapid, while the \n     formation and regeneration processes can be very slow;\n       Whereas protection of United States soil based on the \n     principles of preservation and enhancement of soil functions, \n     prevention of soil degradation, mitigation of detrimental \n     use, and restoration of degraded soils is essential to the \n     long-term prosperity of the United States;\n       Whereas legislation in the areas of organic, industrial, \n     chemical, biological, and medical waste pollution prevention \n     and control should consider soil protection provisions;\n       Whereas legislation on climate change, water quality, \n     agriculture, and rural development should offer a coherent \n     and effective legislative framework for common principles and \n     objectives that are aimed at protection and sustainable use \n     of soils in the United States;\n       Whereas soil contamination coupled with poor or \n     inappropriate soil management practices continues to leave \n     contaminated sites unremediated; and\n       Whereas soil can be managed in a sustainable manner, which \n     preserves its capacity to deliver ecological, economic, and \n     social benefits, while maintaining its value for future \n     generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes it as necessary to improve knowledge, \n     exchange information, and develop and implement best \n     practices for soil management, soil restoration, carbon \n     sequestration, and long-term use of the Nation's soil \n     resources;\n       (2) recognizes the important role of soil scientists and \n     soils professionals, who are well-equipped with the \n     information and experience needed to address the issues of \n     today and those of tomorrow in managing the Nation's soil \n     resources;\n       (3) commends soil scientists and soils professionals for \n     their efforts to promote education, outreach, and awareness \n     necessary for generating more public interest in and \n     appreciation for soils; and\n       (4) acknowledges the promise of soil scientists and soils \n     professionals to continue to enrich the lives of all \n     Americans by improving stewardship of the soil, combating \n     soil degradation, and ensuring the future protection and \n     sustainable use of our air, soil, and water resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/23/senate-section/article/S5971-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5971-S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING THE BOSTON CELTICS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 596\n\n       Whereas, on June 17, 2008, the Boston Celtics won the 2008 \n     National Basketball Association Championship (referred to in \n     this preamble as the ``2008 Championship'') in 6 games over \n     the Los Angeles Lakers;\n       Whereas the 2008 Championship was the 17th world \n     championship won by the Celtics, the most in the history of \n     the National Basketball Association (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``NBA'');\n       Whereas the 2008 Championship marked the culmination of the \n     greatest single season turnaround in the history of the NBA, \n     as the Celtics improved from a record of 24-58 during the \n     2007-2008 season to a league-best 66-16 mark during the 2007-\n     2008 campaign;\n       Whereas the 2008 Celtics NBA Championship team, like all \n     great Celtics champions of the past, epitomized team work, \n     selflessness, character, effort, camaraderie, toughness, and \n     determination;\n       Whereas the 2008 Celtics honored the rich legacy of their \n     franchise, which was--\n       (1) established by a legion of all-time greats, including \n     Bill Russell, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Bob Cousy, Tom \n     Heinsohn, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, Jo Jo White, Dave Cowens, \n     Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson, and Tom \n     ``Satch'' Sanders; and\n       (2) masterminded by one of the legendary coaches of all \n     sports, Arnold ``Red'' Auerbach;\n       Whereas Celtics managing partner Wyc Grousbeck and the \n     entire Celtics ownership group never wavered from paying the \n     price to raise ``Banner #17'' to the Garden rafters;\n       Whereas the 2008 Celtics were brought together by a former \n     Celtics player, Danny Ainge, whose off-season acquisitions of \n     NBA All-Stars Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen earned him the 2008 \n     NBA Executive of the Year Award;\n       Whereas the Celtics were led by Doc Rivers, who--\n       (1) oversaw the smooth integration of new superstars and \n     untested young players into the Celtics lineup; and\n       (2) assembled, and ensured the execution of, a masterful \n     NBA Finals game plan;\n       Whereas the Celtics featured a 21st century ``Big Three'' \n     comprised of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen, 3 \n     veteran players who worked together and never allowed their \n     personal ambition or pursuit of individual statistics to \n     interfere with the goal of the team to win a championship;\n       Whereas a group of talented young players contributed \n     pivotal roles in the march of the Celtics to the 2008 \n     Championship, including point guard Rajon Rondo, center \n     Kendrick Perkins, forward Leon Powe, guard Tony Allen, and \n     forward Glen ``Big Baby'' Davis;\n       Whereas the valuable bench of the Celtics was stocked with \n     veteran role players who made significant contributions \n     during the season, including forward James Posey, guard Eddie \n     House, guard Sam Cassell, forward P.J. Brown, forward Brian \n     Scalabrine, and center Scott Pollard;\n       Whereas the 2008 Celtics team demonstrated remarkable poise \n     and gained invaluable playoff experience in defeating the \n     Atlanta Hawks, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Detroit \n     Pistons in hard-fought series during which every possession \n     counted at both the offensive and defensive ends of the \n     floor;\n       Whereas, after 26 playoff games, the Celtics ultimately \n     secured the 17th NBA Championship of the franchise in one of \n     the most dominating performances in NBA history, a\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\n     39-point rout of the Lakers in front of a raucous Garden \n     crowd; and\n       Whereas the Celtics fans in the State of Massachusetts, in \n     New England, and throughout the world never gave up hope that \n     the franchise would someday return to glory and give a new \n     generation of Celtics fans the opportunity to celebrate a \n     championship: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates--\n       (A) the Boston Celtics for winning the 2008 National \n     Basketball Association Championship, including the players, \n     head coach, coaches, support staff, and team owners and \n     executives whose ability, hard work, dedication, and spirit \n     made the season possible; and\n       (B) the Los Angeles Lakers for their success during the \n     2008 season and winning the National Basketball Association \n     Western Conference Championship; and\n       (2) directs the Enrolling Clerk of the Senate to transmit \n     an enrolled copy of this resolution to--\n       (A) the 2008 Boston Celtics team;\n       (B) Celtics head coach Doc Rivers;\n       (C) Celtics general manager Danny Ainge; and\n       (D) Celtics managing partner Wyc Grousbeck.\n  Mr. REID.
