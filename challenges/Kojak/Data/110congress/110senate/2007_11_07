At that time, there \nwere 16 or 19 amendments, but they were all relevant amendments, with \nthe exception of one from Senator Kyl of Arizona which was a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment dealing with the estate tax. Other than that, they \nwere all relevant to the farm bill. That is the way it has been. We \nwent back and checked, and that is the way it has been for very many \nfarm bills. That is what we should do on this farm bill, as I have \nsuggested. But we can work something out with the minority and come up \nwith a list of amendments.

Mr. President, Senator Specter and I are on the floor. We \nhad the pleasure--the entire Senate did--of listening to a joint \nsession presentation by the President of France. It was stunningly \ngood. I have been to a lot of those over the last quarter of a century, \nand I would put his right up near the top. He was so good.\n  He spoke about the deep and historic friendship between our two \ncountries. After the speech, I heard Senator Joe Lieberman say to him: \nPresident Sarkozy, sometimes we need to be reminded by others of how \ngood we are as a country, how good we have been, and how bright our \nfuture can be. That, in effect, is what the President of France told us \nall as we assembled there.\n  One thing I wish to mention is one symbol of that friendship is the \nLegion of Honor Award the President of France presented to seven World \nWar II veterans who are in a category of their own. To be a World War \nII veteran, a combat veteran, says it all, but to be awarded the Legion \nof Honor by the French Government puts them in a special category.\n  One of the presentations was to our own Senator Dan Inouye, a \nCongressional Medal of Honor winner--well, you don't win one, it was \npresented to him. Senator Inouye is one of the brave men who served our \ncountry during World War II. Senator Inouye, in 1945, was a 20-year-old \nlieutenant who was grievously injured. He lost one limb and had many \nother injuries as he was leading an attack in Italy. The President of \nFrance recognized the heroism of Dan Inouye, as we do every day.\n  Senator Inouye was the leader of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, \ncomposed of only Japanese Americans. So for Senator Inouye and for the \nSenate, this is a wonderful day, and I am so thankful to the President \nof France and the people of France for recognizing Senator Inouye.\n\n\n                             Floor Schedule\n\n  Mr. President, today, we continue to debate the farm bill. This \ndebate is going well. We had good debate yesterday. I wish they had \nbeen more directed toward amendments, but it was a good debate--people \nfor and against the bill. That is what Senate debates are supposed to \nbe about. I am confident the bipartisan cooperation that brought this \nbill to the floor will continue and result in final passage.\n  There has been some concern over the amendment process. I have made \nit clear this bill will not fall victim to nonrelevant amendments, and \nthere was a discussion on the floor with me and a number of other \nRepublican Senators yesterday saying this isn't the way it should be \ndone and we have never done it this way before. But we went back and \nchecked the record and that is the way it is always done. In the last \nseveral decades, the farm bill does not have nonrelevant amendments.\n  On the last farm bill, when Senator Daschle was the leader--he had my \njob--there was one nonrelevant amendment, and that was a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution offered by Senator Kyl on the estate tax. We had one \nof our so-called side by sides, and that was it. All other 18 \namendments were all relevant. That is the way it has to be on this \nbill. It has been recognized for decades that is the only way you can \nget one done.\n  I had a productive conversation with Senator McConnell last evening \nabout the process, and I hope we can work something out on the \namendments. It is something we need to do, and ultimately that is what \nwe will do. The sooner we do it, the better off we are.\n  Tomorrow, I am confident and hopeful the Committee on Justice, State, \nand Housing and Urban Development will meet and confer in conference \nand come up with proposals so we can bring this to the floor and work \nout whatever we can do with the remaining bills. Most all the work has \nbeen done. I have spoken to Senator Mikulski. She has talked to her \ncounterpart in the House, Chairman Mollohan, and they have worked with \ntheir Republican counterparts, and so it is something we should get \ndone as quickly as possible.\n  These bills are extremely important to America's safety and well-\nbeing. The Commerce-State-Justice bill deals with, among other things, \nthe FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, so it is an important \nbill and I hope we can move forward on that very quickly.\n  Today, we turn to the Veterans, Labor, Health, and Education \nconference report. It is an important bill. The labor aspect of it is \nchaired by Senator Harkin and Ranking Member Senator Specter. I feel \nabout them--about Harkin and Specter--as I have for a long time about \nthe Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. Senator Domenici and \nI were the chair and ranking member of that for as long as a lot of \npeople can remember, and for Senator Domenici and I, who was chair and \nI was ranking member, it didn't matter that much because we knew the \nbill and I think we did a fair job of working that bill. I feel the \nsame way about this Labor-HHS bill. It doesn't matter who is the chair, \nwhether it is Harkin or Specter, because we always get a good product. \nThey have done wonderful things and come up with new proposals.\n  We hear a lot about stem cell research. That idea, legislatively, \noriginated in that subcommittee. They were the first ones who got us \nfocused on that.\n\n  I appreciate their hard work. I think they have done a tremendously \ngood job. There is no reason this package should not enjoy the same \noverwhelming bipartisan support the individual bill received; that is, \nthe Labor-HHS bill passed here, and I will talk about it here in a \nminute. The Military Construction-VA got 90-some-odd votes. Both the \nVeterans and Labor, Health, and Education parts of this bill are just \nas important as the VA part. The original VA bill passed the Senate \noverwhelmingly. Democrats and Republicans joined to support this \nlegislation that will address the critical funding shortages that have \nleft tens of thousands--not hundreds, not thousands--tens of thousands \nof our veterans without the care they have earned and left them without \nit for far too long.\n  I am sorry to say the Bush administration has underfunded the VA for \nyears, but no more dramatically has it been underfunded than the \nrequest by the President this year. The result of this short shrift and \nmismanagement has been made so very clear, painfully clear, by the \ncrisis at Walter Reed. The scandal at Walter Reed Medical Center merely \nhighlighted the problem. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have \nstretched the VA to a breaking point. The number of uninsured veterans \nhas skyrocketed. The personal data of millions of vets has been lost or \ndestroyed. Thousands of American veterans we call heroes wait endlessly \nfor treatment because their claims are caught in a bureaucratic \nnightmare. You can't say you support the troops but leave them high and \ndry when they return home.\n  That is why this legislation includes the largest increase in funding \nfor veterans care in the history of our country. We provide almost $4 \nbillion more than the President's request, funds that will go straight \nto the core of the problem, making right the awful conditions at Walter \nReed and other veterans military facilities, yet will ensure that \nveterans' personal data is safeguarded. We will make sure that research \nin post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and other \nall-too-common illnesses our returning troops face is dealt with \nquickly and, most importantly, greatly expand the number of claims \nmanagers and health care workers to provide our heroes with the \nefficient, high-quality care they have so bravely earned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I thank the majority \nleader for his kind words about the cooperation between Senator Harkin \nand myself in structuring the appropriations bill for the Departments \nof Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. As I have said, \nwhen the gavel has changed hands, it has been a seamless exchange.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14026-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14026-S14027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SPEECH OF THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE\n\n  Before commenting on the conference report on Labor, Health and\n\n[[Page S14027]]\n\nHuman Services, and Education, just a word or two about the speech of \nthe President of France which we just heard in a joint meeting of \nCongress. It was truly inspirational. They applauded the United States \nfor our values and urged close cooperation, alliance, and friendship \nbetween the United States and France.\n  He touched some very important subjects, committing France to \nexpanded participation in NATO, to have Europe take over more of its \nown defense--which is good news for the taxpayers in the United States \nsince our Nation has undertaken more than its proportionate share. He \nspoke in emphatic terms about the unacceptability of Iran having a \nnuclear weapon and the pledge of cooperation from France to engage in \nnegotiations and dialog, to see that does not happen.\n  There were important words about the Mideast peace process, the need \nto take risks for peace, the need for a secure Israel, the need for \nrelease of intervention in Lebanon by Syria, about the importance of \nhaving Israel and the Palestinians come to agreement.\n  It was a very impressive speech. I think it bodes very well for \nUnited States-French relations and for greater participation of France \nin international matters. He also spoke about global warming--received \na standing ovation--about the need for U.S. participation with other \nnations in environmental protection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14027-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LABOR-HHS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Now on to the discussion about the legislation, the \nconference report. This bill does not contain excessive funding. What \nwe are looking at is a bill which has a cost-of-living adjustment to \nwhat the figure was last year. The President has come in with a figure \nwhich is $3 billion less than last year. When you add the cost of \nliving adjustment, and some very modest increases in very important \nprograms, this is a modest bill.\n  The National Institutes of Health, which have been increased under \nthe stewardship of Senator Harkin and myself, has been increased from \n12, now to $30 billion. Last year it was $29 billion. The extra billion \ndollars does not even keep up with inflation costs.\n  We have mine safety, which is a major item. It was pared back as much \nas can be done consistent with the mine accidents most recently in \nUtah.\n  Community health centers are still underfunded. Community health \nservices, as has been noted by the President, are very important \nprograms. GEAR UP, a program to deal with at-risk youth, very modestly \nfinanced. Very important to my State, Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia, \nwhich had 406 homicides last year and a real effort to add mentoring to \ntry to take at-risk youth and try to deal with this issue.\n  It is my hope we can negotiate with the President and come to an \nacceptable term. The President has stated his willingness to negotiate \non SCHIP where there is a significant difference between what the \nPresident wants and what the Congress has legislated. As the facts \nsuggest negotiations ought to be undertaken on SCHIP, they do as well \non Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.\n  It is my suggestion these bills not be considered together. They \nviolate the rules in their joinder. There will be a point of order \nraised, and I believe they ought to be separated in accordance with \nregular Senate rules.\n  If we combine the Veterans bill with the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education bill, we have already been advised there will \nbe a veto of both bills. The veterans financing is too important to be \ndelayed. I chaired the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for some 6 years. \nThe additional funds are necessary, and there would be undue delay if \nthey are joined together.\n  So it would be my hope they will be separated so the veterans funding \ncan go forward, and we can send this bill to the President with a view \nto negotiating terms. I have been in touch with the White House, \ntalking about the possibility of coming to an agreed settlement so we \ncan move the appropriations process forward and serve the needs of the \nAmerican people.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, nearly two centuries ago, the Congress \nwelcomed back to America a great Frenchman whose bravery during the \nRevolutionary War still illuminates the pages of our Nation's early \nhistory.\n  The Marquis de Lafayette wanted to come back to thank his \nRevolutionary companions and to see the effects of the freedom he and \nother veterans of 1776 had risked their lives to secure.\n  His 1824 speech at the Capitol was the first ever by a foreign \ndignitary before a joint session of Congress, and he was introduced by \na Kentuckian. Henry Clay happened to be the Speaker of the House at the \ntime, and he said he could not have had a more gratifying duty than to \ncongratulate the Marquis on his return and, as he put it: To assure him \nof the satisfaction which his presence afforded this early theatre of \nhis glory and renown.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Henry Clay's remarks on \nthat important occasion be reintroduced and printed in the Record, 183 \nyears after they were first recorded there.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. SPEAKER then rose, and, in behalf of the House, \n     addressed the Nation's Guest, in the following eloquent \n     strain, adorned by those graces of oratory for which he is \n     distinguished:\n       ``General: The House of Representatives of the United \n     States, impelled alike by its own feelings, and by those of \n     the whole American People, could not have assigned to me a \n     more gratifying duty than that of being its organ to present \n     to you cordial congratulations upon the occasion of your \n     recent arrival in the United States, in compliance with the \n     wishes of Congress, and to assure you of the very high \n     satification which your presence affords on this early \n     theatre of your glory and renown. Although but few of the \n     members who compose this body, shared with you in the war of \n     our Revolution, all have a knowledge, from impartial history, \n     or from faithful tradition, of the perils, the sufferings, \n     and the sacrifices, which you voluntarily encountered, and \n     the signal services in America and in Europe, which you \n     performed, for an infant, a distant, and an alien people; and \n     all feel and own the very great extent of the obligations \n     under which you have placed our country. But the relations in \n     which you have ever stood to the United States, interesting \n     and important as they have been, do not consititue the only \n     motive of the respect and admiration which this House \n     entertains for you. Your consistency of character, your \n     uniform devotion to regulated liberty, in all the \n     vicissitudes of a long and arduous life, also command its \n     highest admiration. During all the recent convulsions of \n     Europe, amidst, as after, the dispersion of every political \n     storm, the people of the United States have ever beheld you \n     true to your old principles, firm and erect, cheering and \n     animating with your well-known voice, the votaries of \n     Liberty, its faithful and fearless champion, ready to shed \n     the last drop of that blood which, here, you so freely and \n     nobly split in the same holy cause.\n       ``The vain wish has been sometimes indulged, that \n     Providence would allow the Patriot, after death, to return to \n     his country, and to contemplate the intermediate changes \n     which had taken place--to view the forests felled, the cities \n     built, the mountains levelled, the canals cut, the highways \n     constructed, the progress of the arts, the advancement of \n     learning, and the increase of population. General, your \n     present visit to the United States is the realization of the \n     consoling object of that wish. You are in the midst of \n     posterity! Every where you must have been struck with the \n     great changes, physical and moral, which have occurred since \n     you lift us. Even this very city, bearing a venerated name, \n     alike endeared to you and to us, has since emerged from the \n     forest which then covered its site. In one respect, you \n     behold us unaltered, and that is in the sentiment of \n     continued devotion to liberty, and of ardent affection and \n     profound gratitude to your departed friend, the Father of his \n     Country, and to your illustrious associates in the field and \n     in the Cabinet, for the multiplied blessings which surround \n     us, and for the very privilege of addressing you, which I now \n     exercise. This sentiment, now fondly cherished by-more than \n     ten millions of people, will be transmitted, with unabated \n     vigor, down the tide of time, through the countless millions \n     who are destined to inhabit this continent, to their latest \n     posterity.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, historians tell us Members of the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S14028]]\n\nalmost missed the Marquis de Lafayette's speech. Clay and the other \nHouse Members did not tell them it was happening until the very last \nminute, and relations between the two Chambers have not been the same \nsince.\n  But America's friendship with France has endured. As French President \nCharles de Gaulle put it in his own 1960 address before a joint session \nof Congress:\n\n       Our common past is filled with efforts and sacrifices. \n     [And] it is great because at all times we have served \n     together for freedom.\n\n  Similar to Henry Clay, I consider it an honor today to welcome \nanother great Frenchman to the American Capitol. When French President \nNicolas Sarkozy addressed the Congress this morning, he stood beside a \npainting of the Marquis de Lafayette. Similar to that great Frenchman, \nPresident Sarkozy sees much to admire in America. He spoke eloquently \nabout that admiration today. I think there is an important lesson in \nhis words and in his election for the 110th Congress.\n  President Sarkozy admires America's openness to new ideas and to new \npeople. He admires our work ethic, and he has already begun to \nimplement policies that will make hard work pay in France. In an effort \nto lure back the so-called fiscal exiles who have left Paris for London \nor Geneva, he has cut the top tax rate from 60 percent to 50 percent.\n  He plans to replace two-thirds of retiring Government workers to \nshrink the size of Government, and to end the right of some Government \nworkers to retire at age 50 with a pension. He is starting to take away \nthe tools French labor unions routinely use to cripple France. To \nencourage work, he has significantly cut taxes on overtime work.\n  A lot of people on this side of the Atlantic, and I am one of them, \nwere skeptical about whether President Sarkozy could actually get some \nof these sensible ideas past his Parliament. We hoped he would. We want \nFrance to be strong. He told us today he is deeply committed to \ncarrying his mission through. But the cultural forces opposed to change \nseemed even stronger.\n  Yet it turned out his election signaled a deep sense of urgency among \nthe French people, an urgency about their future. Sarkozy put it this \nway in his book, ``Testimony'':\n\n       I am convinced that no country in the world can get by \n     without effort, and that France, notwithstanding its \n     undeniable merits and prestigious past, will become a thing \n     of the past if it doesn't take the steps necessary to adapt \n     to the changes taking place in the world.\n\n  The French people surprised us by electing a free-market reformer. \nThen they surprised us again by electing a center-right Parliament that \ncould get his ideas through. Some of those ideas, such as cutting the \ntop tax rate, have gone through. The winds of change are clearly \nblowing through France.\n  And not just France. Over the past few years, the ``Old Europe'' \nmodel of big government and bloated entitlements has shown signs of \ncracking. Germany elected a reformist chancellor from the Christian \nDemocratic Party. Canadian conservatives rebounded under Stephen Harper \nafter near extinction.\n  Even the Socialists are admitting their mistakes. The Socialist \nformer Prime Minister of France, Lionel Jospin, shocked his countrymen \nwhen he blasphemously declared that: The State cannot do everything.\n  In Italy, center-left Italian Premier Romano Prodi announced in July \nhe would raise Italy's retirement age from 57 to 61. Much of Europe, it \nseems, is trying to steer itself away from an economic model that has \nleft it with double-digit unemployment and anemic growth. After \nscoffing at the Reagan Revolution two decades ago, many of them are now \ntaking our 40th President's economic principles to heart.\n  Meanwhile, in the United States, the new Democratic Congress has \nturned away from the ideas that righted our own economic ship after the \ncrisis of the 1970s. They are proposing higher taxes on everything from \nthe size of our houses to the gas we put in our cars. They are handing \nout favors to big labor by proposing to end the secret ballot union \nelections and by working to defund the Federal office that was created \nto shine a light on how unions spend members' dues.\n  The Democratic Presidential candidates are practically tripping over \neach other to propose newer, bigger entitlements to anybody in Iowa or \nNew Hampshire who will listen. In short, some Democrats in Congress and \nout on the campaign trial would like to turn America into France, when \neven the French themselves are obviously having second thoughts.\n  The effects of the Socialist model in France and other Western \nEuropean countries are perfectly clear. President Sarkozy recently \nassumed control of a government that consumes more than 50 percent of \nFrance's gross national product. In Germany and in Italy, the \npercentage of GDP spent by the Government is above 45 percent. Compare \nthat to about 30 percent in the United States. As one economist \nrecently put it:\n\n       Europe's economy is so bad because government is so big.\n\n  So we congratulate President Sarkozy on his recent victory and his \ncourage in attempting to restore France's economic vitality. America \nwelcomes him. We are hopeful he will help lead the people of France \ninto a new era of prosperity and economic freedom and strengthen the \nnoble tradition of our two countries serving together for freedom.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to heed his message.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14028-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14028-S14044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n      RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 3043, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3043) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, \n     Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and do the \n     same with an amendment and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 5, 2007.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I understand the order, we now have 1 \nhour; is that correct? Am I correct we have 1 hour divided up in 15-\nminute blocks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would be advised there is a total \nof 3 hours, of which the Senator controls 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself my 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I urge all Senators to support the Labor-\nHealth and Human Services appropriations conference report. The Senate \nversion of this bill passed, as we all know, a couple weeks ago. We had \n75 votes in favor of it. We would have had 80 votes if all Senators had \nbeen here. So it was a strong bipartisan endorsement of a bill that \nreflected priorities on both sides of the aisle.\n  I am here today to say I am pleased the conference report we are \nconsidering is even stronger than the bill the Senate approved 2 weeks \nago. Much has been added to the bill. I thought what I might do, for \nthe benefit of other Senators, is sort of run through the priorities in \nthis bill and what our appropriations bill does compared to the \nPresident's budget. I think it will give everyone a good idea of how \nstrong this bill is, why we garnered so much support in the first place \nand why I hope we will garner even more support with the conference \nreport.\n  Right now, the conference report invests about $8.2 billion more than \nlast year in education, health, and labor programs. The President's \nbudget cut $3.5 billion--cut $3.5 billion--from these\n\n[[Page S14029]]\n\nprograms. I will run through those now, and I will give you a good idea \nwhat those are.\n  Let's take home energy assistance. This is the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program. At a time when we have record high energy prices, \nthe conference report boosts it by $250 million. The President's budget \ncut the LIHEAP program by $379 million. It is a clear contrast between \nthe President's budget and where we are.\n  Student aid. Since this covers education, what we did is have the \nbiggest increase ever in support for Pell grants for kids who are at \nthe lowest rung on the economic ladder who need these grants in order \nto even go to college. So what we did in our bill is we boosted the \nmaximum award to $4,925. The President's budget limited it to $4,550, \nwhich is far short of the amount needed to even begin to pay for higher \ntuition.\n  Strengthening the poor. Now, here again, in the conference report, we \nhave provided $2.4 billion in the block grants for the Social Services \nBlock Grant Program and the Community Services Block Grant Program. \nThese are the things that go for housing for the poor. It goes for \nthings such as Head Start Programs, all that helps to shore up our \nsocial services system and also community systems--as I said, whether \nit is housing, homeless aid, things such as that for the country.\n  We have provided $2.4 billion for that. The President's budget cut \nboth of these. In fact, it cut the community services block grants to \nzero. They absolutely zeroed it out. Then they cut the social services \nblock grants by about a third. So when you add them together, he cut \nthem both by about 50 percent--at a time when we have more poor people \nin this country than we had in the last several years, when, again, the \ncost of housing is up, all the other things are up for poor people to \npay. Yet he wants to cut it by 50 percent. Unconscionable. Well, we met \nour obligations. We put in $2.4 billion for that.\n  The next one is medical research. Now, again, this Senate has been on \nrecord time and time again supporting healthy, good increases for the \nNational Institutes of Health for the research needed for overcoming \nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's and for the research that is being done at \nthe National Cancer Institute and all the basic research that is funded \nthat goes out to all our colleges and universities and other entities \naround the country.\n  We made such great progress in breaking the genetic code. We are \nmaking such great progress in understanding a lot of the illnesses. We \nare on the threshold with stem cell research and others of entering \ninto a whole new era of uncovering the causes and the therapeutic \ntreatments and cures for a lot of these illnesses. So we are right on \nthat threshold.\n  The President's budget cut the National Institutes of Health by $279 \nmillion--actually cut it. Our conference report has added $1.1 billion \nfor the National Institutes of Health. Actually, it is slightly more \nthan what we had in the Senate when we passed the bill a couple weeks \nago.\n  On special education, this Congress, about 40 years ago, said we were \ngoing to provide up to 40 percent of the difference in the cost of \neducating kids with disabilities when they were mainstreamed in our \nschools. We wanted to put behind us the dark history of the segregation \nand isolation of kids with disabilities who were taken away from their \nhomes, taken away from their neighborhoods, and sent away across the \nState to schools for the deaf, schools for the blind or maybe a lot of \ntimes were not even given an education.\n  So about 40 years ago, this Congress decided we were going to meet \nour constitutional requirements and make sure kids with disabilities \nhad equal and appropriate education. But in doing so, we were going to \nhelp the States by providing up to 40 percent of the additional costs \nof special education.\n  Well, the high mark has been about 18 percent. That was about 3 or 4 \nyears ago, if I am not mistaken--3 or 4 years ago. Since then, we have \ngone backward. We are now down, under the Bush budget, to 16 percent. \nSo we are going in the wrong direction. So what President Bush's budget \ndid is slashed $291 million for special education. What we have done is \nadd $509 million to State grants to help our beleaguered property \ntaxpayers in New Jersey and Iowa and all across this country, to help \nthem meet the educational needs of our kids with disabilities. So we \nmet our obligations there. The President did not.\n  On Social Security, we now know people are waiting as much as 15 \nmonths to get their cases heard. There is a backlog of several hundred \nthousand right now. If we do not add the necessary personnel, people \nare not going to get it, and maybe some of them will die in the \nmeantime. I don't know. People keep getting more and more backlogged \nand get frustrated by this system. They should not have to do that. \nPeople paid in all their lives to Social Security. They ought to get \ntheir cases heard in a timely manner. So what we did is we added \nenough to cut down on the delays. The President's budget would not do \nthat.\n\n  On community health centers, again, the President, when he became \nPresident, said he wanted to have a community health center in every \npoor area in the country. I applauded loudly for that. I thought at \nleast here is something the President and we could agree on.\n  Well, what does the President's budget do? There is no increase at \nall for community health centers, not a dime. So we put in $225 million \nmore to increase funding new community health centers in some of our \npoorer areas of this country. So we met our obligation there, also, in \nterms of meeting health care needs of people who do not have anywhere \nelse to go.\n  The Head Start Program, which has proven its worth clear back to the \nGreat Society. It is one of the Great Society programs. The President's \nbudget cut Head Start by $100 million--cut it by $100 million--leaving \nthousands of kids behind. In our conference report, we have increased \nit by $153 million--not nearly what we need to meet the needs of all \nthe kids who want to get into Head Start, but at least under our tight \nbudget requirements, we were able to increase it substantially. So we \nmet our obligations there in Head Start.\n  So these are some parts of the budget I want Senators to know about. \nThere is a lot of other stuff, too, but these items kind of highlight \nthe difference between where we are in this conference report and where \nthe President's budget is.\n  Again, I thank Senator Specter for the close working relationship we \nhave had. This has been a bipartisan effort from the beginning to right \nnow. Again, that is why I urge all Senators to support this conference \nreport.\n  Now, the President said he is going to veto it because he said our \nbill had too much social spending. I would like to ask him to define \nwhat he means by ``social spending.'' The way he said it was almost \nlike we were funding ice cream socials or something like that in this \nbill. Again, this is out of bounds, out of touch. It shows how isolated \nPresident Bush has become. Every additional dime we have put in goes to \nbedrock, essential programs and services this Congress and this \nPresident and other Presidents have always supported.\n  It is interesting that in the last 5, 6 years, the President has not \nvetoed any appropriations bills. When the Republicans were in charge, \nthe President did not veto an appropriations bill, even though they \nwere over what his budget requests were.\n  Lo and behold, the Democrats, because of the last election, now \ncontrol the House and the Senate, and the President said he is going to \nveto every one of them, except Defense, I guess, maybe Military \nConstruction-VA. All the other ones he is going to veto. He is going to \nveto the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations \nbill because it has ``too much social spending.'' Yet he signed all the \nother bills before this year.\n  I find that more than passing strange that the President, this year, \nsays he is going to veto it. Well, it all adds up to politics. \nEvidently, the President and his advisers think somehow they are going \nto get some kind of political gain--some kind of political gain--by \nvetoing our bill for Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor.\n\n[[Page S14030]]\n\n  Well, I do not know what kind of calculus goes into that, but it is \nbad calculus. It is bad calculus if the President thinks he might make \nsome political gain by cutting Head Start Programs or by cutting \nspecial education or by cutting funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth because it is over his budget, it is ``too much.'' Well, he \nnever said that before. He never said that before to any Republican \nappropriations bill that passed in the last 5 years. I guess only \nbecause the Democrats are in charge he wants to veto it.\n  I would say to the President: This is not a Democratic bill. Yes, we \nmay be in charge because of the election last year, but I still point \nout that this bill passed the Senate with 75 votes. As I said earlier, \nthere were five missing who would have voted for it. It would have been \n80 to 20. You cannot get much more bipartisan than that. It is not a \nDemocratic bill.\n  Senator Specter and I and other people worked very hard on this bill. \nSo I do not see where the President comes across in saying he is going \nto veto it. I think the President is so isolated, so out of touch that \nsomeone said: Well, this is over your budget, so you have to veto it. \nAnd he said: OK. Fine, I will do it.\n  Well, again, the other thing is, when the President sent down his \nfirst veto message on this bill, he said he was going to veto it \nbecause of two things. He was going to veto it because we had included \na provision dealing with stem cell research, which he was opposed to \nand because it was over his budget.\n  Well, both Senator Specter and I agreed in the beginning--even though \nwe both feel very strongly about overcoming the President's dictates on \nstopping funding for stem cell research--even though we feel strongly \nabout that, we were willing to go halfway to meet the President. We \nsaid: OK, we will take the stem cell portion out of here. So we would \nlike to meet you halfway. Well, what we heard from the White House was: \nThat is not enough. It has to be all his way, all the President's way.\n  Well, that is not the way we do things around here. We compromise. \nThe art of democratic rule is to make our compromises. So I figured, if \nwe gave up on our stem cell, then he might give up a little bit on his. \nBut that is not the way the President sees it. It has to be all his way \nor no way.\n  Again, we do not do business like that around here. As I said, we \nhave a farm bill on the floor this year that I am also chairing, and it \nis not all I want, it is not all anybody wants. In the farm bill, we \nhave to make our compromises and agreements to get the job done.\n  But this President is unwilling--unwilling--to compromise, unwilling \nto sit down with us and hammer out some kind of a reasonable \ncompromise. So we are left with only one course of action. We have to \nfulfill our constitutional responsibilities as appropriators to fund \nthe Government, to fund that which Senators and Congresspeople think \nare priorities and, yes, that the administration also thinks are \npriorities. So our constitutional obligation is to work these things \nout and get the best bill we can that people agree upon. As I said, \nwith 75 votes, you can't get much better than that. So I guess we are \nleft with only one course of action: Pass our bill and get it to the \nPresident, and I guess he will veto it. It doesn't make sense to me. It \nmakes no sense for the President to veto this bill. As I said, I can't \nfigure out what he--and then to veto it without saying: Let's sit down \nand work and maybe we can get some agreement. That has not happened. \nSo, again, we are left with only one course of action: Pass the bill, \nthe conference report. I hope Senators will support it as strongly, if \nnot more strongly, than they supported the original bill that passed in \nthe Senate.\n\n  Finally, let me say this: Even with this conference report, we have \nmet all of our pay-go requirements. This bill does not add a single \ndime to the deficit of this country--not a dime. But by cutting a \nlittle bit here and adding there to certain priorities, we were able to \nget a bill that we basically all agree upon. Would I have liked to have \nhad more in NIH? You bet I would. Would I have liked to have had more \nin the Head Start Program? Yes, I would have. Would I have liked to \nhave had more for special education? Yes. The President wanted less \nthan that, so we tried to meet him halfway. Yet the President says no, \nhe wants it all his way.\n  So I hope Senators will support this conference report on Education, \nHealth and Human Services, and Labor overwhelmingly, send it to the \nPresident, and hopefully he will change his mind. Hopefully, between \nnow and then, he will think: Well, you know, maybe I should sign it, \nafter all. Hope springs eternal. We will just have to wait and see. If \nhe signs it, God bless him. That is good. We will be done with it, and \nwe will move on to next year. If he vetoes it, well, we will just have \nto come back and hopefully, with the 75 or 80 votes we have had for it, \nwe will override the veto. It is just not a good way to do things, and \nit causes the kind of confrontation and it causes the kind of bad \nthings happening in Washington that the people of this country want us \nto end. They want us to work things out and move things along. We have \ndone it here in the Senate. We have done it in the House with \nRepublicans and Democrats. Now it is up to the President to also sit \ndown and negotiate in good faith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased this afternoon to recommend the \nMilitary Construction, Veterans Affairs, and related agencies division \nof this conference report to the Senate. This is an extremely important \nand time-sensitive funding measure, and I urge my colleagues to adopt \nit without delay as part of the Labor and Health and Human Services \nconference report and send it to the President to be signed into law.\n  I am particularly honored to be presenting this measure to the Senate \non behalf of the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Tim Johnson. We \nhave worked closely throughout the entire appropriations process, and \nthe Military Construction and Veterans Affairs provisions before the \nSenate today are the product of a thoroughly collaborative and a \ncooperative effort, but the leadership was provided by Senator Johnson. \nI appreciate Senator Johnson's graciousness in allowing me to offer \nthis conference report on his behalf.\n  I would also like to thank the ranking member of our subcommittee, \nSenator Hutchison, for her excellent work and cooperation in developing \nthis conference report and the chairman and ranking member of the full \ncommittee, Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran, for their strong support \nand guidance in shepherding this legislation to the floor.\n  The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs conference report \nbefore the Senate today is fair, balanced, and a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that deserves the full support of the Senate.\n  The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs portion of this \nconference report is critically important to our Nation's military \nforces and to our veterans. It includes $64.7 billion in total \ndiscretionary funding--$3.7 billion over the President's budget request \nfor the Department of Veterans Affairs. This level of funding includes \n$37.2 billion for veterans health care, a high-water mark in the \nhistory of the Department--the largest sum of money ever appropriated \nfor veterans health care. Indeed, it is consistent with the independent \nbudget the veterans organizations have proposed year after year. This \nis the first time we could match their goal with our appropriation. We \nhave provided $2.6 billion more than the President requested for \nveterans health care and $373 million more than the veterans service \norganizations sought in the independent budget. We have, in fact, gone \nbeyond what the independent veterans organizations have suggested in \ntheir budget. This level of funding is a clear demonstration of the \nimportance this Congress places on the health and welfare of our \nNation's veterans.\n  The funding included in this conference report supports a myriad of \nprograms crucial to America's veterans, including funding the veterans \nhospitals, clinics, and veterans centers, as well as cutting-edge \nresearch into critical areas of health care such as traumatic brain \ninjury and post-traumatic stress disorder. As a result of the \nasymmetric combat we are witnessing in Iraq and Afghanistan, this \nNation is\n\n[[Page S14031]]\n\nproducing a new generation of veterans, and they have markedly \ndifferent service-related injuries than were experienced in previous \nwars. Thankfully, more service men and women are surviving their war \nwounds, but many are surviving with catastrophic physical and mental \ninjuries.\n  The nature of veterans health care for new veterans is changing \ndramatically, while the demand for short-term and long-term health care \nfor veterans of previous wars is rapidly increasing as the veteran \npopulation ages. We have two currents rushing together: veterans of \nWorld War II and Korea who are now in their seventies and eighties \nrequiring more care simply because of their age, and a new generation \nof veterans coming out of Afghanistan and Iraq, many of whom are \nsustaining neurological injuries such as traumatic brain injury or \npost-traumatic stress disorder. This other stream of veterans is \nflooding into our system, and we have to care for all of these \nveterans. That is why this legislation is particularly timely and \nparticularly important.\n  All of the challenges to the Department of Veterans Affairs are \nenormous. The conference report before the Senate today addresses those \nchallenges. With this funding, we are providing the resources for the \nDepartment to meet the needs of both aging veterans from yesterday's \nwars and emerging veterans from today's conflict.\n  The conference report also includes critically needed funding for \nmilitary construction. It provides a total of $21.5 billion for \nmilitary construction and an $8.4 billion increase over last year's \nfunding level, with most of the increase directed toward implementing \nthe 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Program.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference report includes $1.1 \nbillion for the Nation's Guard and Reserve forces--a 34.5-percent \nincrease over the President's budget request. The wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan have placed an unprecedented demand on the Nation's Guard \nand Reserve Forces. Yet the President's budget slashed construction \nfunding for several of the Guard and Reserve components. This \nconference report corrects that inequity. For example, it increases \nfunding for the Army National Guard 25 percent over the President's \nbudget request, and for the Air Guard, the conference report more than \ntriples the President's budget request.\n  Military construction may not have the glamour of the Defense \nDepartment's sophisticated weapons and other programs, but it is, \nnevertheless, the bedrock of the Nation's military. Our troops must \nhave sufficient funding to provide barracks, facilities for training \nand maintaining their equipment, and adequate housing for their \nfamilies. Without the resources provided in this legislation, these \ncrucial facilities could not be constructed. This legislation provides \nfunding for an impressive array of military construction projects, the \nvast majority of which were requested by the President. All of the \nmajor construction projects added to the President's budget by the \nSenate have been fully vetted, are included in the authorization bill, \nand are encompassed within the service's Future Years Defense Plan.\n  Some have complained that the Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs conference report should not be coupled with the Labor and \nHealth and Human Services conference report. I will have more to say \nabout that later, but I would like to make the point now that these two \nbills complement each other in many respects, and it makes perfectly \ngood sense to link them together.\n  There are more than a few crossover items between the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill and the Labor and \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill. These include, to name a \nfew, the Labor Department's Veterans Employment and Training Program, \nwhich includes the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program; the \nDepartment of Education's Impact Aid Program, which assists school \ndistricts whose student population is swelled by military dependents; \nand the Traumatic Brain Injury Program directed by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control. There \nare numerous programs that provide benefits to veterans and their \nfamilies that are included in the Health and Human Services program. \nVeterans are not simply veterans. They are members of communities. They \nhave children. They have spouses. They require the services that are \nincluded not only in the Veterans' Administration bill but particularly \ntheir families in other legislation and other appropriations included \nin the Health and Human Services bill.\n  Something else, too, I think is important to stress, and I will do \nthat in greater detail, these veterans as young men and women committed \nthemselves to this country, not because they anticipated collecting \nveterans' benefits but because they wanted to make a difference. They \nwanted to ensure that--mercifully and hopefully--the next generation of \nAmericans wouldn't have to go into combat, but beyond that, that all \nAmericans would have a chance. It was not about ensuring elaborate tax \nloopholes or sophisticated financial transactions; they were fighting--\nand, sadly, being injured and too many dying--to give people a chance \nin this country, an opportunity to go to school, for children to get \nimmunizations, and for bright, talented young people to go to college. \nThat is why I think it is also essential that these two bills are being \nconsidered together, because if we provide for our veterans, they have \nearned it--and we should and we must and we will--but if we neglect the \nrest of the country, have we truly fulfilled and measured up to what \nthey served and sacrificed for? I don't think so.\n  The Senate has before it a comprehensive and vitally important \nconference report for funding both Departments, both areas--the \nDepartment of Labor and Health and Human Services, the Education \nDepartment, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. We have the \nopportunity--I would argue, the obligation--to send a signal to the \nPresident of this country and to the Nation that we are not willing to \nplay favorites among appropriations bills. Funding for health care for \nour veterans is clearly a priority, but it does not trump our \ncommitment to fund health care services for all Americans or education \nprograms or job training for those who need it, including veterans who \nparticipate in many of the Department of Labor programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report in its \nentirety and send it to the President today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of \nwhatever time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise as the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and I \nappreciate the opportunity to speak on the conference report. I am \nfollowing my chairman of his subcommittee. I hope very much that we \nwill be able to take up this bill, which is our subcommittee, Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs, separately, as everyone, I believe, \nknows in their heart is the right thing to do.\n  This bill is a bill that has been agreed to. We have worked on a \nbipartisan basis. We very quickly came to a conclusion in the \nconference on the Military Construction and Veterans' Administration \nbill. In fact, the President said right out that he would sign the \nbill, even though it is almost $4 billion more than he had requested, \nbecause he understands the urgency of both bills--Veterans' \nAdministration and the Military Construction--and he knows that it is \nimportant to do it right away. So he said right up front that he would \nsign our bill. But he also said right up front that he would not sign \nthe Labor and Health and Human Services bill. So there would be no \nreason--no common sense or substantive reason--to combine these two \nbills.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that the leadership in the House decided \nto do this. In fact, they also put the Defense appropriations bill as a \npart of the Labor and Health and Human Services bill, but the \nDemocratic chairman of the Defense bill agreed with the Republican \nranking member, and they were able to take the Defense bill out.\n  For the very same reason, we should be taking the Veterans-Military \nConstruction bill out from under the bill the President has said he \nwill veto. The President will sign the Defense bill and the Military \nConstruction-Veterans\n\n[[Page S14032]]\n\nbill. Why not have this Congress come together and accomplish \nsomething? Two major parts of our Government--it happens that it is the \ntwo parts that fund our warriors who are in the field, in harm's way \nright now--those could be signed right away. Why not do it? I hope the \nCongress will come to its senses and move in a bipartisan way, swiftly, \nto do this very thing.\n  Let me talk about the bills themselves. Military construction: With \nthe impending return of troops resulting from the current overseas \nrebasing effort through BRAC and the global war on terror, our service \nmen and women are in a time of great transformation. The military \nconstruction section of our bill provides $21 billion for construction \nprojects to support these moves and bring our troops home. I cannot \nemphasize enough that we must stay on schedule. It is important that \nthe military services receive the facilities they need to bring our \ntroops home, where they have better training facilities, a better \nquality of life for themselves and their families. From operational \nbuilding to many childcare centers, we have necessary facilities in the \nbill to do that. Servicemembers, families, and local communities across \nour country are counting on us.\n  Now, Congress set a deadline of 2011 for BRAC to be implemented. Yet \nwe see Congress is dragging its feet in the funding requirements to \nimplement the BRAC. We have given the Department their mandate. We must \nfollow through with the money needed. Many of us have visited bases in \nEurope, Korea, and throughout the world. We know there are training \nconstraints in many of those bases; that our service men and women are \nnot able to stay in training. Sometimes it is a constraint in airspace. \nSometimes it is an environmental problem. Sometimes it is a constraint \nin ground space and artillery space, so that we can be fully trained \nwhen we go into harm's way.\n  The reason the Department of Defense made the announcement after our \nCongress passed the overseas basing commission amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill--the reason the Department of Defense announced that \n70,000 troops would be brought home from Germany and Korea is because \nthey agreed that the training constraints would make it impossible for \nus to keep our troops fully trained for the combat into which they will \nbe going. So it is important that we fund this, that we do it on a \ntimely basis, and that we move swiftly on the military construction \npart of the bill.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs is the other part of this unit. I \nknow there is a concern over total discretionary spending in all of the \nappropriations bills. But the President has said he will sign this \nbill. With the money appropriated, the Department of Veterans Affairs \nwill be able to address the needs of over 7 million veterans who count \non us to provide the funds necessary for medical care, medical \nfacilities, research, extended care facilities, and even cemeteries. \nThe appropriations increases in the bill are in areas I support.\n  We will always do what is necessary to take care of our veterans and \ntheir health care needs. The research of the Veterans' Administration \ninto prosthetics, severe trauma, and traumatic brain injury is cutting \nedge. Increasing resources in these programs is a good investment for \nour Nation's veterans and our Nation's future. We are asking the VA to \nexpand research in several areas, including post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome, gulf war illness, prosthetics, and geriatric care. These are \nthe types of injuries the warriors of today are sustaining. These are \nthe warriors in the war on terror. These are the injuries we should be \nlooking for the very best ways to treat, and also the way to \nrehabilitate our injured warriors with better prostheses, better \nartificial arms and legs, so they can have a more normal life because \nthey have given so much for our country.\n  I think every Member of Congress shares the desire to fairly \ncompensate, medically treat, and honor our veterans. The Veterans' \nAdministration provides the health care to address the illnesses or \ndisabilities, physical or mental, including those illnesses that might \nmanifest themselves decades after military service, which is something \nwe also see happening. We always have, and always will, take care of \nour Nation's veterans. Every veteran should know we are committed to \nnothing less.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has shown its resolve time and again to \ncare for our men and women in uniform, as well as the more than 7 \nmillion veterans. We owe them our gratitude. We will do our part to \ntake care of them. I ask that we work together to put our \nservicemembers and veterans first, to do what is best for them and our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I will make the point of order at the appropriate time \nto separate these two distinct bills. The Veterans-Military \nConstruction bill and the Labor-Health and Human Services bill are \nseparate bills. We have separate committees, and we have dealt with the \ntwo committees separately. There is no reason to put them together, \nparticularly when the President has said he will sign the Veterans-\nMilitary Construction bill, and he will veto the Labor-Health and Human \nServices bill.\n\n  Why do we delay and put our military service men and women and their \nfamilies and our veterans in a situation where they are in limbo? Why \nnot pass the bill separately because the bill is ready to go? We have \nworked in a bipartisan way to assure that it is.\n  There is no common sense nor substantive reason to put these bills \ntogether. So I will leave it up to others to determine why the \nleadership in the House would have lumped these bills together. I will \nalso say that I respect the Defense Appropriations Committee chairman \nand ranking member for coming together on a bipartisan basis to take \ntheir bill out because that is exactly what should have happened. I \nhope we will do the same thing for our military veterans and our \nservice men and women who rely on the construction projects and \nmilitary construction to provide the housing, training facilities, \nchildcare centers, and health care centers, which are necessary for \nthem and their families to have the quality care they so richly deserve \nfor what they are doing for our country right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to make the rule XXVIII point of order at this time and for \nSenator Harkin to make the motion to waive, but that all debate time \nunder the previous order be preserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under Senate \nrule XXVIII, paragraph 3, that the text of the Military Construction, \nVeterans Affairs, and related agencies bill, H.R. 2642, which \nconstitutes division B of the conference report for H.R. 3043, is new \nmatter as it was not contained in either the House- or Senate-passed \nbills.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, is there controlled time now? I yield \nmyself 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader controls 54 \nminutes. The Senator from Massachusetts will be using that time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I wish to express my strong \nappreciation to the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for the work they have done on the Labor-HHS \nconference report. This appropriations bill is of enormous importance. \nOur national security gets attention, but so much of what makes a \ndifference in the strength of our Nation is our investment in our \npeople. When we talk about investment in our people, we are talking \nabout education, we are talking about health care, we are talking\n\n[[Page S14033]]\n\nabout job safety, job training programs which have been tested and \ntried, examined and evaluated. The Appropriations Committee has done \njust a splendid job in allocating resources to these priorities. They \nhave done it in a bipartisan way.\n  Now as we see this whole process on appropriations moving forward, we \nknow this will ultimately be decided this evening with a Senate vote. \nIt will then go over to the House of Representatives and down to the \nWhite House to the President where he has indicated he is going to veto \nthis legislation.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to go over this legislation so the \nAmerican people and our colleagues, as we are looking at a variety of \nproposals that are coming at us at a furious pace in the Senate, have a \nvery clear understanding and awareness as to exactly what this \nlegislation is about and its importance to American families. This is \nfamily legislation, it is children's legislation, it is health care \nlegislation. It is about our ability to compete in the future.\n  We hear much talk about the challenges we are facing globally, and we \nare facing serious challenges globally. This legislation deals with \nmaking sure American workers are going to have the kinds of skills \nwhich are necessary so they are able to compete.\n  Global competition is going to be a knowledge-based competition. That \nis why it is so important we invest in education. That is why it is so \nimportant we have a healthy population, and why it is so important we \nhave individuals who have the skills so we can have a knowledge-based \neconomy and be able to compete internationally. This legislation is the \nheart and soul of that effort in the Congress of the United States.\n  Again, I thank old friends and individuals who, for a long period of \ntime, have been strongly committed to these issues on education, \nhealth, and training.\n  When we look over these particular items, it is important to know, \nsince we are talking about priorities, a billion dollars--and a billion \ndollars is real money, that is true--we are talking about a total \nbudget of over $2.8 trillion. The amounts we are talking about \ncertainly are very modest, indeed, particularly when one looks at the \ntotal scope of our budget. And particularly when one looks at what we \nare spending in Iraq, the amounts we are spending in this bill are \nbasically trivial. That is why it is so discouraging, I find, that the \nPresident of the United States believes we have to effectively pay for \nthe war in Iraq by vetoing programs that make a difference in the \nquality of education, health care, and training of American workers.\n  Let's look at these items in some detail. How can we take this \nPresident seriously when he says he will leave no child behind, when he \nvetoes funding for education? How can we take the President seriously \nwhen he says he is for children's health, when he vetoes funding for \nchildren's health care? How can we take this President seriously when \nhe announces a new food safety initiative such as he did yesterday and \nsays he will veto funding for food safety? The President may have the \nwrong priorities, but in Congress, we have worked together, Democrats \nand Republicans, to pass responsible new investments in our schools, \nthe health care systems, and our jobs.\n\n  Here is what is at stake if the President vetoes this important \nlegislation, and the American people deserve to know which of their \npriorities will fall to the cutting room floor when he rejects this \nbill.\n  First and foremost, this bill before us today provides long overdue \nfunding for education. Over the past few years, the White House and the \nRepublican leadership in the Congress have neglected the urgently \nneeded new investments for better teachers, stronger schools, and \ncollege affordability. In fact, under the Republican-controlled \nCongress, funding for the education of our children has actually gone \ndown.\n  This chart goes back to the last time we had Democratic \nappropriations bills and we passed No Child Left Behind. One can see \nthe dramatic falloff rather than an increase in commitment to children \nall over this country. We saw the reductions. This reflects the final \nresults of these battles. We can see the gradual reductions in funding. \nThe red lines are what the administration actually requested. Here is \nPresident Bush's request, a reduction of $2.2 billion; and in 2008, a \nreduction of $1.5 billion. This is the difference between a Democratic \nresolution and a Democratic conference report, $3.2 billion. We are \ncoming back in terms of increases. It provides $3.2 billion in new \nfunding for education compared to last year.\n  The core Federal education initiative for helping schoolchildren who \nfall behind is called the title I program. Despite all the hype from \nthe administration about leaving no child behind, title I funding has \nlanguished since passage of that legislation. The education funding \nbefore us today changes all that. It includes the largest increase in \nthe title I program since the No Child Left Behind Act was passed.\n  Again, these are the annual increases in title I, part A funding, \n2003. It was going down. In 2006, it was flat, 250. And now with this \nproposal, there is a significant increase, $1.85 billion, an indication \nof the Nation's priority of increased funding for title I.\n  Title I, as we all remember, goes back to 1965 when this country said \nwe as a nation are going to make a priority the poorest children and \nneediest children in our society. We are going to give attention as a \nnation to do something about the poorest and neediest children in this \ncountry. That is what title I is all about.\n  We will have a chance to get into those in greater detail. We are all \nfamiliar with the challenges we are facing with school dropout and \nincreased poverty among the neediest of children. We know money is not \nthe answer to everything, but it is a pretty clear indication of a \nnation's priorities. And included in this legislation is title I \nfunding.\n  Shamefully, we have seen the Pell grant stagnate as well. In the past \n5 years, students and families have struggled as college costs have \nskyrocketed. What we have also stated as a country--there was a great \ndebate actually going back to 1960, and was passed in 1965 in the \nHigher Education Act, that we as a nation say that any young person in \nthis country who has the skill and the ability to be admitted to a \ncollege, that they will not be denied that opportunity. If they do not \nhave financial assistance, they will have at least some assistance from \na Pell grant, named after our former colleague in the Senate, Claiborne \nPell. With the explosion of the cost of education, we still saw flat \nfunding for the Pell Grant Program, and now we are seeing a gradual \nincrease. In this particular appropriations bill, we have an increase \nin the Pell grant that will be effectively eliminated if this bill is \nvetoed.\n  The President should recognize that this bill finally delivers on \nmany of the promises we made some 6 years ago. He should embrace the \nprogress and sign the bill. Instead, the President has threatened to \nveto the bill and deny the help our schools so desperately need.\n  The President rejected this bill because it includes an increase of \n$4.5 billion for education funding over what he included in his budget. \nHe has requested $158 billion for the war in Iraq this year--that is \n$433 million today--$158 billion for the war in Iraq. All we are \ntalking about is a $4.5 billion increase for education. Mr. President, \n$4.5 billion for education gets a veto; $158 billion for the war in \nIraq gets his signature.\n  Let's look at the choices and compare the choices of American \nfamilies which are reflected in the legislation before us.\n  This chart reflects trying to help struggling schools turn around. \nAmerican families want to use these funds to help the 9,000 schools \nmost in need of improvement, to strengthen education for all of the \nchildren in these title I schools. This represents 1 day of the war in \nIraq, and the President says no.\n  The most important ingredient is the education of our teachers. \nHaving good teachers, well-trained teachers, knowledgeable teachers, \ncommitted teachers who will serve in our public school system is one of \nthe highest aspirations that we see reflected on our fellow \ncitizens. We need to have good teachers in many of the underserved \ncommunities, and we need to provide help for those teachers. We need to \ngive assistance to those teachers.\n\n[[Page S14034]]\n\n  We have some $3 billion for the high-quality teachers. This would \nhire 30,000 teachers to help reduce class size and provide high-quality \ninduction for 100,000 new teachers. This induction is assisting and \nfamiliarizing teachers in their classroom and in their homerooms. It \nhas been enormously successful in the retention of high-quality \nteachers, these kinds of programs being included in this legislation. \nIt provides high-quality professional development for 200,000 more \nteachers. Teachers want and need to have some time for their \ndevelopment, and this provides that help for their professional \ndevelopment.\n  Every other industrialized nation in the world provides this kind of \nassistance. Teachers need this kind of support. So we are providing \nimportant assistance to them. But, oh no, the President says, no, that \nwill be vetoed.\n  We have $7 billion to help provide the high-quality early education \nthrough the Head Start Programs, which equals 16 days of failed policy \nin Iraq. We all know the importance of early intervention. Everyone \nshould read ``From Neurons to Neighborhoods,'' the great book by Jack \nShonkoff, who has done such an extraordinary amount of work pulling \ntogether these three great studies from the National Institutes of \nHealth, which shows a snapshot of the child's early development, from \nbirth to the very earliest years, and the difference in terms of \ncognitive skills and also social behavior. The earlier the investment \nwe have in these programs, the better the results are.\n  We are not taking the time to reflect all that, but it is so. We have \ndemonstrated it time and time again. But that $7 billion is going to be \nsubject to the veto.\n  I wish to mention two very important areas. We are going through \nthese areas quickly, but I wish to mention the area of health \npriorities. We have mentioned early education and education, but we \nstrongly believe in the $4.9 billion in cancer research which would \nfund over 6,800 grants.\n  We are living in the life science century, with the extraordinary \nprogress that has been made in DNA research and sequencing of the \ngenes. The breakthroughs we have seen are absolutely mind-boggling. \nOver the recent years, we have effectively doubled the NIH research and \nthe results coming through are extraordinary. At the same time, we are \nnow finding that instead of taking advantage of these breakthroughs, we \nare beginning to cut back and cut back and cut back in terms of the \nopportunities in the areas of cancer and cancer research.\n  When you talk to families across this Nation about their priorities, \nNo. 1 in the area of health care will be in the areas of cancer \nresearch. We have 550,000 who die every year from cancer. It touches \nevery family in America either directly or indirectly. We know the \nchallenges we are facing now with diabetes and the challenges with \nobesity. There is an explosion across the country in terms of diabetes.\n  We have $700 million for pandemic flu, to strengthen our health \ndefenses. We know there are a variety of different strains that have \nbeen out there, both chemical and biologics, that could be enormously \ndangerous falling into the hands of the wrong groups and threatening \nAmerican populations in a very significant and important way. We cannot \nbe seeing a reduction in terms of our commitments to pandemic flu.\n  The Centers for Disease Control. Whenever we have a problem, look at \nthe television news over the period of the last couple of weeks, what \ndid we see when we had the problems over in the Far East and China? It \nis always the CDC that takes on the responsibility to go over and try \nto detect and find out what is happening in these areas. This is an \nenormously important health agency that has enormous capability and \nskill in terms of its personnel and commitment. We have all these \nvarious challenges--the increased amount of asthma that has effectively \ndoubled over the period of the last 15 years, increasing obesity, and \nchildhood immunizations. It is interesting there is a higher percentage \nof children in Iraq who are getting immunized for diseases like measles \nthan there are in the United States of America. How do we justify that? \nNow we are seeing a reduction in terms of childhood immunizations.\n  The community health centers, which are the lifeline for some 15 \nmillion low-income Americans, we are cutting back on those at a time \nwhen we are seeing increasing numbers of Americans losing their health \ninsurance. These are all programs that are tried, tested, evaluated and \nall extremely effective and programs the American people support. \nImmunization, the challenges of research in terms of cancer and \ndiabetes and obesity, the challenges we are facing in those areas, the \nimportance of investing in terms of education, all of these are \nextremely important.\n  Finally, I wish to mention worker safety and health spending, which \nis a fraction of the Iraq cost. One week in Iraq, $3 billion. These are \nthe total expenditures for protecting the $500 million in terms of \nOSHA. Since the passage of OSHA, we have reduced deaths in the \nworkplace by more than half. We have increasing complexity for OSHA, \nbecause with new techniques and new toxins being used in the workplace, \nthere are new challenges for OSHA. We need to make sure that in the \nUnited States of America we are going to have safe workplaces as well \nas workplaces where individuals can be demonstrating increased \nproductivity.\n  We all know the challenges that mine health safety has faced, whether \nit has been out in Utah or West Virginia, this past year. We have $340 \nmillion to try to ensure safety in the mines. But that is going to be \nvetoed. To demonstrate this isn't out-of-control spending, we have OSHA \nlast year and OSHA this year, which is a 2.8-percent increase over the \nPresident's request and some 12 percent in the area of mine safety. \nThese are basic and reasonable kinds of expressions by the Congress in \nareas of public concern. Nonetheless, we are hearing this \nadministration is going to veto it.\n\n  Let me also say we have seen an administration that is, over the past \nyears, increasing the reductions in terms of training programs under \nthe Workforce Investment Act. The Workforce Investment Act was \nbipartisan legislation. Senator Kassebaum, myself, and others were \ninvolved in the development and shaping of that, coordinating a variety \nof different job training programs. We had strong bipartisan support, \nand we had support from the workers and from the business community. It \nhas made an important difference. In my State of Massachusetts, at the \nend of last year, we had over 92,000 jobs that are out there waiting \nfor people to be able to take them. Yet we had more than 178,000 people \nwho are unemployed. You would think it would make some sense to get the \nskills to those individuals who can work, who want to work, so they can \nfill those jobs, become taxpayers and productive members of our \nsociety. That is what we are talking about in terms of workforce \ninvestment. That is what happens when we have good programs such as \nthis.\n  Nonetheless, we are finding out that even though this legislation \nrestores some $500 million to the cuts we have had these last several \nyears, this President is now committed toward vetoing.\n  So these are some of the items that are front and center in terms of \nthis appropriations bill. As I mentioned at the outset, this is an \nextremely important piece of legislation. It is basically about the \nsole well-being of our fellow citizens. It is about educating our \nyoung, ensuring the health and well-being of our fellow citizens, about \nensuring we are going to be able to have the kind of skills necessary \nso we can have a productive, expanding economy to be able to offer the \nhope and opportunity that good jobs, with good wages and good benefits, \nmeans to working families. That is what this legislation is about.\n  The numbers that have been included represent the best judgment of \nDemocrats and Republicans together. Compared to where we are in terms \nof the expenditures we have over in Iraq, all Americans, I believe, \nsay: Why aren't we investing in Americans? Why aren't we investing in \nour children, in our families, in education, in health care, in \ntraining? Why aren't we doing the things which are going to make this \nNation stronger in the future? Why are we going to face a veto by this \nPresident on these important priorities?\n  Make no mistake, it is a major mistake for this President to do so. I \nhope he will reconsider his position.\n\n[[Page S14035]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the motion to waive rule XXVIII. \nIf the motion to waive is defeated, the Military Construction-Veterans \nAffairs bill will be stricken from this conference report.\n  Frankly, I am a little bit tired of the political games the \nadministration plays with the health care of our veterans. It is the \nPresident's veto threats that necessitated the combining of the Labor, \nHHS, and Education bill and the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs \nbill. The President has threatened to veto 10 of the 12 appropriations \nbills--10. This President is insisting that Congress strip $22 billion \nfor homeland security, for educating our children, for NIH, and for \nfighting violent crime from the 12 bills. President Bush's budget \nrequest simply did not meet the needs of a veterans population that is \nsuffering from the pressures of war.\n  The number of disabled veterans, the type of injuries, and the mental \nhealth services needs produced by this horrendous Iraq war are well \nbeyond the President's shortsighted budget request. Congress, on a \nbipartisan basis, recognized that the President's request for veterans \nprograms was out of touch with reality, and we increased funding above \nthat inadequate request by $3.7 billion. The President's own bipartisan \nstudy found that the veterans health care system is in need of dramatic \nreform. Yet President Bush, our President, has not requested one thin \ndime, not one thin additional dime for veterans health care to \nimplement much-needed reforms. When faced with the dire political \nconsequences of this bad budget decision, the President, our President, \nPresident Bush, did a political dance and finally agreed to the \nadditional spending approved by Congress for our veterans. But--the \nconjunction ``but''--the President insisted that Congress find $3.7 \nbillion of savings to pay for it in other bills.\n  Did the President--our President--cut his request for a 12-percent \nincrease in foreign aid to pay for it? No.\n  Did the President, our President--your President, my President--did \nthe President reduce his--the President's--request for a 10-percent \nincrease for the Department of Defense to pay for it? Did he? No.\n  Did President Bush identify $3.7 billion of savings from his meager \nand inadequate budget for education or the National Institutes of \nHealth to pay for it? No.\n  President Bush, our President, brandishes his veto pen and refuses to \nparticipate in any attempt to correct his failed budget. Meanwhile, \nveterans health care, our children's education, vital health research, \nand other programs important to our citizens are at risk. As long as \nthe President--our President, President Bush--as long as the President \nlinks veterans funding to his demand for cuts in other vital domestic \nprograms, Congress has no choice--none--but to bundle these bills \ntogether.\n  His plan, the President's plan, to veto the Labor-HHS and Education \nbill, and sign the Military Construction-VA bill would force Congress \nto make dramatic reductions in such areas as education funding, funding \nfor the National Institutes of Health, and funding for low-income home \nenergy assistance.\n  Those decisions would be very bad decisions, and every Member of the \nSenate knows it or ought to know it. The Labor-HHS and Education bill \npassed the Senate by a vote of 75 to 19. The Military Construction-\nVeterans Affairs bill passed the Senate by a vote of 92 to 1.\n  Bundling these bills is not an effort to jam the Senate with \ncontroversial legislation. These bills were fully debated. Any Senator \ncould have come to the floor to offer amendments to reduce funding in \nthe bill. Any Senator who votes ``no'' on the motion to waive has a \nresponsibility to come down to the floor and show down on the $3.7 \nbillion of cuts that Senator would propose for such programs.\n  This bill could be on the President's desk tomorrow. Any Senator who \nvotes ``no'' on the motion to waive rule XXVIII has a responsibility to \nexplain to veterans why that Senator refused to tell the President of \nthe United States that he needs to sign this legislation. I urge a \n``yea'' vote on the motion to waive rule XXVIII.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very proud that this afternoon we \nare considering a very important bill that will fund not only the \nimportant investments in health, education, and the workforce but also \nhistoric increases in spending for our veterans and for their families.\n  Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter have put together a great \nLabor-HHS bill. I am very proud to support it. But this afternoon I \nwant to take a little bit of time to speak directly to the importance \nof the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs portion of this package, \nbecause today it is in grave danger of being blocked by bipartisan \ngamesmanship.\n  Our servicemembers in Iraq and Afghanistan and from so many conflicts \nbefore have done absolutely everything we have asked of them. They have \nanswered the President's call to war with the honor and sense of duty \nwe have come to expect from our Nation's bravest men and women. They \nhave performed under enormous pressure in the middle of a civil war. \nThey have left loved ones behind who count on them. They continue to \nput their own lives on the line every single day.\n  Now, unfortunately here at home, this administration has not been \ncommitted to care for them when they come home. From poor conditions at \nVA facilities around the country to a lack of PTSD counselors, to a \nbenefits claims backlog that keeps our veterans waiting for months and \nsometimes amazingly even years, this administration has failed to \naccount for our Nation's veterans as a part of the cost of this war. It \nis unacceptable that servicemembers who return from fighting overseas \nare being forced to fight their own Government for the care and the \nservices we have promised them.\n  Democrats today on this floor are working to reverse the Bush \nadministration's failure to care for those heroes. We have produced a \nfunding bill for our veterans that includes $3.6 billion more than the \nPresident asked. After years of Bush Republicans cutting corners on our \nveterans, we have, with this bill, offered an honest assessment of what \nthese men and women need.\n  This bill takes into account the extra strains that have been put on \nour VA system from our simultaneous wars and the new battlefield \nrealities that are present today. It includes nearly all of the \n``independent budget,'' a recommendation that has been compiled by our \nveteran service organizations. It makes investments that will improve \nhealth care and expand mental health services and allow construction \nfor vitally needed new facilities.\n  It is going to mean more qualified health care workers, better \nprosthetics, and more accessible veterans facilities. It is going to \nensure our veterans get their earned benefits, see improved conditions \nat VA facilities, and get better treatment for PTSD, traumatic brain \ninjury, and catastrophic injury.\n  Most of all, though, this bill means that after years of neglect, our \nGovernment, the United States of America, will again honor the \nsacrifice of our veterans with the care they deserve.\n\n[[Page S14036]]\n\n  We are also making sure our troops are ready and that they receive \nthe training they need. That is why I was so pleased about the military \nconstruction investment this bill makes across the country and \nespecially in my home State. My home State of Washington's military \nfacilities play an important role in our nation's security, from Fort \nLewis in Tacoma, which is training the Stryker brigades--they are at \nthe center of the fight in Iraq--to Fairchild Air Force Base in \nSpokane, which plays a major role in our air defense; to Naval Air \nStation Whidbey Island, which patrols our Pacific shores.\n  This bill ensures they are going to get funding they need, like all \nof our military facilities nationwide. In Washington State, it means \nmore than $635 million in improvement for Washington's military \ninstallations.\n  One of the best things about this bill is it won such huge bipartisan \nsupport when it passed the Senate on a vote of 92 to 1--92 to 1 it \npassed the Senate. It does not get much better than that for a \nbipartisan, strongly supported piece of legislation.\n  Unfortunately, today Republicans seem to be willing to jeopardize all \nthe good, critical, important matters that have been put into this bill \nwhich they said they supported, in order to play a procedural game that \nis designed to stop this important bill in its tracks. I think that is \na shame.\n  Now they are going to say, and the President will echo them, that the \nbill before the Senate is too expensive. They will say we should have \nnot joined the spending for veterans with spending for health care, \neducation, and job training.\n  In the same breath, they are going to say this money for veterans is \ncritically important and should be sent to the President before Sunday. \nWell, I agree with my 91 colleagues who supported this bill the first \ntime we voted on it, and I agree we need to get it signed into law as \nsoon as possible, and we can do that very easily by voting for it \ntoday, along with this package. It will go to the President by \ndinnertime.\n\n  Most importantly, veterans would go to sleep tonight knowing that the \nvital projects in this bill are on the way. But I fear that is not \ngoing to happen. Instead, now we have Republicans who are going to make \na cynical political move and block this money for our veterans because \nwe have combined it with the Labor, Health and Education spending bill.\n  The President objects, apparently, to combining those bills. So I \nguess the Republicans are going to put their allegiances behind \nPresident Bush ahead of our veterans and say ``no'' to a bill that \nalmost all of those Senators supported a few short weeks ago. I think \nthat is wrong.\n  The Labor, Health and Education bill is a good one. It won the \nsupport of 75 Senators a few weeks ago here on the Senate floor. We are \njoining the two because both make critical investments in a broad range \nof urgent priorities. We need to stop playing political games with both \nof these bills and we need the President to sign them now. The \nRepublicans and the President are complaining about this move today. \nBut it is the American people and our veterans and their families, in \nparticular, who will be hurt if this political move is made today to \nseparate these bills. They will pay the price, those veterans and their \nfamilies, for this roadblock.\n  Our goal is simple. We want to make up for something President Bush \nhas failed to do while he has tried to build up our military. We want \nto be sure our veterans are getting the care they need.\n  As I told my friends before, George Washington was the one who \nfamously observed that:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional to how they perceive the veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their country.\n\n  Today we want to reverse President Bush's failure and reaffirm this \ncommitment. This bill keeps our military strong by honoring the \nsacrifices of our heroes and meeting their needs. When those men and \nwomen put on a uniform, they earn the right to a government that cares \nfor them on their return. When we approve this bill, we will assure \nthem they will get finally the care they need.\n  Veterans Day is just a few days away. I am confident every Senator on \nthis floor will head home to acknowledge the veterans in their State, \nand rightfully tell them ``thank you'' for the tremendous service they \nhave given to our country. I can think of no better time than this for \nus to forget the politics and do something positive for our veterans, \nfor their families, and for our country.\n  I have listened to the other side and the President tell us time and \nagain: We need to get the bills to the President. We need to get the \nappropriations bills to the President. That is what we are trying to do \ntoday, to get two of these critical bills to the President in a timely \nmanner. I urge our colleagues to think twice about a procedural move \nthat will not send to the President the critical funding we need for \nour veterans and our military facilities across this country. With one \nvote we can send those to the President, and by dinner tonight know we \nare doing our job for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have mixed feelings about the \nconference report now before the Senate. The chairman and ranking \nmember of the Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee and the \nMilitary Construction-Veterans Affairs Subcommittee have done excellent \nwork in crafting their respective bills. These bills represent a \nreasonable blending of House and Senate priorities. They support \ncritical national priorities in medical research, veterans' care, K-12 \neducation, and military infrastructure. But the fact these two bills \nhave been joined into a single conference report is unfortunate. The \nPresident has stated unequivocally he will veto the Labor-Health and \nHuman Services bill in its current form.\n  By attaching the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs bill, the \nDemocratic leadership has done nothing to change his mind. The bill \nwill still be vetoed, and the veto will probably be sustained. Through \nthe duration of that process, we will needlessly delay the availability \nof critical funding for veterans' care, and for the facilities \nnecessary to support our Armed Forces.\n  There is no procedural reason that the Military Construction-Veterans \nAffairs conference committee could not meet this evening to approve the \nconference agreement under their jurisdiction. The House and Senate \ncould then approve that conference report and get it to the President's \ndesk for signature by Veterans Day.\n  That would be the right thing to do. The Labor-Health and Human \nServices bill could also be sent to the President, and both the \nCongress and the President would have been allowed to argue their \nrespective fiscal priorities. Instead, we are being compelled to go \nthrough this procedural dance that adds nothing to the debate over \nfiscal policy and serves only to compound Congress's abysmal failure to \nget appropriations bills to the President.\n  I am acutely aware of past failures to enact appropriations bills in \na timely fashion. I was chairman of that committee, and I remember how \nupset and frustrated I was when the Republican leadership wouldn't call \nup the bills. I couldn't believe it, an abdication of very important \nresponsibilities of the Congress, a fundamental right and \nresponsibility of the Congress to set the appropriations priorities. No \none was more frustrated with the Senate's failure to consider these \nbills last year. I was particularly exasperated by our inability to get \nwhat appeared to be a noncontroversial Military Construction-Veterans \nAffairs bill to conference. That was as inexcusable then as it is now. \nBut past failures don't make the current failure any more acceptable to \nme. The President has a right to veto bills. There is no way around \nthat. This President has strong opinions about his responsibility to be \ninvolved in holding down Federal spending, keeping the budget under \ncontrol. Why are we compounding our failure to present him \nappropriations bills by wrapping into Labor-Health and Human Services \nanother bill that we all agree is important and that the President has \nsaid he will sign?\n  This procedure does nothing to change the substance of the debate,\n\n[[Page S14037]]\n\nand it only serves to further delay the appropriations process. There \nmay come a point when vetoes of appropriations bills require us to go \nback to the drawing board and rewrite some of the bills at lower \nspending levels. There may also come a point in that process where I \nbelieve the funding levels advocated by the President are not \nappropriate or sustainable in certain cases. We have the right to \ndisagree. Somewhere along the way, I remain hopeful we will reach an \naccommodation that will allow for enactment of individual \nappropriations bills at an aggregate funding level that is lower than \nthe amount contemplated in the budget resolution. But to get to that \npoint, we have to send the President some appropriations bills.\n  It is November 7. We have failed to send a single one to his desk. I \nhope the Senate will support the Hutchison motion so we can put two \nbills on the President's desk in short order and start to demonstrate \nto the American people that we are responsible, that we are acting on \none of our most fundamental responsibilities, the passage of \nappropriations bills for the operation of the Federal Government.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be given \n10 minutes from the majority leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are here today at this juncture to talk \nabout the point of order raised against combining the MILCON bill and \nthe Health and Human Services appropriations bill. There is a large \npoint I will try to make, which is that these bills are complementary \nin many real ways. Veterans, for example, do not live alone with other \nveterans. They have families who require education, Pell grants, Head \nStart funds, and all of that is within the purview of the Health and \nHuman Services appropriations bill. Also, they are individuals, our \nveterans, who have earned their rights. But I don't believe they \nengaged in battles for this country and wore the uniform of this \ncountry to get a pension or to get a health benefit; they did it for a \nbroader, much larger, much more noble purpose, and that was to build a \ndecent and just America. Part of that is making sure children have \nimmunizations, making sure children can go to good schools and \ndisadvantaged children can enjoy health through the title I program; \nmaking sure talented young people can go to college with a Pell grant \nor a Stafford loan; the CDC can protect all of us from disease, and the \nNIH can use their resources to research breakthroughs in medicine and \nhealth care to benefit all of us. It is that vision of a decent, \nhumane, and just America that ultimately compelled millions of \nAmericans to wear the uniform of this country and defend it.\n  So the notion that we can arbitrarily or not arbitrarily separate \nthese bills, I don't think it accords with one of the major functions \nof all of us as citizens, as soldiers, as Senators--to serve the \ngreater good--and we are doing that, I think, with these two \nappropriations bills.\n  There is another point I think which is interesting to me. These \nbills have passed the Senate overwhelmingly. They would, I think, if \nthey were separated, pass overwhelmingly. But it seems to me we are now \nin a situation where we can't combine them because the President has \nsaid: Don't put them together because I will sign one and veto the \nother, which presents my colleagues in the Senate a very interesting \nsituation: After voting for the underlying bills overwhelmingly, do \nthey support the President's veto? I hope we can avoid that.\n  I think we should send these bills together to the President today. \nWe can do that. We can expedite the funding of the VA at record levels. \nWe can fulfill our obligations to citizens across this country in many \ndifferent ways by supporting this procedural approach of combining the \nbills, voting for the bills, and sending them to the President.\n  But the premise I think is we will separate them if this point of \norder is sustained, and then we will see the VA bill probably signed \nbut then have to come back and negotiate a way for a bill we all \nsupport--the Health and Human Services bill. I don't think that is the \nright approach. The fastest way to get this legislation, with respect \nto veterans, to the President is to vote against this point of order, \nsend it to the President, he can sign it, and next week we can \ncelebrate Veterans Day with the largest veterans appropriations bill \nthat we have ever passed. I think that is the route we should pursue. I \ndon't think we should allow the President to dictate the terms.\n  One of the interesting things about the President's approach--\nparticularly as we have talked time and time again about Iraq--is that: \nWell, the Congress can't tell me how to run policy; all they can do is \nfund or not fund the war. Well, here we are making a very bold, very \nassertive statement about funding the Veterans' administration, \nMilitary Construction, and Health and Human Services. But he says: \nWell, you can't do that. You can't tell me that either because I will \nveto one and I would not accept a package, even though it is a package \nof funding. Again, I think we have to--and we should--assert our will, \nparticularly when it comes to the underlying legislation that passed \nthis body with extraordinary--extraordinary margins. This would be, I \nthink, a different debate if we had taken a bill that was popular and \ncombined it with a bill that could not pass this body, or barely pass \nthis body. Both of these bills have commanded I think strong support, \nand they should go forward and be signed by the President.\n  But there is another issue here, too, and it goes back to the initial \npoint I made about there is a complementarity between these two bills, \nand it is a very direct and, I believe, powerful one. We have, for \nexample, within the Health and Human Services bill, $228 million for \nthe Veterans Employment and Training Program. It is in the Department \nof Labor. But if you are a veteran and you are looking for the training \nyou need and employment opportunities because you have served your \ncountry honorably and well--and if we don't pass that Health and Human \nServices bill, that money will not be there. We have in the Department \nof Labor $23.6 million for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. \nIn fact, I dare say, there is too little attention being paid to \nhomeless veterans. There was a report today that one in four homeless \nindividuals are veterans of the military. That is a shocking and \nshameful statistic for this country. We have in this bill one of \nseveral programs--very small, but they help veterans. That is in the \nlabor portion of the bill; that is not in the veterans' portion of the \nbill. Funding for the Department of Education, $1.26 billion to impact \naid payments. Those payments are targeted to school systems that serve \nmilitary installations, large populations not only of veterans, but of \nActive-Duty soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. So we are saying: \nGreat, we are going to give the veterans what they deserve, but for \nthose veterans and Active-Duty personnel, we can't vote in this bill \nfor $1.26 billion in impact aid. We can't provide their children the \nkind of school systems in adjoining neighborhoods to military posts \nthat we think is adequate--not only adequate but we hope excellent.\n  So these bills are not distinguished in some respects. They serve the \nveteran population and the military population, and to suggest they are \ntotally opposed and diametric is, I think, wrong.\n  In the area of health care funding, we went a long way in the \nVeterans' Administration bill to put significant resources into the \nveterans health care program.\n  In fact, for the first time, it exceeds the independent budget which \nveterans organizations present to us each year, when it comes to \nveterans health care, the largest increase in veterans health care, the \nlargest appropriation we have ever given.\n  One of the areas we asked them to look at is traumatic brain injury, \npost-traumatic stress. We understand now because of the nature of \ncombat and conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, there\n\n[[Page S14038]]\n\nare thousands of young men and women coming back with traumatic brain \ninjuries. They did surveys of returning brigades of some of our Army \nunits and estimated that perhaps 20 percent of the troops might have \nsome indication of traumatic brain injury--slight to moderate. Over \ntime, this is an increasingly more difficult problem for the VA system. \nOf course, we have asked them to treat these individuals. But in the \nHealth Resources and Service Administration--in the other \nappropriations bill, we have $9.5 million for the traumatic brain \ninjury program.\n  We have billions of dollars for the National Institutes of Health, \nfor their research, which will be extremely important if we want to \nunderstand the phenomenon of traumatic brain injury. Of course, if we \ndon't move that bill today, this bill, along with the Veterans' \nAdministration bill, at least temporarily we lose these funds.\n  So I think there is a synergy between the two bills. I think it goes \nback to not just the complementary programs; it goes back to what our \nveterans and our soldiers today are serving for--not self-\naggrandizement, not a pension, or to get the benefits they have earned \nalone but for something bigger. Those men and women are not out there \nputting time in so when they get to be 40 or have 20-plus years of \nmilitary service they get the pension. They are risking their lives so \nthis country lives up to its highest ideals. If we cannot provide and \npass a robust appropriations bill and get it signed by the President on \nHealth and Human Services, we are not living up to our obligations and \nour ideals.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the waiver of \nthe point of order--the waiver being the motion from the Senator from \nIowa. I agree in part and disagree in part with the acting chairman of \nthe Military Construction-Veterans Affairs Subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, two bills were passed by the Senate--one for Labor-\nHealth and Human Services and one for Military Construction-Veterans \nAffairs. They are two separate bills because they are very different in \nnature. They cover very different areas. There was nothing in the bills \nthat was the same. They are separate subjects, and they should be \npassed in the regular order.\n  I have heard criticism on the Senate floor and also in the conference \ncommittee of the President of the United States, as if he had told \nCongress not to combine these bills. The President never said any such \nthing. The President did exactly what I would expect a President to do \nin his relations with Congress and its understanding of the role of our \ntwo different branches of government--executive and legislative. The \nfact is, Congress chose to take two separate bills and put them \ntogether. All the President did was exactly what he should have done. \nHe advised Congress that he was going to veto the Labor-Health and \nHuman Services bill because it was nearly $12 billion over his budget \nrequest. When Congress said: OK, Mr. President, we are going to combine \nthe bill that you have notified us you are going to veto with a bill \nthat you have notified us you will sign, which is the Military \nConstruction-Veterans Affairs bill, the President merely said: I have \nsaid I am going to veto the Labor-Health and Human Services bill, and I \nam putting Congress on notice. Congress can make the decision about how \nit wants to send the bills forward. The President can inform Congress \nof what he is going to do, which I think, frankly, is an advantage in \nthat he has told us. The worst thing would be if he didn't tell us, if \nhe just surprised us after we had worked in good faith on these bills. \nBut he is not surprising us. He is telling us this is what he is going \nto do, and if we decide to play a game by putting two bills together, \nwhen he has told us he is going to veto one of them, the consequence \nwill be that both bills are vetoed instead of just one.\n  Let's not put the President in this debate. The President is doing \nexactly what he should do. The Congress should do what is right. \nCongress knows the funding for military construction and the veterans \nis crucial, that there are new things in this bill that are not \ncurrently able to be funded. And the sooner we get this bill to the \nPresident, the sooner he can sign it, and we can provide these new \npriorities.\n  Where I agree with my distinguished acting chairman of the committee \nis that the bill is a good bill. We have come together in a very \nbipartisan way. We have worked out our differences, and we didn't have \ndifferences on the Senate side. We worked together on a very solid \nbill. We worked out our differences with the House on a bipartisan \nbasis. The President agreed with us that it is a good bill. We all \nrecognize that some of the best parts of the bill would be lost if \nthere were another continuing resolution for Fiscal Year 2008.\n  Delaying base-closing commission implementation: As a Congress, we \nhave required the Department of Defense to complete the implementation \nof the Base Realignment and Closure Commission report by 2011. Every \nday, every week, every month that we delay the BRAC funding is going to \ndelay that implementation process. It is very important that we give \nour troops who are going to be coming back from bases in Germany and \nKorea the housing, the health care facilities, and the childcare \ncenters that will provide a quality of life for our military personnel \nand their families. We owe them that, Mr. President.\n  We could send this bill to the President before the end of the week \nand make sure they have that funding. It is our responsibility to do \nit. It is our responsibility to do it in the regular order, when the \nregular order will give us a Presidential signature. It will also \nprovide new research, new treatments, and added facilities for our \nveterans. We know our veterans are suffering from different kinds of \ninjuries than in previous wars. We know we are saving more lives, but a \nhigher percentage of our wounded veterans are returning home with \nburns, loss of limbs, traumatic brain injuries, and mental health \nproblems. We know that. So we provide for that in this bill. We have \ndone it in a bipartisan way. We have provided more treatment, more \nfacilities, more emphasis, and more research on post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome, traumatic brain injuries, better prosthetics, artificial legs \nand arms that are lost by the bombs being used by the insurgents. All \nof that is in this bill, which could go through on its own in the \nregular order and be signed by the President.\n  One of the things we have heard from our veterans month after month \nafter month is how long it is taking them to get through the system \nfrom when they leave military service to begin receiving their benefits \nand even to enter into the VA health care system. It is ridiculous for \nthem to wait months and months when we should have a seamless \ntransition. What our bill provides is more employees to cut that \nbacklog and give these new veterans who are coming into the system the \nopportunity to have a seamless transition. That is in the bill.\n  If we pass a CR, this year's priorities would not be in it. The bill \ncontains funds to implement the recommendations of the Dole-Shalala \nCommission. The Dole-Shalala Commission is the Commission that was \nappointed by the President to look at the best way to improve the care \nand service we provide to Active Duty Military and veterans who have \nreturned from battle. They made recommendations. They did a thorough \nstudy. These are two great Americans: Donna Shalala and Robert Dole. \nThey came up with recommendations, and we begin to fund them in this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, why wouldn't we pass this bill as a stand-alone \nmeasure when we know it is going to be vetoed if it is combined with \nthe Labor-Health and Human Services bill? It does not pass the smell \ntest to combine these bills when there is no reason to. In the original \nHouse action, they combined Health and Human Services with Defense and \nMilitary Construction and Veterans. The Defense bill was separated out \nbecause the chairman and the ranking member agreed that it had no \nbusiness under Labor-Health and Human Services. That bill, by \nagreement, was separated out. We didn't get that agreement on Military \nConstruction. So now we are faced with having a point of order, under \nthe newly passed rule by the Democratic majority, that says you cannot \nput something in a conference report that has not passed either House \nin that bill.\n\n[[Page S14039]]\n\n  So the point of order is going to succeed. We all know it is going to \nsucceed. Why do we play this game? It is a game that is going to affect \nveterans and military personnel and their quality of life. There is no \nreason, there is no substantive reason, and there is no logical reason.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's vote unanimously to separate these bills, \nsend the MILCON and Veterans bill to the House and ask them to quickly \nappoint conferees. The bill is agreed to. We have hashed out the \ndifferences. We can still get this bill to the President before \nVeterans Day. What a great accomplishment for this Congress, what a \ngreat way to say the President and the Congress are in agreement on \nsomething. I think the American people are looking for that. We see \nthat the ratings of Congress and the President are at an all-time low. \nWhy not give the American people some confidence that we can accomplish \nsomething together for the good of the people? It is very easy, very \nclear that this is a bill the President says he will sign. Let's send \nit to him. There can be no logical reason not to.\n  I urge my colleagues to come together on a bipartisan basis and stop \nthe game playing, especially with our veterans and our military \nfamilies who are depending upon the new initiatives in this bill to be \ndone, and we have the power to do it. Let's do our jobs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business, with the time coming from the majority \nleader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Democracy in Pakistan\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to strongly \ncondemn General Musharraf's declaration of martial law in Pakistan, his \ndecision to suspend that country's constitution, and his brutal \nsuppression of freedom and democracy and human rights.\n  Since Saturday, General Musharraf of Pakistan has ordered the police \nand military to arrest thousands of lawyers, human rights activists, \nand political workers. At this very moment, as we dither in Washington, \nMusharraf's thugs--thugs--are cracking down on democracy advocates \nacross that country. Lawyers in coats and ties are being viciously \nbeaten in the streets and thrown into jail. One out of four lawyers in \nPakistan has been arrested since Saturday--one out of every four. In \nLahore, police are being given cash bonuses for beating and arresting \nlawyers. Any of us who have watched television have seen the scenes of \nlawyers being picked up by plainclothes policemen, pushed into vans, \nand the plainclothes thugs beating them on the heads and backs as they \npushed them into vans. This is especially sad and ironic inasmuch as \nthe founder of Pakistan, the much revered Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was \nhimself a lawyer trained at Lincoln's Inn in London.\n  Since 9/11, the United States has given General Musharraf and \nPakistan more than $10 billion in aid, supposedly to crack down on the \nterrorists, the Taliban, and al-Qaida in their sanctuaries in Pakistan. \nInstead, General Musharraf is cracking down on lawyers, political \nopponents, and human rights activists or anyone who dares to stand in \nhis way of total power in Pakistan.\n  Pakistan's Chief Justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, is under house arrest, \nand the widely admired chair of the Human Rights Commission, Asma \nJahangir, with whom I have met twice when I was in Pakistan--on two of \nthe occasions I have been in Pakistan, I met with Asma Jahangir. She is \na wonderful, lovely woman fighting for human rights for people in \nPakistan. Her house has been declared a ``subjail'' by the Government.\n  What crimes have these people committed? They are guilty only of \nspeaking out against General Musharraf's claim of absolute, unchecked \npower.\n  These are truly the actions of a desperate man. Obviously, General \nMusharraf is worried that the supreme court would rule in favor of \nthose opposing his latest attempt to hold on to the Presidency and to \nremain a general in charge of the military at the same time. This is a \nblatant violation of international human rights standards enshrined in \nPakistan's own constitution. General Musharraf has also cracked down on \nthe independent media, shutting down all private television channels \nand radio stations.\n  What has been the reaction from our President and Secretary of State \nto this brazen violation of human rights and the democratic aspirations \nof the Pakistani people? President Bush has said he is ``deeply \ndisturbed.'' He has pointedly refrained from saying anything or \ncondemning General Musharraf's actions.\n  I guess what set me off today was Negroponte. Deputy Secretary of \nState Negroponte told Congress on Wednesday that President Pervez \nMusharraf is an `` `indispensable' ally in the U.S.-led war on \nterrorism. . . .'' I am sorry, Mr. Negroponte, Mr. Musharraf is not an \nindispensable ally. The Pakistani people are an indispensable ally in \nour fight against terrorism. What a double standard.\n  Look at how the administration responded when Myanmar's military \nregime cracked down on prodemocracy protesters in September. Oh, my \ngosh, we condemned them to the high heavens--rightfully so. Now here is \nGeneral Musharraf doing the same thing in Pakistan and barely a peep \nfrom this administration. And then we have Negroponte, who has shown \nhis colors in the past by calling dictators in Latin America in the \npast, now coming out saying Musharraf is indispensable. What does that \nsay to the Pakistani people? What a double standard. No wonder the \nUnited States is held in such low esteem around the world today when we \nhave President Bush and Mr. Negroponte taking after the brutal \ndictators in Myanmar, but, oh, not General Musharraf.\n  This is a profound mistake. This is the time to stand with the \nPakistani people and not with the dictator who is dismantling their \ndemocracy. This is the time for the President to announce that he is \nsuspending all U.S. aid to Pakistan except for humanitarian assistance \ndirectly related to the health, education, and human needs of the \nPakistani people.\n  As of yesterday, President Bush has not even placed a call to General \nMusharraf. He should do so immediately. He should demand that the \ngeneral immediately return the country to constitutional rule, restore \nfreedom of the press, and unconditionally release the lawyers, human \nrights activists, and opposition leaders who have been arrested since \nSaturday, and he should inform General Musharraf that the United States \nis suspending all assistance to Pakistan, except for humanitarian aid, \nuntil such action is taken.\n  The world's greatest democracy, the United States, cannot turn a \nblind eye to the tragedy unfolding in Pakistan today. The time to act \nis now, and if the President will not act, I am prepared to work with \nmy colleagues in Congress to suspend all assistance, except \nhumanitarian aid, to Pakistan and to do it as soon as possible.\n  As I said, since 9/11, we have provided more than $10 billion in aid \nto Pakistan. The overwhelming amount of this went to the military to \nboost its capacity to fight terrorism. But, unfortunately, the Pentagon \nand OMB have very little transparency or oversight of just how that \nmoney is being used or has been used.\n  In fiscal year 2007, Pakistan received an average of $83 million a \nmonth at a time when Musharraf had negotiated a so-called peace \narrangement with tribal leaders and was not even conducting \ncounterterrorism operations in tribal areas. I think it is time for our \nGAO to look into where this money went, and I will be working with my \ncolleagues on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee to ensure that \nCongress is provided an accounting of all these expenditures. There are \ntoo many rumors, too many stories being told around Pakistan that a lot \nof this money has found its way into the pockets of high-ranking people \nsurrounding General Musharraf.\n  Now I am told that some of our military money is being spent by \nPakistan\n\n[[Page S14040]]\n\non Harpoon missiles. These are antiship missiles used in naval warfare. \nWhy in the world do they need these missiles? Is al-Qaida operating \nmajor surface warships? Hardly.\n  While this administration and Mr. Negroponte say that Musharraf has \nbeen a partner in the war on terror, the evidence is different.\n\n  Recently, Musharraf entered into a peace agreement with Baitullah \nMehsud, a well-known Taliban supporter and sympathizer who operates in \nsouth Waziristan. This is the tribal area bordering Afghanistan where \nit is thought that maybe Osama bin Laden is hiding out. General \nMusharraf agreed to withdraw all Pakistani troops from the area and \nrelease 25 Taliban militants.\n  Additionally, Mr. Mehsud would not even agree to stop dispatching \nfighters to Afghanistan, where suicide bombings against American and \nNATO forces have dramatically increased this year. Just yesterday, \nthere was a horrific Taliban bombing in northern Afghanistan, with \ndozens of people killed, including at least six members of the Afghan \nParliament.\n  I ask: Why is General Musharraf making deals with the sponsor of \nattacks such as this? Is General Musharraf helping or hurting our fight \nagainst militant Islamic extremists in Pakistan? He makes an agreement \nwith a known Taliban supporter, but he won't make any agreements with \nlawyers and human rights activists in Pakistan.\n  It is time for the Bush administration to make our efforts in \nPakistan more effective. We need a real partner in this fight, not \nGeneral Musharraf. He has severely undercut his ability to effectively \nfight terrorism. It is time to understand that only a government that \nis supported by its people will actually have the ability to crack down \non extremists who seek to hurt and harm American interests.\n  The people of Pakistan have spoken out. They do not want Musharraf, \nbut he is not listening. He is a dictator, and he is going to stay \nthere, and he is going to trash the Constitution, he is going to jail \nlawyers and human rights activists and members of the supreme court.\n  Just remember, Musharraf came to power in a coup d'etat in 1999, \nousting the democratically elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He \nassumed the title of chief executive. Later, he assumed the office of \nPresident of Pakistan, all the while remaining commander in chief of \nthe military. Now he is seizing absolute power.\n  I have come to the floor many times in the last 13 years to speak \nabout America's relationship with Pakistan, to praise Pakistan and the \nPakistani people as a steadfast ally going back for more than half a \ncentury. I have been to Pakistan many times. Make no mistake, I am a \nfriend of the people of Pakistan. I admire them greatly. They have been \ngreat, strong friends of the United States for over 50 years. In the \nfight against communism and in every war we have ever conducted, they \nhave helped us out. But at this time, I must speak out about the grave \ninjustices being inflicted on the Pakistani people by General Musharraf \nin his grab for absolute power.\n  In the months and years ahead, the people of Pakistan will be asking: \nWho stood with us against General Musharraf's attempt to destroy \ndemocracy and seize absolute power? That is why it is so important that \nwe in Congress, and the President as well, make it clear that we stand \nwith the Pakistani people and Pakistani democracy and the rule of law \nand we reject Musharraf's power grab.\n\n\n           Robert H. Clampitt Foundation Children's PressLine\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a provision in \nthis bill that I sponsored. With funding in this conference report \ndesignated in the fund for the improvement of education, the Robert H. \nClampitt Foundation's Children's PressLine will establish a New Orleans \nbureau to teach journalism skills to at-risk youth in New Orleans.\n  Using an oral journalism methodology created 31 years ago by its \npredecessor, Children's Express, New York City-based Children's \nPressLine, CPL, has a proven model of civic engagement and issues \nawareness by youth that facilitates the participation of children of \nall ages and literacy levels. Every year, CPL enables more than 75 \nchildren and teens to be trained quickly and easily, empowering them \nwith real-world critical thinking, learning and writing skills outside \nof the constraints of a traditional classroom environment. This CPL \nmodel has a proven track record for creating an engaging program that \nteaches critical professional skills and media literacy in a format \nthat invests children in the lasting journalism that they produce.\n  This funding would provide for CPL personnel to work with local \neducation and community leaders to establish a New Orleans bureau, \nimplementing the CPL model for youth training and development. In the \nspirit of CPL's acclaimed ``In Search of Faith'' project following 9/\n11, the bureau's youth reporters would apply their skills to creating \nan oral history of children's experiences recovering from Hurricane \nKatrina. As CPL content is syndicated nationally through the Scripps \nHoward News Service and through online news sites including PBS \nOnlineNewsHour, the program would also create a national forum for \nchildren's voices to be heard.\n  By sharing their poststorm experiences with a national audience, \nthese children will both process their traumatic experiences in a \ncreative way, while also developing important writing skills that will \nbolster their academic achievement. These types of creative programs \nare critical for children's development, particularly after a traumatic \nexperience, and we are excited that CPL will now have the resources \nnecessary to build a New Orleans bureau and work with children who will \nbenefit greatly from the program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you to the senior Senator from Louisiana for \nspeaking so eloquently about the benefit that her State will get from \nfunding in this bill. I understand there has been some confusion about \nthe intent of this funding. I want to assure my friend from Louisiana \nthat I will communicate to the Department of Education that the intent \nof this funding is to help children in New Orleans.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will join the chairman in his efforts to clarify this \nprovision.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you to the chairman and ranking member for their \nefforts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. President, I wish to discuss the appropriations package \nbefore this Chamber today. We find ourselves, once again, dealing with \nthe bulk of our Nation's spending bills at the end of the year, behind \nschedule, devoid of the careful consideration these important measures \nwarrant. It is distressing that year after year, the Congress fails to \nproduce legislation on time and free of unrequested, unauthorized, and \nwasteful spending. It is unfortunate that this year is no different.\n  In hopes of avoiding a veto from the President on a bloated Labor, \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill, the majority has decided \nto lump the bill together with the popular Military Construction-\nVeterans Administration appropriations bill. Instead of allowing this \nbody to consider each bill on its own merits through robust and \ntransparent debate, the majority and its members of the appropriations \ncommittees have attempted to shield their wasteful ways with the \ntreatment and well-being of our servicemen, women, and veterans covered \nunder the MilCon-VA bill. Not only is this an unconscionable tactic, it \nalso is a violation of Senate rules, specifically rule XXVIII and \nrepresents the continued devolution of our annual budgeting process. I \nam confident that there will be enough collective wisdom mustered today \nto uphold the Senate rules and send this conference report back to the \nHouse.\n  Let us address briefly the reasoning behind the President's \nthreatened veto of the underlying bill. The Labor-HHS bill currently \nstands $9.8 billion above the President's request, and $841 million \nover the Senate-passed level. Not only is this an unacceptable \ninflation of the original funding request, but it also highlights the \negregious practice of earmarking funds. During conference, behind \nclosed doors, there were at least 117 earmarks added to the Labor-HHS \nportion of the bill, and an additional 109 earmarks inserted into the \nMilCon-VA portion. Overall, the package before us today contains an \neye-popping total of nearly 2,200 earmarks. I am ashamed of this \ngraphic\n\n[[Page S14041]]\n\ndisplay of waste. It is disconcerting that in this time of necessity \nfor our men and women returning from service overseas, lawmakers have \nattempted to hijack a bill vital to ensuring their proper care and \ntreatment.\n\n  As usual, the majority of earmarked funds in this bill will go to the \nStates represented by members who serve on the appropriations \ncommittee. I have long stressed the necessity of reforming the \nexcessive and irresponsible ways of earmarking, and the state of the \nbill before us today only reinforces that need. And to think, less than \nmonths ago, most Members heralded the enactment of the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act of 2007, believing it would change \nbusiness as usual. Well, it hasn't.\n  Allow me to take a moment to highlight a few earmarks of particular \nnote: $350,000 to study the relationship between residential floor \ncoverings and distributive patterns of airborne particulates in Smyrna, \nGA; $320,000 for the American Jazz Museum, Kansas City, MO; $400,000 \nfor a study of the feasibility of establishing a graduate school in the \nmedical sciences at Radford University in Radford, VA; $130,000 for the \nFirst Ladies Museum in Canton, OH; $325,000 for the South Florida \nScience Museum, West Palm Beach, FL; $150,000 for the Italian-American \nCultural Center of Iowa in Des Moines, IA; $150,000 for the American \nBallet Theatre in New York, NY; $1.42 million for the virtual \ncolonoscopy outreach program at Marshall University in West Virginia; \n$100,000 for the Kansas Regional Prisons Museum; $250,000 for exhibit \npreparation at the James K. Polk Presidential Hall TN; $75,000 for the \nMonterey Bay Aquarium in California; $211,900 for exhibit preparation \nat Utah Art and History Museum.\n  While some in this body may feel that it is in our vital national \ninterest to spend $350,000 of the American taxpayers' money to study \nthe spread of dust on residential floor coverings, I simply disagree. \nThe above,mentioned projects are only a small snapshot of the many, \nmany other wasteful items tucked away in the 853 pages of this bill.\n  Our Nation remains at war, and as a result we continue to see our \nbrave service men and women in uniform returning home in need of \ncomprehensive and effective care from our VA system. It is our \nresponsibility as Members of Congress to address the needs of those who \nhave born so valiantly the sacrifices of armed conflict by providing \nour VA system with the resources needed to accomplish its mission. The \nPresident has stated publicly his intention to sign a clean version of \nthe MilCon-VA bill when it reaches his desk. However, rather than \naddressing the needs of our veterans in a timely fashion, the majority \nhas chosen to unnecessarily delay passage of this vital bill. The \nAmerican taxpayer expects more of us, as do our brave service men and \nwomen who are fighting abroad on our behalf. We must stop these \nWashington games and return to placing our Nation's interests before \nour own.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to address the pending legislation, \nthe conference report for the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Fiscal Year 2008 appropriations legislation, which has been \ncombined with the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction VA \nappropriations legislation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cut right to the chase. Packaging these \nbills together is an effort to force President Bush to sign the Labor-\nHHS appropriations bill, which he opposes and will veto, by combining \nit with a Military Construction Veterans funding bill that cleared the \nSenate with almost unanimous consent. We ought to be working to write \nfunding bills that are acceptable on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue \nand debating these conference reports separately. Instead what we are \nseeing is 2008 election year politicking at work.\n  I voted against the Labor-HHS appropriations bill on the floor \nbecause of the overall spending level, which was roughly $9 billion \nover the administration's request. Now I understand that this portion \nof the conference report grew by an additional $840 million beyond what \nthe Senate passed. The level of spending in this title of the \nconference report is excessive and will add to the huge financial \nburden we are leaving for our children and grandchildren. So while this \nlegislation is well intentioned, I cannot support it. Nine billion \ndollars may not seem like much money in the context of a budget that \ntotals more than $2 trillion. But the cumulative effect of excessive \nspending will total in the tens of billions in any given year unless we \nact to maintain some form of fiscal discipline. Some of the additional \nspending, particularly related to education, I support--but the vote \nbeing cast today is in relation to the entire $151 billion \ndiscretionary package, which on the whole I do not believe should be \napproved.\n  The military--veterans title of this package first passed the Senate \nby a vote of 92 to 1. I supported this bill on the floor, which was $4 \nbillion over the administration's request, because I agree with the \nvast majority of the policies and support the increased commitment to \nour Nation's veterans during a time of war. I fully support this \nportion of the conference report--and my understanding is that if the \nCongress presented this title to the administration as a free-standing \nbill, the President would sign the legislation. So what we are seeing \non the floor of the Senate here today is the majority party's \nwillingness to use whatever means necessary to get their way on \nexcessive domestic spending--even if it means stalling a bill that \nwould provide immediate resources to our Nation's veterans. Rather than \nworking for the best interests of our veterans, they are being used for \npolitical theater. That, to me, is shockingly bad judgment.\n  I understand that a point of order lies against this package for \nviolating Senate rule XXVIII, and that it will be raised this \nafternoon. I will vote to sustain the point of order because the end \nresult could be President Bush receiving the Labor-HHS title and the \nmilitary-veterans title as free-standing packages. Thus the military-\nveterans package would be signed and needed funds for our veterans will \nbe available.\n  My understanding is that, for a variety of reasons, the President \nwill veto the Labor-HHS title. The administration has been vocal about \ntheir concerns for some time, so this should not come as a surprise to \nmy colleagues. The Senate has been on notice.\n  I tried to improve the Labor-HHS title during the floor debate by \noffering an amendment dealing with the Ryan White HIV/AIDS funding \nformula. My amendment was accepted by a rollcall vote of 65 to 28, but \ndropped during the conference process. My amendment simply ensures that \nthe current Ryan White funding formulas would not be altered by this \nappropriations bill, neutering a provision in the underlying House bill \nthat changes the formula that was unanimously agreed to in the Senate \njust last year. We agreed the money would follow the patients. The \nconference report will revert to waiting lines, while providing San \nFrancisco a funding increase--even though they receive money in part \nfor people who are already dead.\n  Last December, the House and Senate passed by a overwhelming majority \nauthorization legislation for Ryan White. Our recent revisions to Ryan \nWhite ensured that no large city lost more than 5 percent of its \nformula funding from the previous fiscal year. In addition to the \nformula funding, cities sometimes receive additional supplemental funds \nto deal with severe need. To ensure more stability, we reduced that \nsupplemental funding--from 50 percent of the total to one-third of the \ntotal appropriations--to provide additional formula funding.\n  The House provision I mentioned, which Senator Feinstein stated on \nthe Senate floor was a ``Pelosi fix,'' funnels $9.4 million away from \nthe current Ryan White Fiscal Year 2008 formulas so that 11 cities \ncould benefit from yet another hold harmless provision for Fiscal Year \n2007. This new, retroactive hold harmless provision is added on top of \nthe hold harmless provisions under the current Ryan White funding \nformulas. While some have called this a stop-loss, it is still a change \nto the funding formulas because it alters how the appropriations \ndollars would be directed to cities receiving Ryan White funds. This is \na retroactive application of the stop-loss, applying to 2007 grant \nawards, not 2008 grant awards. Quite frankly, this earmark ensures that \n11 cities arbitrarily receive additional funds for Fiscal Year 2007 at \nthe expense of 45 other cities.\n\n[[Page S14042]]\n\n  Even though my amendment was supported by a majority of Senate \nconferees, it was dropped in the conference negotiations. Because no \namendments were allowed during the conference meeting, there was no \nchance for all conferees to take an up-or-down vote. Is this democracy \nat its best? Our constituents deserve a better, more fair process.\n  As I said previously during the Labor-HHS floor debate, I stand ready \nto work with all of my colleagues on a compromise product that can \ngarner support from both the legislative as well as the executive \nbranch of our Government. It is unfortunate that we have to waste yet \nanother week on this political exercise, rather than using that time to \nwrite a quality compromise product that can actually become the law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I alert my distinguished counterpart, \nSenator McConnell, that I am going to use 4 or 5 minutes of leader \ntime. So if he needs more time, I alert him to that fact. Our time is \nbasically gone. I didn't know that when I came to the Chamber.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am prepared to use a couple minutes \nof my leader time.\n  We have before us a combination of two bills--the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services bill and the Veterans bill. We know the President will \nsign the Veterans bill. He has been hoping to get it for the last \ncouple of months. We know he will veto the Labor, Health and Human \nServices bill. So Senator Hutchison from Texas has made a point of \norder that the Veterans bill should not have been placed into the \nLabor-HHS bill in conference.\n  The principal reason for sustaining that point of order is to \nseparate these bills and give us a chance to get a Veterans bill to the \nPresident by Veterans Day, which is next Monday. Today is the last day \nthe House of Representatives could appoint conferees on this bill in \norder to get it to the President by next Monday, Veterans Day. So the \nonly way we can get a signed Veterans bill by Veterans Day is for the \npoint of order to be sustained, thereby separating these two bills and \ngiving us a chance to get the job finished for our veterans, who richly \ndeserve this important bill, by next Monday on Veterans Day.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to sustain the point of order, to give \nus a chance to get these bills separated and get this much needed \nrelief to our veterans by next Monday, Veterans Day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Labor, Health, and Education bill \npassed the Senate with 75 votes. When the bill originally passed the \nSenate, I applauded my Republican colleagues for joining with us in \nsuch great numbers to support a bill of such great importance to our \ncountry's domestic well-being.\n  This bill makes significant investments in education, and isn't it \nright that we do that? It supports the No Child Left Behind programs \nsuch as title I grants. In one school district in Nevada, 315,000 \nstudents go to that school district. I have another school district in \nNevada that has 88 students in it. We have 17 superintendents of \nschools in Nevada, but I have met with every one of the \nsuperintendents, and they believe the No Child Left Behind Act is \nreally creating problems. Whether it is a big school district or a \nlittle one--problems. One of the big problems is the financial aspects \nof it are too short.\n  The conference report that is before the Senate will do something to \nmagnify our ability to educate children with disabilities. That is the \nright thing to do. Why should the burden be left with local school \ndistricts? That money is taken from programs that enrich schools and is \nused to take care of a Federal mandate--educating these children. I \nsupport educating those with disabilities--physical, emotional, mental \ndisabilities. They should be educated. But we required the States to do \nthat. We should step forward. We have not done that. This bill \nconference report does that.\n  This legislation helps families pay for college with Pell grants and \nother aids. It is important that is done.\n  This legislation supports our economy and the well-being of our \nworkforce with job-training programs for adults, young people, and \ndislocated workers, and supports funding for the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth.\n  For health care, it makes critical investments, including local \nhealth care centers like community health care centers, to improve \naccess to care and train nurses and other health care professionals.\n  I can remember as a young Senator, Senator Moynihan was back there. \nHe sat right back there. We were debating, at the time, one of the \nproblems of the day--homelessness. Senator Moynihan said to me--he said \nit as a professor would tell a student--he said that one of the big \nproblems with homelessness is we haven't lived up to our obligation as \na Congress. When we emptied the mental institutions around the country, \none of the obligations we had was to have community health centers so \nthese people could go back and have their medicine readjusted. He said \nwe have not done that. Very few community health centers exist, and \nthis is the reason we have so many homeless. This legislation doesn't \ncure it, but it helps, it helps with community health centers.\n  In this legislation, crafted by Senators Harkin and Specter, there \nare new funds for medical research to study diseases such as diabetes, \ncancer, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's.\n  I had a conversation with J.C. Watts yesterday. He is retired from \nCongress but an All-American quarterback from Oklahoma, a great \nathlete. He said: Have you seen David Humm lately? I said: No, I \nhaven't. David Humm was an All-American from Nebraska, and, of course, \nJ.C. Watts knew of him and knew him. I told him: You wouldn't know \nDavid Humm. Handsome--he should have been a model. He played college \nfootball. He played professional football for 10 years. But he was \nstricken with multiple sclerosis. David Humm is very sick now.\n  You think of people like David Humm when you recognize that we need \nto do medical research. This legislation increases funding for diseases \nsuch as multiple sclerosis. It gives the National Institutes of Health \nresources to do things in medical research that they cannot do unless \nthey get money.\n  Right now, people who want to do medical research are stymied. They \nknow they make these applications to the National Institutes of Health, \nand if they are lucky, one out of every five grants will be funded, so \na lot of people don't bother to even apply anymore because their \nchances are so remote that they are going to be able to do their \nmedical research. This bill will help.\n  This legislation fights poverty with community service block grants \nand social service block grants. It adds money to programs such as Head \nStart to keep kids healthy and start them on a path to good education \nand helps families cope with ever-rising energy prices.\n\n  It does it all. It works in tandem with the VA portion to support \nAmerica's veterans with funds for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration. There is money in this to support the \nDepartment of Labor's veterans employment and training programs to help \nreturning troops.\n  There are additional moneys for emergency and hospital care, \nrehabilitation, education, and long-term support for Americans with \ntraumatic brain injuries.\n  It is a good partner with the bill that is part of this conference \nreport, the veterans aspect of this. In the Labor-HHS bill, there is \ncare for homeless veterans, who comprise an outrageous 23 percent of \nAmerica's homeless population. If you see a homeless person on the \nstreet, you can bet, No. 1, there is a 25-percent chance that person is \na veteran. What a shame.\n  The priorities I talked about here are not Democratic or Republican \npriorities; they are American priorities. We all want to keep our \neconomy strong and growing, we all want to provide our children with \nkeys to unlock a future of limitless opportunity, and we all want to \ngive every American a chance to share in the blessings of our country. \nThe bill now before us reflects those ideals in a responsible way. Yet \nPresident Bush has threatened another veto.\n\n[[Page S14043]]\n\n  Remember, ``veto'' is a new part of his vocabulary. He has been \nPresident for 7 years, and that is just something new he has picked up. \nIn fact, he has threatened to veto all 12 appropriations bills before \nthey were even written. He has already vetoed children's health \ninsurance and is threatening to veto the farm bill, which is bipartisan \nlegislation that both sides of the aisle have worked hard to write. In \nthe 7 years of his Presidency, after having rung up record deficits and \ndebt with his tax and spending policies that were rubberstamped by a \nRepublican-dominated Congress, President Bush has suddenly decided to \nact as if he has newfound fiscal discipline.\n  Given his fiscal record, everyone should understand the President's \nlatest stand is driven by partisan politics rather than a desire to \npursue proper fiscal policy. I understand that. I am sure many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle understand that. We all do \nunderstand it, but it is irresponsible. His failed Presidency has left \nhim with little else to become relevant. But he should not attempt to \nscore political points on the backs of our veterans who have given so \nmuch to our country and received so little in return.\n  We have, in this conference report, $4 billion more than he asked \nfor. Why? Because it is needed. The President should not attempt to \nscore political points on the backs of working families who are \nstruggling mightily after 7 years of his failed economic policy. Gas \nprices in Nevada are way over $3 a gallon now, and they say they will \narrive at $4 a gallon. The President should not attempt to score \npolitical points on the backs of children in need of a good education, \nthose who are ill and in need of a cure and those who are homeless in \nneed of a place to sleep.\n  He should not, and we must not let him, and we have that right here. \nWe have the ability, and we have that obligation when we vote on this \nlater today.\n  Some Republicans are seeking to separate the two bills--to force a \nvote just on the VA bill and vote just on the Labor-HHS bill. If we do \nthat, here is what happens. This bill will go back to the House with \nonly the Labor-HHS bill. That is all the President will get. He will \nnot get the veterans bill. At some time he will get it, but he could \nhave it today. Remember, one bill we passed by 92, the other one by 75. \nWhy would people change their votes? They agreed on these two bills. We \nhave not changed the amount of them.\n  So I hope we can do both of these bills. With the same bipartisan \nsupport that has brought this bill to the floor, we can pass it and \nsend it to the President. We can get aid to veterans before Veterans \nDay. We can start investing in America's domestic priorities right \naway.\n  We must not dance around the reality of the situation. President Bush \nwants these bills separated so that he can pressure us to make even \ndeeper cuts in education, health care, and homeland security. Why do \nyou think increases were made in the Labor-HHS bill? To help the \nAmerican people as we see it. We are an equal branch of Government.\n  The President and some of his allies here in the Senate are sure to \nrecycle their well-worn language that we are holding up funding for \nveterans. That is false. It is untrue. We stand ready to pass this bill \ntoday. We stand ready to make right the awful conditions many veterans \nface as a result of this administration's neglect. We will not take \nfrom Peter to pay Paul. We need not make that choice.\n  Mr. President, 92 Senators who voted for the VA bill believe it sets \nthe right priorities for America. I do too. Clearly, the 75 Senators \nwho voted for the Labor-HHS bill believe it, that it sets the right \npriorities for America.\n  What we have before us now are the same priorities. They have not \nchanged. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing.\n  We are the legislative branch of Government. The Founding Fathers, in \nsetting up this wonderful country with our Constitution, made three \nseparate and equal branches of Government. We, the Congress, do not \nserve under the President; we serve with the President.\n  Why in the world would Senators who voted 75 in number now suddenly \nvote against the bill for which they voted? That is what they are \ndoing. Why wouldn't we just send this whole piece of legislation to the \nPresident? Seventy-five Senators voted for one part of it; 92 Senators \nvoted for the other.\n  Be the legislative branch of Government; that is who we are. Don't \nkowtow to the President. We did what we thought was right, and it is \nunfair for him now to tell us how we should legislate.\n  I ask that Senators vote the way they did the first time around: 92 \nsupported the VA bill; 75 supported the Labor-HHS bill. They are both \nbadly needed for this country.\n  Madam President, if we have remaining time, I yield it back.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the point of \norder. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, \nNovember 7, when the President's veto message on H.R. 1495 is received, \nit be considered as having been read, spread in full in the Journal, \nand printed in the Record; that there then be 3 hours of debate on the \nmessage with the time divided as follows: 45 minutes each for Senators \nBoxer and Inhofe, 90 minutes under the control of the Republican leader \nor his designee; that upon the use or yielding back of time today, the \nmessage be set aside to occur following morning business tomorrow \nmorning, Thursday, November 8, at which time there be a total of 30 \nminutes remaining for debate, with 7\\1/2\\ minutes each for Senators \nBoxer and Inhofe and 15 minutes for the Republican leader or his \ndesignee; that upon the use or yielding back of time, with no further \nintervening action, the Senate proceed to vote passage of the bill, the \nobjections of the President notwithstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to override the President's veto of this important bill. \nThere are many colleagues who want to speak tonight on the subject of \nWRDA, because this has been a team effort. Senator Boxer, the chairman \nof the committee, along with Senator Inhofe, ranking member, have \nworked hard and diligently to put a bill together which the vast \nmajority of us support, and many colleagues are here tonight to speak. \nI will be very brief.\n  I want to speak about this bill because it is so critical to \nLouisiana. It is critical for us to give a green light to the people of \nsouth Louisiana and to the gulf coast who are still struggling to \nrebuild and put the pieces of their shattered lives back together \nbecause of the unprecedented two-punch storm--Katrina and Rita--and the \nbreaking of the Federal levee system that should have held but didn't. \nWe saw 285,000 homes destroyed. Because of the fires in California, as \nhorrific as they were, screaming out of the mountains with the Santa \nAna winds and scorching homes and neighborhoods, 1,600 homes were lost. \nThousands of families were displaced and some businesses destroyed. But \ncompared to Katrina and Rita, which is now 2 years in the past but is \nvery close in the memory and hearts of the people still living there, \nwe have to continue to remind ourselves and the Nation, it was 285,000 \nhomes destroyed, unprecedented in the history of this Nation.\n  This bill in place lays a foundation for us to build on. It lays a \nfoundation for security and prosperity. Frankly, without it, our long-\nterm recovery is in jeopardy. This bill will authorize, not fund, about \n$7 billion in critical water infrastructure projects, the first real \npiece of Louisiana coastal restoration effort, the closing of a \nshipping channel that was literally devastating to the parish in which \nit lies, St. Bernard Parish. Every home was destroyed in that parish; \n67,000 people who lived there saw their lives and businesses destroyed \nwhen the levees supporting this commercial channel failed. There were \nlevees throughout the metropolitan area that failed. This bill begins \nto lay a foundation for coastal restoration, to restore levees, to \nclose the Mississippi Gulf outlet channel we refer to as Mr. Go, \nestablishing for the first time hurricane protection along some \nsouthern parishes, Lafourche and Terrebonne, which we don't hear very \nmuch about because everybody focuses on New Orleans. We don't hear \nabout Lafourche and Terrebonne and Iberia and Cameron. These are \nparishes that have hundreds of thousands of people who live there and \nsupport the commerce of this Nation disproportionate to their number. \nThis is where the pipelines are. This is where much of the energy \ninfrastructure is for the Nation. It is these places we want to \npreserve for the future.\n  That is why Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer and the members of their \ncommittee--Senator Vitter represents us on this authorizing committee--\nhave done an outstanding job in pulling together these projects. I \ndon't know why the President chose this bill to try to reassume the \nmantle of fiscal responsibility, but he picked the wrong bill. As my \ncolleagues will explain, it is fiscally responsible to pass a \nframework, a guideline, a limit on these projects. That is what WRDA \ndoes.\n  For the Nation it is important we invest in critical infrastructure. \nI don't like to make these comparisons on everything, but it is worth \nnoting that we are now spending $120 billion this year in Iraq. We are \nspending $2.3 billion a week. It is hard for me to go home to Louisiana \nand explain why we can't come up with $7 billion in authorizations for \nprojects that are going to last over the next 20 or 30 years. We still \nhave to go back and get the funding, but without authorization, we \ncan't get started.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in a strong override. The House did \nso last night. I look forward to the Senate overriding the President's \nveto of this important bill.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14044-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14044-S14056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007--VETO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair lays before the Senate the \nPresident's veto message on H.R. 1495, which under the previous order \nis considered read and spread in full upon the Journal.\n  The message from the President to the House of Representatives is as \nfollows:\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1495, the ``Water \nResources Development Act of 2007.''\n  This bill lacks fiscal discipline. I fully support funding for water \nresources projects that will yield high economic and environmental \nreturns to the Nation and each year my budget has proposed reasonable \nand responsible funding, including $4.9 billion for 2008, to support \nthe Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) main missions. However, this \nauthorization bill makes promises to local communities that the \nCongress does not have a track record of keeping. The House of \nRepresentatives took a $15 billion bill into negotiations with a $14 \nbillion bill from the Senate and instead of splitting the difference, \nemerged with a Washington compromise that costs over $23 billion. This \nis not fiscally responsible, particularly when local communities have\n\n[[Page S14045]]\n\nbeen waiting for funding for projects already in the pipeline. The \nbill's excessive authorization for over 900 projects and programs \nexacerbates the massive backlog of ongoing Corps construction projects, \nwhich will require an additional $38 billion in future appropriations \nto complete.\n  This bill does not set priorities. The authorization and funding of \nFederal water resources projects should be focused on those projects \nwith the greatest merit that are also a Federal responsibility. My \nAdministration has repeatedly urged the Congress to authorize only \nthose projects and programs that provide a high return on investment \nand are within the three main missions of the Corps' civil works \nprogram: facilitating commercial navigation, reducing the risk of \ndamage from floods and storms, and restoring aquatic ecosystems. This \nbill does not achieve that goal. This bill promises hundreds of \nearmarks and hinders the Corps' ability to fulfill the Nation's \ncritical water resources needs--including hurricane protection for \ngreater New Orleans, flood damage reduction for Sacramento, and \nrestoration of the Everglades--while diverting resources from the \nsignificant investments needed to maintain existing Federal water \ninfrastructure. American taxpayers should not be asked to support a \npork-barrel system of Federal authorization and funding where a \nproject's merit is an afterthought.\n  I urge the Congress to send me a fiscally responsible bill that sets \npriorities. Americans sent us to Washington to achieve results and be \ngood stewards of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This bill violates \nthat fundamental commitment. For the reasons outlined above, I must \nveto H.R. 1495.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \n                                     The White House, November 2, 2007.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to reconsider the bill (H.R. 1495) to provide \nfor the conservation and development of water and related resources, to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Army to construct various projects for \nimprovements to rivers and harbors of the United States, and for other \npurposes, returned to the House by the President on November 2, 2007, \nwith his objections, and passed by the House of Representatives, on \nreconsideration, on November 6, 2007.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding, for \nclarification--because we have changed this a little bit--that our \nfinal decision is we are going to have an hour and a half kind of \nequally divided for those of us who are for overriding the veto, and \nthen after that there will be an hour and a half for the other side, \nand we can divide our time as we want since we are agreeing on this. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 45 minutes \nof his own, as does the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, that is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ninety minutes is reserved for the Republican \nleader, and all of that time can be parceled out in a manner the \nSenator sees fit.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Good. The bottom line is, we are going to have an hour \nand a half to state why we think this is not a good veto and to \noverride it.\n  Mr. President, I do have a number of people, Republicans, who want to \ncome down and be heard who did not have a lot of time for preparation. \nI am very glad this is coming up right now, but, hopefully, they are \nstill going to be around.\n  First of all, Senator Bond has been very helpful in this effort and \nis a very senior member of this committee that put this legislation \ntogether. I will yield him whatever time he shall use. Ten minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma. I \ncongratulate him and the Chair, Senator Boxer from California, for \nbringing this balanced and much needed bill to the floor so we may \nexpeditiously override the veto.\n  Now WRDA is supposed to be authorized every 2 years, but there has \nnot been a bill passed by this Congress during the entire \nadministration. I have been working on this bill since 2001, so we are \ncalling it WRDA 2001. The reason I have a direct interest in it is my \nState has nearly 1,000 miles of Missouri and Mississippi River frontage \nin addition to our lakes. Our communities rely on Corps projects for \naffordable water transportation, flood protection, energy production, \nenvironmental protection, and recreation opportunities.\n  When we talk about the environment--and in a minute I will be telling \nyou why the environmental benefits of transportation by water are so \nimportant--my constituents know that Corps projects mean jobs, trade \ncompetitiveness, reliable and affordable energy, drinking water, and \nprotection from floods which ruin property and kill people.\n  We are not alone because States up and down the Mississippi River, up \nand down the Missouri River, up and down the Ohio River, States in the \ncentral part of the Nation, depend on the lakes; and States on the \ncoasts depend upon their ports as well. So this is truly a national \nbill. But I can speak to it directly from what I have seen and what I \nknow in my part of the world.\n  I am delighted we are completing our long journey to permit \nmodernization of the Mississippi River locks. These locks were built \nduring the Great\nDepression, some 75 years ago,\nfor paddlewheel boats--paddlewheel boats--that only pushed 600-foot \nbarge tows. Now we have 1,200-foot barge tows trying to get through \n600-foot locks. They have to double lock. And these locks are old.\n  I have spent a lot of time with the people who depend on these \nlocks--the farmers; shippers of cement, building materials, \nfertilizers, energy, coal, and petroleum that travel by water. They \nshowed me and I have seen that these locks are not just leaking, sheets \nof water are coming through them. You can only use so much bailing wire \nand duct tape on a 75-year-old lock to keep it from going out.\n  Now one medium-sized 1,200-foot barge tow carries the same amount of \ncommodities that 870 large semitrucks would carry. It would take a \ntrain car unit 2\\1/4\\ miles long to carry the same load. But there is \nnot room on our highways to put 870 trucks for every barge tow that \nwould be used. The rails are filled. There is not room to put a 2\\1/4\\ \nor 2\\3/4\\ train on our railroads.\n  If we want to get our commodities to the market, if we want to have \nthe most environmentally friendly and efficient means of \ntransportation, we have to be able to move goods up the Mississippi \nRiver.\n  The locks in the bottleneck begin just above St. Louis. So all of the \nnorthern Midwest depends on those locks. The Mississippi River itself \ncarries about 60 percent of the grain moving in international commerce, \nforeign trade--getting better prices for our farmers, keeping our rural \ncommunities healthy with good prices, and also lessening our balance of \ntrade deficit. If you believe in selling our goods abroad, if you \nbelieve foreign sales are good for us--and I am strongly convinced they \nare--then we must have transportation.\n  We have had a long, arduous process to get the 2-year bill in 7 \nyears, and we have been blessed with strong bipartisan support. From my \npart of the country, Senators Grassley, Harkin, Durbin, and Obama have \nplayed key roles, and I express my gratitude.\n\n  Now the administration says they vetoed this bill because they say it \nis too big. If it were a normal 2-year bill, it would be big. But this \nis a 7-year bill, taking into account literally four different WRDA \nbills. If you total only three WRDA bills during the 5-year period--\n1996 to 2000--the authorization levels are comparable.\n  I think we must override the veto because this bill does not spend a \ndollar. It is an authorization bill. It says these projects are \napproved for consideration for funding. The Corps of Engineers has gone \nthrough extensive processes--engineering, public comment--to come to \nthis point, and we are giving congressional blessings. This just adds \nprojects to the list eligible. Put another way, it is a license to \nhunt. You still have to go out and hit the bird, and you cannot go \nbeyond the limit. The limit is the budget.\n  The White House should know this bill spends not one dollar. The \nbreakfast menu is larger, but the breakfast budget is unchanged. To say \notherwise is to either misinform or purposely mislead.\n  The unfortunate reality for our State and the farmers and shippers in \nour\n\n[[Page S14046]]\n\nState is that water resources and water transportation do not seem to \nbe a high priority of this administration, despite the expectation of \nsupporters in 2000.\n  The previous administration was not supportive, and this one is no \nbetter. I know the White House staff will disagree, but OMB ought to \ntry to go out and talk to the people who live in our part of the \ncountry. There are many areas where these projects are needed.\n  In November of 2005, the Washington Times reported that President \nBush noted during a press conference with Panamanian President \nTorrijos:\n\n       [I]t's in our nation's interest that this canal be \n     modernized.\n\n  Well, I think that is a great idea: modernize the Panama Canal. But \nwhile we are at it, why not modernize our own shipping areas? The \nadministration does not oppose modernizing the Social Security-aged \nlocks on the Mississippi River built for paddlewheel boats, but they \nalso have not endorsed it or lifted a finger to endorse it. Endorsement \nwas reserved for upgrading the waterways in Panama. My colleagues and I \nbelieve our Midwestern exporters deserve as much consideration as \nChinese exporters who transit the Panama Canal.\n  I could list the supporters of it: the National Corn Growers \nAssociation, Carpenters Union, Operating Union, American Farm Bureau \nFederation, American Soybean Association, scores of members of the \nWaterways Council, and a whole lot of hard-working folks in Missouri \nand Illinois with whom I have met.\n  Our staffs have worked tirelessly on this legislation--not for days \nor weeks but years. There are many who have worked hard. I thank Ruth \nVan Mark, Ken Kopocis, Angie Giancarlo, Joe-Ellen Darcy; and a very \nspecial thanks to the bipartisan staff support of a very good friend of \nmine, Let Mon Lee, who has worked on the committee.\n  The success of our economy and its people owes a great debt to the \ninvestments that were made by those who came before us.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for investments that will provide \nopportunity, value, competitiveness, and growth to our future so our \nexport growth will not be limited to exporting barges.\n  This, as shown on this chart, is what we are exporting. We are \nexporting the barges to countries in Latin America so they can ship \nefficiently, economically, in environmentally friendly waters and take \nmarkets away from American farmers.\n  My thanks to the committee and the staff of Environment and Public \nWorks. We appreciate their work. I urge my colleagues to join with us \nand adopt this bill by a veto override.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there will be other Members who want to \ncome down to speak. When that happens, if staff will remind me, I will \ninterrupt my remarks in order to give them time.\n  But I want to approach this legislation a little bit differently. I \ncould be standing here and saying some of the same things my good \nfriend from Missouri said in terms of things that are in this \nauthorization bill that are critical to my State of Oklahoma, but I \nthink my State of Oklahoma already knows that. I already talked to them \nabout it.\n  We have things in this bill, and they are not all projects that will \nbe built, but these are projects that the Corps of Engineers has \ncarefully gone through, prioritized, and determined should be done.\n  Let me give you an example. We have work on the most devastating \nSuperfund site in America called Tar Creek in northern Oklahoma. That \nis something that is going to be addressed in this legislation. We are \nmore than 50 percent through resolving that problem, but more needs to \nbe done--things such as a lake called Arcadia Lake that is close to the \ncentral part of the State. The city of Edmond has been in not a lawsuit \nbut a legal difference with the Corps of Engineers now for many years, \nand they were almost forced to pay several million dollars for water \nthey never did receive. So a lot of this bill clarifies problems that \nare out there, and it is necessary.\n  I think the Senator from Missouri made it very clear, the last time \nwe had a bill was the year 2000--7 years ago--and actually that bill, 7 \nyears ago, was only a 1-year bill. A lot of people think it was a 2-\nyear bill. It was a 1-year bill. We are supposed to have these every \nyear or 2 years, but we have not had one.\n\n  Last year I can remember standing here on the floor, and I think we \nactually got it passed, but then we ran out of time before adjournment \ntook place.\n  It is very difficult for me to do this because I love our President, \nbut I think he has been ill advised in this case because, as has been \npointed out by the Senator from Missouri, this bill does not spend a \ndime. For people to walk around--and I am doing quite a bit of time on \ntalk radio to make sure the public is aware of this--this is an \nauthorization bill.\n  In a minute, I am going to explain the history of authorization \nversus appropriations. I hope there are some people who are listening, \nparticularly conservative people. The reason I say that--we are all \nrated around here for being conservative or liberal. I happen to be \nrated by the American Conservative Union, and several other \norganizations, not No. 2, I say to my friend from Colorado, not No. 3, \nbut No. 1--the most conservative Member of the Senate. Yet I am \nstanding here asking this Senate to override the President's veto of \nthe authorization bill called WRDA.\n  Now I see my friend, the junior Senator from Louisiana, is wanting to \nhave some time. I will be glad to yield to him, and then I am going to \ncome back and kind of go over some history at that time.\n  How much time would the Senator like? Ten minutes?\n  I yield the Senator 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I particularly thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Oklahoma, the ranking member on the committee. I thank \nSenator Inhofe and Senator Boxer and all of the committee members for \nall of their diligent work for many years, in fact, that has finally \nproduced this very good and worthwhile WRDA bill which we are about to \npass into law.\n  I stand as one of the two Senators from Louisiana very excited about \nthis moment because this legislation is absolutely crucial for our \nrecovery from Hurricanes Rita and Katrina and, indeed, for our survival \nas a coastal culture, as a coastal State, moving into the future. It is \nabsolutely vital in that regard. I believe passage of this bill, \nincluding overriding the President's veto, is absolutely necessary for \nthe Nation and the Congress to keep the very generous and very solemn \ncommitment made to the people of Louisiana and of the gulf coast \nfollowing Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. This bill is enormously \nimportant, and it has been a long time in coming.\n  While ordinarily a WRDA bill would be passed every other year, we \nhaven't had one in many years to pass through the Congress. So, as a \nresult, this is long overdue. This is the equivalent of two or three \nwater resources bills combined.\n  The good news is that from our perspective, particularly dealing with \nLouisiana issues, we have used that time and that opportunity to \nimprove the bill dramatically, even from the moment when I came to the \nSenate 3 years ago and started working on the committee on this bill to \nimprove it dramatically and to include more measures for coastal \nrestoration, coastal protection, and hurricane protection for our \nsurvival.\n  I want to make clear this isn't some parochial Louisiana matter. Even \nthe provisions I care most deeply about have national importance and a \nnational impact and truly are national priorities. Let me mention a few \nsets of numbers just to illustrate the point.\n  Thirty-three: That is the number of States that rely directly on the \nprotection systems in Louisiana authorized in this bill for maritime \ncommerce--import and export of goods--and, of course, that includes the \nentirety of the Midwest and particularly grain and other products from \nfarmers in the Midwest.\n  Eighty: That is the percentage of domestically produced chemicals and \npetrochemicals that come from Louisiana and Texas vital to our economy. \nThis bill is helping protect that economic infrastructure, that \nindustry.\n\n[[Page S14047]]\n\n  Twenty-six: That is the percent of seafood that comes from Louisiana \nwaters and includes more shrimp, crawfish, and oysters than any other \nState.\n  Three million: That is the number of barrels of oil that could not be \nrefined each day because of the shutdown of our refineries immediately \nafter the hurricanes.\n  One dollar: It doesn't sound like much, but that is the extra amount \nthat each of our constituents nationwide paid per gallon as a result of \nthe 2005 hurricanes that hit Louisiana. Each gallon of gas used to take \nkids to school and to drive to work, farmers using it in their \ntractors, boats to ship imports and exports, airplanes to fly \npassengers and cargo, truckers to drive their loads across the Nation--\n$1 a gallon extra because of that disruption, because of a lack of \nprotection.\n  Mr. President, $2.8 billion: That is the extra amount all of our \nconstituents paid nationwide in just 1 week as a result of those \ngasoline price spikes.\n  Maybe the most important number is 4. That is from a commission, a \nstudy commissioned by FEMA. That is the amount of money saved: $4 for \nevery $1 invested in mitigation and protection. That is a great savings \nfor the future for the taxpayer.\n  So this is vitally important for my people in Louisiana, but it is \nvitally important to the Nation because of that direct connection, \nbecause of that direct impact of the hurricanes on the Nation's \neconomic vitality, on the Federal Treasury that had to respond to the \ndevastation of the hurricanes.\n  As I said, I am proud of the work all of us have done, including, as \nI served on the committee, on the conference committee, to fashion key \nprovisions, taking into account the lessons of Hurricanes Rita and \nKatrina, key provisions that are now in this bill.\n  Let me mention just a few. The Water Resources Council: That is a \ncouncil and an integration team that would be verifying the Corps' \nwork, the Corps' conclusions and findings in terms of the \nimplementation of Louisiana projects. So we have experts from outside \nthe Corps, from academia, from the realm of practicing engineers to \nwork hand in glove with the Corps so that design mistakes such as those \nthat led to the levee breaches never happen again.\n  True 100-year hurricane protection: As I grew up in the New Orleans \narea, I was told we had 100-year protection, but the day Katrina hit, \nit disclosed the fact that wasn't true. Now we will be building through \nthis bill true 100-year hurricane protection, and I thank President \nBush for his commitment to that and his commitment to ask for all of \nthe funding necessary to do that.\n  Moving forward on higher levels of protection for populated areas, \nwhat we would call true category 5 protection: The Corps is currently \nlooking at that, designing that, but this bill will move that effort \nforward in a major way so we move forward with the design and \nimplementation of that higher level of category 5 protection.\n  Coastal restoration: We can talk about levees and physical barriers \nand the storm surge all we want, but if we continue to lose our rich \ncoastland, which is the buffer land from storms, we will never be able \nto win that fight. So the fight starts with restoring our coastal \nbarrier islands and coastal buffer lands. In this bill we have $4 \nbillion worth of that authorized work, 17 separate projects for coastal \nrestoration. Of all of the work I have done in this bill, I think \nbeefing up that portion of it is what I am most proud of because when I \ncame to the Senate, when I came to this committee, there was only about \n$400 million dedicated to that coastal restoration, one specifically \nauthorized project. Now there is $4 billion and 17 authorized projects.\n  We can go on and on. Closing MRGO, the deadly hurricane highway which \nwas directly related to so much of the catastrophic flooding in New \nOrleans; other important work around the State, work with regard to the \nPort of Iberia and improving hurricane and flood protection in \nVermilion parish, work that is very crucial to the Calcasieu River to \nallow navigation in that area to go on and prosper; bank stabilization \nfor the Quachita and Black Rivers in north Louisiana; other hurricane \nprotection improvements in lower Jefferson and Lafourche Parish; \nstudies to improve access to Vidalia, LA, and other areas; countless \nprojects, countless examples of important work.\n\n  Then last, but certainly not least, something we have been waiting \non, working toward for 15 years and more, which is the Morganza to the \ngulf hurricane protection project to bring protection for the first \ntime to a vital area just west of New Orleans, a populated area rich in \nculture, seafood, economic production, economic vitality. This project \nhas been developed by the Corps over 15 years and more. It should have \nbeen in the last WRDA bill. In fact, it was in the last WRDA bill but \nis subject to a chief's report, and then the Corps of Engineers missed \nits deadline for that chief's report. That is finally being fully \nauthorized, moving forward in an aggressive fashion because of this \nWRDA bill.\n  So again, in closing, let me say, make no mistake about it; this bill \nis vitally important for Louisiana, for our people, for our continued \nrecovery, for our survival. But I don't want that to come across as \nsome narrow or parochial concern because it does touch all of America \nin terms of impact. If our gulf coast is devastated in the future, \ngasoline prices will spike far more than 2 years ago. Our economy will \nbe disrupted far more than 2 years ago, and, yes, FEMA and the Federal \nGovernment will have to spend even more than 2 years ago to deal with \nsuch a future disaster.\n  This WRDA bill is long overdue. It is fully justified. I thank \nSenator Inhofe, Senator Boxer, and all of the committee again for their \nvery hard work as we move forward and finally pass this into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nLouisiana. He has been an excellent member of the committee. He has \ncertainly been looking out after the very serious problems that exist \neven today in his State of Louisiana, problems that exist as a result \nof Katrina and other things that were happening before, such as beach \nerosion and other problems they have.\n  I also thank Senator Boxer. We joke around about this a little bit. \nWe are kind of opposites in terms of philosophies, but we do come \ntogether in agreement on the process we use in determining what should \nbe done for infrastructure in this country.\n  Now, I said just a few minutes ago that I have what some would think \nis a distinction, and some would question that, but I am rated anyway \nas the most conservative member of the Senate, and here I am standing \nup asking my colleagues to join me in overriding a veto that the \nPresident should not have made. I think if there are any discerning \npeople who really want to know why, it is pretty heavy lifting to \nfollow this through, but I think it is important to do that.\n  There are some things that work in government and a lot of things \nthat don't work. My colleagues have heard me say this before when we \nwere talking about the transportation bill, the fact that it is \nsomething that does work, where people who are using the transportation \nsystem are putting money into it. It comes from a trust account, and we \nmake determinations as to how it should be allocated in accordance with \nthe needs of the States, taking into consideration things such as \nhighway deaths and things such as road miles and lane miles, and then \nmake those allocations. Frankly, it works very well.\n  This is almost the same process, except these are water projects. \nSeveral people have talked about how it is overdue. Actually, this bill \nis 6 years overdue. We had the last one in the year 2000. We tried in \n2001, 2002, 2003, and last year we came--we passed the bill on this \nfloor, standing right here I can remember, and we thought it would be \nhistory by now, but the clock caught up with us and we didn't have time \nto get it out of conference and passed into law.\n  Now, I think if we look at this--I am going to make a statement a lot \nof people would not understand, but I am making this statement for my \nconservative friends. If you take away the authorization process from \nthe way we do business down here, then it has to be done by \nappropriators. What we are talking about today doesn't spend a dime. \nYou have heard people say it, and I felt the President, in his message, \nwas a little misleading to imply that\n\n[[Page S14048]]\n\nthis somehow is going to end up in more spending. It doesn't end up in \nmore spending. It wouldn't matter what the amount of the bill is \nbecause what this does in this particular bill is it takes 751 \nprojects, and it gives a maximum that can be spent on any project. If \nyou go over the maximum, then you have what we call a 60-vote point of \norder which I will--I commit to standing up and invoking so we can't \nspend more money.\n  Now, it doesn't mean--if the total amount that you would add up in \nthis bill is $23 billion, it doesn't mean it is going to end up costing \n$23 billion. That money has to be appropriated, and historically it has \naveraged out to about 70 percent of the projects. I have already said \nthere are--what is the total number of projects in this bill--751 \nprojects. Only 70 percent of those would get any funding, and then many \nof the rest of them will get funding at an amount far less than we are \nauthorizing. We are saying you can go up to that amount.\n  Now, to understand this, I would like to kind of walk us through. It \nappears I will have time to do this because we don't have any more on \nour side who are planning to come down and speak. So the significant \ndifference between authorizing and appropriating in the Senate is a \nlong history, and it goes back to 1816. Let's start with the charts \nback there.\n  The responsibility of authorizing versus appropriating has been a \ndebate that has been ongoing for a long time. What happened is, when \nthey first created some 11 permanent standing committees, that happened \nin 1816 to handle legislative proposals.\n  At that time, they weren't really sure about authorizing and \nappropriating because the problem hadn't really come up yet--until \n1867. In 1867, the Senate created the Appropriations Committee. It was \nthe first step of the Senate to separate authorization and \nappropriations, saying that we should go through the process of \nauthorizing before we appropriate.\n  In 1899, the Senate adopted a change to rule XVI to remove most of \nthe appropriations bills from its jurisdiction because the \nAppropriations Committee was enacting policy on how Federal agencies \ninternally operated. There is the difference right there. The first \ntime that happened was in 1899. So the rule XVI, as we know it today, \nwhich gave birth at that time, said we should segregate the authorizing \nprocess from the appropriations process. Some Senators argued that the \nAppropriations Committee was legislating on appropriations bills, and \nthe Senate directed that certain authorizing committees would handle \nappropriations legislation for the issues within their jurisdiction. \nAnd this diminished the role of the Appropriations Committee that had \nbeen established.\n  In 1922, the Senate changed course again and adopted another change \nto rule XVI. It is now rule XVI as we know it today. Rule XVI says that \nif you appropriate money that is not authorized, it takes a \nsupermajority 60 votes--instead of 51 votes. That may not sound like a \nbig difference to a lot of people, but I assure it is a huge difference \nin passing legislation. So that restored the general appropriations \nback to the Appropriations Committee. However, they had the \nauthorization committees to take care of the problems.\n  I will give you an example. The Armed Services Committee, on which I \nam honored to sit, is an authorization committee. I could use any \nnumber of examples. For example, I could talk about our F-22 vehicle \ncoming up, and there are going to be people who don't really know that \nwe need to have the F-22 because the F-15s and F-16s are inferior to \nsome of the things Russia is making in their SU-30 and SU-35 vehicles. \nThese are technical things that most of the Senators, if they are not \nsitting on the Armed Services Committee, would not know. Someone who \ndidn't have the advantage of knowing why we should authorize different \nvehicles to defend America would have no way of doing it if they are \njust appropriators. So the example I use is a good one.\n  Right now, in the bill we are considering today, which is in \nconference--the Senate armed services reauthorization bill--with the \nHouse, it addresses the problem with a ballistic missile defense \nsystem. A lot of people aren't aware of it unless they sit on the \ncommittee, but there are three phases: the midcourse phase, the boost \nphase, and the terminal phase. There are two vehicles on the boost \nphase that are still in R We don't have them yet. We are naked in \norder to try to knock down something in a boost phase. We have two ways \nof knocking down missiles in the midcourse phase, and we are working on \ntwo in the terminal phase.\n  I don't think there is anybody out there, after 9/11, who would not \nagree that we need to have this defense for America. That technology is \nthere. If you are just an appropriator and not an authorizer, you would \nlook at that and say: Wait a minute, we have six systems to knock down \nan incoming missile. So they may say we only need two; we can save X \nbillions of dollars by only having two. But the problem is, as we all \nknow, in the midcourse phase we don't know whether it is going to be \nwithin the range of a ground-based missile or where you can use an \nAEGIS missile fired off a ship. These are six technical systems that \nare necessary to defend America from an incoming missile. That comes \nfrom an authorization committee, not an appropriations committee. A lot \nof people, who don't have this information, are trying to knock down \nsome of the money we are spending on missile defense. So I think that \nis probably the best example to use.\n  The same principle is true on my other committee, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. It applies to the bill today, the WRDA bill, \nthe Water Resources Development Act bill. We review all projects and \nrequests, and we make sure that every project of these 751 projects \ngoes through a lot of scrutiny, and it has certain criteria that have \nto be met and an engineer's report from the Corps of Engineers.\n  I remember one time I cast a very unpopular vote--it was the right \nvote--several years ago when we had the Everglades Restoration Act, \nwhich passed 99 to 1. That one was me because it didn't meet the \ncriteria. It didn't have the engineer's report and all that. A lot of \npeople voted for it because they were afraid they could not explain \ntheir vote back home. I never had that problem.\n  We have all these projects that have gone through scrutiny, and when \nwe finally pass the bill--which we have already passed and the \nPresident vetoed, and we are going to override the veto tomorrow--it \nwill be reality tomorrow.\n  Here is what will happen after that. None of these projects we are \ntalking about--sure, a lot of them are in Oklahoma, and a lot are in \nColorado, and the Senator from Missouri talked about his, and the \nSenator from California will talk about things authorized in \nCalifornia. These have all met certain criteria. Very likely, when they \ncome up--a lot of them--for appropriations, I will come down to the \nfloor and oppose them. It doesn't mean I agree with everything we have \nauthorized. We are just saying that thought has gone into it, they have \nlooked at it professionally, it met the criteria, it has engineering \nreports, and we ought to authorize it and let the appropriators come \nin, and we can look at it closely to see if maybe we authorized too \nmuch or maybe we disagree with it. Right now, I can tell you that I was \nopposing appropriations to many things we authorized.\n  I can state it a different way. The only discipline we have in \nspending, I say to all these people who talk about earmarks, is the \nauthorization process because if we take away the authorization \nprocess, we have no way of knowing, when the Appropriations Committee \ncomes with a bill to the floor and says: We want to fund this, whether \nit meets the criteria.\n  So what we are doing with the bill we have passed and the veto that \nwill be overridden tomorrow--so it will become law--is we are saying \nthat we are putting in a maximum of 751 projects so that they cannot go \nover that amount. If they do--I make this commitment on the floor of \nthe Senate tonight--I will be the first one down here to stand up and \nsay I am going to invoke rule XVI to require a 60-vote point of order \nso that we will have discipline, and the appropriators are not going to \nspend more money than has been authorized.\n\n  That is a quick course. I don't expect that anybody will really \nunderstand it or believe it. I know in my heart that it is right and we \nhave to have this\n\n[[Page S14049]]\n\nprocess. This fight that has been taking place between the \nappropriators and authorizers since 1816 is something that is \nnecessary, and we have to protect authorization.\n  Let me bring up one more thing. If the President had never vetoed \nthis bill--it doesn't make any difference because we are going to \noverride the veto, and everybody has to know that. So this is kind of \nan exercise in futility. We have the bill; it is going to be reality. \nIn the event that we are unable to override the veto tomorrow morning, \nthat would mean we would not have an authorization bill. That means \nthat any appropriator could come down here, or anybody else, and say we \nneed to have this, and they could be swapping deals and meet no \ncriteria whatsoever, and that is not the way we want to do it. So I see \nthis as the only discipline we have for spending.\n  I have mentioned that I have the rating of being the most \nconservative Member in the Senate, and I do. But I also realize I am a \nbig spender in some areas. One is national defense, and one is \ninfrastructure. That is what we are supposed to do in this body. If you \ndon't think there is a crisis out there in transportation--our roads, \nhighways, and waterways--not very many people realize that in Oklahoma, \nwe are actually navigable. We have a navigation way that comes all the \nway to my hometown of Tulsa, OK, the Port of Catoosa, where they can \ncome up through Louisiana and up the Arkansas River, and right now we \nhave a problem with that. We have a 12-foot channel, except for one \nsmall area that is 9 feet. That is a choke point. That limits what we \ncan do.\n  If there is anything we need in this country--and all you have to do \nis drive on the highways and you see the cars and trucks going by and \nsee how much worse the traffic is today than it was in the past. One of \nthe great ways to relieve that traffic is to be able to utilize to a \ngreater extent our navigation ways. I don't have the statistics with \nme, but you can carry three trainloads of stuff on a barge and move it \nactually cheaper, in many respects, into places. So in order to do the \nthings the Senator from Missouri talked about in increasing the \ncapacity to use these navigation ways, and even to my State of \nOklahoma, it is something that is going to have a profound impact on \nthe future of transportation in this country.\n  I don't think there is anybody who is so naive not to understand that \nwe have a crisis in our transportation system. The traffic is worse \nevery day, and I am sure each one of us--the 100 Senators who serve in \nthis Chamber--gets hundreds of letters every day asking what are we \ngoing to do about the transportation system--not realizing that our \naction tonight will be a great relief to that problem.\n  I believe in building the infrastructure of this country, and I \nbelieve in the authorization process. I believe it offers our only \ndiscipline on spending. I am sorry that a lot of conservatives don't \nunderstand this, and they believe this is a spending bill, when it is \nnot. So as much as I hate to do this, I urge my colleagues on the \nRepublican side to join me in overriding the President's veto of this \nvery significant bill that each State in America needs.\n  Again, I know we are going to be seeing the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Boxer, soon. It is interesting that the committee \ncalled the Environment and Public Works Committee had the largest \njurisdiction of any of the committees. Up until the last election and \nthe new majority came in in January, I was chairman. Now Senator Boxer \nis chairman, and I am ranking member. We have worked together on this \nbill, and this is not something we have spent just a few hours or days \non; we spent 6 years on it. We spent a lot of time looking at last \nyear's bill to see what is relevant today.\n  Some of the detractors will say: Wait a minute, you have already \nauthorized a lot of things that have not been appropriated. To that, I \nsay you made my point. A lot of the things we are authorizing will not \nbe appropriated. That fortifies the point that this should not be \nmeasured as a bill that is a $23 billion bill or something that \nindicates we are going to spend all this money. This is a bill that is \nnecessary in the process to offer discipline to our spending, and that \nis what we intend to do.\n  With that, I will retain the remainder of our time, in the event one \nof our Members wants more time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today and tomorrow will be very special \ndays for me here in the Senate because the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, led by myself and Senator Inhofe, comes forward united \nacross party lines to lead the effort to override the President's veto \nof the Water Resources Development Act, a bill that will authorize the \nprojects and policies of the Civil Works Program of the Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  I wish to thank Senator Inhofe for his kind comments and say that I \nthink everybody knows that when it comes to the environment, Senator \nInhofe and I don't exactly see eye to eye. But when it comes to \nbuilding the infrastructure of the United States of America, taking \ncare of the needs of our communities, making sure there is flood \ncontrol, that we can move goods because we need to dredge so many of \nour port areas, when it comes to making sure we have recreation areas, \nand, yes, that we do the kind of environmental restoration that will \nhelp us with flood control--for example, restoring the great coastal \nwetlands of Louisiana--we can and do work together.\n\n  Yesterday, the House voted 361 to 54 to override the President's veto \nof this critical legislation, giving us in the Senate the opportunity \nto make this bill the law of the land by our vote tomorrow. I note it \nis very rare that we have successful veto overrides. Why is it? Because \nin their genius, our Founders said we need quite a supermajority to do \nthat. So it is rare, indeed, when we have a strong vote such as this to \ngo against a President of either party, and I have served with four \nfrom both political parties. The signal it sends to the executive \nbranch, in a moment such as this, is we are asserting ourselves as \nrepresentatives of the people. We are saying: Mr. President, we \nshouldn't have to have a fight about this. This is something we should \nwork on together. When we did pass the conference report, I remember \nasking the President rhetorically: Do we have to fight about \neverything? I don't think we should. Senator Inhofe and I can set aside \nour differences to work on this bill. It seems to me we represent \nbasically the entire philosophy from one end to the other, and it seems \nto me we should have had the support of the executive branch.\n  Today and tomorrow are also special days for the many people and \ncommunities across our Nation that have waited so long for this time to \ncome, for this important legislation to become law. Indeed, when we \nfinally accomplish this tomorrow--and I pray we do--it will be 7 years \nin the making, 7 years since we actually had a Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. That is too long to wait.\n  I say to all the communities across our great country waiting for \ndesperately needed flood control, such as New Orleans and the gulf \ncoast, such as Sacramento in my State of California, where 300,000 \npeople are in jeopardy should there be a flooding problem, I say to all \nof you: The wait is nearly over and help is on the way.\n  Again, I thank my ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Inhofe. We do share a commitment to shoring up our \nNation's infrastructure, including its water resources. On some issues, \nas we know, we do not stand shoulder to shoulder, but on this issue, we \nhave stood shoulder to shoulder to get the work done, and I think we \nwill stand shoulder to shoulder in the future, as well as look at other \ninfrastructure needs in our States and communities.\n  I also thank the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee \nchairman and ranking member, Senators Baucus and Isakson. They have \nbeen a very important part of our team helping to put this package \ntogether.\n  Unfortunately, despite the bipartisan nature of this critical \ninfrastructure investment and despite waiting 7 years,\n\n[[Page S14050]]\n\nthe President decided 7 years was not long enough and he vetoed the \nbill. I tell you the truth, I still cannot believe it. I know many of \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle spoke with the President and \nsaid to the President: Please understand, Mr. President, this is not an \nappropriations bill, this is not a spending bill, this is an \nauthorization bill. Anyone who wants to learn more about that simply \nread the record of what Senator Inhofe--if not the most fiscal \nconservative member, certainly one of the most in this body--said about \nthis bill.\n  This bill is an authorization bill, and every single project has to \ngo through the rigors of the appropriations process. But what we have \nto do is give the Corps the ability to complete repairs to levees, \nflood walls, and pumps that failed to protect the lives and property of \nthose in New Orleans.\n  Remember when the President spoke in Jackson Square in September 2005 \nand he offered a pledge to the American people. This is what he said \nthat night. I remember the eeriness of the scene, where the President \nhad come out of the darkness because there was no electricity in New \nOrleans, and the lights were lighting him. It was, in a way, a touching \nmoment.\n  What the President said was important. This is what he said:\n\n       Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what \n     it takes, we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens \n     rebuild their communities and their lives.\n\n  I do believe when you say that, you need to mean it. We will do what \nit takes. Yet we had tonight Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter, both \nrepresenting New Orleans and Louisiana and representing their people \nwith great emotion and great conviction, begging for this bill because \nthis bill will help make Louisiana whole.\n  I traveled to New Orleans with several members of the committee to \nconduct a field hearing this year. Seven Senators were on that trip, a \nclear indication of how important protecting New Orleans and the gulf \ncoast is to the Members of this Senate. We saw the needs of the New \nOrleans area, but we also saw the hope and the optimism of the people \nand the community leaders that the Federal Government would, in fact, \nkeep its commitments.\n  This bill makes our promises real. This bill makes the promises of \nthe President of the United States real. This misguided veto only \ncreated further delay, and I beg my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to listen to Senator Inhofe, to listen to Senator Vitter, to \nlisten to Senator Landrieu, to listen to my words tonight.\n  WRDA also contains the authorization for Louisiana's Wetlands \nRestoration Program, wetlands that are critical to protecting south \nLouisiana from hurricanes and improving the environment.\n  Before I talk about the critical flood threat facing Sacramento in my \nState of California, I wish to talk a little bit about Florida, and \nthen I am going to yield 5 minutes to Senator Nelson.\n  Not only did I get to go to New Orleans, but I got an amazing \ninvitation from Senator Nelson. Let's just say it was more than an \ninvitation; it was a strong urging. It was a begging. It was so \nimportant to Senator Nelson that I certainly could not say no.\n  I went to see the Everglades with my own eyes. My husband came with \nme and Senator Nelson and his wife Grace greeted us there. We went out \non a tour of the Everglades which we will never forget.\n  I can tell you the beauty of that place is most extraordinary. It is \njust extraordinary. As Senator Nelson will explain much better than I, \nwe have an area that is in crisis. We have a window in which we must \nact to make sure the water flows into the Everglades to keep it alive, \nthe river of grass.\n  One of the lasting memories of that trip as we went out and dusk fell \nand we were out and we saw the alligators out there, we saw what \nappeared to me--and, of course, Senator Nelson had seen this--I think \nhe got more pleasure watching my face as I thought all of a sudden we \nwere in a meadow. I almost thought: How could this boat actually be \nmoving in a meadowland? It was not a meadowland. It was this river of \ngrass.\n  We saw wildlife actually jumping out of this river of grass onto \ntrees. It was a spectacular moment. I thought, God has given us this \ngift, and it is our obligation, it is our duty, it is our \nresponsibility to make sure others get to see this gift.\n  At this time, I am happy to yield 7 minutes to Senator Nelson and I \nlook forward to his remarks. I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, as the Senator from \nCalifornia has been describing her experience, I have been enjoying \nenormously not only her reflection of that experience but remembering \nseeing the faces of Senator Boxer and her husband as they saw these new \nexperiences of gliding in an airboat over a sea of grass that Marjory \nDouglas called river of grass.\n  As we came to the edge and went into the big cypress preserve where \ncypress stands, clumps of large cypress trees dotted the landscape, as \nthe Senator explained, it was getting close to sundown. As the light \nlowered, as you were gliding over this meadow of grass, it looked \nexactly like that until suddenly you were shocked into the reality that \nthere was a doe and her fawn as they were bounding, not over the meadow \nbut sloshing through the water as they headed toward the clump of \ncypress trees.\n  It is now our responsibility to protect and preserve this national \ntreasure--indeed, an international treasure--for the generations to \ncome. It was 60 years ago that the Everglades National Park was created \nby an act of Congress and President Harry Truman signed the bill into \nlaw. The Senator at whose desk I now reside was then a young Member of \nCongress, Senator George Smathers, who helped bring that Everglades \nNational Park 60 years ago, in December of 1947, into fruition.\n  Now we sit here on a momentous occasion. In order for us to continue \nto try to protect this national and natural treasure, we have to \novercome a Presidental veto. It is important not just to our State but \nso many States because of these water projects, because the last time \nwe had such a law that authorized these water projects was back in \n2000.\n  What that plan did in 2000 in an Everglades restoration plan, created \nafter years of study and analysis, was to try to restore the Everglades \nto something of what nature intended. But we couldn't do it like nature \nhad it because a huge portion of the south part of the peninsula of \nFlorida was the Everglades. Decades later, it is so different because \nthere are 6 million people living in South Florida, there is a major \nagricultural industry, and in the intervening half century, mankind has \ncome in and diked and drained the natural flow of the water in a way \nMother Nature never intended. So what was passed--the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan in 2000--was intended, given the changes in \nthe population, the agriculture, and the existing diking and draining, \nto restore as much of that to the natural function that Mother Nature \nintended so we could preserve the Everglades.\n\n  The bill we have in front of us contains two restoration projects \nthat have undergone painstaking planning, design, and development, and \nthey are ready for construction. But we can't get them constructed \nuntil we can get them authorized. The Indian River Lagoon and the \nPicayune Strand are vital projects--together worth $2 billion--in \nincreasing the water quality and maintaining and preserving the natural \nareas to reverse the decades of damage and neglect.\n  So 7 years after the creation of this plan, a plan that has been on \nhold because the Federal Government has faltered in its commitment to \nrestoration of this national and natural treasure, it is time for us to \nget on and approve this bill, unfortunately, by overturning the \nPresident's veto.\n  The biggest threat now to the restoration of the Everglades--thanks \nto folks such as Senator Boxer and those beyond the boundaries of \nFlorida who are finally understanding how important it is--is the \ndelay. We made a promise 7 years ago, and we are going to finally \nfulfill that promise. It is a partnership between the State of Florida \nand the Federal Government. We committed ourselves then to the largest \nrestoration project in the world, and when we pass this legislation, \ndespite those who have tried to detour it, the Federal Government will \nhave\n\n[[Page S14051]]\n\nmade a significant step in living up to its commitment.\n  So with this victory close at hand, let me remind my colleagues there \nare many more battles we are going to have to fight in the future to \nsave the Everglades. But, Madam President, it is my pleasure to stand \nhere to support Senator Boxer in this vote to override the President's \nveto.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 21 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before Senator Nelson leaves the floor, \nI again thank him for bringing me into this entire plan. I am glad I \ncould be of help in saving the Everglades, and I think he has support \non both sides of the aisle.\n  There was an amazing story in the New York Times the other day about \nthe Everglades and how we have to act. Madam President, you are one of \nthe best environmentalists I know, and you know the window is closing \nfor us on so many projects. We need to move now or it is too late. Once \ndamage is irreparable, there is nothing more we can do. So I praise my \nfriend, Senator Nelson.\n  I also say that his whole family is dedicated to this issue. When I \nwent out there and saw the love his family has for this area, the \nunderstanding they have, and how the whole community has been brought \ntogether by Senator Nelson, I think this is a seminal moment for his \ncareer because what we are doing is so critical. And as he points out, \nwe can't move forward unless we have this authorization.\n  The fact that we have to override a veto is sad. I mean, it is adding \nmore time that we are losing. But I am hopeful that tomorrow, sometime \nperhaps even before noon, when the votes are taken, this bill will be \nthe law of the land, and we can go back home and tell people we have, \nin fact, reached across party lines and done something for them, \nnotwithstanding the President's objection.\n  So I thank Senator Nelson. And, Madam President, I am going to yield \n7 minutes to Senator Murray, but before I do, I want to talk about one \nparticular project that is in this bill for California.\n  We have many in here, but I think it is important that people \nunderstand when we looked at this bill, we looked at so many serious \nproblems, where lives are at risk, and one place that is true is in the \nSacramento region of California. As you know, that is our capital. This \nconference report, this important bill, allows the Corps of Engineers \nand the Bureau of Reclamation to complete the necessary modifications \nat the existing Folsom Dam in California so we can protect 300,000 \nresidents of Sacramento and the capital itself from horrific flooding.\n  Madam President, imagine 300,000 people living in a very precarious \nsituation. The capital itself is in a very precarious situation, and we \nknow we can make it safe. That veto left our citizens at risk. But, \nhopefully, tomorrow we will change that.\n  Sacramento is not only the capital of California, where we have 37 \nmillion people and growing, but it is also America's largest \nmetropolitan area with less than 100-year flood control protection. So, \nagain, it is America's largest metropolitan area with less than 100-\nyear flood control protection. And for those who don't know what that \nmeans, we mean a flood that comes once in 100 years. That is what you \nhave to plan for when you have so many people in harm's way.\n  Statistically, Sacramento is four times as likely to be devastated by \nflooding than New Orleans was. Sacramento is situated at the confluence \nof two great rivers, the American River and the Sacramento River. The \nSacramento River is born in the Southern Cascade Mountain Range, while \nthe American River originates in the High Sierra. The city sits in a \nlow valley, in a low valley where these two rivers meet.\n  This large floodplain is one reason California has such productive \nfarmland, and we all benefit from that. It is beautiful farmland. But \nas a result of growth, the Sacramento metropolitan area is now home to \nnearly half a million people and contains 165,000 homes, 1,300 \ngovernment facilities, including the State capitol, and businesses \nproviding 200,000 jobs. A major flood would cripple the Sacramento \nregion's economy, significantly impair the operations of our government \nin our State, cause up to $15 billion in direct damages, up to $30 \nbillion in total economic loss, and we can't even put a pricetag on the \nloss of life.\n  In our State, we know about flooding, we know about fires, and we \nknow about earthquakes. I know, Madam President, in your State you have \ngone through many natural disasters as well.\n  In 1986, as a result of storms, 13 people were killed, 67 were \ninjured, 1,300 homes were destroyed, and 967 businesses damaged--the \ntotal damage cost over $400 million.\n  In 1997, 8 people were killed, 23,000 homes destroyed, and 2,000 \nbusinesses destroyed or damaged--the total damage was $1.8 billion.\n  As the capital of the world's fifth largest economy, no one can deny \nit is important to protect the Sacramento region.\n  I would simply say, in this bill we are taking care of this problem, \nand I want to thank the House for their strong support, particularly \nDoris Matsui and the late, wonderful Congressman Bob Matsui, who really \ngot us started on this project. We are going to do the right thing for \nSacramento. It means everything to our State.\n  We also have many other important California projects in the bill--\nthe revitalizing Los Angeles River, restoring the Salton Sea, critical \nflood control projects, and dredging and navigation projects all \nthroughout our communities. So this bill is really an economic \nlifeblood for California. It truly is. It is also a matter of life and \ndeath for our people.\n  So today is a moving and a touching day. We did in about 8 months, as \nwe took the gavel, what hasn't been done in 7 years. It is a prideful \nmoment but much more important than that; it shows we can reach across \nparty lines. It shows we can work together across State lines. It shows \nwe can work together between the House and the Senate. This moment is \nabout to come, and it is going to mean a great deal to the people of \nour country.\n  Madam President, I yield 7 minutes to my dear friend from Washington \nState, Senator Patty Murray, who has been such a leader on these issues \nand many others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California for \nthe tremendous work she has done on this critical bill that supports \nthe infrastructure across the country and for her diligence in keeping \nto the task to make sure we are finally here at this point where we are \njust a vote away from having this signed into law.\n  Madam President, I wanted to come to the Senate floor tonight to urge \nthe Senate to override the President's very shortsighted veto of this \nWater Resources Development Act. This is a bill that, as the Senator \nfrom California said, renews critical flood control, navigation, and \nwater quality projects that are important across the country but are \nimportant in my home State of Washington as well.\n  This bill ensures our waterways can continue to be used to move \ngoods. It helps restore our beaches and our wetlands, which are \nimportant to our coastal communities, and it makes sure we are \nprotected from catastrophic floods. These projects in this bill are \nessential for our economy. And as we saw with Hurricane Katrina, they \ncan also be a matter of life and death. That is why I was astonished \nthat President Bush vetoed this bill.\n  More than 2 years after Katrina flooded 80 percent of New Orleans, \ndestroyed coastal Mississippi, and killed 1,600 people, I couldn't \nbelieve the President said no to this bill. Even after he failed to \nrespond to the devastation on the gulf, he is now standing in the way \nof projects that will protect the people of that region. Madam \nPresident, 81 Senators approved this bill in October because we \nunderstood our responsibility to invest in these important projects \nthat provide for public safety and that keep our economy healthy.\n  The President's veto is another example of his misplaced priorities. \nThroughout this year he has been insistent on playing political games \nat the expense of our Nation's economy and our health and safety. So, \nagain, I\n\n[[Page S14052]]\n\nurge our colleagues to override this veto and show the President he got \nit wrong.\n  I know most of the Senate agree it is critical for us to address \nthese issues now. This bill will help us avoid another catastrophe such \nas we saw in New Orleans, and it will help ensure our environment and \nour economy stays healthy.\n  Too many years have passed since the Water Development Resources Act \nwas reauthorized. It is 5 years overdue now, and the needs are piling \nup. I again thank Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe because their \nleadership in the first year of this Democratic-controlled Congress \nmade sure that this bill did finally get to the President.\n  The tragedy in New Orleans provided a dramatic example of how \nnecessary this bill is, but there are hundreds of communities across \nthe country that have been waiting for years for Congress to act on \nthis bill and ensure that these vital projects finally get started.\n  WRDA creates a national levee safety program and ensures thousands of \nmiles of levees across the country will get a general safety \ninspection. It enables the Federal Government to act quickly on \ncritical flood control projects, and it helps our local communities \nprepare for damaging and deadly floods.\n  This bill is also about economic development. It ensures that \nshipping can continue on our waterways and helps us to move everything \nfrom wheat to cars to wind turbines from port to port. And it is about \nmaking sure our lakes and our beaches are clean and safe. It protects \nour environment and promotes recreation and it provides jobs.\n  By vetoing this bill, the President said no to the communities that \nhave been waiting for years to go ahead with these critical \nenvironmental, safety, and economic development projects. And, Madam \nPresident, some of those communities are in our home State. From \nshipping, to boating, to fishing, our waterways in the Pacific \nNorthwest are vital to our way of life. That includes, by the way, a \nmajor shipping route on the Columbia River, with container ships and \nbulk carriers and tankers and car carriers that travel back and forth, \nas the Presiding Officer knows, carrying goods in, and shipping lumber \nand grain and countless other products out.\n  So it is vital to the economy of our region the Columbia get regular \ndredging and maintenance. This bill, the WRDA bill, lifts restrictions \non the number of days Federal dredges can operate to make sure that \nhappens. And it helps our region in a number of other ways too. This \nbill gives the Corps of Engineers another tool so they can eliminate \nthat huge backlog of permit applications for people who are trying to \ndo everything from building piers to expanding ports. That will save \nour local governments millions of dollars.\n  By vetoing this bill, the WRDA bill, the President essentially said \nno to the economy, to the safety, and to the environment in my home \nState of Washington.\n  Sadly, the Water Resources Development Act is not the first important \nand bipartisan bill this President has blocked. It happens to be the \nfifth. Besides this bill, President Bush has vetoed children's health \ninsurance; lifesaving stem cell research, twice; and our efforts to \nchange course in Iraq and bring our troops home. He has, by the way, \nthreatened to veto many of our appropriations bills. He says he objects \nto our spending bills because they invest $22 billion more than he \nasked for.\n  President Bush is pretty happy to talk about pork and complain, but \nwhat he will not do and has not done yet is tell the American people \nwhat he wants to cut. Would he cut health care funding? Would he cut \nthe money to build our deteriorating bridges and roads? Maybe he would \ncut investments to the FBI or the DEA. Perhaps it is the millions of \ndollars of funding we have in these bills for job training or education \nthat he objects to. We don't know because he would not say.\n  But he ought to know this. We stand by these important investments \nbecause our bills ensure our roads and our bridges and our airports and \nour railways are in good and safe condition. They ensure our kids can \nsee a doctor. They ensure we can do cutting-edge research so we can \nfind cures for diseases such as diabetes or MS. But as we have seen, \nthe President has insisted on blocking these ideas and priorities and \nkeeps repeating his apparent favorite four-letter word, which is \n``veto.''\n  Instead of investing in our communities, he has continued to play \npolitical games. Instead of progress, all we have gotten are vetoes. I \nhope it is time for us to send a message to President Bush: We are not \ngoing to stand idly by and watch you veto these investments in our \ncommunities. I hope our colleagues override this veto on this important \nlegislation, and I believe by standing together, as our friends in the \nHouse did, we can send a strong message to him about who has the right \npriorities for America. I hope by doing this we can finally unite with \nour Republican colleagues in choosing a new course for the other \nimportant bills--the children's health bill, all of our appropriations \nbills, even the stem cell research bill.\n  I think it is time for Congress to turn a page on the President's \nobstruction. This is the first step. I hope there are more to come. As \nI have said before, and I will say it again now, people around this \ncountry are eager for a change. They want to see a light at the end of \nthe tunnel, and we want to make sure the President does not put out \nthat light.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I \nthink what she did in her presentation is give a message of hope. I \nthink this is a signal, this vote tomorrow. It is a signal we can work \ntogether across party lines to get things done for the good of the \nAmerican people. People want to see that and they are going to see it.\n  The President said this bill lacked fiscal discipline. He doesn't \nrealize, I guess, it has been 7 years in the making. We used to do \nthese WRDA bills, these water resources bills, every 2 years. So there \nhas been pent-up demand, the normal pent-up demand in a country that is \ngrowing, whose economy is growing, that is importing more and exporting \nmore goods. Of course we are going to have a pent-up demand.\n  Then, when you put on top of that the disastrous consequences from \nKatrina and Rita and the fact that we are getting more floods and we \nare having more problems, you realize this bill is a very fair and \ndefensible one. Again, as Senator Inhofe said, we don't spend a dime. \nThis is an authorization bill, the first step in bringing Federal \nresources and expertise to a project that is developed at the local \nlevel.\n  Every one of these projects is brought to us from our communities. \nThat means the communities are willing to put up funds and our funding \nis so important because it spurs on these projects.\n  I think what is sort of getting to the American people is the fact \nthat, as the President says, a bill such as this, which is an \nauthorizing bill, is too large. He seems to have a blank check for \nventures overseas--$12 billion a month is going out the door, $12 \nbillion a month for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This bill equals \nliterally 2 months of that funding. It has taken us 7 years.\n  Put it into perspective. This bill that authorizes all these \nimportant flood control projects, navigation projects, recreation \nprojects, environmental restoration projects--all these bills add up to \n2 months in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Then we read on the front page of the Washington Post the other day \nthat the administration is paying millions of dollars to fix a dam in \nIraq. I am all for that. I don't want to see anyone hurt in Iraq. But I \ndon't want to see anyone hurt in Sacramento or in Seattle or in New \nOrleans or in any of the towns in Mississippi. I don't want to see us \nlose the Everglades. The fact of the matter is, I think the President \nis on weak ground in vetoing this bill that is so important for the \npublic works of the country while spending so much on the public works \nof countries abroad.\n  This is an investment in America we will be making tomorrow morning, \nif all is well, and we see that same kind of vote we had the last time. \nWe can stand tall and proud. Seven years is too long a wait for a bill \nthat authorizes essential programs, such as navigation,\n\n[[Page S14053]]\n\nflood control, ecosystem restoration--but we are ready to go. I think \nthis bill meets our communities' needs. Some of them are unmet needs. \nSome of them are acute needs.\n  Make no mistake, the projects that are authorized in this bill that I \nhope we will again pass tomorrow--again I hope we will override the \nPresident's veto--are going to protect thousands of homes and the lives \nof millions from catastrophic flooding. It is going to help us restore \nwetlands, estuaries, and rivers of our Nation--places where wildlife \nthrives and our families go to enjoy the outdoors.\n  Indeed, as hunting, fishing, boating, camping, and other outdoor \nindustries boom, this bill is an important part of keeping our \nrecreation economy thriving.\n  It also says, yes, our ports need attention. The waterways need to \nhave capacity. We need to make shipping easier, safer, and efficient, \nso it keeps the economy moving. So much of our economy is dependent on \nwater resources. Our ports and harbors are the gateway to the world. \nOur manufactured goods, such as autos and computer chips, move through \nthose ports. Our agricultural goods, such as grains, wines, and fruit, \npass through our ports and harbors to be sold around the world. Goods \ncome in and they get distributed to the entire country. We are talking \nabout thousands of jobs. We are talking about moving goods. We are \ntalking about recreation.\n\n  We are talking about 360 million visits a year to our lakes and our \nbeaches and other areas; 25 million people visit a Corps project at \nleast once a year and that generates 600,000 jobs.\n  Let me say, tomorrow or later tonight my colleagues may hear some \ncomplaint about the fact that we didn't do enough Corps reform. I wish \nto say Members on both sides of the aisle spent a great deal of time on \nthis issue. Senator Feingold has been a prime mover in this area, and I \ngreatly respect the work he has done, but I have to say, as I have said \nto him, I know he wants more. But we went a long way. This is a good \npackage. We have a truly independent review process. I think we \nactually made that independent review process more independent. We have \noutside experts, free of political pressure, coming in and examining \nall aspects of the environmental, economic, and engineering components \nof a project study. These panels will be able to receive and evaluate \npublic comments. The panels will be available to advise the Corps \nthroughout the entire development process.\n  The bill requires the first updates of the Corps planning principles \nand guidelines since 1983, when President Reagan was in the White \nHouse. The bill will make the Corps mitigate the impact of its projects \nthe same as any other party and make sure mitigation is done in kind, \nup front, and not as an afterthought.\n  We included safety assurance reviews, increased watershed planning, \nauthorized a levee safety assessment program, and expedited the \ndeauthorization of the backlog of unconstructed projects.\n  But Senator Feingold still believes we should have done more. \nFrankly, I would love to do more, and I will work on this in the \nfuture. But we went as far as we could go. We cannot make the perfect \nthe enemy of the good. I find myself saying that over and over around \nhere. We have to do good work. The only perfect work is the work each \nof us wants to do.\n  I know what is perfect. Senator Cantwell knows what is perfect. \nSenator Inhofe knows what is perfect. If we write our own bill, to us \nit is perfect. But we have 100 of us, 100 different ``perfects.'' It \nmeans we have to reach across the aisle and work together.\n  I say to Senator Feingold, even though he is not on the floor today, \nthank you for your leadership, but please reconsider your opposition. \nVote with us on the override. We have gone a long way. We have acted in \ngood faith, and we will continue to work with you in the future on so \nmany of the important reform issues you bring to this floor.\n  Tomorrow is a very big day for me as chairman of the committee, for \nSenator Inhofe, who actually started this bill when he had the gavel. \nHe brought it pretty close to being the law, but we didn't quite get it \nover the line. He has worked with me as a solid team member.\n  I think it is going to be a great day for the Congress. I think it is \ngoing to be a great day for the Constitution. What we are saying: Mr. \nPresident, we are elected too. We count too. The American people vote \nfor us too. When so many of us tell you we believe strongly that we \nneed to meet the infrastructure needs of our country, we hope you would \ncome to the table. This time you chose not to do so. We hope in the \nfuture you will join us.\n  It is a great day for the Constitution. The Framers of the \nConstitution foresaw this. They said: If you have an executive who \ndecides to veto something that is a crying need in the Nation, and \neverybody agrees--67 of us, or two-thirds of those present and voting, \ncan override a veto. Tomorrow is going to be a great day for the health \nand safety of the people of my State of California, of the United \nStates.\n  I look forward to coming to the floor tomorrow. I think Senator \nInhofe and I will divide 15 minutes, and we will, once more, lay out in \nshorter form why we think it is essential to override this ill-advised \nveto.\n  Madam President, thank you so much for your consideration, and for \nyour work on this bill.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise in support of the Water \nResources Development Act conference report.\n  It has been 6 years since Congress last passed a water resources and \ndevelopment reauthorization bill. The time has come to finally pass \nthis important legislation. I am very disappointed that the President \nhas vetoed this bill.\n  America's infrastructure and waterways system is the foundation of \nour economy. For too long, we have been ignoring our infrastructure, \nbut Katrina was a wake-up call for all of us. In the wake of this \ndisaster, we saw firsthand the devastating impact of a weak \ninfrastructure on our people and our economy. The more we continue to \nfail to fund our water infrastructure, the more we are putting our \nNation's competitiveness at risk in this global marketplace.\n  Our physical infrastructure is a critical piece to making America \nmore competitive. Our infinite needs are overwhelming and being \nsqueezed. We should be rebuilding an infrastructure of competitiveness \nso that future generations have at least the same opportunity to enjoy \nour standard of living and quality of life. If we continue to ignore \nthe upkeep--the deterioration of our locks and dams, flood control \nprojects, and navigation channels--we risk disruptions in waterborne \ncommerce, decreased protection against floods as we saw in Katrina and \nother environmental damage.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that this bill includes many provisions \nthat will benefit the Great Lakes. First, there is authority for the \nCorps to deal with a very serious threat facing the Great Lakes. Asian \ncarp are just miles from the lakes, and the only thing standing in \ntheir way is a temporary dispersal barrier in the Chicago Ship & \nSanitary Canal. This bill authorizes the Corps to complete construction \nof Barrier II which is the permanent barrier as well as to convert \nBarrier I into a permanent facility and to operate and maintain both \ndispersal barriers at full Federal cost. Under this authority, the \nCorps would study options for hydrologic separation of the canal and \nthe Great Lakes while maintaining the movement of cargo and \nrecreational vessels.\n  This bill clarifies that any reconnaissance study under the Great \nLakes Fishery & Ecosystem Restoration program is to be performed at \nfull federal expense. The Great Lakes navigation system has been \nassociated with impacts on Great Lakes fishery resources, and the \npurpose of the Great Lakes Fishery and Ecosystem Restoration program is \nfor the Corps to cooperate with others to plan, implement, and evaluate \nprojects supporting the restoration of the fishery, ecosystem, and \nbeneficial uses of the Great Lakes. When Congress authorized this \nprogram initially, the intention was for the Corps to develop projects \nunder this authority just like other programs. That means that the \nreconnaissance study is to be a fully federal expense, and cost-sharing \nis required for subsequent study, engineering, design, and \nconstruction.\n  This bill reauthorizes the Great Lakes Remedial Action Plans and \nSediment Remediation and the Great Lakes\n\n[[Page S14054]]\n\nTributary Models Program. These are two programs that allow the Corps \nto provide assistance for controlling the source of sediments and to \nidentifying specific actions to resolve pollution problems.\n  Also contained in this bill is authority directing the Corps to \nexpedite the operation and maintenance, including dredging, of the \nnavigation features of the Great Lakes and connecting channels for the \npurpose of supporting navigation. The Corps has a huge backlog of work, \nand that backlog includes the Great Lakes. Freighters are getting stuck \nin shipping channels, other ships are carrying reduced loads, and some \nshipments have simply ceased altogether. The Corps estimates a backlog \nof 16 million cubic yards of dredging at commercial Great Lakes harbors \nand channels, which the Army Corps expects will cost about $192 million \nto address. In order to help address this backlog, the Corps will be \nauthorized to expedite this work.\n  Lastly, this bill allows the St. Lawrence Seaway Development \nCorporation to carry out much-needed repairs, including maintenance \ndredging, of the Eisenhower and Snell lock facilities and related \nnavigational infrastructure for the St. Lawrence Seaway. Unfortunately, \nlike many of our infrastructure projects, we have not done much upkeep \nof the St. Lawrence Seaway. This bill will allow for those improvements \nto be made at a total cost of $134,650,000.\n  The passage of this WRDA conference report cannot be delayed any \nfurther. It is simply too important to our Nation in terms of its \nbenefits to our economy and environment and for the speedy recovery for \nthe areas affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to override the President's veto.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I will vote to sustain President \nBush's veto of the Water Resources Development Act. The President's \nveto of the WRDA bill is a welcome opportunity for Congress to modify \nthe flawed, bloated bill. Instead of overriding the veto, Congress \nshould be taking this opportunity to fix the bill.\n  For 7 years, I have worked with Senator McCain and many of our \ncolleagues to achieve essential reforms of the Corps of Engineers, and \nhave long anticipated the day that meaningful reforms are enacted. \nUnfortunately, during conference, the Senate's strong Corps reform \nprovisions were significantly watered down. Instead of the reform bill \nthat the country needs, this bill is simply the latest example of \nbusiness as usual.\n  After a decade of Government and independent reports calling for \nreforming the Corps, and pointing out stunning flaws in Corps projects \nand project studies, and after the tragic failures of New Orleans' \nlevees during Hurricane Katrina, the American people deserve meaningful \nreforms to ensure that the projects the Corps builds are safe, \nappropriate, environmentally responsible and fiscally sound. The \nurgency and necessity could not be clearer.\n  A critical component of reforming the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is \nensuring independent review of significant Corps projects. This bill \nprovides review but does not ensure it is truly independent.\n  I will continue to push for Corps reforms that ensure fiscal \nresponsibility, accountability, public safety, and environmental \nprotections. This means ensuring that Americans' tax dollars are spent \non the most important priorities, not just on Members' pet projects. \nEarlier this year, I was joined by Senators McCain, Coburn, Carper, \nGregg, Sununu, and DeMint in offering an amendment to form a commission \nof non-Federal, water resources experts to provide Congress \nrecommendations on a process for prioritizing Corps projects.\n  However, the Senate defeated this effort. I can only conclude that \nmany of our colleagues think the status quo is acceptable. To me, there \nis nothing acceptable about a $58 billion backlog (soon to be $81 \nbillion) of authorized but unfunded projects. Some of my colleagues \nhave argued it is okay to authorize $23 billion in projects, because \nWRDA only authorizes projects and does not appropriate funds. This \napproach shirks our responsibility as elected officials. By authorizing \nWRDA projects, Congress is indicating these projects are worthy of \nfunding and that taxpayer dollars should be committed to these \nprojects. Unfortunately, without some way of prioritizing and with a \nlimited annual construction budget of around $2 billion, our Nation's \ncritical infrastructure and restoration projects--and the American \npeople who depend on these water resources projects--will suffer.\n  The President did the right thing when he vetoed the WRDA bill and I \nam disappointed that Congress is determined to override that veto. My \ncolleagues would be better off if they listened to people like Mark \nBeorkrem, a true Corps reform champion. Mark recently passed away, but \nhis 20 years of advocacy on behalf of the Mississippi River and \nreforming the Corps of Engineers will have profound and lasting effects \non the health and vitality of the Mississippi and rivers across the \ncountry. Most recently, Mark played a pivotal role in ensuring the \ninclusion of a comprehensive ecosystem restoration component in the \nCorps' Mississippi River lock expansion project. He also provided \nleadership within the national Corps Reform Network, as well as the \nSierra Club, sharing his knowledge and passion for environmental \nprotection and restoration. The Mississippi and many of our Nation's \nrivers and wetlands are better off thanks to Mark's tireless efforts. \nWe should be guided by his example.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the President's veto of the WRDA \nconference report, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord newspaper editorials on this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 5, 2007]\n\n   Fiscal Plunge, a Vetoed $23 Billion Water Bill Is Not Worth Saving\n\n       Ah, the theatrics of Washington. On Friday, President Bush \n     vetoed the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), a bill \n     that would authorize $23 billion in spending on water \n     projects by the Army Corps of Engineers. Lawmakers of both \n     parties were critical. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid \n     (D-Nev.) said that the veto shows ``President Bush is out of \n     touch with the American people and their priorities.'' \n     According to Mr. Reid, one of 81 senators to vote for the \n     WRDA (it passed the House 381 to 40), the bill would \n     ``strengthen our environment and economy and protect our \n     natural resources'' and fund projects ``essential to \n     protecting the people of the Gulf Coast region'' from \n     hurricanes. The veto is ``irresponsible,'' Mr. Reid declared.\n       After almost five years in which he did little to check the \n     spending of a Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Bush is a \n     bit late in trying to recover his party's reputation for \n     fiscal conservatism. But even discounting for the White \n     House's political posturing, this is hardly an example of an \n     ``irresponsible'' veto. To the contrary, that word might \n     better be applied to the WRDA itself. The bill would indeed \n     authorize about $1.9 billion for coastal ecosystem \n     restoration and protection in Louisiana to help the state \n     rebuild its defenses against hurricanes. The president \n     supports that; he just thinks that Congress could have \n     authorized it without also larding on billions of dollars \n     worth of economically and environmentally questionable \n     projects. And he's right: After all, the Senate and the House \n     versions of the legislation tipped the scales at $14 billion \n     and $15 billion, respectively. Then, in conference committee, \n     lawmakers added more pet projects to bring the total up to \n     $23 billion.\n       The silver lining in the bill is that it takes some \n     tentative steps toward reforming the Army Corps, providing \n     for independent review of projects worth more than $45 \n     million. But this modest change is much weaker than what the \n     overhaul reformers in the Senate had advocated. Thus Mr. \n     Bush's valid concern, expressed in his veto message, that the \n     WRDA ``does not set priorities'' among the $58 billion in \n     projects authorized in past bills. Indeed, though it has a \n     high nominal price tag, the WRDA only promises projects, \n     essential and otherwise, that have to compete for the $2 \n     billion the Army Corps spends each year. So the WRDA is \n     largely a hollow political exercise. Given the overwhelming \n     margins by which both houses passed the bill, though, Mr. \n     Bush's veto is almost certain to be promptly overridden. This \n     time, Congress's empty gesture will trump the president's \n     futile one.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Nov. 6, 2007]\n\n                            Scant Resources\n\n       This week's anticipated veto override by Congress on a \n     water-projects spending bill will allow $23 billion in \n     unfunded mandates, codifying a pork-laden plan that, for the \n     most part, will not come to fruition. Ironically, these \n     members of Congress who have given overwhelming approval of \n     the bill and are poised to overthrow President Bush's veto \n     are highly unlikely to actually set aside real funding for \n     the bill when it comes time to parcel out appropriations.\n       Congress gave landslide approval for this bill (81-12 in \n     the Senate and 381-40 in the\n\n[[Page S14055]]\n\n     House) to grant the $23 billion for some 900 projects by the \n     Army Corps of Engineers and yet they failed to back up the \n     mandates with actual funding. This makes the political \n     theater all the more an empty charade, with Mr. Bush finally \n     chastising Congress for its lack of fiscal restraint and \n     members of his own party lampooning his efforts.\n       The Water Resources Development Act adds to the backlog of \n     mandates the corps will ostensibly be handling--$38 billion \n     by Mr. Bush's count and $58 billion by Taxpayers for Common \n     Sense. It is puzzling that Congress would continue to add to \n     this burden when historically Congress allocates a mere $2 \n     billion per year for new corps construction projects. It \n     seems most members relish the opportunity to send out a \n     crowing press release in their home district about a hard-\n     fought earmark that has fat chance of ever improving the \n     quality of life for their constituents.\n       The bill lacks the prioritization needed to ensure vital \n     projects are completed first. However, this is not new--pork \n     projects continue to dilute the corps' spending power as it \n     spreads itself too thin. This was apparent in Louisiana, a \n     state that by far has enjoyed the most in corps \n     appropriations (some $1.9 billion in the last five years to \n     second-place California's $1.4 billion). Yet, rather than \n     placing high priority on projects like the levees prior to \n     Hurricane Katrina, funding instead went to an unjustifiable \n     navigation canal lock project and the low-trafficked J. \n     Bennett Johnston Waterway.\n       An odd set of bedfellows have urged oversight and belt-\n     tightening on the water projects, from Sen. Russ Feingold, \n     Wisconsin Democrat, to the earmark watchdog Republicans Sen. \n     Jim DeMint of South Carolina and Rep. Jeff Flake of Arizona. \n     While their logical stance will be dismissed, the consolation \n     is most of the projects in this earmark-laden bill won't see \n     the light of day.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From USA Today, Nov. 7, 2006]\n\nOur View on Flood Control: Despite Katrina, Business as Usual on Water \n  Projects. Instead of Setting Priorities, Congress Piles on the Pork.\n\n       Suppose you need a new car. You want to spend $14,000. Your \n     spouse argues for $15,000. Then you go to the showroom and \n     you compromise--by driving away in a $23,000 vehicle.\n       Add six more zeroes to each figure, and that's basically \n     what happened in Congress to the first legislation since 2000 \n     to authorize new water projects. The Senate approved $14 \n     billion, the House approved $15 billion and they \n     ``compromised'' on $23 billion.\n       This bloated package--everything from dams and levees to \n     sewage treatment plants and beach restoration--is, of course, \n     an exercise in local greed and political clout. Neither is \n     going away any time soon. But in its ham-fisted grab for the \n     money, Congress also managed to ignore lessons taught so \n     painfully by Hurricane Katrina.\n       It may complete the folly this week if the Senate, as \n     expected, follows Tuesday's House action and overrides a \n     richly deserved veto by President Bush.\n       For decades, lawmakers have authorized water projects less \n     on the nation's needs than on their own need to bring home \n     federal dollars and get re-elected.\n       In the process, the Gulf Coast was made steadily more \n     vulnerable. Projects to tame the Mississippi's flow and turn \n     it into a lucrative shipping channel degraded marshes and \n     swamps that had long protected New Orleans from storm surges. \n     Katrina blew past the vanishing buffers, pushed water up a \n     man-made channel and overwhelmed ineptly built federal \n     levees.\n       While the $23 billion measure authorizes projects designed \n     to mitigate such blunders--strengthening New Orleans' levees, \n     for instance, and starting to restore the Louisiana coastal \n     wetlands and Florida's Everglades--it also includes an \n     assortment of dubious ones, on the Gulf Coast and elsewhere:\n       $131 million to deepen Louisiana's Port of Iberia, even \n     though the project failed a government cost-benefit analysis. \n     After that, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., made sure the \n     calculation was redone.\n       $2 billion to expand Upper Mississippi River navigation \n     locks to accommodate more barges. In 2001, the project was \n     halted when government planners were accused of \n     overestimating barge traffic and using other inaccurate \n     assumptions to justify the locks. Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., vowed \n     to get the project built anyway.\n       $56 million to replenish sand at Imperial Beach in San \n     Diego County. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., defends it as a \n     way to fight ``storm surge.'' That's dubious, and in any \n     case, why should taxpayers in Kansas have to re-sand a beach \n     in California?\n       Millions more for local water supply projects and other \n     unspecified plans.\n       Absent is any plan to reform this cavalier process. The \n     Senate rejected, 69-22, a measure to create a commission of \n     outside experts to set priorities.\n       Unfortunately, Bush's record on fiscal responsibility is so \n     poor that his veto carries little credibility on Capitol \n     Hill. So, after sustaining vetoes it should have overridden \n     (on stem-cell research and children's health insurance), \n     Congress is now about to override a veto it should have \n     sustained.\n       Lawmakers could have used this as an opportunity to write a \n     cheaper, cleaner, more sensible roadmap for making the nation \n     safer from hurricanes and floods. Instead, they are spending \n     tax dollars on a vehicle loaded with expensive, unnecessary \n     options.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 15, 2007]\n\n                          Reform for the Corps\n\n       Congress appears to be on track to approve a major water \n     resources bill that would, among other provisions, provide \n     long-overdue money for Everglades restoration and money to \n     begin rebuilding Louisiana's vulnerable wetlands. But the \n     House and Senate versions of the bill diverge on one crucial \n     issue: reforming the Army Corps of Engineers.\n       This difference should be resolved by Senate and House \n     negotiators in favor of the stronger Senate version, which \n     guarantees meaningful reform.\n       Compared with most government agencies, the corps has \n     always lived a charmed and largely undisciplined life, \n     accountable to no one except a Congress that is happy to let \n     it do whatever it wants as long as it builds the dams, \n     levees, bridges and other pork-barrel projects dear to \n     Congressional hearts.\n       One result is that over the years the corps has inflated \n     the economic payoffs of its projects while underestimating \n     their potential damage to the environment. As the levee \n     failures during Hurricane Katrina demonstrated, the corps has \n     also made misjudgments in engineering and design.\n       The Senate version addresses this by requiring independent \n     peer review of the design, cost and environmental \n     consequences of projects exceeding $40 million in value. The \n     House version offers a review process that is more loosely \n     structured and is independent in name only. It gives the \n     corps all sorts of wiggle room, including the authority to \n     define the scope of the reviews, which in turn could leave \n     important issues unexamined.\n       There are other differences between the two versions, but \n     this is the most important. The Senate should stand firm.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           WRDA Veto Override\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise today supporting the override of the President's \nveto of the Water Resources Development Act, known as the WRDA bill. We \nhave waited for this bill for a long time. Senator Boxer of California \nand Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma worked so hard on it; 7 years it took us \nto put this bill together. It is a bill which should be passed on a \nregular basis because the needs of our country are recurring. They did \na great job in putting this bill together. The conference passed it \nwith an overwhelming vote within 7 months after the session began.\n  After 7 years of toil and 7 months hard work to put the bill \ntogether, it authorizes navigation, ecosystem restoration, and flood \nand storm damage reduction projects all over America. The projects in \nthis bill are important for all of our Nation and represent benefits to \nrural and urban areas as well.\n  In Chicago, for example, residents will see enormous benefits from \nthe Thornton and McCook Reservoirs projects in this bill. These \nreservoirs are currently under construction, but until they are \ncompleted, significant areas in that part of the country will remain \nunprotected from major floods. I know what I am speaking of. It has not \nbeen that long ago--only a few weeks--that I was in the suburbs \nwatching them as they packed the sandbags and turned the pumps on in \nthe basements and found ways to avoid the floodwater damage that was \nafflicting most of our area in the northern suburbs, in the northwest \nsuburbs.\n  These reservoirs, when completed, will provide some protection. \nWithout them, millions of homeowners are going to be exposed to \nflooding. There is another element. It is not just the damage to the \ncommunities, it is not just the interruption of commerce, it is not the \nwater-soaked basement and all of the stuff that has to be thrown away, \nit is not just the expense of buying a pump to try to clear out our \nhome; it is also the fact that when we run into this flooding situation \nwe have sewer backups that discharge raw sewage into Lake Michigan. \nThat is unacceptable. It is the sort of thing every community along the \nlake has to take seriously.\n  How does a community come up with the resources to deal with that so \nthe storm drains do not overflow? Well, it\n\n[[Page S14056]]\n\nis hard for them to come up with the resources by themselves. But with \nFederal assistance it is possible.\n  Critics of this kind of approach say it is porkbarrel, more earmarks \nand Federal spending and, you know, these Senators, they are trying to \nput more money in their States for political reasons. Well, the fact \nis, this is Federal money earmarked for projects to avoid flooding, to \nprotect homes, to protect neighborhoods, and to protect great national \ntreasures such as Lake Michigan.\n  The reservoirs not only will help stop sewage overflows, but they are \ngoing to save homeowners money. Almost 75 percent of the residential \nlots in South Holland, IL, are now in a floodplain. That will be \nremoved when the Thornton projects are complete. Completing these \nprojects will save the homeowners in South Holland $713,000 in annual \ninsurance premiums.\n  A lot of those homeowners are struggling with property taxes now and \ngetting a break on flood insurance is certainly good news. This is just \none of the many examples of how the WRDA bill will save homeowners real \ndollars and protect their homes.\n  Another important feature of the bill for Illinois is increased lock \ncapacity and improvements to the ecosystem of the Upper Mississippi and \nIllinois Rivers. The Mississippi River, of course, is a beautiful \nriver, and father of all waters, and has many claims to historic and \nnatural significance. But it also is an important avenue of commerce. \nThis is the backbone of the waterway system of America. It transports \n$12 billion worth of products each year, including over 1 billion \nbushels of grain to ports around the world. This efficient river \ntransportation is vital to Illinois. Shipping by barge is inexpensive \nand helps keep our ports competitive. That is good for producers and \ngood for consumers all over the world.\n  More than half of the Illinois annual corn crop and 75 percent of all \nU.S. soybean exports travel along the Upper Mississippi and Illinois \nRivers. Shipping by barge is not only cost effective, but it has real \nenvironmental benefits. Barges operate at 10 percent of the cost of \ntrucks, 40 percent of the cost of trains, they release far less carbon \nmonoxide, nitrous oxide, and hydrocarbons, and barges use much less \nfuel to operate.\n  But the system of locks and dams along the Upper Mississippi that \nmake travel possible is in desperate need of modernization. The current \nsystem was built 70 years ago and it needs to be repaired. Many of the \nolder locks are only 600 feet in length. Most of the current barges are \ntwice that length. That means these goods take twice as long to go down \nthe river into the marketplace.\n  The override veto before us today will authorize $2.2 billion for \nreplacing and upgrading locks and dams, and--this is a critical part of \nit--$1.7 billion for ecosystem restoration along the river.\n  We struck an agreement between those who want to use the river for \ncommerce, and those who value it as a natural resource. We said, if we \nimprove the locks and dams, we will put a comparable amount of money, \n$1.7 billion, into restoring the river, the ecosystem of the \nMississippi River. So I think that is a fairminded, balanced approach \nto what our Nation needs.\n  As we have seen in the tragedy that occurred along Minnesota's 35-W \nbridge, our country's infrastructure is aging and overburdened. The \nprojects included in this bill are desperately needed to shore up our \nwaterway system, a vital component of our national infrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, the President vetoed this bill last Friday. After \nyears of trying to put this bill together, this President discovered \nhis veto pen this year and decided he would start vetoing bills one \nafter the other. This is the latest casualty. The WRDA veto override \nwas passed by the House yesterday with an overwhelming vote, 361 to 54.\n  When the Senate originally considered the bill earlier this year, \nthere were only five Senators who voted against it. In less than 1 week \nthis Congress has come together to send the President a strong message \nthat his fiscal priorities are misplaced and misguided. I do not \nunderstand how this President can ask us for $196 billion to rebuild \nIraq, and we ask for $23 billion to put into rebuilding America's \nwaterways, protecting the levees that could flood communities and doing \nthings that are critical for our future, and the President says it is \nwasteful spending--wasteful if it is spent in America, not wasteful if \nit is spent in Iraq?\n\n  I fear the President gets up every morning in the White House and \nlooks out the window and all he sees is Iraq. If he looked out that \nwindow, he would see America is out here too. It needs investment. A \nstrong America begins at home. The Water Resources Development Act will \nbuild the infrastructure which will build the economy, creating good \nbusiness, good-paying jobs, construction jobs that cannot be \noutsourced, jobs that will be filled by Americans getting decent wages \nand good benefits, taking them home to their families, building up the \nneighborhoods and communities that are the backbone of this great \nNation.\n  The President does not see that. Oh, he can see $196 billion for \nIraq. He cannot see $23 billion for America. I think he is wrong. By \nthe vote yesterday in the House of Representatives, overwhelmingly they \ntold him he was wrong. I hope we reach the same conclusion when this \nmatter comes before us tomorrow. What was intended to be reauthorized \nevery 2 years is now 5 years too late.\n  If we follow the President's lead, we will postpone this again, we \nwill see locks and dams continue to deteriorate, bridges continue to \nfail, and people wondering why in the world this great Nation of \nAmerica is not making certain its infrastructure and backbone are \nstrong enough to sustain economic growth.\n  It is time the President stopped using his veto pen for essential \nprojects, programs like those in this bill, and in the appropriations \nbills that will be sent his way. I encourage all of my colleagues to \nsupport this bill to override the President's veto.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Baucus, in sponsoring the National Methamphetamine Awareness \nMonth resolution of 2007. As a senior Member of the Senate representing \na State confronting an epidemic of methamphetamine abuse and as \ncochairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I \nhave often been confronted with heartbreaking stories of the \ndestructive nature meth abuse has on families and children. All too \noften, meth abuse not only ruins the life of the user, it disrupts the \nlives of the users family, friends, and the community at large. That is \nwhy Members of Congress must do everything we can to ensure that \ncommunities across the country have the tools and support they need to \nstop meth in its tracks.\n  Since the passage of the Combat Meth Act in 2005, an act that \nrestricted the sale of a main ingredient of meth known as \npseudoephedrine, or PSE, the number of home-grown meth labs has \ndramatically decreased throughout the Nation. In spite of this \nencouraging development, the National Association of Counties reports, \nin its recent survey of county sheriffs, that meth remains the No. 1 \ndrug problem in almost half the counties across the country. In some \ncases, sheriffs reported, in this survey, that not only has the rate of \nmeth abuse stayed the same, it has actually increased. The Drug \nEnforcement Administration, DEA, estimates that over 80 percent of the \nmeth in this country is smuggled in from Mexico by drug cartels who \nproduce this poison in superlabs.\n  Senator Baucus and I have held hearings to examine ways in which the \nGovernment could break the meth supply chain while helping to reduce \nthe number of people suffering from meth. One of the areas discussed, \nto help achieve these goals, was to boost our efforts to educate and \nraise awareness among the public. We have to do a better job to reach \nthose who don't view meth as a deadly drug, and we have to ensure that \nour children never try meth. Studies show that the longer you keep a \nchild drug-free, before the age of 20, chances are very good that they \nwill never try or become addicted to drugs.\n  In my State of Iowa, we have 22 community based organizations that \nare designed just for this purpose. One of these organizations, that I \nfounded, called Face It Together, or FIT, encourages parents, \neducators, businesses, religious leaders, law enforcement officials, \nhealth care providers, youth groups, and news organizations to work \ntogether to come up with new and creative ways to confront drug abuse \nwithin their communities. While some of these community coalitions \nreceive some financial support from the Federal Government, the real \ndifference is made by all of those who volunteer within their \ncommunities to ensure they remain drug-free.\n  Although much remains to be done to eradicate meth from our \ncommunities, this resolution is part of a vast, ongoing effort to \nensure meth abuse does not expand further into our society. I am please \nthat this resolution is supported by the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions \nof America, CADCA, and I urge my colleagues to join us in support of \nour efforts against meth abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14057-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DETROIT REPERTORY THEATRE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize \nthe 50th anniversary of the Detroit Repertory Theatre, one of \nMichigan's oldest, continuously operating professional theatre \ncompanies. Located in the heart of Detroit, this theatre company has \nmade significant contributions to the arts landscape in Detroit and \nacross Michigan, forging an enduring legacy over the last half century.\n  The arts play an important role in building and sustaining \ncommunities by bridging cultural, ethnic, economic differences, and by \nbeing an important economic catalyst. Since its inception in 1957, the \nDetroit Repertory Theatre has been at the forefront of this effort and \nhas provided world-class theatre productions for the greater Detroit \ncommunity. Its ongoing emphasis on racially and ethnically diverse \ncasting and its focus on theatrical relevancy have allowed it to carve \nout an important niche in the grassroots theatre world.\n  The Detroit Repertory Theatre's golden anniversary is particularly \nimpressive considering the myriad challenges grassroots theatre \ncompanies face. This theatre company has not only weathered and adeptly \novercome every challenge but continues to provide quality performances, \nwhile focusing on making their productions both relevant and accessible \nto the community. Integral to the theatre's mission is reaching out to \na broader theatre audience through various successful outreach efforts, \nincluding Arts in Education Programs, Free Acting Workshops, the New \nPlaywrights' Program, and the Charitable and CMO Partnerships.\n  True to its bold tradition of forging ahead, this anniversary not \nonly celebrates past achievements but concurrently looks forward and \nembarks on new challenges. On Saturday, the Detroit Repertory Theatre \nwill hold a black tie benefit to formally celebrate its golden \nanniversary and to kickoff its 50th Anniversary Challenge. This effort \nseeks to raise the funds necessary to execute its operational and \ncommunity development initiatives, seeking to position the theatre to \nmeet the challenges that lie ahead.\n  When an organization enjoys the type of success the Detroit Repertory \nTheatre has over the years, there are many who have sacrificed much and \ndeserve acknowledgement and our heartfelt gratitude. It is in this \nspirit that I know my colleagues join me in recognizing and \ncongratulating all those who have contributed to the Detroit Repertory \nTheatre's many successes over the last 50 years, in particular Bruce \nMilan, an original cofounder and the theatre's artistic and managing \ndirector, as well as his fellow cofounders, Barbara Busby and Dee \nAndrus. The community looks forward to an equally impressive record of \nsuccess over the next half century.

Madam President, I am honored to recognize Mr. \nBernard Rader of Freeport, NY, for his selection as one of just seven \nAmericans--along with my colleague, Senator Inouye--to receive the \nFrench Legion of Honor from President Nicolas Sarkozy on his first \nofficial visit to Washington. Bernie, who is also a recipient of the \nBronze Star and the Purple Heart, is deservedly being recognized for \nthe heroism and courage he displayed in the service of our Nation as a \nsoldier in the 301st Regiment of the 94th Infantry Division during \nWorld War II.\n  The Legion of Honor was established by Napoleon in 1802 to honor both \nmilitary and civilians who have made significant contributions to \nFrench life. With this recognition, Bernie Rader joins Legionnaires \nincluding Dwight Eisenhower, Winston Churchill, Neil Armstrong, and \nQueen Elizabeth II.\n  Bernie Rader was born in the Bronx on December 12, 1923. In 1943, \nBernie heeded his country's call to service and joined the Army as a \nrifleman assigned to the 94th Infantry Division. On September 8, 1944, \njust over 3 months after D-day, Bernie's regiment landed on Utah Beach \nin Normandy, France. The 94th ID subsequently moved into Brittany, \nwhere it was responsible for containing and taking on remaining pockets \nof German resistance in the English Channel ports of Lorient and Saint \nNazaire. During the Siege of Lorient, in October 1944, Bernie's platoon \nwas ambushed, and he was wounded and taken captive as a prisoner of \nwar. Thinking quickly, Bernie asked one of his comrades to bury his dog \ntags to keep the Nazis from discovering his Jewish faith. Bernie was \nheld for 6 weeks as a POW before being released during an unprecedented \nprisoner exchange organized by Andrew Gerow Hodges of the Red Cross.\n  Bernie's 94th Infantry Division went on to help liberate several \nsmall French towns. They also trained and armed 29 French infantry \nbattalions to aid them in the war against Germany. In early 1945, the \n94th ID launched an attack across the Saar River, which separated \nFrance and Germany. By March of 1945 the division controlled a 10-mile \nfront, where it repelled German attacks. On March 13, 1945, they drove \nto the Rhine River, eventually taking\n\n[[Page S14058]]\n\nthe industrial city of Ludwigshafen on March 24. By the beginning of \nApril, they had taken responsibility for containing the west side of \nthe Ruhr pocket along the Rhine River. The 94th ID occupied the Ruhr \nuntil V-E Day.\n  Bernie Rader was discharged from the Army in January 1946. After the \nwar, Bernie became a certified public accountant in his home State of \nNew York. He worked on the New York State Society of Certified Public \nAccountants, NYSSCPA, and served as president of the Nassau County \nChapter in 1986 and 1987. He won the Distinguished Service Award from \nthe NYSSCPA in 1992.\n  In 2004, Bernie presented the citizens of L'Ile de Groix, France, \nwith a plaque to show his gratitude for the aid they provided to his \nfellow soldiers who had been taken prisoner outside of Lorient and held \non the island of Groix under very harsh conditions. He is now working \nto establish a sister city program between L'Ile de Groix and his town \nof Freeport on Long Island.\n  On behalf of my constituents in New York, Mr. President, and indeed \non behalf of all Americans, I wish to congratulate Bernie Rader for his \nselection for the French Legion of Honor. This honor rightly recognizes \nBernie's heroism and steadfastness at a critical time in the history of \nour Nation. I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join \nme today in recognizing and honoring Bernie Rader and his fellow \nLegionnaires for their noble service and their commitment to the \ndefense of democracy and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14058-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           CONGRATULATING WILLIAM PRESCOTT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CASEY. Madam President, today I congratulate William \nPrescott Elementary School, in Scranton, PA, on receiving the \nprestigious Blue Ribbon Schools award from the Department of Education \nfor its outstanding achievement in providing students with a first-rate \neducation.\n  William Prescott Elementary School serves just fewer than 300 \nstudents from the east side of Scranton and is part of the Scranton \nSchool District. Like many schools throughout Scranton and all of \nPennsylvania, William Prescott Elementary School strives to provide the \nbest possible opportunities and to enrich the life of each student. The \nadministration and staff work passionately to provide a comprehensive \ncurriculum inclusive of language arts, lab-based science, computer \neducation, art and music education, English as a second language, \nspecial education, as well as many other courses. For the past 13 \nyears, and particularly during the last 3, the students at William \nPrescott Elementary School have demonstrated steady progress in the \nareas of Reading and Mathematics and have far exceeded Pennsylvania's \nState targets. I am proud to say that the school is truly a model of \neducational excellence.\n  In addition to this, and I believe this is key, the school actively \nworks to involve parents and the community in the learning process. \nThrough partnerships with community organizations such as the Head \nStart Program, the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, and Scranton Area \nFoundation, William Prescott Elementary School demonstrates its \ncommitment to a comprehensive educational program that builds on \npersonal responsibility, accentuates individual respect, and develops a \nlove of learning.\n  Special credit for this achievement belongs to the principal, Mr. \nAlbert P. O'Donnell, and the teachers, for creating a safe and \nchallenging learning environment. During my brief experience as a \nteacher I learned firsthand how much dedication the students, the \nparents, and all involved must exhibit in order to succeed at this \nexceptional level. It is with great pride that I congratulate William \nPrescott Elementary School on this outstanding achievement. I hope that \ntheir dedication and hard work inspires both young students and those \nserving in the field of education alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14058-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMENDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO TEACH FOR AMERICA\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, I wish to recognize the fifth \nanniversary of the Wachovia Championship golf tournament at Quail \nHollow Club in Charlotte.\n  Several years ago, a number of leading North Carolinians gathered to \nbegin the planning for this first-class event. Under the leadership of \nQuail Hollow president Johnny Harris, tournament chairman Mac Everett, \nand executive director Kym Hougham, the Wachovia Championship has \nquickly risen to the top echelon of sporting events in the country.\n  These leaders desired to create a premier sporting event that would \nprovide a first-class experience for patrons, PGA tour players, and \nvolunteers that at the same time would have a significant economic \nimpact for the Carolinas, showcase my State and region to a national \nand international television audience, and most importantly raise \nsignificant funds for charitable interests in the State.\n  The primary beneficiary of the success of the Wachovia Championship \nis Teach for America. Funds generated from the tournament are used to \nsupport the national efforts of this organization.\n  This past year, I circulated a letter that asked appropriators to \nfund the Teach for America program at a $15 million level for this \nfiscal year. Teach for America's goal is to provide students in urban \nand rural low-income areas with highly qualified teachers in order to \neliminate educational inequity. This program is the national corps of \ntop college graduates who commit 2 years to teach in underresourced \npublic schools and become lifelong leaders in the pursuit of \neducational equity. After completing their 2-year commitment, 63 \npercent of the Teach for America alumni continue to work in education. \nSince 1990, nearly 17,000 college graduates have joined Teach for \nAmerica, impacting the lives of over 2.5 million students.\n  I applaud the efforts that Wachovia is making to support this \nprogram. In its first 5 years, the Wachovia Championship has donated \nover $7.5 million to Teach for America and other charities. This year, \nto my understanding, the bank's donation to Teach for America is $1 \nmillion, and their overall contributions to charities have been $1.95 \nmillion.\n  As you can see, this golf tournament has a much bigger impact on the \ncommunity than its direct entertainment and economic impact. Through \nthis golf tournament Wachovia has been able to reach out and affect \noverall society by helping students gain a quality education. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14058-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14058-S14059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR. WILLIAM POTTER\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the awarding \nof the first endowed professorship in the field of nonproliferation \nstudies to my friend, Dr. William Potter. Bill has served as director \nof the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of \nInternational Studies. In that post he has made valuable contributions \nto U.S. policy through detailed analysis of the threat posed by the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, comprehensive program-\nmatic reviews of efforts to address the threat, and training of arms \ncontrol and nonproliferation experts.\n  Bill Potter has an unequaled research and academic record in the \nfield of nonproliferation. He has served as a consultant to the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency and the RAND Corporation. In addition, \nhe has served for a number of years on the United Nations Secretary \nGeneral's Advisory Board on Disarmament Research. He has written or \nedited 14 books and contributed to more than 90 books or journals. He \nhas also made Monterey's quarterly publication, ``The Nonproliferation \nReview,'' the leading journal in the field of nonproliferation.\n  I am honored that Monterey Institute has named Dr. Potter's new \nposition the ``Nunn-Lugar chair of nonproliferation studies.'' In 1991, \nSam Nunn and I believed that our Government had to act to address the \nthreats posed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As political and \nmilitary leaders inched away from Cold War standoffs, the weapons they \nhad developed to threaten and deter each other remained capable of \nkilling the entire American population and rendering our country a \nwasteland.\n\n[[Page S14059]]\n\n  Sam and I worked closely with experts and friends like Bill Potter. \nTogether we understood that a unilateral effort would not succeed and \nchallenged the United States and our former enemies to work together. \nThe United States needed a diplomatic strategy and a programmatic \nresponse to the threat. The Nunn-Lugar program was our answer. The \nprogram succeeded in convincing Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to \nremove all nuclear weapons from their territories. In addition, it \nbecame the primary tool through which the United States continues to \nwork with Russia to destroy its massive nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological warfare capacity.\n  I could relate many stories and experiences I have enjoyed with Bill \nPotter. His patient diplomacy and leadership have made important \ncontributions to U.S. national security and international peace. The \neducation, policy information, and policy expertise he will provide \nthrough his new position to the students at the Monterey Institute will \ncontinue the grand tradition he has established there and ensure that \nhis talents and dedication are continued in a fine academic tradition.\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was and remains the \nNo. 1 national security threat facing the United States and the \ninternational community. We still have a lot of work to do to address \nthe threats posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \nI congratulate the university and Dr. Potter on this important \nannouncement and look forward to continuing my close relationship with \nBill and his colleagues at Monterey as we work together to address the \nthreat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14059-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING PENOBSCOT BAY PORCH SWINGS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I congratulate Penobscot Bay \nPorch Swings of Brunswick, a woman-owned company dedicated to reviving \nthe tradition of porch swings in my home State of Maine.\n  Inspired by the old-fashioned hammock swings she saw along the Maine \ncoast while on a field trip with her daughter, Sarah Bloy began \ncreating the prototype for what would become the widely popular \nPenobscot Bay Porch Swing. After 4 years of planning and a trip to the \nMarine Canvas Training Institute, Ms. Bloy commenced production of her \nporch swings in January 2005. Each swing, which takes between 8 and 10 \nhours to make, is delicately produced in a studio workshop at \nBrunswick's Fort Andross by Ms. Bloy with the assistance of her \ndedicated employee.\n  Penobscot Bay Porch Swings is a successful small business due to Ms. \nBloy's entrepreneurial and innovative spirit. Her company's hand-made \nporch swings are similar to those fashionable at the turn of the 20th \ncentury in Maine and New England, illiciting nostalgia for some and \namazement for many others. Penobscot Bay Porch Swings offers an \nassortment of styles that were named to celebrate Maine's coastal \nheritage. The Bar Harbor, Kennebunkport, and Camden are some of the \nswing styles available. Moreover, the swings' vibrant colors provide a \ncontemporary look to a time-tested design. Choosing between colors, \nsuch as Capri blue and Tuscan orange, Jockey red and Seville Seaside \nstripes, customers have many bright and welcoming options for the color \nof their swing. And each hammock swing is carefully crafted with mildew \nresistant Sunbrella fabric to temper the tough elements of New \nEngland's climate.\n  Ms. Bloy has also created the inventive Castine Cradle, a swing-like \ncrib especially designed for babies and infants. Along with the swings \nand cradles, Ms. Bloy also constructs a plethora of brilliant pillows \nto coordinate with her swings, in even more creative colors like \nBeachfront Balsam and Sandrine Sunset. Her sights are set on expanding \nher business, with the hopes of designing new and more creative \nproducts for her clientele to enjoy for seasons to come.\n  Porch swings and hammocks have long been a staple of east coast life, \nand Ms. Bloy's expertly crafted swings will help to revitalize interest \nin this outstanding tradition. Penobscot Bay Porch exemplifies what a \nsmall business can accomplish with a pioneering and talented Mainer, \nsuch as Sarah Bloy, at the helm. Penobscot Bay Porch Swings has built a \nreputation of meticulous craftsmanship and durability, and I wish Sarah \nand everyone at Penobscot Bay Porch Swings the best of luck as they \ncontinue to thrive and expand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/07/senate-section/article/S14059-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14059-S14060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL WESLEY L.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Intellectual \nProperty Enforcement Act of 2007. Congress is charged ``to promote the \nprogress of science and useful arts,'' and part of promotion is \nprotection. This legislation will enhance existing intellectual \nproperty enforcement laws, provide more resources to combat \ninfringement, and harmonize copyright and trademark laws. I thank \nSenator Cornyn for joining me in this effort, which is a high priority \nof mine, and also of the creative communities and industries across the \ncountry.\n  Each year, counterfeiting and copyright infringement cost the U.S. \neconomy billions of dollars. The International Anti-Counterfeiting \nCoalition estimates that counterfeiting and piracy cost American \nbusinesses $250 billion a year, and hundreds of thousands of jobs as \nwell. Clearly, IP theft is big business, and that can devastate small \nbusinesses. No one knows this better than Vermont companies such as \nHubbardton Forge, Vermont Teddy Bear Company, and Burton Snowboards. \nEach of these companies, and many others like them across the Nation \ninvests time, money, and effort in the development of new products. \nWhen their products are infringed, it devalues the product and \nthreatens the company.\n  Senator Cornyn and I have heard from a myriad of interested parties \nabout the importance of protecting intellectual property, and have seen \nmany enforcement proposals. The legislation we introduce today will \nserve as the core of our legislative effort this year. It will start \nthe process of considering how to ensure that our enforcement laws are \nup to the task, and that the necessary resources are in place to \nenforce them. Other Senators have introduced legislation to address \nthese issues, and the Department of Justice and others have suggested \nlegislative language. These are all helpful to the debate, and I expect \nthere will be more to come. Introduction of the Intellectual Property \nEnforcement Act of 2007 is the beginning of this important effort.\n  The centerpiece of the bill we introduce today gives the Department \nof Justice the ability to bring civil actions against copyright \ninfringers. Punishment should fit the crime, and a civil action is \noften more appropriate to the wrong being done in such cases than is \ncriminal prosecution. This concept has passed the Senate on three \nseparate occasions, as the PIRATE Act. Next, this bill adds resources \nfor agents to combat infringement. It does not matter how strong our \nlaws are, if there are not enough agents, or if our agents do not have \nthe proper expertise to investigate and prosecute crimes, piracy will \nflourish and harm our economy. Third, this bill allows for ``harmless \nerrors'' on copyright registration forms. Copyright registration should \nnot be voided by innocently checking the wrong box or misspelling a \nword on a form. Finally, this bill harmonizes the forfeiture provisions \nin the copyright and trademark statutes.\n  By enacting well-balanced enforcement laws, we can protect both the \ncreators and the consumers of intellectual property. It is impossible \nto put a price tag on creativity, but we must do all we can to protect \nthe fruits of creative labor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2317\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Intellectual Property \n     Enforcement Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide continued entitlement to coverage for immunosuppressive drugs \nfurnished to beneficiaries under the Medicare Program that have \nreceived a kidney transplant and whose entitlement to coverage would \notherwise expire, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Organ transplantation is one of the most \nremarkable success stories in the history of medicine. No longer is it \nconsidered experimental. Today, transplants are accepted as the best \ntreatment for certain diseases, including End Stage Renal Disease. \nApproximately 28,000 organ transplants were performed last year in the \nU.S. The vast majority of transplants are provided to patients in need \nof a kidney.\n  Our Medicare system provides health care to millions of aged and \ndisabled Americans, as well as those living with ESRD, each year. \nThousands of Americans receive a Medicare-covered kidney transplant \neach year through the Medicare ESRD Program, which also covers \ndialysis, immunosuppressive drugs, and other medically important \nservices.\n  Unfortunately, there are long waiting lists for people who need an \norgan. Today there are over 98,000 individuals waiting for a \ntransplant. For those lucky enough to receive one, the next challenge \nis to obtain coverage for immunosuppressive drugs--medications that \norgan transplant recipients must take every day for the life of their \ntransplant to reduce the risk of organ rejection.\n  In 2000, Congress wisely eliminated the 36-month time limitation for \nMedicare-aged and Medicare-disabled beneficiaries who had Medicare \nstatus at the time of transplant. Today, for an older or disabled \nperson on Medicare, coverage for immunosuppressive drugs is covered for \nthe life of the transplant.\n  However, we still have an unfair and unrealistic gap in coverage for \npeople with ESRD who are neither disabled nor elderly. For those \ntransplant recipients, coverage for immunosuppressive drugs ends 36 \nmonths after transplantation. For example, Medicare would pay for a 26-\nyear-old woman\n\n[[Page S14067]]\n\nliving with ESRD to have lifelong dialysis at $50,000 per year. \nMedicare would cover the cost of a transplant for her at $100,000 per \ntransplant operation. But, the immunosuppressive drugs she would need \nto ensure the organ is not rejected by her body are only covered by \nMedicare for 36 months, even though the drugs cost the Government only \n$15,000 per year.\n  This is economically inefficient and morally wrong. Without regular \naccess to immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection, many patients \nfind themselves back in a risky and frightening place--in need of a new \nkidney. This senseless cycle of care costs taxpayers a lot of money and \nputs thousands of lives on the line.\n  I am pleased to introduce today, along with my colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Thad Cochran, the Comprehensive Immunosuppressive \nDrug Coverage for Transplant Patients Act. This legislation would \nalleviate the disparity between coverage for immuno-suppresive drugs \namong Medicare beneficiaries. It is time to provide lifetime coverage \nfor immunosuppressive drugs through Medicare. We will reduce the need \nfor dialysis and kidney re-transplants and provide reliable, sustained \naccess to critically important, life-saving medications for thousands \nof Americans. In the long run, we will save money and lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the International Center Act to authorize \nthe lease or sublease of certain property described in such Act to an \nentity other than a foreign government or international organization if \ncertain conditions are met; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend the \nInternational Center Act to make it clear that Intelsat can continue to \nlease the land on which its headquarters building is located.\n  Congress created Intelsat when it passed the Communications Satellite \nAct in the 1960s, intending it to be an international organization \ncharged with establishing the world's first global satellite system. In \n2000, Congress passed the ORBIT Act, which essentially mandated that \nIntelsat become a private company. The purpose of the ORBIT Act was to \npromote a fully competitive global market for satellite\n\n[[Page S14068]]\n\ncommunication services for the benefit of consumers. Congress \ninadvertently overlooked some important changes that were required to \ncomplete this transformation and, as a result, had to make technical \nchanges to correct these oversights.\n  One technical correction still needs to be made, however: the \nInternational Center Act, ICA, must be amended to ensure that \nIntelsat's lease of the land on which its headquarters is located \ncomports with the law. The U.S. Government owns this land. The State \nDepartment and Intelsat entered into a long-term lease for the land on \nwhich Intelsat built its headquarters many years ago. Intelsat \nconstructed and fully owns the building. The lease was originally \nentered into pursuant to the ICA and has been amended several times \nover the years, most recently in 2006. The ICA, however, limits leases \nof this property to foreign governments and international \norganizations. At the time Intelsat leased the property and built its \nheadquarters building, it was an international organization.\n  When Congress mandated in the ORBIT Act that Intelsat privatize, it \ncreated a problem regarding Intelsat's land lease. Once Intelsat was no \nlonger an international organization, it technically no longer \nsatisfied the requirements of the ICA. In other words, Congress' action \nrequiring Intelsat to privatize has left the company's right to \ncontinue to lease the land in question. But it was never the intent of \nthe ORBIT Act to create this uncertainty with respect to the legality \nof Intelsat's land lease.\n  The bill I am introducing amends the ICA to eliminate this \nuncertainty that the ORBIT Act created regarding the lease. It is \nnecessary to ensure that the now privatized Intelsat can continue to \nlease the land. My bill would in no way alter the rights or obligations \nof the parties or any of the lease terms or conditions. It in no way \nexpands any of Intelsat's rights under the existing lease. Nor does it \nchange in any way the rights or powers that the State Department \ncurrently has under the lease. The Secretary of State will continue to \nhave the same right to prohibit any use, development, occupancy, lease, \nor sublease as is currently authorized under the existing lease. My \nbill makes no substantive change in the relationship between the State \nDepartment and Intelsat. It merely eliminates the inconsistency between \nthe lease and the ICA that was caused by Intelsat's privatization--\nwhich Congress required when it passed the ORBIT Act.\n  The State Department has approved this legislation to amend the ICA. \nI hope my colleagues will support the bill, too, and act on it \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2322\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
