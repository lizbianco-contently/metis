Mr. President, we are going to do the farm bill today. I \nhave gotten a number of inquiries about why did we stop the farm bill \nfrom going forward when we did. At the time that occurred, we had 26 \npending amendments. Christmas is 1 week from Tuesday. We have to finish \nour work. We have, even today, a heavy burden having to short circuit \nthis a little bit.\n  We have the Defense authorization bill; that is something that is \nessential. In that Defense authorization bill are many things, not the \nleast of which is the wounded warrior aspect of it that Patty Murray \nworked so hard on.\n  We have the pay raise for the troops. The troops cannot get the pay \nraise until we do the Defense authorization bill, even though we have \nsent to the President and he has signed the Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  We are going to come in probably at 11 o'clock on Monday. There will \nbe a cloture vote an hour after that on FISA. People have said: Well, \nwhy did you not move? I have gotten some inquiries, especially from \nsome of the blogs saying: Why did you not rule XIV it or something that \nwould make it easier and allow people who do not like the bill to make \ntheir position known?\n  I have stated on the floor--this is the third time--the reason we are \ngoing to cloture is because Senators Feingold and Dodd want a 60-vote \nmargin on proceeding to the bill.\n  One of the things I have worked very hard to do in the 3 years I have \nbeen Democratic leader, the 1 year I have been the majority leader, is \nto make sure the committee structure of the Senate is sound and the \ncommittee chairs and the committees do their work.\n  It brings stability to this body. Now, I think what we have to do in \nregular order, unless I try to short circuit this in some way--and I \nthink it would be not looked upon favorably by the Senate and, frankly, \nby the American people if I tried to short circuit this. We have a \nprocedure--it does not happen very often--where you have a joint \nreferral. In this instance, on the FISA bill, the controversial but \nimportant FISA bill, there are two committees that have jurisdiction, \nthe Intelligence Committee, and after that it is referred to the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  They both have done their work and they have done good work. But what \nsome wanted me to do is take the best out of one and the best out of \nthe other and bring it to the floor. I cannot do that unless I trample \nthe system.\n  Under regular order, I will bring the Intelligence bill to the floor. \nThe first operative action after that is the Judiciary Committee. \nSenator Leahy is an experienced, veteran legislator. He has been here \nlonger than I have been here. He certainly knows what to do. The Senate \nwill work its will as to what needs to be done with FISA.\n\n  I will guarantee you right now one thing that is going to occur: not \neveryone will be happy. But people have the obligation to do what they \nthink is right, and I have an obligation to move the bill to the floor. \nIt is important we have a debate, and that debate will start on Monday.\n  I also am concerned that not everyone is happy they did not have the \nopportunity to offer their farm bill amendments. That is always a \nproblem, and certainly there were no individual Senators in mind, \nDemocrats or Republicans, who did not have the opportunity to offer \ntheir amendments.\n  But the culminating factor is when we had an objection to the \nmanagers' amendment, with the 26 amendments we had to start dealing \nwith at 8:30 last night, we could not get from here to there.\n  So I think we are doing the right thing this morning, moving forward \nto completing FHA today, the farm bill, and Defense authorization; \nstarting on the important FISA bill on Monday and then doing everything \nwithin our power to fund the Government for the next year. And we are \ngoing to have a debate on war funding. That will take place next week.\n  So we have our hands full. But I wanted to lay out everything this \nmorning, where we are headed and why we are in the position we are in \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15580-7", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It was time to bring \nit to conclusion. So I applaud the majority leader for his decision. I \nthink it was the right thing to do.\n  Secondly, we do have a chance to get additional progress this morning \nwith the FHA matter. There is also the Defense authorization bill. I \nthink we are making good progress this week, and the majority leader \nwill have some excellent cooperation on this side of the aisle in that \ndirection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15580-9", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15580-S15598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FHA MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of S. 2338, which the clerk \nwill report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2338) to modernize and update the National \n     Housing Act and enable the Federal Housing Administration to \n     more effectively reach underserved borrowers, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n[[Page S15581]]\n\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the status \nof the time situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 30 minutes of general \ndebate on the bill, equally divided.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over the past few months, as the subprime \ncrisis has deepened, I have said time and time again we need to act to \nhelp millions of American families at the risk of foreclosure to save \ntheir homes.\n  Until now, we have been blocked in those efforts, which is \nunfortunate. But I do wish to thank my colleague from Oklahoma who, as \nalways, has agreed to this debate, to a discussion of the issue on the \nmerits. He wanted a careful look, wanted his voice heard but did not \nwant to be dilatory for its own sake, and I very much appreciate that. \nNow I believe we can move this important legislation forward.\n  The word ``crisis'' gets tossed around a lot in Washington. But make \nno mistake about it, we are in one. Almost a million Americans have \nlost their homes due to foreclosure this year alone. It seems each week \nforeclosures reach a new alltime high.\n  Some people stand by and say: Do nothing. The administration has \nsaid: Well, let the market take care of this by itself. They have come \nup with various plans where they sort of tie themselves in a pretzel to \navoid any Government involvement.\n  But the fact is, if we are going to solve this problem, one thing we \ndo not need is a bailout, but what we need is rational, smart \nGovernment involvement to help those at the bottom work their way out \nof this crisis which will, in a certain sense, trickle up and reassure \nthe credit markets that things are being done and help the entire \neconomy, because we have a triple whammy in this crisis that spreads \noutward. First are the more than 2 million homes that could be \nforeclosed upon in the next year and a half, 2 years. Second are \ndeclining housing prices. Because even if you paid your mortgage \ncompletely or have never missed a payment and are still paying it, if \nthere are foreclosures in your community or foreclosures even in the \ncountry, housing prices decline.\n  That hurts all of us and hurts the economy then, in the third level, \nin two ways. One, there is a dampening effect on consumer spending, \nand, two, there are the credit markets, which are right now frozen.\n  If people cannot borrow, whether they be companies or individuals, it \nputs a real damper on the economy. The only way out of this is smart \nGovernment involvement--not solely. We need the private sector. But \nwhen the administration says they are never, ever going to get the \nGovernment involved, they have ideological blinders on, they are in an \nideological straitjacket, they hurt those who will be foreclosed, they \nhurt all homeowners, and they hurt the general economy.\n\n  If you talk to people in this country, even conservative Republican \nbusiness leaders agree we need some careful, rational Government \ninvolvement, not a bailout. That is what we are trying to do this \nmorning. The costs of inaction are high. The Joint Economic Committee \nestimated the spillover from the subprime foreclosure crisis could \nexceed $100 billion for homeowners, their neighbors, and the local tax \nbase.\n  On top of the subprime losses, the continuing housing slump could be \na massive blow to the economy. Economists estimate a 10-percent decline \nin housing prices could lead to a $2.3 trillion economic loss at a time \nwhen our country cannot afford it.\n  This legislation is the perfect example of the kind of help Americans \nare looking for. It is moderate, it is thoughtful, and it is directed \nat the problem.\n  First, I wish to thank the two sponsors of this legislation, Senator \nDodd and Senator Shelby, as well as my colleagues on the Banking \nCommittee, where this passed 20 to 1, for their support.\n  It is definitely and desperately needed. It has the support of the \nadministration, one of the few areas where the administration has \nlooked at some kind of moderate Government help. The FHA Modernization \nAct revitalizes an important Government agency that for years, until \nthe rise of unscrupulous subprime lenders, helped thousands of families \nacross the country achieve the American dream, and now in these \ntroubled times, it can be a source of salvation for those families who \nwere tricked into unaffordable loans.\n  The bill makes a number of important changes to the FHA program, many \nof which will make it more competitive with subprime lenders, assure \nits financial help, and protect borrowers who were taken advantage of.\n  First, and especially in high-cost States such as mine in New York \nand my colleague across the river in New Jersey, who will speak shortly \non this measure, this is vital. For years, this program has been hard \nto use in our home State. When you go to a place such as Long Island, \nwhere the average home price is over $400,000, more than half the \npopulation cannot use FHA. That was never the intent.\n  The bill also allows FHA to accept lower downpayments. It makes it \nmore attractive to borrowers who could otherwise turn to an \nirresponsible subprime broker for their loan.\n  This does entail some additional risk, but the legislation strikes a \nsafe, responsible balance between increasing FHA's competitiveness with \nthose lenders without endangering the program's bottom line.\n  Finally, the bill expands the eligibility for counseling under the \nFHA program.\n  We desperately need counselors. There is another piece of legislation \nstill being blocked by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nsponsored by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, and the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Brown, and myself, aided by the help of Senator Murray, \nwhich will put $200 million into counseling. That is being blocked.\n  This bill at least will allow the FHA to give counseling to a certain \nnumber of people. It is an improvement that not only helps borrowers by \nletting more of them preserve their homes, but it reduces losses to the \ninsurance funds, which is good for taxpayers as well.\n  This bill is not a panacea. It is, frankly, a small step--much needed \nbut a small step. There are many more things that have to be done: \nMoney for those who need help in counseling; making sure there is \ncredit for mortgages available, which involves using the agencies, the \nGSEs such as Fannie and Freddie. Congressman Frank and I have \nlegislation to deal with that. We also need a protector for the future. \nLegislation Senator Dodd has offered and I have cosponsored and worked \nwith him on for many months would actually prevent this from happening \nin the future by regulating the small group of mortgage brokers who are \nunscrupulous, as well as the mortgage lenders, almost all of them \nnonbanks.\n  We still have a long way to go, but my hope is, given the magnitude \nof the crisis, that this first step will not be the last and that this \nfirst step represents a coming together of those who are not \nideologues, those of us who say, yes, the Government needs to be \ninvolved in a smart, careful, and focused way. If that can happen, we \ncannot solve the subprime crisis, make it go away, but we can greatly \nmitigate the damage that occurs. We can reassure the markets finally \nthat someone is in charge. The administration is trying to be involved \nbut because of the ideological handcuffs, no Government involvement, \nand some of their plans get laughed at, and many of their plans are not \ntaken seriously--just about all of them--because they won't deal with \nthe magnitude of the crisis. You have to deal with it head-on.\n  I am hopeful this is a good first step that will pave the way to \nother larger and even more necessary steps. I thank Senator Dodd, \nSenator Shelby, Senator Coburn, and my colleagues on the Banking \nCommittee for their active support and guidance with this legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, may I learn the current time agreement?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York has\n\n[[Page S15582]]\n\n15 minutes, with 6 minutes remaining. The Senator from Florida has 15 \nminutes, if he is controlling the time.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I join with the Senator from New York in speaking \nabout this important step we are taking to deal with a serious crisis \nthat America and, frankly, the world is facing with credit. It is \nparticularly important that we think about the many Americans who today \nfeel threatened in their homes as they face the potential prospect of \nlosing their homes because of the current situation. We have a partial \nanswer to this large problem. It isn't the whole answer, but it is a \nvery good first step. It is an important first step that is going to \nhelp a number of families stay in their homes.\n  When I had the privilege of serving as Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, one of the hallmarks of our time was the attempt to put \nmore and more American families into home ownership. It is the \nculmination of the American dream. That dream today is seriously \nthreatened. The FHA Modernization Act before the Senate is a strong \nfirst step in the direction of fixing the problem.\n  By the summer of 2010, about 600,000 people with subprime loans are \nexpected to lose their homes because they will not be able to make \ntheir higher monthly payment. These are people who got into an \nadjustable rate mortgage, and each and every year or perhaps two or \nthree times a year that mortgage resets at a higher payment and a \nhigher rate. The way to avert that is to allow these folks to find \nanother financing vehicle, and the FHA is the answer.\n  HUD estimates that more than 200,000 first-time home buyers and \ncurrent homeowners who need access to capital could obtain FHA-insured \nmortgages next year if Congress expedites passage of this legislation. \nThat, combined with the administration's FHA Secure Program, will help \nmore than a quarter million Americans avoid foreclosure and stay in \ntheir homes. The administration already has implemented a program \ncalled HOPE Now. That also is helping about 80,000 Americans to remain \nin their homes.\n  The fact is, this is a timely piece of legislation, one that enjoys \nbipartisan support and one in keeping with the wonderful tradition the \nFHA has had in the home-ownership story of America.\n  FHA began in 1934. Since that time, it has always operated in the \nblack by collecting insurance premiums on the mortgages it insures and \nnever burdening the taxpayers with any Government subsidy, and it has \nmanaged to help countless millions of Americans reach the dream of that \nfirst home.\n  While I was HUD Secretary, we recognized that FHA was falling behind \nin market share because it had not been modernized. The rules had not \nbeen keeping up with changes in the marketplace. This is a tremendous \nfirst step. It is a step that is long overdue and one I am proud to see \ncome about.\n  I know some have concerns about the issue of reverse mortgages. I \nbelieve that is an issue which also falls well within the purview of \nFHA and can be safely done, well managed, and, in fact, should not be \nan impediment to this legislation moving forward.\n  I don't want to take any more of the time. I believe it is very \nimportant that, working together, all of us will move this bill to \nfruition, helping hundreds of thousands of American families who have \ntasted the dream of home ownership to maintain the dream, stay in their \nhomes, and work through the FHA program so they can then refinance \ntheir mortgages into mortgages they can live with.\n  I thank Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby and others on the \nBanking Committee who have worked so hard to make this moment a \nreality. I am proud of any role I might have played in it because I \nthink it is truly touching at the heart of where so many American \nfamilies are today. They have had the dream of home ownership. Let's \nkeep more and more American families in their homes, continuing that \ndream.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like the record to reflect \nthat I would have voted in favor of the FHA Modernization Act today.\n  California has been at the epicenter of the current foreclosure \ncrisis, and this bill will provide new, safe, and secure financing \nopportunities both for homeowners currently trapped in abusive loans \nthat are scheduled to reset at rates they no longer can afford, as well \nas for future borrowers seeking alternatives to the risky and exotic \nloans that many turned to or were steered toward in the absence of a \nviable FHA product.\n  Among its most important features, the bill would raise the current \nlimit on loans the FHA will insure from $362,000 to $417,000. In \nCalifornia, where the third quarter median home price was over \n$568,000, the ability to access FHA loans has virtually disappeared. \nAccording to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nCalifornia, which previously led the Nation in FHA loan usage, has seen \nits FHA loan volume drop from 109,074 in 2001 to just 2,599 in 2006, a \ndecline of 98 percent and a loss of $13.6 billion.\n  While the increase in the loan limit provided by this bill will \nprovide welcome relief, the House version goes even farther, permitting \nthe FHA to insure mortgages equal to 125 percent of the median area \nhome price or 175 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit, \nwhichever is lower. The House bill also would give the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development the authority to raise the new insurance \nlimit by as much as $100,000 ``if market conditions warrant.'' For \nCalifornia and other high cost areas, this increase would further \nenable borrowers to avoid the type of nontraditional and frequently \nabusive loans that have gotten us into our current mess, and I will be \nurging conferees to support the higher limits.\n  Today, however, it is important to recognize the significant step \nthat the Senate has taken in overwhelmingly passing this bill as we \nseek to restore stability to the housing market and bring assistance to \nthe more than 2 million Americans at risk of losing their \nhomes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate \noverwhelmingly passed the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, \nModernization Act today. This bill would make much-needed improvements \nto this important program to give more homebuyers the option to get a \nFHA government-backed loan instead of the more risky products that have \ncontributed to the current mortgage crisis.\n  The FHA program is critical to insuring home mortgages for low and \nmiddle income borrowers that are unable to obtain financing from \nconventional mortgage lenders. However, over the past decade, FHA has \nbeen priced out of the market.\n  In California alone, FHA loans have dropped from 109,074 in 2000 to \njust 2,599 in 2006--resulting in a decline of 98 percent in 6 years.\n  Furthermore, the current crisis in the subprime lending market has \nput more than 500,000 American homeowners into foreclosure this year.\n  My State of California has been especially hit hard.\n  More than 50,000 California homes went into foreclosure in just the \nmonth of October. This equates to one foreclosure filing for every 258 \nhouseholds in the state--about double the national foreclosure rate.\n  The bill passed by the Senate today takes an important step to help \nAmerican families who face the threat of losing their homes and those \nwho want to buy a new home with a safe and affordable mortgage--it \nmodernizes the FHA program and expands the financing options available \nto homebuyers.\n  Specifically, this bill would:\n  Increase the maximum size of mortgages that FHA can insure in \nexpensive housing areas to $417,000 from the current level of $362,790.\n  This increase in the loan limit is a step in the right direction, but \nmore needs to be done. It is my hope that the final bill signed by the \nPresident further increases the loan limit to over $500,000, as \nincluded in the House-passed version of the FHA bill.\n  This is essential so that more homebuyers in states like California, \nwhere the average cost of a home is over $490,000, can be helped.\n  Reduce the downpayment requirement to 1.5 percent from the current \nrequirement of 3 percent under the FHA program--allowing FHA to compete \nwith subprime lenders.\n\n[[Page S15583]]\n\n  Require the secretary of the Housing and Urban Development, HUD, and \nthe FHA Commissioner to work with the mortgage industry and non-profit \norganizations to improve the FHA loss mitigation process so more \ntroubled homeowners can keep their homes.\n  Increase consumer protections by requiring the secretary of HUD to \nprohibit unfair or deceptive practices that may be used with FHA-\ninsured manufactured housing loans.\n  Improve housing counseling assistance by creating a pre-purchase \ncounseling pilot program to test the effectiveness of various \ncounseling options.\n  It also expands the eligibility for post-purchase counseling for low \nand moderate income homeowners who are having trouble making their \nmortgage payments.\n  It is crucial that we help make homeownership more affordable and \naccessible to American families and provide relief to those facing the \nthreat of losing their homes.\n  The Senate's approval of this legislation today is an important step \nto help achieve this.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3853\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, under the order governing this bill, I \ncall up the Dodd-Shelby amendment and ask unanimous consent that it be \nadopted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for Mr. Dodd and \n     Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 3853.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a 12-month moratorium on the implementation of \n             risk-based premiums for FHA insured mortgages)\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 123. MORATORIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK-BASED \n                   PREMIUMS.\n\n       For the 12-month period beginning on the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     shall not enact, execute, or take any action to make \n     effective the planned implementation of risk-based premiums, \n     which are designed for mortgage lenders to offer borrowers an \n     FHA-insured product that provides a range of mortgage \n     insurance premium pricing, based on the risk the insurance \n     contract represents, as such planned implementation was set \n     forth in the Notice published in the Federal Register on \n     September 20, 2007 (Vol. 72, No. 182, Page 53872).\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3853) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from New \nJersey, a member of the Banking Committee who has worked long and hard \non the subprime issue.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNew York for his leadership, along with the chairman of the full \ncommittee and the ranking member, on this issue of the FHA. It is \nsomething I have been advocating for quite some time.\n  In March of this year, at some of the first hearings of the Banking \nCommittee about what we were envisioning as it related to the subprime \ncrisis, I said that we were going to be facing a tsunami of \nforeclosures. Some people said that was an overestimation. \nUnfortunately, we have not even seen the full effect of that tsunami as \nwe have hundreds of thousands of mortgages reset every quarter for the \nnext 2 years, and at the rate of default and foreclosures, the numbers \nwill grow dramatically. Of course, that has a consequence to all of \nthose American families for which the American dream becomes the \nAmerican nightmare. It has a consequence to neighborhoods and \ncommunities where those properties, if they go into foreclosure, have a \nnegative effect on the values of the adjoining properties and, \nobviously, on those communities as it relates to the consequence of \nproperty values that continue to take a nosedive. Therefore, it has an \nenormous impact on the lives of people across our country. It also has \na very significant impact as it relates to the economy of our Nation.\n  I am glad, working in the committee, that we are here today to pass \nthis important bill, the FHA Modernization Act. We clearly need to pass \nFHA reform.\n  I spoke then about the need to raise the FHA loan limits in order to \ngive borrowers more options. In my State of New Jersey, which is not \nunique, 13 of the 21 counties are at or over the FHA ceiling of \n$362,000, and 75 percent of New Jerseyans live in these 13 counties. \nUnless this bill passes, the FHA means absolutely nothing for the \noverwhelming part of the 9 million people who live in New Jersey as a \nvehicle, an opportunity to achieve home ownership and to be good \nborrowers, people who work hard, obey the rules, follow the law, serve \nin their communities, worship, but ultimately would not have the \nwherewithal to pay but for the type of loans the FHA can guarantee.\n  I believe, in the wake of the tsunami of foreclosures, these are \ncritical options to new homeowners and maybe even to some who will \nultimately refinance. The legislation before us today will bring more \nattractive FHA mortgages into the subprime marketplace so borrowers \nlooking to refinance or first-time homeowners have a realistic \nopportunity to choose an FHA loan instead of a risky mortgage.\n  I knew then what I know now. This legislation is long overdue. \nHomeowners need more options than just the subprime market. That is why \nI am pleased we will be finally passing this critical bill. I hope we \ngive it a very strong sendoff from the Senate. I know this is something \nfor which we are in agreement with the administration. It should \nreceive broad bipartisan support. It is only one of many tools \nnecessary to deal with the challenges the Nation faces on the subprime \nand the crisis of foreclosures, but it is an important one.\n  I urge its passage and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I support this FHA initiative. As the \nSenator from New Jersey so appropriately noted, this is another tool \nwhich is absolutely critical in this area, as is an amendment which I \nhave pending to the farm bill which, regrettably, as a result of last \nnight's cloture motion, will be ruled nongermane and therefore will not \nbe allowed to be brought up. This amendment says essentially that if a \nperson's home is foreclosed on, they don't then get hit with an IRS tax \nlien for the amount of the foreclosure which is not recovered. In other \nwords, if you own a home and, regrettably, you can't meet your payments \nbecause of a subprime event, and your loan was, say, $100,000, and they \nforeclose, take it away from you, and then they sell your home but they \ndon't get $100,000--let's say they get $50,000 of that loan paid--you \nget hit with a tax bill for the additional $50,000. Or if there is a \nrestructuring, where the lenders actually rewrite your loan so you can \nmake your payments, and that represents a writedown in the value of the \nloan, you get hit with a tax bill.\n\n  So the irony of the event is, it is pretty devastating to people. \nFirst, their home gets taken. Then the IRS agent shows up and gives \nthem a tax bill and hits them with a tax lien. That, obviously, is not \nfair, and it is not appropriate. It is a quirk of our Internal Revenue \nlaw. This amendment would eliminate that. It would eliminate that \nevent.\n  I do think it is important. I think it is an important element of \nmoving forward in a way that tries to work us through this subprime \nmeltdown which is having a deleterious effect on our economy and, \nobviously, is having a very tremendous personal impact on people who \nare affected by the interest rates on their loans jumping to a point \nwhere they can no longer pay them.\n  So I regret this amendment was ruled out of order for all intents and \npurposes by the cloture motion. I believe there was very strong \nbipartisan support. In fact, I have not met anybody so far who is \nopposed to this concept. I hope it can be included in a final package, \neither under unanimous consent or because nobody objects to it, or, \nalternatively, that the Finance Committee,\n\n[[Page S15584]]\n\nwhich I know is working on this issue, can come forward and offer a \nunanimous consent request to move this free standing.\n  I think it is important we do it now. I do not think we can wait. \nThese loans are being foreclosed on now. The people who are getting hit \nwith these tax liens are getting these liens today. So it is very \nimportant we move promptly.\n  So I wished to highlight this issue also as one of the issues which \nis raised relative to resolving this question or at least mitigating \nthe question of how we deal with this subprime meltdown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida has 7 \nminutes 14 seconds; the Senator from New York has 1 minute 28 seconds \nremaining.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to my \ncolleague and friend--our majority whip--from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, our \nremaining time on this and then 5 minutes from the time against the \nCoburn amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, from our side I would like to yield to \nSenator Isakson from Georgia 5 minutes of the remaining 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I will defer to the Senator \nfrom Georgia if he wants to speak at this moment.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will be happy to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to commend the authors of this \nlegislation on what they have done. This is an outstanding piece of \nwork. I spent 33 years of my life in the single family housing \nbusiness. When I got started in 1967, I cut my teeth selling houses on \nFHA and VA loans. For all those years--and it has now been 40 years--\nthe FHA and VA have served the United States of America well.\n  The first thing the American public needs to understand is the \ncurrent mortgage crisis in America is not an FHA problem, from a \nstandpoint of poor underwriting or poor loans. FHA does a good job of \nunderwriting, a good job of servicing, a good job of appraising. They \nhave good standards.\n  The subprime market problem is an irresponsible lending practice in \nthe conventional market, particularly when it comes to the \nunderwriting. However, because that crisis does exist, FHA is going to \nbe looked to as the savior in many cases. As conventional capital \nrestricts and credit is reduced, it is going to be more important than \never for the FHA to be able to meet those demands.\n  But during the deliberations of this and during the writing of this \nbill, Senator Shelby and Senator Dodd did some great things the \nAmerican public needs to understand. They realized one of the problems \nin the subprime markets was they were starting to make 100 percent \nloans--interest only--for 3 or 4 years, with a bullet at the end.\n  This bill specifically ensures that every FHA loan, every FHA loan \nthat is made will have at least a downpayment of 1.5 percent. So there \nis not going to be any 100 percent lending. You will have some skin in \nthe game.\n  Statistically, you always know in the housing business when a \nborrower has to put equity in a house, it is an insurance policy that \nloan is going to be paid. That is the insurance that ensures FHA they \nhave a very low risk on the taxpayers' money.\n\n  Secondly, this recognizes the rising values in America and raises the \ncap on the amount of an FHA loan that can be made. This is going to \nallow FHA to meet a lot of demand that is going to be created by \nfailures in the subprime market.\n  Another point on the subprime market is, FHA loans have not ever \nbeen, nor are they now, subprime loans. They are intended to be loans \nfor those entering the housing system of the United States of America.\n  My dear friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, is going to offer an \namendment later on which I will comment on for a second. He and I have \nhad some discussions on it.\n  There is a section of the bill that deals with what is known as \nreverse mortgages, and probably most people in here would not know what \nthat is. But basically that means, if you pay for your house and you \nget in your senior years and you want to draw on the equity and value \nof that house, then you can take out a mortgage against your house, and \ninstead of making payments every month to pay it off, you receive \npayments every month up to a percentage of the appraised value of the \nproperty.\n  So for people reaching their latter years or their senior years, who \nneed to be able to supplement their income to exist, they can use the \nequity in that house to continue to have an income and a cash flow.\n  FHA can make that loan and insure it. So can the conventional \nmarkets. The question the Senator from Oklahoma has is whether the FHA \nshould raise the limit on the number of those loans it makes, which is \nat $275,000 right now. Talking to FHA, they are at that cap.\n  There is a provision in the bill that calls on CBO to make a study to \ndetermine what that cap should be. But in the meantime, we should not \nbe capping the number of loans. So the bill is appropriate to raise the \ncap, and it is appropriate to call for the study. I reluctantly oppose \nthe amendment, but I do so mainly because I wish to ensure every \nAmerican senior who has paid for their home, who has it mortgage free, \nhas the opportunity to leverage that home to have income in their later \nyears, safe and secure by the underwriting process of the FHA.\n  But I conclude with the way I began: This is a great bill for the \nUnited States of America. It is not a reaction to bad practices on the \npart of FHA, but it is a reaction to say that because of our good \npractices, because of the capital that is available because of FHA, it \nis important for us to recognize the demand that will come to us as a \nbyproduct of the subprime market.\n  I commend Senator Crapo, Senator Shelby, Senator Dodd, Senator \nSchumer, and all those who have worked on it, and I commend it to my \ncolleagues for a favorable vote.\n  I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my colleague, \nSenator Schumer from New York, for his leadership on this issue and \nSenator Martinez of Florida and Senator Carper, who played an important \nrole in making certain this bill came to the floor. It is timely. It is \nimportant.\n  Back the late 1920s, the United States faced an overwhelming housing \ncrisis. The values of homes were plummeting, and the availability of \ncredit to buy homes was in jeopardy. At that time, President Franklin \nRoosevelt and others stepped in, in 1932 and beyond, to make a massive \ncommitment to restoring the American dream for thousands, if not \nmillions, of American families.\n  One of the means by which it was restored was the creation of the \nFederal Housing Administration. This Government agency stepped into the \nprocess of mortgages and said: We will provide backing and guarantee \nand assurance it is safe to buy a home, and it is safe to loan the \nmoney.\n  That started to restore the confidence of the American consumers in \nour housing market--a confidence which led to the dramatic expansion of \nhome ownership in America, the expansion of personal wealth, as \nfamilies invested in their homes and saw their assets grow, and then \nthe investment of the growth of America's communities, neighborhoods, \nand towns. It is part of the American dream.\n  Not a single one of us will forget the first home we ever purchased. \nMoving from being a renter to a homeowner is a watershed in anyone's \nlife. Your feeling about where you live and what you want to put into \nwhere you live changes when you become a homeowner.\n  Now we are involved in another housing crisis. It is a crisis which \nmany\n\n[[Page S15585]]\n\nwant to minimize. But they should not. The fact that 2.2 million \nAmericans face foreclosure is not just your neighbor's misfortune, it \nis a misfortune for your neighborhood. It is a misfortune for our \nNation.\n  That is why this bill is so important. We are trying to find ways to \nbring that same type of confidence and liquidity back into the housing \nmarket. That is why this bill is timely and should be passed on an \nemergency basis.\n  When the Federal Housing Administration, the FHA, steps up and \nincreases the loan limits, it means it is a realistic appraisal of \ntoday's housing market, so they are relevant to the needs of average \nfamilies who pay higher costs now for housing than they did a few years \nago. When we reduce the downpayments, it means some families will have \ntheir chance to move into a home even earlier in their earning years, \nrather than waiting and renting and perhaps missing that opportunity.\n  I am heartened by the fact that this bill includes counseling--not \nonly counseling for the purchase of a home but counseling when a family \nis troubled and worried about whether they can continue to make their \nmortgage payments.\n  All of these are moves in the right direction. I can tell you many \nthink this housing crisis is an isolated crisis in America. It is not. \nMr. President, 2.2 million foreclosures will lead to the reduction in \nvalue of 44 million single family residences, condos, and other units \nof home ownership. Forty-four million homes will lose value because of \nforeclosures. I have seen it on the West Side of Chicago, where \ngentrificaton and modernization have taken neighborhoods that were \nnothing more than vacant lots and turned them into town homes and row \nhouses that are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now one of the \nhouses on the block is boarded up, facing foreclosure and an auction, \nrealizing at the auction the asking price is likely to be at least 20 \npercent to 30 percent lower than the value that was originally assessed \non the home. That means every home in the neighborhood takes a hit.\n\n  What does it mean when 44 million homes lose value in America? It \nmeans 1 out of 3 homeowners in America will see a decline in the value \nof their home. It is not just the house you are living in, it is also \nthe most important asset in most family's lives. That is why this bill \nis needed. That is why we need to move forward as quickly as possible.\n  Let me say, even with this bill, even with Secretary Paulson's \nproposal 2 weeks ago, these are modest steps that need to be built \nupon. It is not enough. It is good. I want to see it move. It is \nimportant. We need to do more. This housing crisis has become an \neconomic crisis in America, and we need to face it squarely. Franklin \nRoosevelt did in the 1930s. We need to do that today.\n  Let me add a word too. I want to change the bankruptcy law so a \nfamily facing foreclosure, going into bankruptcy, has one last chance \nin the bankruptcy court to renegotiate the terms of their mortgage. You \ncan do that today if you take a vacation home into your bankruptcy or \nyour family farm into a bankruptcy. But the law prohibits the \nrenegotiation of the terms of your mortgage for your principal \nresidence. That makes no sense whatsoever. A foreclosure can cost the \nparties involved up to $50,000. The ultimate sale of the home, after \nforeclosure, can bring maybe 70 percent or 80 percent of the actual \nvalue of the home. Now what we need to do is look at a comprehensive \napproach to deal with the housing crisis which threatens our economy.\n  I urge strong support for this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, could I inquire as to the remaining \ntime?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 3 minutes remaining for \ngeneral debate on the bill on the Republican side.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes on the bill itself \nfrom the time remaining to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \nyielding me the time. I will make my comments very briefly.\n  First of all, I rise in support of this FHA reform package. I do not \nthink this is the time for us to take choices away from homeowners and \nconsumers. This helps provide additional choices for homeowners with \nsome safeguards.\n  The FHA reverse mortgage program contains some important safeguards \nfor borrowers such as mandatory counseling and limits on fees that can \nbe charged. For those very rare instances in which reverse mortgages \nwere used as part of a predatory or fraudulent scheme, I support \nvigorous enforcement against the perpetrators. The problem is with the \nperpetrators, not with the reverse mortgage program.\n  The bill also provides some provisions restricting seller-financed \nhome equity plans. There are some provisions which I think are good. \nThere are provisions for the energy efficiency mortgages. I am cochair \non the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Caucus, and I want to seek every \nopportunity we can to have structures that promote energy efficiency. I \nthink that is a good part of the bill. I thank Chairman Dodd and \nSenator Shelby, as well as Senator Martinez and Senator Schumer, for \ntheir work on this bill. I am pleased this reform package also includes \ntitle I manufactured housing, which is something I have worked on with \nSenator Bayh.\n\n  So there are some important reforms to be offered on this bill, and I \nthink they are offering opportunities for affordable home ownership. So \nI am rising in support of this particular piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, with the remaining time, I simply wanted \nto say I think it is wonderful when we come together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to tackle one of America's problems. The subprime crisis, \nthe loss of home ownership by so many American families, the threat of \nit, is particularly an acute problem at this time in our history. It is \ngood that in this season of Christmas we have made a downpayment on \nthis problem. The Government will not be able to fix all of the \nproblems out there in the credit community; however, this is a good \nstep, a good first step, and a good bipartisan step.\n  Senator Shelby, the ranking member of the subcommittee, has played an \nintegral part of us getting to this point today, and I thank him.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in urging passage of \nS. 2338, the FHA Modernization Act of 2007.\n  The Banking Committee has invested a considerable amount of effort \nand time to reach agreement on this bill.\n  Legislating can be a difficult process that requires not only \npatience but also a willingness to compromise. The Banking Committee \nhas been able to compromise in a way that achieves a balanced bill.\n  The bill makes the necessary changes to the FHA program so that it \ncan meet the needs of today's mortgage marketplace. The bill also \nprovides protections for the American taxpayer who ultimately bears the \nfinancial risks of the program.\n  The end of a legislative session on the eve of an election year can \nbe a very difficult time to reach consensus on just about anything. \nWhen we are able to come together, it is incumbent upon us to seize \nthat opportunity and move forward.\n  With that in mind, I commend Chairman Dodd's efforts to craft a \nbipartisan bill and I encourage all my colleagues, on both sides of the \nHill, to support final passage of S. 2338 as passed by the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time for general debate has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3854\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3854 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3854.\n\n\n[[Page S15586]]\n\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3854\n\n(Purpose: To ensure the cap on Home Equity Conversion Mortgages is not \n   permanently eliminated before a study regarding program costs and \n                   credits is submitted to Congress)\n\n       On page 20, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       (e) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection \n     (a)(2)(A) shall not take effect until the study and report \n     required under subsection (d) has been submitted to Congress.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I don't disagree we have to take action to \nhelp those people who are in a bind now based on both the economics, as \nwell as probably a pretty severe bubble that has occurred. The real \nfact is some people are going to lose their homes. I have agreed to \nthis debate, not because I was trying to stop all of the FHA \nmodernization, but because I am markedly concerned that in this \ncomponent what we are doing has nothing to do with the crisis that we \nsee today, but, in fact, will put the next two generations in \nobligation for a sum somewhere between $50 billion and $60 billion in \nterms of reverse mortgages.\n  Now, the question I would ask, which has not been asked, is where are \nthe metrics to measure the market forces in reverse mortgages in this \ncountry? There are none. As a matter of fact, this bill looks at that \nby asking for a study. But the other intent of the bill is that we ask \nfor a study, but we eliminate the cap which the study is supposed to \nhelp us determine.\n  There are some other concerns the American taxpayer should have, one \nof which is FHA has what is called a qualified audit. They have two \nmaterial weaknesses we wouldn't accept from any other corporation in \nthis country in which we would entrust our money or invest our assets. \nWhen they are audited, there are two material weaknesses in their \nability to control what they are doing, measure what they are doing, \nand assess what they are doing. We ought to be concerned about that.\n  We are simply asking with this amendment that before we raise the cap \non the noncritical area in the home mortgage market, we, in fact, study \nto know what we are doing. The idea for the study is great, but the \nstudy is going to have limited value if, in fact, we move all reverse \nmortgages to the Government. That is going to be the ultimate impact of \nthis bill.\n  The crisis is in the mortgage industry, not the reverse mortgage \nindustry. But we are applying and using that crisis to absolutely \nensure that in the future, our children are going to be hooked for the \nguarantee for all of the reverse mortgages in this country. We are \ngoing to limit the private reinsurance equity reverse mortgage in this \ncountry by what we do.\n  I think the other thing we ought to think about as we do this is some \n``what-ifs.'' What if we don't get a good handle on this subprime \ncredit and the debt situation that is going on? What if we end up \nbecoming the true guarantor of all of these loans? What if they get to \nthe point where they can't be repaid? It is not going to be the \nPresiding Officer and me who are going to pay this; it is going to be \nthe next couple of generations.\n  So this amendment is just designed for prudence. It says, if we are \ngoing to study this, let's study it and then make a decision. There is \nno credible source that says there is a shortage of access of credit \nfor reverse mortgages in this country. It is not in the committee \nreport. It is not in the report. So why are we doing this? Because it \nworks and because people--we are doing it because that is the way \neverybody will go if you can get a Government-guaranteed loan. The \nbanks make more money on it. It is easier--you evidently have to \nqualify, but conventional reverse mortgages will go out the window. So \nwhat have we done with that? We have shifted the risk for all of the \nreverse mortgages in this country to our kids. If that was where we had \na crisis, then I would be in agreement that maybe we should go there, \nbut that is not where it is.\n  What we are attempting to do with the FHA Modernization Act is to \nhelp those who are in a crisis now. Probably, had we done this 3 years \nago, many of the people who are in subprime loans would have been in \nFHA, and we wouldn't see the extent of the crisis we have today.\n  So what I would ask is that our colleagues stop for a minute and say: \nDo we really want at this time to do this? I understand that I am going \nto be opposed on this by members of the Banking Committee, but I would \nask them to show me the data that says there truly is a dent in this \naspect of the reverse mortgage market.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of thousands of \nfamilies in my home State of Maryland.\n  For them, the American dream has turned into a nightmare.\n  I am referring to the phenomenon called the ``credit crunch,'' the \n``mortgage meltdown,'' or the ``subprime crisis.''\n  Regardless of which name we choose to attach to it, the situation \nthreatens to upend the financial stability of individual homeowners and \nneighborhoods.\n  The latest projections show that, nationwide, millions of Americans \nmay lose their homes, and the ripple effect on our economy will be felt \nby all.\n  There may be no more powerful symbol of the American dream than home \nownership.\n  For most American families, their largest asset is their home, and it \nserves as their primary tool for building wealth.\n  Buying a home ranks among the top motivations for saving. Owning a \nhome gives a family a stake in their communities. It provides a hedge \nagainst an inflationary rental market; it provides tax benefits; it \nprovides a source of revenue for emergency expenses, and it provides \nsecurity in old age.\n  In our communities, higher levels of home ownership improve the \nappearance and stability of neighborhoods, and result in better \nschools, more civic participation, and lower crime rates.\n  Many public and private entities have committed their energies to \nincreasing home ownership. Much progress had been made, with the rates \nof home ownership among every racial and ethnic group of Americans \nreaching new highs every year since 1995.\n  That is precisely why the crisis that is spreading through our Nation \nis so alarming.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association has just released its National \nDelinquency Survey for the second quarter of 2007. Rates of mortgage \ndelinquency have reached their highest point in twenty years. \nForeclosure rates are at the highest level ever.\n  It is now estimated that up to 2.2 million Americans who took out \nsubprime mortgages between 1998 and 2006 could lose their homes during \nthe next 2 to 3 years.\n  As the fallout from this situation continues, we are learning more \nand more about the factors leading to the crisis. One key factor is the \ncategory of loans known as ``subprime.''\n  Subprime loans usually have interest rates 3 percentage points or \nmore higher than prime loans, which are typically offered to applicants \nwith credit scores of 650 or higher. Subprimes can be either ``fixed \nrate'' loans, where payments stay the same over the life of the loan, \nor they can be adjustable rate mortgages, known as ARMs.\n  ARMs come in many forms: some begin with very low ``teaser'' rates \nthat then rise steadily as prime interest rates increase. Others, such \nas 2/28 loans, offer very low rates for a brief period, and then reset \nsharply higher, regardless of the prime interest rate, for the \nremaining term of the loan. Many borrowers choosing those loans were \ntold that because their homes were certain to increase in value, they \nwould be able to refinance later and get better terms before their \ninterest rates rose.\n  They assumed that the rapid escalation of prices that occurred in the \nfirst part of this decade would continue. I have heard from borrowers \nwho took out 2/28 or 3/27 loans erroneously believing that as long as \nprime interest\n\n[[Page S15587]]\n\nrates remained low, their own mortgage rates would also. They are now \nfacing huge increases in their monthly payments, some as much as 40 \npercent higher.\n  Some borrowers are also facing foreclosure because they could not \nafford the third or fourth year payments, and were not able to \nrefinance because of missed payments or because the value of their home \nwas less than the outstanding debt. Many regret ever purchasing a home \nand blame themselves for entering into a raw deal. But a 2005 Federal \nTrade Commission study showed that many borrowers did not understand \nthe costs and terms of their own recently obtained mortgages. Many had \nloans that were significantly more costly than they believed, or \ncontained significant restrictions, such as prepayment penalties, of \nwhich they were unaware.\n  For a while, as problems became evident in other areas of the county, \nsuch as Florida and Nevada, analysts said that the Washington \nmetropolitan area and the surrounding region would not be affected. \nThey said that the presence of the Federal Government as a major \nemployer and associated contracting opportunities would prop up housing \nprices and sustain the market. It didn't turn out that way. This area \nis now very much affected by the mortgage mess. Northern Virginia is \nexperiencing some of the sharpest declines in home values in the \nNation.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association has reported that 24 States have \nalready seen decreased revenues directly attributable to changes in the \nhousing sector. This is for two reasons: first declining home values \nhave led to reduced property tax revenues. Second, fewer sales have \nresulted in lower revenues from transfer taxes--the fees that are paid \nwhen homeownership is transferred from sellers to buyers.\n  Maryland is one of those 24 States. Let's look at what is happening \nin Maryland.\n  The top chart shows the percentage of loans that are seriously \ndelinquent in Maryland and in the United States. Seriously delinquent \nloans are more than 3 months delinquent or in the process of \nforeclosure. The percentage of prime loans is relatively small--under 2 \npercent. But in the subprime category, the rates are much higher--for \nfixed rate loans, it is more than 4 percent in Maryland and nearly 6 \npercent nationwide. For subprime ARMs, it is nearly 8 percent in \nMaryland and more than 12 percent nationwide.\n  This tells us that nearly 1 in 15 Maryland mortgage holders with a \nsubprime loan are in imminent danger of losing their homes. For \nborrowers with subprime adjustable rate mortgages, the rate rises to \nnearly 1 in 10.\n  The bottom chart shows how the situation has worsened over the past 3 \nyears in Maryland with respect to delinquent loans. These are loans \nthat are 30 to 60 days past due with no payments being made. Since the \nfourth quarter of 2004, the rate of delinquent prime loans has \nincreased marginally from 1.7 percent to 2.06 percent. But the rate of \ndelinquent subprime loans has increased by more than 50 percent--from \n8.56 percent at the end of 2004 to 13.76 percent today.\n  If no comprehensive plan is put into effect to address this problem, \nthese loans will become seriously delinquent and lead to foreclosure.\n  Foreclosures affect entire neighborhoods, as the repossessed homes \noften stay vacant for extended periods. Some are boarded up, the lawns \ngo untended, the neighborhoods become undesirable places to live, and \nthe value of the surrounding homes is depressed.\n  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, in 2005 and 2006, \n186,000 subprime loans were issued in Maryland. They accounted for \nnearly one-third of all home loans originated in the State during those \n2 years. It is projected now that because of ballooning interest rates \nthat borrowers will not be able to afford, more than 38,300 Maryland \nhomes will be lost to foreclosure.\n  This phenomenon is hitting hardest in the communities least able to \nweather the storm. Some groups--African Americans, Latinos, and the \nelderly--are disproportionately affected.\n  In recent years, minorities have markedly increased their rates of \nhomeownership, helping to increase wealth and improve economic \nstability.\n  These gains are now very much at risk.\n  This is because statistics show that nationwide in 2005, more than 54 \npercent of loans to African Americans and 46 percent of loans to \nLatinos were subprime loans.\n  But minorities did not necessarily receive subprime loans because of \nlower credit scores or lower incomes. Five years ago, the Center for \nCommunity Change, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, issued a report \nentitled, ``Risk or Race?'' It demonstrated that subprime lenders \ntarget minority communities and that African Americans and Latinos pay \nhigher loan rates than Whites with similar incomes.\n  When it comes to buying a home, when incomes and credit scores were \nthe same, African Americans were 3.2 times more likely than Whites to \nget a higher rate loan. Latinos were 2.7 times more likely to get a \nhigher rate loan.\n  When it comes to refinancing, African Americans were 2.3 times more \nlikely than Whites to get a higher rate loan, and Latinos were 1.6 \ntimes more likely.\n  Here's something that is even more surprising: the disparity between \nWhites and minorities increases as incomes rise. Minorities with higher \nincomes are more likely than those with lower incomes to be offered a \nhigher rate loan.\n  So minorities are more likely to have subprime loans, and subprime \nloans are more likely to go into foreclosure, now at alarming rates.\n  On average, minority households have median net worth that is less \nthan one-tenth that of White households. Of the wealth that African \nAmericans and Latinos possess, two-thirds is in home equity. So the \nmortgage crisis is placing not just homes, but also the economic \nstability of minority communities, in serious jeopardy.\n  This crisis will have a profoundly negative effect on the future of \nthese communities.\n  An article earlier this week in the Washington Post featured Caprise \nCoppedge, who works as a housing counselor at United Communities \nAgainst Poverty in Capitol Heights, MD. Capitol Heights sits right on \nthe border between Washington, DC, and Maryland in Prince George's \nCounty. Ms. Coppedge spoke of the increased volume of people coming to \nher for relief, most directly as a result of mortgage problems. She \nsaid that her caseload of people who need help with mortgage payments \nhas increased from one person a week to three a day. She said, \n``There's been a shockingly sharp increase of people in need of help in \nthe past 6 months. It's unreal.'' Last year, her caseload consisted \nprimarily of renters behind in their payments, and the rare homeowner \nwho fell behind in payments had experienced job loss or some other \ninfrequent event.\n  She continued, ``Then in midsummer, we felt the tide turning. People \nstarted trickling in. First they came in to express concern about their \nloans and gathered information. Then by September, everything picked up \nspeed and suddenly, people were telling us they were behind on their \nmortgages.''\n  The Post reported that in Prince George's County, 127 out of every \n10,000 homes are in foreclosure. It is the highest rate in Maryland and \none of the highest in the region. There are now approximately 57,000 \nsubprime loans being serviced in Prince George's County--41 percent of \nall loans in the county. Federal Reserve Data compiled by the Consumer \nFederation of America showed that 43 percent of people buying homes in \nPrince George's County in 2005 used high-cost loans, compared with 20 \npercent in the region overall.\n  Similar trends are evident in Baltimore City and Montgomery County. \nThese are the areas that have the most to lose as the subprime crisis \ndeepens.\n  Prince George's County Executive Jack Johnson has pledged $10 million \nin foreclosure assistance to help keep people in their homes. This \neffort will help many families, but the magnitude of the problem \ndemands resources that only the Federal Government can bring to bear.\n  Finally, there is another set of statistics that should raise the \nantenna of every Senator. Conventional thought has always held that \nyour credit score affects your mortgage rate.\n\n[[Page S15588]]\n\n  For fixed-rate loans, the highest FICO scores translate to the lowest \ninterest rates and the lowest monthly payments. However, Fannie Mae, a \ngovernment-sponsored loan buyer, has estimated that up to half of \nsubprime borrowers actually had credit ratings that could have \nqualified them for prime rates. Another study by First American Loan \nPerformance, a San Francisco research firm, says that this proportion \nreached 61 percent in 2006.\n  How could this have happened? There are many factors involved: I will \nmention just a few: lack of consumer education; the brokerage industry; \nthe advertising industry; and predatory lending, which I have already \ndiscussed.\n  First, the lack of consumer education: a Mortgage Banker Association \nsurvey from 10 years ago indicated that nearly one-third of homebuyers \nnever met with anyone except their real estate agent when they bought a \nhome. The numbers may have changed somewhat, but the extent of the \ncurrent crisis suggests that the picture may have not changed much.\n  A more recent borrower survey by the Mortgage Bankers found that half \nof borrowers who had purchased a home in the previous 12 months \ncouldn't recall the terms of their mortgage.\n  Second is the brokerage industry: There is a term called ``yield-\nspread-premium,'' or YSP. Simply put, it is the amount that mortgage \nbrokers are paid by lenders for originating a loan.\n  Some brokers have reportedly received up to 5 points for every \nsubprime loan they originate--that works out to $10,000 on a $200,000 \nmortgage. On a prime loan, the margin is about one percent, or $2,000. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported that a March 2007 rate sheet from New \nCentury Financial Corporation told brokers they could earn a ``yield \nspread premium'' equal to 2 percent of the loan if the borrower's \ninterest rate was an extra 1.25 percentage points higher than the \nlisted rates.\n  The tiny print at the bottom of the document read, ``For Wholesale \nUse only. Not for distribution to the general public.'' New Century \nFinancial is now in bankruptcy protection and no longer issuing \nsubprime loans.\n  Where do the extra payments to the broker come from? They are \nfinanced by charging the borrower a higher rate. So the monetary \nincentives are in place for brokers to steer would-be borrowers to the \nriskiest and most costly loans. About 70 percent of subprime loans are \noriginated by mortgage brokers who get paid with these YSPs.\n  Third, even with the intense media attention paid to this crisis, you \ncan still open any newspaper and see advertisements for new housing \ndevelopments. The developers are offering balloon mortgages that are \nmore likely to lead to foreclosure for many borrowers. Also in many \ncommunity papers you will find ads from subprime lenders touting how \nborrowers can get loans with no documentation of income, no down \npayments, and little or no credit history.\n  The crisis is national and we need a national response. The President \nand Treasury Secretary Paulson have put forth a proposal that is \nvoluntary and, by many estimates, will help only about one in five of \nthe subprime borrowers whose rates are set to increase over the next \nyear. It is limited to borrowers who took out loans only since 2005 and \nonly those with lower credit scores who are up-to-date on their \npayments.\n  Residents of heavily affected counties in Maryland and many other \ncounties across the Nation would no doubt say that a more comprehensive \nand inclusive solution is required. Several bills have been introduced \nin the House and Senate, including S. 2338, the FHA Modernization Act, \nwhich we are considering today. This measure will increase the FHA's \nloan limits for single families to 100 percent of the median home price \nin an area, up from 95 percent, and it will reduce the FHA's down \npayment requirements from three to 1.5 percent. This bill will also \nauthorize $200 million for foreclosure-prevention counseling for low- \nand moderate-income homeowners who are having trouble making their \nmortgage payments. I support the reforms included in this bill and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on additional solutions.\n  We must work to repair the damage that has been done, and change the \nlaws so that prospective homebuyers can secure affordable and fair \nloans. People in our communities are looking to us for leadership and \nwe must provide it. The sooner we act, the more families' dreams will \nbe preserved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, we have reached an understanding to use \nthe remaining time. At this time, I yield, in opposition to the \namendment, 8 minutes to Senator Crapo.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Off whose time?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Off the time in opposition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. It will go back to the remaining speakers on the \nDemocratic side.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Coburn \namendment. This amendment calls into question how we are going to \nmodernize the FHA reversion mortgage program, often called the HECM, or \nhome equity conversion mortgage program. I have long been a supporter \nof the program, and I have worked with a number of members of the \nBanking Committee, a bipartisan group, to remove the volume limit on \nthe amount of reverse mortgages the FHA may insure. I especially thank \nthe other Senators who have worked on this: Senators Dodd, Shelby, \nReed, and Allard.\n  I understand the concerns my colleague from Oklahoma is raising about \nthe need to further understand and be able to evaluate the development \nof the reverse mortgage industry.\n  Although I support the report that is in the bill that will help us \nto do that, it is very important to understand why this amendment is \nthe wrong approach to getting a better handle on understanding reverse \nmortgages.\n  There has been a cap imposed on the number of reverse mortgages that \ncan be issued by the FHA and by HUD. That cap has already been reached. \nSo if we don't lift the cap while we are conducting the study, the \nprogram essentially terminates.\n  The reason we must not allow that to happen is the very reason the \nSenator from Oklahoma has been talking about: We need to have further \nability to study and evaluate this program and refine its \neffectiveness. That is what the study is in place for. We need a \nprogram for the study to continue to be effective.\n  What does the report that we included in the bill do? It requires \nthat the GAO help Congress analyze and determine the effects of \nlimiting the amounts of the costs or fees under the program from the \namounts charged under the program as of the date of enactment. It goes \nthrough a number of requirements; for example, requiring that we focus \non the cost to mortgagors for participating in the program, the \nfinancial soundness of the program, the availability of credit under \nthe program, the cost to the elderly homeowners under the program, \nparticularly evaluating mortgage insurance premiums charged under the \nprogram, the upfront fees, and the margin rates charged under the \nprogram.\n  I went through that on purpose because I think it is important that \nwe understand there are issues here about reverse mortgages that we are \nstudying. But the issues right now focus most significantly on making \nsure that the elderly who are participating in this program don't pay \nsignificantly high or overly high upfront fees.\n  The program is very successful in terms of protecting the taxpayer. \nOver the next 5 years, it is estimated that not only will this program \nnot cost the taxpayers any money, it is estimated to generate about \n$1.5 billion in revenues to the Treasury over the next 5 years because \nof the fees that are being charged as these mortgages are entered.\n  I think it is important to note, because it is going to be critical \nfor the future of this program, and understand what the level of these \nshould be, what the level of the mortgage premium should be, and have \nthe ability to work effectively as we move forward in refining the \nprogram.\n  A reverse mortgage is a unique loan that enables a senior to remain \nin their\n\n[[Page S15589]]\n\nhome and to remain financially independent by converting part of the \nequity in their home into tax-free income, without having to sell the \nhome, give up title, or take on a new monthly mortgage payment.\n  The reverse mortgage is aptly named because the payment stream is \nreversed. Instead of making monthly payments to the lender, as one \nwould do with a regular mortgage, the lender makes payments to the \nhomeowner.\n  This HECM program was created to serve our seniors who are ``cash \npoor'' but ``equity rich.'' They need to have a cashflow and they have \nsignificant equity in their home that they have built up over the \nyears. The majority of the recipients are elderly widows. The funds \nfrom a reverse mortgage can be used for anything, such as daily living \nexpenses, home repairs or modifications, health care expenses, \nprescription drugs, in-home care, existing debts, prevention of \nforeclosure, or any other needs that the elderly may have.\n  As reverse mortgages have become more understood and the real-life \nsuccess stories have been told, this HECM program has grown. There is a \nsignificantly increased interest in it. Clearly, this sector of \nindustry is going to continue to grow as baby boomers get older and the \nconsumers' acceptance and understanding of the program increases. \nIncreased lender participation led to competition that has already \nresulted in mortgage fee reductions across the country.\n  The point I am leading to here is simply this: This is a program we \nmust not stop dead in its tracks by simply reimposing the cap. It is \ncritical that the legislation we put together that lists the cap, while \nwe are conducting this study, makes sure that we better understand how \nto approach defining the level of support for the program and that it \nis able to continue. Rather, what the amendment would do is simply \nreimpose the cap and essentially stop the program. There would be \nnothing further to study then, because the program would be ended.\n  I think we can all agree we need to develop these kinds of unique and \nhelpful programs for those in our country who have reached the point in \ntheir lives where they have significant equity but don't have the \ncashflow they need to meet their critical life needs. This program is \none that helps them in a way that preserves their dignity, their \nability to live in their own home, and assures that they have an \nopportunity for a cashflow that will enable them to live out their \nlives in a way that doesn't put them in a position of constantly \nwondering how they are going to make next month's payments.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I am very interested in this \nlegislation. I do support the bill. I think the reverse mortgage is an \nimportant tool for many elderly in order to live out their days with \nbasic needs.\n  However, this week, with the assistance and support of Senator Kohl, \nthe chairman of the Aging Committee, I was given the opportunity to \nchair a hearing on reverse mortgages, where, frankly, I was shocked to \nlearn some of the predatory practices that are going on. Senator Crapo \nis exactly right; there are, in fact, mostly elderly widows who are \naccessing these reverse mortgages. That is why it is so important that \nwe protect them with counseling and with aggressive oversight and that \nthe predatory marketing that is now beginning to go on is brought to a \nclose.\n  I will give some examples. Some very bad companies are now \nadvertising: Come sell reverse mortgages and, by the way, you can \ndouble your commission if you sell an annuity at the right time.\n  We heard testimony from a family where, in fact, an elderly widow who \nhad a home equity line of credit had money in the bank, was brought \ninto the confidence of a salesman, who then ended up selling her a \nreverse mortgage she didn't need and a deferred annuity she didn't \nneed, and she was over 80 years old. It was a tragedy. We have to make \nsure the counseling being given--by the way, the counseling being given \nnow is being paid for by the lending industry, because HUD only gave $3 \nmillion for counseling--$3 million. We are talking about a program that \nwill generate about $1.7 billion under this bill for the Federal \nGovernment, and more than $3 million is needed to help the elderly \nwidows understand what is going on. $3 million is outrageous.\n  There is a piece of legislation I will introduce, along with Senator \nKohl, that I will, I hope, have an opportunity to add to this bill \nbefore it gets to the President. It is going to do some important \nthings. It is going to raise the amount of money for counseling to \ncover the need, only about $24 million a year. It is going to make sure \nthat counseling is independent and that, in fact, these people getting \nthe counseling are assessed as to whether they are suitable for a \nreverse mortgage. Many of the elderly are not suitable for it, and they \nare going to get themselves into a trap they cannot get out of.\n  The other thing is making sure that we build a wall between the \ndeferred annuity salesman and the people who are selling reverse \nmortgages. It is unconscionable that these salesmen might prey on these \nelderly people and sell them complicated financial products they don't \nneed.\n  I support the bill. I think the amendment Senator Coburn offered--I \nget what he is trying to do and I appreciate it. I think we need to \npass this bill with these important safeguards in place, it is my hope \nthey are added before the President signs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is interesting. I will ask a couple of \nquestions. Where is the study that shows the Federal Government ought \nto be in the reverse mortgage market? It is not there. Where is the \nstudy that shows what will happen to the private mortgage market? It is \nnot there. So what we are doing is moving all reverse mortgages and the \nobligations thereof to our kids.\n  We ought to let private markets work some. We ought to create that \nability. We are going to eliminate that ability. There is no question \nthat reverse mortgages are advantageous for a lot of people. As you \nheard, there are going to be people preying on widows out there, \nsaying: Here is the FHA, and I can sell you this annuity if you want to \nreverse mortgage your home. There is not going to be any balance on \nthat.\n  So we are going to shift an entire industry, which should be private, \nwith FHA reserve, for those who need it to help them, to the \nGovernment. The long-term consequence by the auditors' report is that \nit is going to be $45 billion that is going to get shifted to debt to \nour kids. That is the exposure there.\n  I am not against reverse mortgages. I am not against us trying to do \neverything we can in terms of the real crisis out there, which is \nassociated with the subprime mortgages. This is a totally different \ncategory. What we are doing is expanding a program, unlimited. What if \nthe GAO report comes back and says you should not do that, there is a \nmarket out there? Every banker in this country, if you give them an \noption of a conventional mortgage or an FHA-guaranteed mortgage, is \ngoing to go to the FHA. What will happen? There is a lower \nqualification for it. They make more money off of it. Consequently, we \nare going to direct a whole industry into a Government-backed program \nby what we are doing in this bill.\n  I am not even opposed to reverse mortgages through FHA. I am opposed \nto us overreacting and creating only one market, taking the private \nmarket totally out of it and putting our kids on the hook for it.\n  Nobody answered the questions about FHA in their audit. No large \ncorporation would still be on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, or \nany other exchange, if they had three significantly qualified areas to \ntheir financial statements. They have two of the three that are \nmaterial weaknesses, inability to even watch the programs we have. We \nare going to ignore all that today. I understand that. We are going to \nignore the fact that there are no metrics, no study to tell us what we \nare doing is right. But we are going to do it.\n  Somebody has to protect and think about the future. So this amendment \nis common sense. It says, wait--we can\n\n[[Page S15590]]\n\nwait a short period of time; it will not take GAO all that long. What \nis the pressure on this? The pressure is the money generation. We are \ngoing to collect $1.5 billion from these same elderly people in \ninsurance, who are going to be scammed by people who will sell them \nannuities. So they are going to get less money out of their reverse \nmortgage than they would have gotten in the private sector. They are \ngoing to get less. And then we are going to say we did something.\n\n  I am surprised it has not been raised, but what we are doing is a \ncredit card scam. We are being the credit card scam. We are going to \nenable people to get scammed. We don't know what we are doing. The \nstudy is important to do.\n  I will work with the authors of the bill to raise the cap somewhat, \nbut to raise it unlimited, never to have a cap regardless of what the \nGAO report says? When are we going to come back and fix it? What if \nthey say: You shouldn't be doing this; maybe this ought to be in the \nprivate market. There isn't a need for our children to take on the \nadditional risk of these reverse mortgages.\n  What are we going to do? There is no mechanism for what we are doing \nin the FHA Modernization Act if that comes to fruition. The reason for \nthe amendment is to pause and ask the question: Where are the metrics \nthat say we need to do it? Where is the market failure that says the \nFederal Government ought to be doing it?\n  This was a pilot. We are now converting a pilot into a full-grown \nprogram. Shouldn't we know what we are doing? Shouldn't we assess \nwhether there is a true market failure in reverse mortgages before we \ndo this? No. 2, shouldn't we consider some of the safeguards for a lot \nof the people who are going to be taken advantage of through this \nprogram? Finally, No. 3, with our debt growing $1 million a minute, \n$1.3 billion a day--and every child now who is born in this country is \ninheriting $400,000 in unfunded liabilities--do we have an obligation \nto be maybe a little more prudent and say: Wait a minute, let's fix the \nsubprime, but let's be more prudent on this issue until we really know \nwhat we are doing.\n  I understand it is a good idea. For me, it will be great when I \nretire. I probably will do a reverse mortgage. But we don't know what \nthe markets are. We don't know where they are. And we don't know the 5-\nyear future right now, especially given the subprime crisis in front of \nus, and we are going to add more to that?\n  What if somebody comes to their elderly mother and says: I want you \nto do a reverse mortgage on your home so I cannot default on my private \none? Is that why we are doing this? Or what if somebody says: I want to \nsell you the best thing you ever had; I am going to give you an \nannuity. Sounds good. You have a home, you are an elderly female, no \nhusband, and you buy it, only to find out later you could have bought \nan annuity that would have given you $300 or $400 more a month if you \nhad been in the private market with checks and balances rather than be \nscammed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a summary of \nthe independent auditors' report--Urbach Kahn & Werlin--from this past \nyear on the Federal Housing Administration.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Independent Auditors' Report\n\n       Inspector General--United States Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development\n       Commissioner--Federal Housing Administration\n       We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance \n     sheets of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a wholly \n     owned government corporation within the United States \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), as of \n     September 30, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated \n     statements of net cost, changes in net position, and the \n     combined statements of budgetary resources (Principal \n     Financial Statements) for the years then ended. The objective \n     of our audits was to express an opinion on these financial \n     statements. In connection with our audits, we also considered \n     FHA's internal control over financial reporting and tested \n     FHA's compliance with laws and regulations that could have a \n     direct and material effect on its financial statements.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       We concluded that FHA's Principal Financial Statements are \n     presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity \n     with accounting principles generally accepted in the United \n     States of America.\n       Our consideration of internal control over financial \n     reporting resulted in the following matters being identified \n     as significant deficiencies: A risk assessment and systems \n     development plan are needed for FHA's Home Equity Conversion \n     Mortgage systems and transaction controls; HECM credit \n     subsidy cash flow model needs improvement; and FHA system \n     security controls need to be strengthened.\n       We consider the first two findings to be material \n     weaknesses. We found no reportable instances of noncompliance \n     with laws and regulations.\n       This report (including Appendices A through D) discusses: \n     (1) these conclusions and our conclusions relating to other \n     information presented in the Annual Management Report, (2) \n     management's responsibilities, (3) our objectives, scope and \n     methodology, (4) management's response and our evaluation of \n     their response, and (5) the current status of prior year \n     findings and recommendations.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues, the FHA has \nsignificant problems if they cannot pass an audit. That has not been \naddressed in this bill at all in terms of the audit defects FHA has.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and ask how much time is \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma has 17 \nminutes remaining. Opponents to the Coburn amendment have 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to a distinguished \nmember of the Banking Committee, the Senator from Delaware.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his leadership on \nthis issue to bring us to this day and my friend from Oklahoma who \noffered the amendment before us. He raises a good point, and it is one \nthat should be addressed in the conference to follow. My hope is that \nsome of the concerns he raised will be addressed. I don't know that his \namendment will be approved today, but the points he made are not \nwithout value.\n  We have had FHA for 70 years. The reason we have it is because in the \nGreat Depression, we realized we needed to encourage home ownership in \nthis country, and we still do. For many years, FHA was the go-to guy, \nif you will, for folks who had marginal credit, maybe were not \nhomeowners, were first-time homeowners and they needed help to get them \nin position to qualify for loans and become homeowners.\n  There are all kinds of virtues that flow from home ownership. I will \nnot get into them all. They are many and valid.\n  In recent years, we have seen people who normally would have gone to \nthe FHA, first-time home buyers or people with marginal credit, to get \na guaranteed home loan--in recent years, instead of 15 percent of \nAmerican loans being purchased through FHA mortgage, we see the trend \ndown. Today, it is roughly 5 percent. That difference is 10 percent of \nthe people. A lot of people have gone to subprime lenders. A lot have \ngone to mortgages that, frankly, in the long run don't make sense. They \nmight get a teaser rate the first couple of years of 3 or 4 percent and \nthen see the rate go up to 7 percent, 8 percent, or 10 percent and find \nthemselves in a mortgage vehicle they cannot get out of because there \nis no ability to escape.\n  We need to get that 5 percent of loans, home mortgages guaranteed by \nFHA, back up closer to 15 percent. We are not going to do it with the \nFHA of the 20th century. We have to bring the FHA into the 21st \ncentury. That is what we do with this legislation. We bring it into the \nera in which we live today.\n  I wish to mention a couple of the changes that are made possible with \nthis legislation. Among them is loan limits. Today, it is about \n$365,000. They are going to go up to roughly $415,000 to reflect the \nchange in the marketplace.\n  The downpayment FHA required of home buyers for years is 3 percent. \nIf you buy a home for $200,000, the downpayment is $6,000. We cut that \nin half to 1.5 percent. So the downpayment for a $200,000 house will be \nabout $3,000 to make home ownership within reach.\n  Also, the legislation removes the caps on reversible mortgages from \ncurrently $150,000 to really to no cap. We are going to consider that \nand we\n\n[[Page S15591]]\n\nshould consider that in conference, I hope with the input from the GAO.\n  Finally, the bill creates--and I think this is important and speaks \nto the concern raised by Senator McCaskill--it creates a prepurchasing \ncounseling program.\n  I am convinced it is not strong enough. Senator McCaskill authored \nlegislation--and I suppose some of us will join her in sponsoring that \nlegislation--to strengthen this provision to make sure, if you or I \nqualify through FHA, we want to make sure the folks going to the FHA \nmaking that loan are getting the kind of counseling they need and not \nsomebody who is there to set them up and take advantage of them.\n  This is not the only step we need to take to get us through the \nsubprime lending morass for home mortgages. The Paulson freeze \nannounced last week is a good idea. Interest rates would be frozen for \n5 years for folks in these adjustable rate mortgages that are about to \nreset and raise the rates. That is a good first step. This is a good \nsecond step.\n  A good third step is to ban predatory lending practices. Legislation \npassed the House and is about to be considered in the Senate.\n  Last point. This is what Senator Schumer and I are interested in: GSA \nreform. That is the last piece. It would include a low-income \naffordable home program too.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 3 minutes to someone who has been a genuine \nleader on this issue, a cosponsor of this legislation--just like you \nand me, Mr. President--on subprime counseling, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Casey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Schumer for his leadership \non these issues. I rise today, like so many this morning, to talk about \nsomething we refer to by way of acronym. In case someone is just tuning \nin, when we are talking about FHA, we are talking about the Federal \nHousing Administration. We are talking about home ownership, the dream \nof home ownership which is so much a part of the American dream, and \ntoday we have an opportunity to pass legislation, a modernization bill \nfor the FHA, which will reform FHA lending programs to make them a more \nviable alternative for borrowers looking to purchase or to refinance a \nhome.\n  By way of history, back in the depths and the darkness of the \nDepression in 1934, a single-family FHA mortgage insurance program was \ncreated to help spur the housing market and increase home ownership--\njust what we are trying to do today in 2007. FHA made the low-\ndownpayment, 30-year fixed-rate loan the standard product of the United \nStates and has traditionally played a role in providing home purchase \nfinancing to minority, first-time, and lower income home buyers.\n  This bill does a number of things. We have heard them, but I will go \nthrough the list again briefly.\n\n  First, increasing loan limits. This is so important at this present \ntime to help the middle class of America.\n  Second, this legislation streamlines the borrowing process to make it \nfaster and more efficient. Everyone here has been through the process \nof borrowing money. It is complicated enough. Anything we can do to \nstreamline that will help consumers and future homeowners.\n  Third, it increases prepurchase counseling for borrowers so they know \nhow much they can afford before they buy a home. This is a part of the \nsubprime crisis. Not nearly enough attention and resources are \ndedicated to counseling. This legislation helps in the context of the \nFHA counseling homeowners.\n  Finally, it improves and expands the availability of reverse \nmortgages so that older citizens can stay in their homes longer and \nsafely tap into the equity they built up in their home.\n  I don't need to go into the details of the subprime crisis; we all \nknow about it. Senators Brown, Schumer, and I authored legislation, the \nBorrowers Protection Act. We also have money in the budget the \nPresident is talking about vetoing, $200 million for counseling. It \nwill be a big mistake for the President to do that. But this \nmodernization bill of our housing programs is focused on home-ownership \npreservation and providing borrowers with responsible, stable \nalternatives to subprime mortgages.\n  We know we need other alternatives. Right now, the credit markets \nacross the country and across the world remain tight, and even \nborrowers with good credit are having a hard time borrowing. So this \nbill provides realistic alternatives for hundreds of thousands of \nborrowers right at the time they need it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator's time has expired. \nWho yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, does my colleague from Oklahoma wish to \nspeak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those in favor of the amendment have 17 \nminutes. Those opposed have 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, may I ask unanimous consent to borrow a \nminute and a half from my colleague from Oklahoma?\n  Mr. COBURN. In my normal magnanimous state, I would normally be happy \nto do that and will do that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Schumer, and I thank \nSenator Coburn for always being generous with his time. I thank the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Over the past few years, our country's problem has not been lack of \ncredit; it has been too much bad credit, too many unscrupulous \nopportunists looking to take advantage of a situation. Nowhere is that \nmore true than in the State of Ohio. As State and Federal regulators \nignored the problems, predatory lending mushroomed. We have the highest \nrate of foreclosed homes in the country. Whole neighborhoods have been \ndevastated because of foreclosures. It is not an isolated event. When \nhomes are foreclosed, they affect the value of homes nearby, the crime \nrate, city tax revenues--the entire fabric of Slavic Village, Garfield \nHeights or Cincinnati or all over the State. These communities stretch \nacross my State. Of the 30 cities hardest hit in the Nation, 6 are in \nOhio.\n  By providing loans program at a fair price, the FHA program can give \ntens of thousands of families an alternative to the decidedly unfair \nloans they are caught in today. We need to act quickly, as Senator \nSchumer and Senator Martinez said. We need to work out our differences \nwith the House. We need to get this legislation to the President.\n  Every day in Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, Columbus, and \nToledo, in addition to smaller cities in Ohio, 200 families in Ohio \nlose their homes. Every month, thousands and thousands of these \npredatory loans are resetting at rates that will quickly become \nunaffordable to more and more families.\n  This legislation, needless to say, is only part of the solution. We \nneed to do several things. We need to ensure that additional resources \nfor counseling, as Senator Casey and Senator Schumer worked so hard on \nand that were included in the housing appropriations bills, are signed \ninto law. We need to enact reasonable protection for borrowers so they \nare not preyed upon when it comes time to refinance loans. We need to \nchange policies, as Senator Gregg, Senator Stabenow, and Senator \nVoinovich said, so families forced to sell their homes at a loss do not \nfind themselves slapped with a tax bill. We need to change our \nbankruptcy laws, as Senator Durbin advocated, so that homeowners have \nthe same rights in bankruptcy as vacation homeowners do. And we need to \nchampion the interests of homeowners.\n  Next week, the Federal Reserve will consider and I hope adopt rules \nto strengthen the protection against deceptive mortgage lending \npractices. I commend Senators Dodd, Shelby, Schumer, Casey, and all \nthose who have worked hard on this legislation and want to take further \nsteps to deal with this problem better than we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to Senator Martinez in \nopposition to my amendment.\n\n[[Page S15592]]\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nbeing magnanimous even with his own colleagues. I appreciate it very \nmuch.\n  I understand the concerns of the Senator from Oklahoma. Anytime we \nare looking at an expansion of a Federal Government program, it gives \none pause. Having been the Secretary of HUD, I understand that. But I \nmust say it is important for folks to understand when we talk about any \nburden on the Federal Government, this is a program that is an \ninsurance program, and since 1934 has never lost a dime of the American \ntaxpayers' money. In fact, it has a surplus today of over $20 billion.\n  What they do at FHA is look at the risk in the mortgage. Then they \nwill insure it accordingly and the mortgagee pays a premium \naccordingly. The same takes place in the reverse mortgage. HUD \nfacilitates a larger reverse mortgage program through the FHA's home \nequity conversion mortgage, which is an industry leader, accounting for \n90 percent of all reverse mortgages. So when we talk about the private \nsector, today, out of 14 million mortgage transactions in 2006, only \n100,000 were reverse mortgages, of which 90 percent were handled by the \nFHA. That has the Good Housekeeping Seal of approval.\n  The problems the Senator from Oklahoma talks about occur on that 10 \npercent in the private market. The HUD-insured, FHA-run HECM Program is \none that allows a certain amount of comfort to those elderly who seek \nto have a reverse mortgage. There have been instances of predatory \npractices. Although these have generally not been a problem with the \nHUD mortgages, we always must be vigilant of those, and I support \nefforts to try to curtail any predatory practices.\n  What we are looking to do is make positive changes that will enhance \nthe product availability but, more importantly, lower the cost going \nforward to America's elderly who seek to use this program. It will help \nus to better understand the evolving financial needs of seniors. I am \nproud this bipartisan legislation is something that will help America's \nseniors.\n  Reverse mortgage programs are an important tool used by many \nFloridians. In fact, in the last fiscal year alone, Florida witnessed a \n116-percent increase in the number of reverse mortgages, and these \nproducts continue to increase in popularity. Congress has the \nresponsibility to ensure that our elderly are properly protected but \nstill give them every opportunity to be able to make good personal \nfinancial decisions for themselves.\n  Now, my dear friend from Oklahoma has raised concerns, but the growth \nof this program is projected to be only 109,000 from 100,000 in the \nyear 2007; and in 2008, 166,000. So there is going to be a gradual \ngrowth of this program.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 3 minutes has \nexpired, but the Senator from Oklahoma controls 12 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I just want to point out that the study the Senator \ntalks about is an important study, and it is a part of what this bill \ncontains. However, the study will be useful to us once the program has \nbeen expanded and we have the opportunity to see what the experience is \non the program. So rather than not study it, it is going to study it, \nbut it has to study it in the future based on the growth and expansion \nof the program because for the past we have the statistical data \navailable and the history of this program. The bottom line on the audit \nissue, which I know is a concern, is the historical data will give us a \nfuller understanding of what the experience is, rather than the \nmanagement assumptions that are made through the current audit.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a good program for America's seniors. \nThe concerns raised by the Senator from Oklahoma are valid and should \nbe kept in mind, but we should vote for this good amendment today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will note for my colleagues' benefit \nthat I do not plan to ask for a recorded vote on this amendment. I also \nwill not demand a recorded vote on the bill itself, so colleagues would \nnot have to come to the floor.\n  Let me summarize. What we are trying to do with FHA modernization is \ngood. We have a crisis. There is no crisis in reverse mortgages. As a \nmatter of fact, there is not hardly any private sector anymore. The \nreverse mortgages that are growing, I would advise the Senator from \nFlorida, are growing at 60 percent a year at FHA. That is not slow \ngrowth. If we take 60 percent a year over the next 10 years, instead of \n109,000, we will have 800,000. So that is why GAO estimates that we are \ntalking about $56 billion in new obligations that our kids are going to \nhave to come up with if anything happens.\n  So, again, nobody has answered the question: Is there a crisis in \nreverse mortgages? There is not. Nobody has answered the question: \nWhere are the metrics in terms of the marketplace, saying there is not \nadequate credit out there in the private marketplace, not guaranteed by \nour children? We are not going to guarantee it, our children are. \nNobody has answered those two questions. And nobody has said: Here is \nwhat the data shows on the market now that we are going to do 130,000-\nplus, I believe, this year, and how does that impact with the total \nnumber of mortgages that are out there this year in the very difficult \nmarket that we find ourselves in with the tight credit.\n  So I would ask for a voice vote on this amendment, and then I will \nnot object to a voice vote or a consent after that on the underlying \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3854) was rejected.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time has \nexpired on the debate relating to this matter, the FHA Modernization \nAct.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I will use my leader time to speak, and I rise to express \nmy optimism for the bill we are about to pass--and it will pass--and my \nappreciation that we have reached the point that we can get this done \nfor the American people.\n  Mr. President, every day the mortgage crisis grows worse. We have \nreached a point where hundreds of families have either lost their homes \nor may lose them, and soon that will be in the tens of thousands. As \nbad as the crisis is now, there is reason to believe we are only in the \nearly stages.\n  Some may say: If a borrower gets into financial trouble, it is their \nobligation, and their obligation alone, to find a way out. But that \nisn't the way it works. The cost of a foreclosed home has an impact on \nall of us--not just the borrower but all of us. Families lose the roof \nover their heads and the equity they have gained. Neighborhoods suffer \nthe loss of property values. Cities and towns lose taxes. Lenders and \ntheir shareholders lose too. And it is no exaggeration to say the \nentire national economy is put at risk.\n  We are seeing those effects in Nevada, with the number of \nforeclosures since August of 2006 up by more than 200 percent, and \nanother 21,000 homes at risk by 2009. We have been working hard to \nalleviate this problem at home. Last month, I organized a roundtable \ndiscussion in Reno with lenders, mortgage services, housing counseling \nagencies, and other Federal and local officials. And we followed that \nup with mobile resource centers to bring foreclosure information into \nthe neighborhoods where people need them.\n  Taking these steps is a crucial part of the solution, but we need new \nlaws at the Federal level to give lenders the tools and flexibility to \nhelp people find ways to keep their homes. As grim as things look \ntoday, they could get far worse. That is why it is important we act \nnow.\n\n[[Page S15593]]\n\n  I am glad to see my Republican colleagues have finally heard the call \nand joined us to support this legislation. Let's be clear. The \nGovernment can't solve this problem alone, but we certainly can help. \nWhen this bill becomes law, it will accomplish two main things: It will \nincrease FHA loan limits on both the high and low ends, and it will \nreduce downpayment requirements. The result will be better loan options \nfor families who are having trouble keeping up with their exploding \nmortgage payments resulting from teaser rate mortgages. They will have \nthe option of refinancing through an FHA bank loan, with the peace of \nmind that comes with it.\n  For future home buyers, a fully backed FHA loan with honest, upfront \nterms, will help prevent a crisis like we now face and ensure that more \nAmerican families will experience all the safety, comfort, and \nstability that comes with home ownership. The past decade has seen \nremarkable growth in American home ownership. What is more, these gains \nhave been enjoyed from coast to coast and among groups that have \ntraditionally been shut out. The bill we are about to pass will help \nensure this progress continues. It is an accomplishment for the Senate \nand an important step forward for the American people.\n  Finally, Mr. President, during this vote I hope we can clear a \nconsent request that I will offer to go forward on the Defense \nauthorization bill. It is late in the year, and the President can't pay \nthe troops the pay raise they deserve until we pass this bill. Waiting \nuntil next week will not do the trick. We must finish this today.\n  I certainly hope we can work this out in the next few minutes to go \nforward on this as soon as we complete this bill. Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner have worked very hard on this legislation, as have many \nothers, and I hope we can move forward on it very quickly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is expired.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill having been read the third \ntime, the question is on the passage of the bill, as amended.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, we are going to then move and complete \nwork today on the farm bill. We hope the two managers can work through \nwhatever minor problems exist. The sooner people determine what they \nwant to do, the more quickly we can dispose of the bill.\n  As I indicated earlier, we are going to file cloture this evening, \nthis afternoon, on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It is an \nextremely important piece of legislation. There are some strong \nfeelings on both sides of the issue. We are going to come in around 11 \no'clock on Monday morning. There will be a vote around noon on Monday. \nThe managers of this bill, this important bill, should be ready to \nstart legislating Monday afternoon. We do not have a lot of time.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. There are a significant \nnumber of amendments people want to offer. A week from Tuesday is \nChristmas. So I would hope we can work our way through this. We hope \nthere are some other issues we can complete. Late in the session like \nthis, they have to be agreed upon.\n  Senator McConnell and I have had a number of conversations the last \ncouple of days on the way we are going to end the session regarding \nfunding, other issues relating to funding. The one good thing is both \nmy office and his office have kept quiet about it. As a result of that, \nthings are moving fairly quietly.\n  That is the way we want it. No one will be surprised about anything. \nEveryone will know exactly what is going to happen. At this stage, it \nappears the House will take up the spending matter, the omnibus, on \nMonday. They will send it to us on Tuesday. That is the glidepath we \nhave now. The path we hope is a smooth one, but in this world we live \nin, you never know, but it is looking pretty good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me briefly add, I am hoping there \nwill not be a need for this hour of debate on the Defense conference \nreport. I think we all know what is in it at this point. Hopefully, we \ncan yield back time. There are a number of Members who have travel \nplans. If we can expedite the consideration of the remaining issues, it \nwould be appreciated by a great many of our Members.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15598-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15598-S15619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But I \nwill try to accommodate all those who wish to speak within the 30 \nminutes allocated on this side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I make the same request for Senators on \nthis side of the aisle. If they wish to speak during this brief period, \nlet us know. We will try to fit in as many as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I urge the adoption of this conference \nreport for the Defense Department. Every year since 1961 there has been \na Defense authorization bill enacted. This year conferees and staff \nhave worked extraordinarily hard, with bipartisan cooperation, and we \nare proud to be keeping up our four-and-one-half decades-long tradition \nwith this conference report.\n  The great men and women of our Armed Forces are making the most \ndifficult sacrifices. They are putting their\n\n[[Page S15599]]\n\nlives on the line, they are giving up precious time spent with their \nloved ones, they are driven by love of country and by the call of duty.\n  Our priorities on this bill are threefold: Care, readiness, and \nmanagement. First, care will guarantee our troops have the best health \ncare and support, both on the battlefield and once they return home.\n  Second, readiness will ensure our Armed Forces succeed, both in \nongoing operations and taking on new challenges in future missions.\n  And, third, management will provide oversight for defense contracts, \noperations and processes, to ensure efficiency and maximize results.\n  First, caring for our troops and their families must always be our \ntop priority. Earlier this year, media reports and a joint hearing of \nthe Senate Armed Services and the Veterans' Affairs Committee exposed \ntotally unacceptable conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\n  Further investigation revealed deficiencies in mental health care, in \ntransitioning from DOD to VA care, and in our responsiveness to the \nneeds of our veterans.\n  This conference report includes the Wounded Warrior Act, which would \naddress all these issues, ensuring our brave men and women receive the \nbest care possible whenever and wherever their health concerns are.\n  The Wounded Warrior Act brings new focus to the signature injuries of \nthe Iraq war, by establishing and funding comprehensive policies for \npreventing and treating traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and other mental health conditions.\n  It provides for respite care and medical care for family members who \nare primary caregivers for seriously injured servicemembers.\n  It requires the Department of Defense and the Veterans' \nAdministration to develop fully interoperable electronic health record \nsystems. The act initiates fundamental reform at the Department of \nDefense and Veterans' Administration disability evaluation system, by \nrequiring use of the VA presumption of sound mental and physical \ncondition when men and women join the service, and it also requires VA \nstandards for awarding disability.\n  In both cases, that will benefit our men and women. This act requires \nthe Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs to work together to \nsignificantly improve the management of medical care, disability \nevaluations, personnel actions, and the quality of life for \nservicemembers recovering from illnesses and injuries incurred while \nperforming military duty.\n  A lot of Senators have been involved in this effort. I simply wish to \nacknowledge a few. First of all, the Veterans' Affairs Committee, under \nthe leadership of Senator Akaka, has been very significant in bringing \nthis matter together, getting it through the Senate and now making this \npart of a conference report. There are other Members whom I will \nidentify later who have been involved, but for the time being, thanks \nare owed to many people for this Wounded Warrior Act.\n\n  Our report also includes a number of provisions to ensure that our \nservicemembers and their families are able to maintain a high quality \nof life. It authorizes a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for all \nuniform service personnel, half of a percent more than the President \nproposed, and an expansion and improvement of education assistance and \nsupport for family members. I will insert for the Record at the end of \nmy comments a much more lengthy list with specific details of the \nimprovements in compensation and quality of life for our uniform \npersonnel.\n  Second, readiness for our ongoing engagements, primarily those in \nIraq and Afghanistan, includes providing equipment, training, \ntechnology, and the authorities our Armed Forces need to prevail in \ncombat today. For example, our report authorizes over $16 billion for \nmine resistant ambush protected vehicles, MRAPs, to protect against the \nthreat of IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan, consistent with the Department \nof Defense's amended budget request responding to urgent operational \nneeds in the theater. Readiness also includes continuing to look ahead \nto ensure that our Armed Forces are appropriately transforming to be \nready to meet emergent threats, to address long-term readiness. This \nauthorization bill increases investments in defense science and \ntechnology programs for a total authorization of nearly $11 billion, \n$142 million more than the budget request. It includes authorization \nfor a number of specific additions to our fleets of ships, submarines, \naircraft carriers, ground systems, and aircraft. Again, a longer list \nwill be inserted at the end of my statement.\n  The third priority is management. Sound management and oversight are \ncritical for us to ensure that every dollar spent on national defense \nis spent wisely and that every initiative carried out by the Department \nof Defense is done so efficiently and effectively. The conference \nreport establishes a chief management officer in the Department of \nDefense and in each of the military departments to ensure for the first \ntime that these issues receive the continuous, top-level attention they \nneed and deserve. The conference report would also address a number of \nspecific management challenges that have arisen over the past few \nyears. It will require private security contractors operating on the \nbattlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan to comply with Department of \nDefense regulations on the use of force as well as orders and \ndirectives from commanders. It will establish a commission on wartime \ncontracting in Iraq and Afghanistan to monitor reconstruction, \nsecurity, and logistics support contracts and to make recommendations \nto improve the contracting process. It will also establish a special \ninspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, as we already have in \nplace in Iraq.\n  Further in the area of management, the Department of Defense has lost \nits institutional capability to manage the hundreds of billions of \ndollars it spends on goods and services each year. In recent years, we \nhave seen an alarming lack of acquisition planning across the \nDepartment, the excessive use of time-and-materials contracts, \nundefinitized contracts, and other open-ended commitments of DOD funds, \nand a pervasive failure to perform contract oversight and management \nfunctions so necessary to protect the taxpayers' interests. Just last \nmonth, the Commission on Army Acquisition and Program Management in \nExpeditionary Operations reported that systemic failures in the DOD \nacquisition system have left the Department vulnerable to fraud, waste, \nand abuse. These problems have been particularly acute in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, but they are in no way limited to Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe conference report includes the Acquisition Improvement and \nAccountability Act of 2007 which would address these problems with the \nmost sweeping piece of Government acquisition reform legislation in \nmore than a decade. Among other things, it will tighten the rules for \nDOD acquisition of major weapons systems and subsystems, components and \nspare parts, to reduce the risk of contract overpricing, cost overruns, \nand failure to meet contract schedules and performance requirements.\n  For example, section 816 of the conference report requires the DOD to \nreview systemic deficiencies that lead to cost overruns on major \ndefense acquisition programs, and section 814 of the conference report \ntightens data requirements applicable to contractors on such programs. \nFurther, it will establish a defense acquisition workforce development \nfund to ensure that the Department of Defense has the people and the \nskills needed to effectively manage DOD contracts. It will strengthen \nstatutory protections for contractor employees who blow the whistle on \nwaste, fraud, and abuse on DOD contracts by providing for the first \ntime a private right of action in Federal court for contractor \nemployees who are subject to reprisal for their efforts to protect the \ntaxpayers' interests. A number of other management provisions will be \nincluded in my remarks at the conclusion and made part of the Record.\n  The conference report identifies all funding provided for programs, \nprojects, and activities that were not requested in the President's \nbudget. For the first time the report identifies the names of Members \nrequesting such funding. This information was made available to the \ngeneral public in an electronically searchable format on the Armed \nServices Committee Web site on December 7. I ask unanimous consent that \na letter I signed at the conclusion\n\n[[Page S15600]]\n\nof the conference certifying compliance with the requirements of rule \nXLIV be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: In accordance with the requirements of \n     paragraph 3 of Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     I hereby certify, with regard to the conference report on \n     H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2008, that each congressionally directed spending item, \n     limited tax benefit, and limited tariff benefit, if any, in \n     the conference report, or in the joint statement of managers \n     accompanying the conference report, has been identified \n     through a list including the name of each Senator who \n     submitted a request to the Committee on Armed Services for \n     each item so identified, and that such information was posted \n     on the Committee website at approximately 8:30 a.m. on \n     December 7, 2007.\n       In addition, the certifications received by the Committee \n     pursuant to paragraph 6(a)(5) of such rule have been posted \n     on the Committee website in accordance with the requirements \n     of the rule.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. A few other comments on some specific provisions. First, \nthe conference report includes a provision that would restore the \ncollective bargaining and appeals rights for Department of Defense \nemployees who are included in the national security personnel system. I \nam pleased we were able to work out language on a bipartisan basis that \nenables the Department of Defense to move forward with personnel reform \nwithout denying its employees those well-established rights. The ball \nis now in the Department of Defense's court to prove it can implement a \nnew performance management system in a manner that is transparent and \nfair and can gain the acceptance of the Department's civilian \nemployees.\n  Second, the conference report includes a provision to improve and \nexpand the special immigrant visa program and expand priority 2 \nconsiderations under the U.S. refugee program to those Iraqis who have \nassisted our efforts in Iraq and similar consideration for certain \nhighly vulnerable religious minorities in Iraq. I am pleased that the \nconference report includes this provision.\n  I make note of one measure that will not be included in the \nconference report, sadly, and that is the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of \n2007. This critical legislation would have broadened Federal \njurisdiction to hate crimes motivated by gender, disability, sexual \norientation, and gender identity. I am deeply disappointed that the \nHouse conferees were unwilling to include this provision in the \nconference report and unwilling to put it to a vote as part of the \nconference report in the House of Representatives. This provision has \nmy full backing; 60 of us voted essentially for this bill in a vote \nbefore the Senate. I hope our colleagues will support it when we bring \nit up for a vote at a future time.\n  Finally, I congratulate Senator McCain on his first conference report \nas ranking member of the committee. I thank my dear friend Senator \nWarner for continuing to be such a great partner, when Senator McCain \nwas understandably unavailable. This bill could not have happened \nwithout Senator McCain and without Senator Warner. I also take my hat \noff to Ike Skelton who chaired our conference. His even temper and \nplain decency helped smooth a number of rough edges. I will include at \nthe end of my comments a list of the staff of the Armed Services \nCommittee who worked so tremendously hard to bring this annual bill to \nthe point where we now, hopefully, will see its adoption, see the \nbenefits for our troops and their families and our Nation.\n  I also want to add to the names of those who worked so hard on the \nWounded Warrior legislation Senator Patty Murray of Washington. She has \nbeen a leader in this effort and I pay special tribute to her, along \nwith other Members who have worked so hard on the Wounded Warrior \nlegislation.\n  The conference report includes improvements in compensation and \nquality of life for the men and women in uniform, in addition to the \n3.5 percent pay raise for uniformed personnel, including: Authorizing \npayment of combat related special compensation to servicemembers \nmedically retired for a combat related disability. Payment is equal to \nthe amount of retired pay forfeited because of the prohibition on \nconcurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA disability \ncompensation; reducing below age 60 the age at which a member of a \nreserve component may draw retirement pay by 3 months for every \naggregate 90 days' service on duty under certain mobilization \nauthorities; enhancing reserve education assistance benefits, including \nauthorizing servicemembers eligible for education benefits under the \nReserve Education Assistance Program to use those benefits for 10 years \nafter separation, allowing separated servicemembers to regain \neligibility by rejoining a reserve component; and authorizing \neligibility for increased benefits by aggregating 3 years of qualifying \nservice or more; and extending the prohibition on an increase in \nTRICARE fees for retirees and reservists and increasing funds for the \nDefense Health Program; requiring the Secretary of Defense to establish \na Family Readiness Council and develop a comprehensive policy and plans \nto improve the support for and coordination of family readiness \nprograms; and amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow \ncertain spouses and children of servicemembers residing under orders in \nforeign countries to treat their time accompanying the servicemember as \nresidence in the United States for the purpose of satisfying \ncitizenship requirements.\n  The Walter Reed Hospital investigations made clear that we need to \nimprove the care we provide to our veterans, and especially to our \nwounded warriors. Our Nation has a moral obligation to provide quality \nhealth care to the men and women who put on our Nation's uniform and \nare wounded or injured fighting our Nation's wars. This obligation \nextends from the point of injury, through evacuation from the \nbattlefield, to first-class medical facilities in the United States, \nand ends only when the wounds are healed. When wounds may continue to \nimpact a veteran for a lifetime, we have an obligation to continue to \nprovide quality care.\n  In an effort to better meet this obligation, the conference report \nincludes portions of the Senate and House passed legislation to improve \nservices for wounded warriors. This legislation reflects close \ncollaboration between the Committees on Armed Services and Veterans' \nAffairs. Some of the Conference Report's provisions would: Require the \nDOD and VA to jointly develop a comprehensive policy on improvements to \ncare, management, and transition of recovering servicemembers in an \noutpatient status; expand treatment and research for traumatic brain \ninjuries, post-traumatic stress disorder, and traumatic eye injuries; \nguarantee combat veterans mental health evaluations within 30 days of \ntheir request; require the DOD to use the VA Schedule for Rating \nDisabilities in determining servicemember disabilities; increase from 2 \nto 5 years the period during which recently separated combat veterans \nmay seek care from the VA; require the DOD to use the VA presumption of \nsound condition in establishing eligibility of servicemembers for \ndisability retirement; and increase leave under the Family Medical \nLeave Act for caregivers of seriously injured servicemembers from 12 to \n26 weeks.\n  The conference report will ensure that our service men and women are \nprovided with the equipment, training, technology, and authorities they \nneed to prevail in combat, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nSpecifically, the conference report: Added over $16 billion for all \nknown Service and Special Operations Command requirements for mine-\nresistant ambush protected, MRAP, vehicles that improve protection for \nour troops exposed to the improvised explosive device, IED, threat in \nIraq and Afghanistan; funded over $4 billion for the Joint Improvised \nExplosive Device Defeat Office, JIEDDO, and directed JIEDDO to invest \nat least $50.0 million in blast injury research and over $150.0 million \nfor the procurement of IED jammers for the Army; and authorized fiscal \nyear 2008 end strengths for the Army and Marine Corps of 525,400 and \n189,000, respectively, which is an increase of 13,000 for\n\n[[Page S15601]]\n\nthe Army and 9,000 for the Marine Corps.\n  The conference report also seeks to make sure tomorrow's service men \nand women are provided with the equipment and technology they need to \nprevail in future operations. To this end, the conference report \npromotes the transformation of the Armed Forces to meet the threats of \nthe 21st century, including: Requiring the Secretary of Defense to \nobligate sufficient annual amounts to develop and procure a competitive \npropulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter, JSF, program in order \nto conduct a competitive propulsion source selection, and adding $196.9 \nmillion to the Joint Strike Fighter program in fiscal year 2008 for \nthis effort; authorizing construction for one Army High Speed Vessel \nand five Navy Battle Force warships, including the first ship of the \nCVN-21 aircraft carrier class; providing multiyear procurement \nauthority for Virginia class submarines, and adding $588 million in \nadvance procurement funding to support buying an additional submarine \nin 2010; adding $300 million in advance procurement funding for 3 T-AKE \nclass supply ships, and $50 million in advance procurement for a tenth \nLPD-17 class amphibious ship; adding $2.28 billion for procurement of 8 \nadditional C-17 Globemaster strategic lift aircraft; and adding $51 \nmillion to the budget request to provide increased space situational \nawareness capabilities to address concerns raised as a result of the \nrecent Chinese kinetic anti-satellite weapons test.\n  Devoting modest resources and effort to sound management practices \nensures that our defense dollars are well spent. The conferees included \nseveral provisions designed to enhance the management of the DOD. \nSpecifically, these provisions would: Provide that the Deputy Secretary \nof Defense is the Chief Management Officer of the DOD, and establish a \nfull-time position of Deputy Chief Management Officer, with the rank of \nUnder Secretary, to ensure continuous top-level attention to the \nmanagement problems of the Department; strengthen oversight of \nreconstruction activities in Afghanistan by establishing a Special \nInspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, modeled after the \nSpecial Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction; repeal the authority \nof the DOD to establish a new labor relations system and restore \ncollective bargaining and appeals rights; and allow the Department to \ncontinue efforts to develop and implement a new pay for performance \nsystem, but only if the system is implemented in a manner that is \nconsistent with existing labor relations requirements; tighten the \nrules for competition between Federal employees and private \ncontractors, to ensure that Federal employees are given fair \nconsideration for work to be performed for the Department of Defense.\n\n  The conferees also included the Acquisition Improvement and \nAccountability Act of 2007 in the conference report. These provisions \nwould improve the management and oversight of the DOD acquisition \nprograms, and, specifically, would: Require the private security \ncontractors operating on the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan to \ncomply with DOD regulations and rules on the use of force, as well as \norders and directives from combatant commanders regarding force \nprotection, security, health, safety, and interaction with local \nnationals; establish a Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan to study and investigate Federal agency contracting for \nreconstruction, logistics support, and security functions in those \ncountries, and make recommendations as to how contracting processes \ncould be improved in the future; establish a defense acquisition \nworkforce development fund to provide a minimum of $300 million in \nfiscal year 2008, and increasing amounts thereafter, to ensure that the \nDOD has the people and the skills needed to effectively manage the \nDOD's contracts; strengthen statutory protections for contractor \nemployees who blow the whistle on waste, fraud and abuse on DOD \ncontracts by providing, for the first time, a private right of action \nin Federal court for contractor employees who are subject to reprisal \nfor their efforts to protect the taxpayers' interests; and tighten the \nrules for DOD acquisition of major weapon systems and subsystems, \ncomponents and spare parts to reduce the risk of contract overpricing, \ncost overruns, and failure to meet contract schedules and performance \nrequirements.\n  The conference report also includes a provision that would build new \nflexibility into specialty metals requirements to ensure that the DOD \ncan acquire the weapon systems needed by our men and women in uniform. \nIn particular, the provision contains four new exceptions to the \nspecialty metals requirements: a new exemption for commercial, off-the-\nshelf items; a new de minimis exception for items that contain \nrelatively small amounts, less than 2 percent by weight, of non-\ncompliant material; a new national security exception for items that \nare needed by our warfighters; and a new ``market basket'' exception \nfor dual-use items. The exceptions for commercial, off-the-shelf items \nand de minimis amounts of non-compliant material are particularly \nimportant, because they apply to purchases by the Department and by \ndefense contractors and subcontractors at any tier, regardless of \nwhether the items acquired are systems, subsystems, assemblies, \nsubassemblies, or components. Because commercial items such as engines \nand generators are built almost exclusively out of commercial, off-the-\nshelf components, and any military-unique components are likely to \nconstitute less than 2 percent of the specialty metals included in the \nfinal product, they too can now be purchased by DOD and its contractors \nwithout the cumbersome need for a waiver.\n  In addition, the provision would eliminate the Anti-Deficiency Act as \nan enforcement mechanism for specialty metals requirements, ensuring \nthat noncompliance can now be treated as a routine contract violation, \nsubject to appropriate contractual penalties, and not as a potential \ncriminal offense that precludes the acceptance of a product. Taken \ntogether, these changes should reduce the inordinate amount of time and \neffort that the Department has had to spend over the last 2 years \ntrying to enforce compliance down to the component level on major \nweapon systems.\n  The conference report also included a number of other noteworthy \nprovisions, including: Requiring a report on Pakistan's efforts to \neliminate safe havens for violent extremists on its territory and to \nprevent cross border incursions by those extremists into Afghanistan; \nrenewing authority for the Special Operations Command to provide \nsupport to foreign forces, groups or individuals who are supporting or \nfacilitating ongoing military operations by U.S. special operations \nforces; and expanding the Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa program and \ncreating a priority 2 refugee category for those Iraqis who have \nprovided assistance to the United States and for certain highly \nvulnerable Iraqi religious minorities.\n  In the area of nonproliferation and cooperative threat reduction, the \nconference report: authorized an increase of $230 million to the amount \nrequested for the Department of Energy nonproliferation programs; \nauthorized an increase of $80 million for the DOD's Cooperative Threat \nReduction, CTR, Program; and expanded the CTR program to countries \noutside of the former Soviet Union and adopted provisions that would \nrepeal all of the required annual certifications.\n  The conference report also authorized $9.8 billion for ballistic \nmissile defense, a net reduction of $597 million below the budget \nrequest. The conference continued to focus on effective near term \ncapabilities against existing short and medium range threats by \nauthorizing an additional $120 million for such systems. Further, the \nconferees authorized provisions to improve the budgeting, acquisition, \nand oversight of missile defense programs, and to limit the use of \nfunds for construction and deployment activities for the proposed \nEuropean missile defense deployment until the governments of Poland and \nthe Czech Republic give final approval of any bilateral deployment \nagreements negotiated with the United States, and Congress receives an \nindependent assessment of options for missile defense in Europe.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the list of staff \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee to which I earlier referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S15602]]\n\n          Staff Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee\n\n       Borawski, June M.; Brewer, Leah C.; Bryan, Joseph M.; \n     Caniano, William M.; Carrillo, Pablo E.; Clark, Jonathan D.; \n     Cohen, Ilona R.; Collins, David G.; Cork, Fletcher L.; \n     Cowart, Christine E.; Cox, Jr., Daniel J.; Creedon, Madelyn \n     R.; Cronin, Kevin A.; DeBobes, Richard D.; Dickinson, Marie \n     Fabrizio; Eisen, Gabriella; Farkas, Evelyn N.; Fieldhouse, \n     Richard W.; Forbes, Diana Tabler; Greene, Creighton.\n       Howard, Gary J.; Hutton, IV, Paul C.; Jacobson, Mark R.; \n     Kiley, Gregory T.; Kingston, Jessica L.; Kostiw, Michael V.; \n     Kuiken, Michael J.; Leeling, Gerald J.; Levine, Peter K.; \n     Maurer, Derek J.; McConnell, Thomas K.; McCord, Michael J.; \n     Monahan, William G.P.; Morriss, David M.; Niemeyer, Lucian \n     L.; Noblet, Michael J.; Parker, Bryan D.; Pasha, Ali Z.; \n     Paul, Christopher J.; Pearson, Cindy; Pollock, David.\n       Quirk V, John H.; Rubin, Benjamin L.; Rusten, Lynn F.; \n     Sebold, Brian F.; Seraphin, Arun A.; Smith, Travis E.; \n     Soofer, Robert M.; Stackley, Sean G.; Svinicki, Kristine L.; \n     Sutey, William K.; Wagner, Mary Louise; Walsh, Richard F.; \n     Wells, Breon N.; White, Dana W.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I sincerely congratulate Chairman \nLevin, the members of our committee, and our House colleagues for their \nwork on the conference report to accompany the fiscal year 2008 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. With provisions that authorize a \nconsiderable pay raise for all military personnel, increase Army and \nMarine end-strength, reform the system that serves wounded veterans, \nand help prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in defense contracting and \nprocurement, this conference report undoubtably contains many important \nelements that will help support our national defense and, in \nparticular, our servicemen and women. However, this conference report \nalso contains other provisions that are very problematic. In fact, so \nflawed are those provisions that, despite all that is good in the \nconference report--and there is much--I must--cannot support this \nyear's report.\n  In this year's conference report, and the accompanying bill, there \nare $5.3 billion in earmarks. That does not even include about $330 \nmillion worth of military construction pork ``airdropped'' by the House \nAppropriators despite having enacted ethics reform legislation just 2 \nmonths ago. Of that $5.3 billion, $2.3 billion came from the Senate and \n$4.1 billion originated in the House. The disparity between the two \nbills is unprecedented.\n  Almost half of the total amount of pork in this conference report, \nand the accompanying bill, arises from a single provision that \nauthorizes the procurement of eight C-17 Globemaster aircraft that the \nDefense Department states we neither need nor can afford. I should also \nnote that this conference report stripped out an important amendment \nthat called for all congressionally directed spending on new programs \nand grants to be subject to full and open competition. In my view, the \nmassive pork spending in this conference report renders it a frontal \nassault on this body's purported commitment to ethics and earmark \nreform and, in my view, results in a inexcusable failure in our \nobligation to the taxpayer.\n  The conference report also contains troubling provisions that will \nlikely fail to cure abuses in multiyear contracting, possibly weaken \nthe ability of the Department of Defense to waive protectionist \nrestrictions on the purchase of weapon systems containing specialty \nmetals, and allow the Air Force to precipitously retire fully-capable \naircraft just so it can buy new ones. Therefore, while many elements in \nthis conference report are undoubtably helpful, I regrettably cannot \nsign it.\n  Clearly, the most egregious single item in this report is a provision \nthat authorizes the Air Force $2.28 billion to buy eight C-17 \nGlobemaster aircraft. I note that the dollar amount associated with \nthis one provision, which originated in the House, nearly equals the \ntotal amount of earmarks in this bill that arose from the entire Senate \nside.\n  This provision is particularly problematic given that the Secretary \nof Defense has consistently maintained that the Defense Department met \nits strategic airlift requirements with the final purchase of C-17 \naircraft authorized by the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act and, \ntherefore, simply does not need any more C-17 aircraft. In fact, during \ndeliberations with the conferees, the Defense Department conveyed \nconcern that continuing the C-17 production line would compete with the \nDepartment's number one priority for strategic airlift, the \nrecapitalization of the aerial refueling tanker fleet. Reflecting that \nview, the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2008 included no \nfunding for additional C-17 aircraft and, as it did last year, asked \nfor money to begin shutting down the C-17 production line.\n  In 2007, Congress allowed the Air Force to buy 10 C-17 aircraft above \nwhat it actually needed. This year, in their collective wisdom, the \nconferees have seen it fit to repeat that multibillion dollar mistake \nby providing for a follow-on purchase, in the face of the \nadministration's admonitions. At the end of the day, this provision \ndoes little else than subsidize the continuation of the contractor's C-\n17 production line, which is nearing its end--a corporate handout at \nits worst.\n  I am particularly concerned about this provision given that I have \nuncovered compelling evidence of possible wrongdoing in the Air Force's \ninteraction with the contractor on the C-17 matter. That evidence \npoints to a disturbing level of effort--undertaken jointly by the Air \nForce and the contractor--to undermine the current program-of-record \nand support a procurement proposal for which there is no validated \nrequirement and which is not reflected in either the President's Budget \nRequest or even the Air Force's own Future Years Defense Program, FYDP. \nIn its rank aggressiveness, the evidence I found, and referred to the \nappropriate authorities for further review, is not unlike some of what \nI observed in the Boeing tanker lease scandal. From those authorities, \nI understand that a review is pending. When faced with similar \ncircumstances concerning the Boeing tanker matter, we suspended \nprocurement activities until all related investigations were concluded. \nPrudence requires that, at a minimum, we do the same here.\n  This conference report also includes authorization for 52 new \nmilitary construction projects totaling $328 million requested by \nindividual Members of the House that were not vetted or included in \neither the House- or the Senate-passed National Defense authorization \nbills for fiscal year 2008. On October 30, 2007, the House \nAppropriations Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Subcommittee \nslipped this bloated earmark list to the House Armed Services Committee \nwith no public review or semblance of transparency. And, in order to \nmaintain comity with the appropriators, the majority of defense bill \nconferees, over my objections, decided to insert the authorizations \ninto our conference report. Not only is this is a classic example of \n``parachuting'' or ``airdropping'' earmarks into a conference report in \nthe dead of night, which we ostensibly sought to stop with the \nenactment of a new ethics law two months ago, it is also an abrogation \nof our role as authorizers to fully vet each new matter we consider--\nrather than blindly accept what the appropriators tell us. Despite the \nrhetoric of a ``new day'' for accountability, allowing such practices \nreflects that there is no transparency in this process. Regrettably, \nthe conferees appear content to hide behind parliamentary tricks and \nmental gymnastics while knowing full well the spirit and intent of the \nreform we sought to achieve earlier this year. Saying that over $300 \nmillion in pork construction projects can be added in conference means \nthat there is essentially no limit on how much a program or a project \ncan balloon during conference. This is a ``hog call'' if I've ever \nheard one.\n\n  Senate amendment 828 to the Senate-passed Bill applied Federal \ncompetitive bidding laws and regulations to congressional earmarks. \nRather modest in what it sought to do, that provision would not have \nprohibited Members of Congress from earmarking defense dollars. \nInstead, it simply would have ensured that taxpayers received the \nadvantage of a competitive process. Under that provision, a Member of \nCongress in either body would have retained the prerogative to fund an \nactivity that he deems worthy, but a full and open competitive process \nwould be used to select the most qualified entity to undertake the \nproject. If an activity is important enough to require earmarking of \ntaxpayers dollars, that legislative proposal would simply have required \ntransparency and full and open\n\n[[Page S15603]]\n\ncompetition. Moreover, waiver authority was built into the provision to \nallow the Department reasonable flexibility in its implementation. In \nmy view, that important provision should have been included in this \nconference report.\n  The provision that I originally offered as an amendment to the Senate \nversion of the bill clarified how much savings would be required to \nachieve under a multiyear contract before Congress could authorize that \nprocurement mechanism to buy the largest and most expensive weapon \nsystems. That clarification was important to help the Defense \nDepartment use multiyear contracts responsibly to capitalize on mature, \nwell-run programs by buying at economically efficient rates--not to \ninsulate poorly performing systems from effective congressional \noversight. While the multiyear contracting provision in the conference \nreport is helpful, it contains language that allows the Department to \nwaive its stringent requirements in a way that eviscerates the \nprovision's underlying intent. In other words, the waiver provision \nappears to create a loophole through which the Department can keep \nchronically poorly performing programs ``on rails'' and away from \nmeaningful congressional oversight.\n  For some time now, I have been concerned about how the Air Force, in \nparticular, has been creating requirements for procuring new aircraft \nby precipitously retiring older but reliable, platforms to bulk up buys \nof new aircraft platforms. This has required this committee to \nlegislatively prohibit, in previous authorization bills, the retirement \nof KC-135s, B-52s, C-5s, U-2s and C-130s. In this year's conference \nreport, we have unwisely relieved at least a couple of those \nrestrictions.\n  The Air Force's number one acquisition priority is to replace its \naged KC-135 fleet of tanker aircraft. The Air Force's original attempt \nto replace that fleet led to the now infamous Boeing tanker lease \nscandal, which resulted in jail-time for a top Air Force procurement \nofficial and Boeing's chief operating officer.\n  This time, the Air Force intends to implement a ``comprehensive'' \ntanker replacement strategy, one component of which is the purchase of \na new, commercial-derivative tanker. On that component, two contractor \nteams have submitted offers responding to a request for proposals, \nwhich the Air Force is now reviewing. A contract may be awarded as soon \nas late February 2008. Unfortunately, on the other two components of \nthe strategy--implementing a complementary commercial fee-for-service \nprogram and re-engining some of its older KC-135s--the Air Force has \nmade no serious headway. Against that backdrop, I remain concerned that \nthe Air Force may simply maximize its desired purchase of new planes. \nSeveral studies conducted by both the Air Force and independent groups \nindicate that the current KC-135 fleet is viable for the intermediate \nterm. Given that taxpayers have made a significant investment in the \nKC-135 fleet, the Air Force should not be permitted to precipitously \nretire them simply because it wants to buy as many new tanker aircraft \nas possible.\n  The ``Air Force Fleet Viability Board, KC-135 Assessment Report'' \ncautioned that, before retiring KC-135s, the Air Force needs to conduct \ndestructive testing so it can proceed on an informed basis. However, \nthe Air Force has not complied with that recommendation. Nonetheless, \nsection 135 of this conference report allows the Secretary of the Air \nForce to retire immediately 48 KC-135E tanker aircraft. It also allows \nthe Air Force to start retiring the remaining 37 KC-135E during fiscal \nyear 08 after contract award for the KC-X tanker replacement aircraft. \nOnce again, without reasonably restricting the Air Force's retirement \nof KC-135s, we may have lost the ability to ensure that the Air Force \ndoes not replace its current fleet of tanker aircraft by simply \nmaximizing its purchase of commercial-derivative aircraft a solution \nthat simply disregards the interests of the taxpayer.\n  A provision on the retirement of C-130 airlift aircraft is similarly \nimprovident. That provision, section 133, would repeal the requirement \nin the fiscal year 2007 National Defense Authorization Act that any C-\n130E aircraft retired in fiscal year 2007 be maintained in a condition \nthat would allow recall of the aircraft to active service. Another \nprovision, section 134, would allow for the retirement of 29 more C-\n130E aircraft in fiscal year 2008.\n  Without the Department's requirements for tactical airlift capability \nwell-defined, it would be premature to retire any C-130 aircraft, at \nleast until: (1) an Air Force Fleet Viability Board has conducted an \nassessment of the C-130E/H fleet of aircraft; and (2) the results of \nthe Intra-Theater Lift Capability Study, ITLCS, phases 1 and 2, \nidentify the right mix and number of intra-theater airlift assets. \nTherefore, I believe that we should not retire any more C-130 aircraft \nuntil the Department determines what its intra-theater lift \nrequirements are and that aircraft already should not be stripped for \nparts or destroyed until we have the results of the requirements \nanalysis.\n  This conference report also contains several policy provisions that \nweakens the broad waiver authority that the Department of Defense \ncurrently has with regard to weapon systems that contain specialty \nmetals. For a long time, I have tried to lessen the impact of, if not \nentirely eliminate, ``buy America'' restrictions, including the Berry \namendment, in Defense Department purchases. Legislation restricting the \nDepartment's purchases along those lines tend to direct spending for \nthe benefit of a particular entity or congressional district. So, I am \nconcerned that, with the specialty metals/``buy America'' policy \nprovisions contained in this conference report, we may have further \nopened the door for more pork legislation in the future. Finally, as \nthose policy provisions were not in either the Senate- or the House-\npassed defense bills, I question whether those provisions should have \nbeen added in conference.\n\n  Another objectionable provision in the conference report would \nestablish a policy that future major combatant ships be nuclear-\npowered, regardless of requirements, cost, or other considerations that \ngo into selecting a new ship class propulsion system. The Secretary of \nDefense could only seek a waiver of this requirement if he determines \nthat nuclear propulsion for a future ship is not in the national \ninterest. If the next cruiser class, CG(X), is required to be nuclear-\npowered as a result of this policy, its cost will increase by greater \nthan $1 billion and the ship will be delayed several years. The result \nwould be significantly increased cost, fewer ships, and delays in \nfielding the next major surface combatant class of ships. At a time \nwhen the Secretary of the Navy is doing all he can to reform how the \nNavy goes about buying its biggest and most expensive weapon systems, \nthis provision is a move in the wrong direction.\n  The conference report also includes a provision that sets a very \ndangerous precedent by in effect forcing the Department to take action \nfor the benefit of certain Members of Congress. Section 2846, entitled \n``Transfer of jurisdiction, former Nike missile site, Grosse Ile, \nMichigan'', mandates that the Department of Defense spend funds from an \naccount that has historically been guided by an objective assessment of \nthe risk to human health. This provision requires the Corps of \nEngineers to clean up a site to a higher standard than the Army deems \nnecessary in Gross Ile, Michigan, so the property can be used as a \nwildlife refuge. Let me be clear: I have nothing against refuges. But, \nthe Department of Defense has over 9,900 properties evaluated as \nFormerly Used Defense Sites, FUDS, and must conduct cleanup projects at \nmore than 3,000 of them. The FUDS program costs the Department over \n$250 million a year and is expected to cost the Department $18.7 \nbillion when all said and done.\n  We simply cannot afford allowing individual Members of Congress to \nmove their pet projects to the top of the priority list, completely \ndisregarding the risk to health and safety of other more vital \nprojects. Clean-up should be based on the priority of risk, not \npolitical muscle.\n  There was another conference decision which I believe may be very \ndetrimental to our role as an authorizing committee. Senate-passed \nbill, Senate section 2811, ``General Military Construction Transfer \nAuthority,'' was intended to extend to military construction accounts \nthe current congressional review process for requests from\n\n[[Page S15604]]\n\nthe Department of Defense for the reprogramming of funds between \naccounts. Currently, for every funding account except military \nconstruction, the Secretary of Defense notifies all four defense \ncommittees of his intent to transfer funds from one account to another \nduring the year to better manage obligations. However, for military \nconstruction accounts, the Secretary sends a notification only to the \nHouse and Senate subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs. The Senate provision sought to extend that oversight \nresponsibility to our conferees on the House and Senate Armed Services \nCommittees. That was a good provision. It was included in our Senate \nmarkup without question and was agreed to by both the House and Senate \nstaffs during conference.\n  However, at the last moment during conference deliberations, members \nfrom the House Appropriations Committee persuaded my fellow conference \nleaders to drop the provision for no substantive reason, other than it \nwould diminish the power of the appropriators. This capitulation is \nvery troubling. The provision was written in response to recent actions \nby the Appropriations subcommittees that either held up military \nconstruction reprogramming requests based on parochial interests or \napproved reprogramming requests over the objections of this committee's \nstaff. In particular, we were concerned by the proposal made by the Air \nForce to the Committees on Appropriations in January 2007 to use the \nexisting reprogramming process to carry out a ``new start'' military \nconstruction project that had not been authorized by law--a clear \nchallenge to the role of the authorizing committees over new start \nmilitary construction.\n  The committee was also concerned that the appropriators in both \nbodies approved a reprogramming in July 2007 for a military \nconstruction project for which no funds were appropriated in fiscal \nyear 2007, as a favor to a particular Member--disregarding the policy \nimplications of the action. Also, earlier this year, the Senate \nappropriators held up approval of two reprogramming requests for \nprojects in Virginia in order to force the Department to act on other \nreprogramming requests. If this committee had equal authority, we would \nhave the ability to prevent such shamelessly parochial and \ninstitutionally divisive behavior. Senate section 2811 would have put \nan end to such activity between the appropriators and authorizers by \nestablishing equal footing with regard to reprogramming requests on \nmilitary construction projects. I am at a complete loss why it was \ndropped from our conference agreement.\n  Again, while there is much in this year's conference report that is \nvery worthwhile and helpful to helping provide for the national \ndefense, the elements contained within it that move in the wrong \ndirection are too numerous, too large, and too costly for any Member to \nignore. With those elements in this conference report, I simply cannot \nin good conscience tell the American people that this is our best--that \nthis conference report represents our best vision for the country on \nmatters that relate to, or affect, our servicemen and women and how we \nsecure our national security interests abroad. By declining to sign \nthis conference report today, I respectfully convey to the chairman and \nmy fellow conferees my belief that we can, and for the sake of both the \nwarfighter and taxpayer, we must do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to thank my colleagues, \nboth in the House and Senate, for their tremendous bipartisan work on \nthe fiscal year 2008 national defense authorization bill.\n  The Congress has passed the national defense authorization bill every \nyear since 1959, and I have had the great privilege to have had a hand \nin this annual piece of legislation each of my 29 years in the Senate.\n  This bill accomplishes the following: supports our troops deployed in \nharm's way; bolsters the readiness of our Armed Forces; reforms the \nacquisition practices of the Department of Defense; addresses the \nproblems in military medical care uncovered at Walter Reed and \nelsewhere; provides needed equipment to protect our deployed forces; \nand strengthens the quality of life of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines, and their families.\n  To care for those who serve in uniform, their families, and retired \nveterans, this legislation authorizes $696.4 billion which includes the \nbase budget for fiscal year 2008--$507 billion--and the President's \nemergency supplemental requests for Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global \nwar on terrorism--$189 billion--made in February, July, and October.\n  It authorizes a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for all \nuniformed service personnel.\n  It continues the authorization to pay over 25 separate bonuses and \nspecial pay critical to successful recruiting and retention.\n  It authorizes fiscal year 2008 end strengths for the Army and Marine \nCorps of 525,400 and 189,000 respectively, which is an increase of \n13,000 for the Army and 9,000 for the Marine Corps.\n  It includes the Wounded Warrior Act, which will improve health care \nand benefits for recovering veterans, recovering servicemembers and \ntheir families, and begin the process of reform of the Department of \nDefense, DOD, and Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, disability \nevaluation systems.\n  It requires DOD and Veterans Affairs to jointly develop a \ncomprehensive policy on improvements to care, management, and \ntransition of recovering servicemembers in an outpatient status.\n  It authorizes payment of combat-related special compensation to \nservicemembers medically retired for a combat-related disability. \nPayment is equal to the amount of retired pay forfeited because of the \nprohibition on concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA \ndisability compensation.\n  It reduces below age 60 the age at which a member of a Reserve \ncomponent may draw retirement pay by 3 months for every aggregate 90 \ndays' service on active duty under certain mobilization authorities.\n  It guarantees combat veterans mental health evaluations within 30 \ndays of their request.\n  It includes several provisions to continue to provide best quality \nhealth care to servicemembers and their families and provisions that \nwould enhance the ability of the services to attract health care \npersonnel.\n  It guarantees combat veterans mental health evaluations within 30 \ndays of their request.\n  To ensure that servicemembers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are \nproperly equipped, this legislation adds over $17 billion for mine \nresistant ambush protected--MRAP--vehicles that improve protection for \nour troops exposed to the improvised explosive device, IED, threat in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  It funds over $4 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device \nDefeat Office, JIEDDO.\n  It authorizes funds to procure ammunition, modernize ammunition \nplants, and protect and enhance military training ranges.\n  To meet current and future threats to our country's national \nsecurity, this bill requires the DOD to develop a competitive engine \nprogram for the Joint Strike Fighter and authorized $480 million for \nthis purpose.\n  It authorizes more than $13 billion for Navy shipbuilding.\n  It provides mulltiyear procurement authority for fiscal years 2009 \nthrough 2013 Virginia-class submarines, and adding $588 million in \nadvance procurement funding to support buying an additional submarine \nin 2010.\n  It adds $51 million to the budget request to provide increased space \nsituational awareness capabilities to address concerns raised as a \nresult of the recent Chinese kinetic antisatellite weapons test.\n  It authorizes $220.4 billion to meet the operation and maintenance \nrequirements of the services to support combat operations and improve \nthe readiness of deploying and nondeploying forces.\n  To ensure for the effective oversight of Department of Defense \ncontracts, contractors, and acquisition workforce, this legislation \nrequires private security contractors operating on the battlefield in \nIraq and Afghanistan to comply with DOD regulations and rules on the \nuse of force, as well as orders and directives from combatant \ncommanders regarding force protection, security, health, safety, and \ninteraction with local nationals.\n\n[[Page S15605]]\n\n  It establishes a Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan to study and investigate Federal agency contracting for \nreconstruction, logistics support, and security functions in those \ncountries, and make recommendations as to how contracting processes \ncould be improved in the future.\n  It strengthens oversight of reconstruction activities in Afghanistan \nby establishing a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \nReconstruction, modeled after the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction.\n  It includes the Acquisition Improvement and Accountability Act of \n2007, which would improve the management and oversight of DOD \nacquisition programs.\n  It strengthens statutory protections for contractor employees who \nblow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse on DOD contracts by \nproviding, for the first time, a private right of action in Federal \ncourt for contractor employees who are subject to reprisal for their \nefforts to protect the taxpayers' interests.\n  To recognize the responsibilities and enhance the role of the \nNational Guard, this legislation includes the National Guard \nEmpowerment Act which authorizes promotion of the Chief of the National \nGuard Bureau to the rank of four-star general and recognizes the \nresponsibilities and enhanced role of the National Guard.\n  Finally, to ensure the effective security and remediation of \nDepartment of Energy sites, this act supports enhanced security at \nDepartment of Energy, DOE, nuclear sites and the development of new \ntechnology to promote environmental cleanup of DOE sites.\n  Madam President, this important bill will maintain our readiness and \nsupport the military's transformation to meet the 21st century's \nthreats. I urge my colleagues to support this crucial legislation.\n  Madam President, I direct persons to the committee report, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008. On page 334 \nthere appears a provision, section 1079, entitled: ``Communications \nwith the Committees On Armed Services of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives.'' I will read a part of it to familiarize people:\n\n       The Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, the \n     director of a national intelligence center, or the head of \n     any element of the intelligence community shall, not later \n     than 45 days after receiving a written request from the Chair \n     or ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services \n     of the Senate or the Committee on Armed Services of the House \n     of Representatives--\n\n  The Senate and the House provide certain information.\n  I worked with this provision at the time it was framed in our \ncommittee, and I want to say for the record that it was never intended, \nnor do I personally find any wording in this amendment, which would \ninclude the daily brief provided to the President of the United States. \nThat is the exclusive property under executive privilege of the \nPresident.\n  Madam President, I wish to add on that list on the Wounded Warrior \nSenator Webb, who took a very active role in that.\n  Our respective leaders have asked us to keep this debate limited as \nbest we can. I know of only one speaker on my side who is seeking 5 \nminutes. I think our distinguished chairman covered the matter very \ncarefully as he always does.\n  It has been a privilege for me to participate in the preparation of \nthis conference report and to work on the other committee matters \nthroughout the year. As the chairman said, Senator McCain is on a \nmission, a mission I happen to support strongly. I am happy to work \nwith Senator Levin instead of Senator McCain. His chief of staff, \nseated next to me, Mike Kostiw, and I were in constant contact with \nhim, and in every way Senator McCain had hands on in the affairs of the \ncommittee this year as ranking member in the preparation of this \nreport.\n  Senator McCain and I have known each other ever since I was Secretary \nof the Navy. He was then in the prison camps. Shortly thereafter, when \nhe joyously returned home to a nation that welcomed him with open \nheart, we have been friends ever since. It was quite logical for him to \nask me to work in his stead. This is the 29th year Senator Levin and I \nhave occupied these two chairs. Particularly the last 17 years, either \nI have been chairman or he has been chairman or ranking member of the \ncommittee. Our partnership is rather extraordinary. I anticipate he \nwill maintain and continue that strong effort to make this committee \nwhat it is, nonpartisan in its function, in large measure, with Senator \nMcCain after my departure a year hence.\n  Again, I salute my good friend for his leadership as chairman this \nyear. He is always open to me and other members of the Republican side \nof the committee to entertain their views very fairly and objectively, \nthoroughly. And together with our superb professional staff, we have \nmanaged to put together a very commendable bill for the Senate and now \nthis conference report for the whole of the Congress.\n  Having said that, I join in his recognition of Ike Skelton and Duncan \nHunter, the two partners we have worked with for many years on the \nHouse side. This was his first year as chairman for Congressman \nSkelton. We worked in the final stages of the preparation of this bill, \nthe four of us, on many key issues to resolve differences between the \nHouse and Senate. Ike Skelton is an extraordinary leader. He has been \non that committee many years and has been about as long as we have in \nthe Congress. We are fortunate to have his services, as we do the \nservices of Senator Levin.\n  I yield the floor. The chairman may wish to recognize a speaker on \nhis side. Then I will recognize a speaker on our side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, before I yield time to Senator Murray, \nlet me all too briefly thank my friend from Virginia. I treasure this \nrelationship. It has been extraordinarily meaningful to me and \nimportant to me and our wives. We still have a year and a few months to \ngo and we will make fullest use of all that time. In the meantime, let \nme extend my thanks to him and my appreciation for the friendship and \nsupport he has always provided, not just to me but to every Member of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my good friend. I wish to add \nour respective wives who have spent long hours waiting for us as we \nhave traveled so many times in these almost 30 years to places all over \nthe world together and left them at home, and many nights late \nhere. They have been a good team to support both of us.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Indeed, they have.\n  I thank the Senator for those comments, and I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Michigan and \nthe Senator from Virginia for their tremendous work on this \nlegislation.\n  I am glad we are considering this bill. And I have come to the floor \ntoday to highlight a section of this legislation that's especially \nimportant to me because it will make a huge difference in the lives of \nour servicemembers and veterans--the Wounded Warriors Act.\n  The Wounded Warriors Act has already passed the Senate once on its \nown. To ensure it passed Congress this year, it was added to this \nDefense bill, too. It is taken longer than I had hoped to get to this \npoint. But today, I'm optimistic that we can pass this bill, and get \nthese much-needed improvements to our troops and our veterans soon. \nThis is a major step toward real change.\n  I want to talk about how we got to this point, and why this bill is \nso necessary. This February, the Washington Post stunned us all with a \nseries of articles on the squalid conditions some of our servicemembers \nwere living in at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\n  The articles described infestations of mice and cockroaches in some \nWalter Reed facilities. They described moldy walls, and broken ceilings \nin the rooms servicemembers were living in while they waited to get \ncare. And the articles described how many of our servicemembers and \ntheir families feel trapped in a bureaucratic ``Catch-22,'' while they \ntry for months to work out their disability ratings.\n  I am proud that Democrats led a bipartisan effort in the Senate to \naddress these problems aggressively. The Wounded Warriors legislation \nwe have now is the result of a historic partnership between two of our \ncommittees--the Veterans' Affairs Committee,\n\n[[Page S15606]]\n\nchaired by Senator Akaka, and the Armed Services Committee, chaired by \nSenator Levin. I want to thank both Senators for their leadership on \nthis.\n  Together, we convened hearings, reached across the aisle, and crafted \nlegislation that will make sure that the men and women who have served \nour country so honorably get the care they deserve when they come home.\n  The more we dug for information, the more we learned about the huge \nproblems we need to address. Last winter, when I visited Walter Reed \nwith our majority leader and other members of the Leadership team, the \nservicemembers we talked to weren't just frustrated with their living \nconditions. They had reached the end of their patience trying to \nnavigate a disability system, which made absolutely no sense to them--\nor to us.\n  And the problem was not limited to servicemembers at Walter Reed. I \nwent home and met with servicemembers in medical hold in Washington \nState--more than 200 people showed up. They, too, were angry and \nfrustrated with their situation. They told me story after story about \nhow they had to struggle to get their disability ratings and fight for \nthe care they needed.\n  It was clear from these meetings that the Defense Department and the \nVA don't have a joint strategy for caring for servicemembers and \nveterans, and that they use inconsistent ratings for disabilities. \nTheir paperwork doesn't even match. How you're rated as disabled by the \nmilitary is completely different than how you're rated by the VA.\n  The result is that our servicemembers get caught in the middle. They \nget lost in the bureaucracy, while trying to get the treatment they \nneed to recover. Too often, our injured servicemembers are the ones \ntrying to figure out how to work out the transition. It's frustrating, \nand it's completely unacceptable.\n  Other servicemembers told us that they have had to struggle to get \nthe right diagnosis for their injuries. Our military has long known \nabout the mental wounds that can be caused by war. But many \nservicemembers still said they got little or no help to cope with \nmental illness.\n  I talked to men and women who said they knew something was wrong. \nThey felt different. And they forgot little things--basic things. They \ndescribed not being able to find their keys after they put them down. \nThey couldn't remember their kids' birthdays. They couldn't even \nremember what they'd done the year--or even the day--before.\n  One young man from a rural community in my home State of Washington \nsaid he came home and felt isolated, unable to talk to his childhood \nfriends. He was 22, but he couldn't remember what he'd learned in \nschool just a few years ago. He said he didn't know who he was any \nmore, and he eventually tried to take his own life.\n  That young man had a traumatic brain injury. He had been around not \none--not five--not 20--but more than 100 explosions while he was on the \nground in Iraq. Even so, he wasn't screened for TBI when he was \ndischarged. No one asked how he was doing. And no one followed up when \nhe got home to ask how he was adjusting to civilian life.\n  This should not happen to any of our servicemembers who have served \nus honorably. Yet that young man's experience is all too common.\n  As a result of our investigation, Democrats said, ``No more.'' It's \nsimply unacceptable that after fighting for our country, our \nservicemembers have had to return and fight against our government for \nthe care they deserve.\n  By passing the Wounded Warriors Act, we are moving aggressively to \nmake sure that these men and women are treated well when they come \nhome. The Wounded Warriors Act lays out a clear path directing the \nDefense Department and the VA to address shortfalls in the care of our \nwounded warriors.\n  It requires the Defense Department and VA to work together to develop \na comprehensive plan to prevent, treat and diagnose TBI and PTSD. It \ncreates DOD centers of excellence for TBI and PTSD to improve our \nunderstanding of these devastating injuries. If directs the two \nagencies to develop a joint electronic health record so that critical \nmedical files aren't lost as our wounded troops move from battlefield \ndoctors, to medicals holds, and on to the VA.\n  The act requires the military and the VA to work together on \ndisability ratings. This is the first step toward bridging the gap \nbetween the VA and the Defense Department. And it requires the military \nto adopt the VA presumption that a disease or an injury is service-\nconnected when our heroes--who were healthy prior to service--have \nspent 6 months or more on active duty.\n\n  The bill also addresses many of the horrifying conditions that our \ntroops found themselves in at Walter Reed and other facilities. It \nensures our servicemembers get adequate severance pay. And it can \nprovide medical care for the families of recovering servicemembers.\n  In addition to the Wounded Warriors Act, the Defense Authorization \nbill includes important provisions passed by the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee aimed at improving care for servicemembers once they \nreach the VA system.\n  As you know, my colleagues on the Committee and I have worked hard to \nget these improvements in place, so I want to take a moment to mention \nthem as well.\n  Under this bill we will require that an initial mental health \nevaluation be-provided to veterans or returning servicemembers no more \nthan 30 days after they ask for one. We will extend the period of \neligibility for VA health care for combat veterans of the Persian Gulf \nWar and future conflicts. That time period will increase from 2 years \nto 5 years after discharge or release. And we'll ensure improvements to \nthe quality of care for veterans with TBI by requiring age-appropriate \nnursing care, and plans to help servicemembers recover and transition \nback into civilian life.\n  While this bill is an important step toward providing our wounded \nwarriors with the level of care they deserve and have earned, it's by \nno means the last step. Much work remains to be done by the DOD and the \nVA. We in Congress will have to keep a close watch to make sure the \nDefense Department and the VA are meeting the goals we've set out here.\n  And as a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, I can assure you that I will be \ndoing just that.\n  I voted against going to war in Iraq. But I've said consistently that \nno matter how you feel about the war, we have an obligation as leaders \nto make sure that our men and women who fight for us get the care they \ndeserve. I'm particularly proud of the way Democrats moved to address \nthe problems facing our returning servicemembers, which clearly wasn't \na priority for the Bush Administration.\n  Democrats said: ``Not on our watch. Not any more.''\n  The Wounded Warrior bill provides real solutions for our troops and \nveterans from the battlefield to the VA and everywhere in between. Our \nservicemembers have always answered the call of duty, but for too long, \nour Government has not answered theirs. I'm proud to say those days are \nover. This bill is part of that commitment. Let's pass it today, so we \ncan get started on these improvements and provide the kind of care our \nservicemembers and veterans deserve. As I said at the beginning of this \nspeech, this is a major step toward real change for our troops.\n\n\n                   Nomination of General James Peake\n\n  While I have the floor, Madam President, I also want to take a minute \nto say a few words about the nomination of GEN James Peake to be the \nnext Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  On Thursday, I joined with my colleagues on the committee and voted \nin favor of his nomination. As we all know, there has been a vacuum at \nthe head of the VA for years now, and for the reasons I have already \nlaid out today, we need someone strong to lead this agency as we work \nto change course there. I do not think we ought to dwell on the \nmistakes of the past. I believe we do have to learn from them.\n  At his confirmation hearing, General Peake pledged to stand up and \nput the needs of veterans above the political needs of the White House. \nHe can guarantee that I am going to hold him to his word because we owe \nour troops nothing less.\n\n[[Page S15607]]\n\n  After fighting for their country, too many have had to fight against \ntheir Government to get the care and benefits they have earned. They \nhave had to contend with bureaucratic ineptitude, a massive claims \nbacklog, and wait times--just to name a few of the many problems at the \nVA.\n  While I believe we shouldn't dwell on the mistakes of the past, I \nbelieve we must learn from them. And I expect General Peake to learn \nfrom the VA's past failures.\n  The veterans of this country deserve a Secretary who is an honest and \nindependent advocate for them--not an apologist for failed \nadministration policies. Yet one of the biggest mistakes made by \nGeneral Peake's predecessor was his blind political allegiance to the \nPresident--at the expense of the veterans he was supposed to serve.\n  In his confirmation hearing, General Peake pledged to stand up for \nthe needs of veterans above the political needs of the White House. As \na senior member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and the \nMilCon-VA Appropriations Subcommittee, he can guarantee that I will \nhold him to his word.\n  General Peake will be taking the reins at a critical time in the \nagency's history. Many challenges lie in his path--from the enormous \ntask of streamlining and improving the military and veterans disability \nsystems, to implementing a joint electronic medical record; and from \nreducing wait times for benefits, to caring for the large number of \nreturning veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic \nbrain injury.\n  These challenges require innovative solutions. They require a \nSecretary who will roll up his sleeves and get to work. And they \nrequire strong leadership. It will require action. And it will require \nresults. General Peake promised to do just that. We must all hold him \naccountable--I know I will. If he fails to change the direction of this \nagency, he will have to answer for it.\n  But I also pledge to work with him to get this right and put our \nveterans first. We have a true opportunity to change course at the VA. \nBut the clock is ticking. With our troops fighting overseas and older \nveterans accessing the VA in greater numbers, we are facing \nunprecedented challenges.\n  As they say at the VA in my home State, ``business as usual'' isn't \nan option. And I am hopeful that General Peake won't accept ``business \nas usual'' either. I am hopeful that he will make sure we keep our \npromises to the heroes who risked everything for our safety because we \nowe them nothing less.\n  Madam President, I again thank the Senator from Michigan and the \nSenator from Virginia for their tremendous leadership in making sure \nour troops get all they need and, in particular, for the Wounded \nWarriors Act, which will be historic when it gets passed and signed \ninto law and we can turn around to the men and women who served us so \nwell and say: We are working with you, not against you.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record, in a slightly different form, a list of the staff--\nprofessional staff and several personal staff--on my side who have \nhelped in the preparation of the Senate bill and the preparation of the \nconference report. While there is some redundancy, I think the Record \nshould reflect my specific appreciation to these many people who make \nit possible for the chairman and ranking member to prepare these bills \nand then the reports. So I have infinite respect and gratitude for each \nof them.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Minority Staff Senate Armed Services Committee\n\n       Republican Staff Director: Michael V.

I say to the Senator from Michigan, I understand, Mr. \nChairman, the distinguished Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, wishes to \nsay a few words in support of the bill at the end.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As does the majority leader. If I could just introduce \nthis thought: We have three additional Members, we believe, who wish to \nspeak: Senator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, and Senator McCaskill. Those \nare the ones we have so far on this side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Perhaps, Madam President, we should have the Chair inform \nus as to the remainder of the time for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman has 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, and \nthe ranking member has 23 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, first of all, let me thank both the \nchairman\n\n[[Page S15608]]\n\nof the committee and Senator Warner, as well as Senator McCain, for \ntheir work for the people who defend this country. I also would be \nremiss if I did not thank their staffs. They have been highly \ncooperative with my staff as we looked through several items.\n  This is a large bill. It is an important bill. I intend to vote for \nit. But I have some heartburn, and I want to spend a few minutes \ntalking about it.\n  Last year, the Defense Department contracted out $110 billion without \nthe first competitive bid on either contracts or grants. When we \nconsidered this bill in this body, we approved a competitive bid \namendment that would say: We are going to have competition for all of \nthese. We have $5.6 billion worth of earmarks in this bill, of which \nnone are competitive; there is another $12 billion of add-ons, of which \nnone are competitive--just in what we have done.\n  There is a difference of opinion among a few of us with a vast \nmajority of the others in terms of whether the President--whoever the \nadministration is--gets to direct priorities versus us directing \npriorities. I understand that, and that is a fair debate.\n  Our position is that sometimes we know better. That may, in fact, be \nthe case. But this body passed an amendment that said we are going to \nuse competition on all these earmarks so that, in fact, the American \npeople get value, they get a better product at a lower price. That, \nunfortunately, was taken out in conference. Senator McCain \nwholeheartedly supported that amendment on this floor.\n  Now, why would we take that out? What is it that would say we don't \nwant to get the best value for our taxpayers' dollars when it comes to \n$100 billion worth of spending? Why is that? Why would we do that?\n  We had a very simple process. We said: If you have an earmark and it \nis something that needs to be done right now, all competitive \nrequirements for that are waived. It does not apply to anything in the \npast. But for any new spending we earmark, we say: If it is not urgent \nor unique, then we ought to spread it out to find out how we get the \nbest value for our money. We agreed to that. Then, when we got to \nconference, we did not hold it.\n  Why did we not hold it? Why is it we do not want to have the winner \nof competition of grants and contracts to be involved in getting better \nvalue for the American people? Could it be we want to protect someone? \nCould it be we do not want sunlight? The real answer is going to be \nthat yesterday the Accountability and Transparency Web site that we \npassed went on line, and all of America is going to find out where all \nthis money is going. On this Web site, it shows if it was a directed \nearmark without any competition whatsoever.\n  So why would we deny the American taxpayers now the ability to get \nfar greater value than what they are going to get because we want to \ndirect something somewhere? If we truly think it is the best thing--and \nit is not urgent and it is not unique--and we want to say we want to do \nit, good and dandy, but why wouldn't we want to do it at the best \nvalue, at the best price for the American taxpayer? So we end up where \nthe American taxpayer is going to lose about $10 billion to $15 billion \nthis year through inefficiency and the lack of competitive bidding on \ngrants and contracts in the Defense authorization bill.\n  When I met with Tina Jones, the Comptroller, what we found out was \nthat what we label at $5.9 billion in this bill is really closer to $17 \nbillion when you really work it all out. We started discovering this \nwhen we asked the Department of Transportation to tell us what was the \nimpact of their earmarks.\n  The other amendment I have offered that has not been accepted by this \nbody--but should--is to do a study of our earmarks to see if we really \nget value, if they really do turn something profitable. Do they really \ngive us something our military needs? What happens is this $110 billion \nshould have only cost us $90 billion.\n  Now, what does the difference mean? It means buying thousands more \nMRAPs. It means buying more F-22s. But because we do not competitively \nbid and because the conference committee did not keep this amendment, \nthe American taxpayer loses, our children lose. But, most importantly, \nthe warfighter loses because if we waste dollars that could have gone \nto help them better, we disadvantage them in the job we have asked them \nto do for us.\n  So I am going to keep offering this. I am going to make a big deal \nabout competition for getting Government contracts in this country, \nbased on quality and price. I am going to keep offering the fact that \nwe ought to assess what the effect of our earmarks is. Now, people \nbristle at that. But if we are right that we know better than the \nPentagon and we know better than the generals and we know better than \nthe procurement officers, we at least ought to look at the results of \nhow we know best and see ``Did it turn out?'' instead of blindly \ncontinuing to do the same thing without the knowledge of the effect of \nwhat we did.\n  There are all sorts of other issues connected with this--parochial \nissues, campaign issues, political issues--that are connected to \nearmarks. But the most important issue that ought to be considered is \nthe warfighter. The second issue that ought to be considered is our \nchildren. The fact is, we are hurting our children when we are not \nefficient and proper with the American taxpayers' money.\n  I do intend to vote for this bill. It is very important for our \nwarfighters.\n  I do appreciate the chairman. I admire so much his relationship with \nall those on the Armed Services Committee, the collegiality under which \nhe has worked on this legislation.\n  My admiration is not limited to the Members of the Senate; there is \nthe staff. They have been tremendously cooperative with us.\n  But this is a great question we need to ask. We fail to uphold our \noath when we don't spend money wisely. We fail the next generation. We \nfail the principle of liberty that we have a Defense Department for in \nthe first place when we waste money.\n  I know there are a lot of other areas we can work on within the \nDefense Department, but before we have any credibility about working on \nthe other money we waste, we ought to be sure we are clean in terms of \nwhat we do. So the fact we are not going to look at what the results \nwere of the money that we directed, and that we are not going to have \ntrue competition for about $150 billion this next year of grants and \ncontracts within the Defense Department says we are going to let down \nthe warfighter, says we are going to let down the next generation. To \nme, my hope is in the future, we will embrace this transparency, this \nidea that we ought to get the best value for every dollar we spend for \nour Defense Department, and we ought to do it in a way that is \ntransparent so the American people can see what we are doing.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for giving me this time. I thank \nthe majority leader for creating an opportunity for us to at least have \nsome time to discuss this bill. Discussions such as these are important \nto the American public. My challenge is to the chairman of this \ncommittee: Next year, let's make up for this. Let's truly put \ncompetition first. Let's get great value for our children and for our \nwarfighters. We can do it. We won't stop anything that is needed now. \nWe won't stop anything that is unique. But those things that are not \npertinent to the here and now, that are going to come in the future, we \nought to get great value for. We know we don't. The IG report said we \ndon't. There is tons of information we have that says we are not \ngetting great value.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank my colleagues for giving me \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I think it is important for the colloquy \nthat the Senator and I are now having that the copy of the amendment \nthat was once in the bill and deleted be put in the Record at this \npoint. Does the Senator have it with him? If we could do that, that \nwould be helpful.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will make certain it is placed in the Record.\n  I so ask unanimous consent.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S15609]]\n\n                           amendment no. 3044\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of earmarks for awarding no-bid contracts \n                      and non-competitive grants)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 827. PROHIBITION ON USE OF EARMARKS TO AWARD NO BID \n                   CONTRACTS AND NONCOMPETITIVE GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--\n       (1) Contracts.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, all contracts awarded by the Department of Defense \n     to implement new programs or projects pursuant to \n     congressional initiatives shall be awarded using competitive \n     procedures in accordance with the requirements of section \n     2304 of title 10, United States Code, and the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation.\n       (B) Bid requirement.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), \n     no contract may be awarded by the Department of Defense to \n     implement a new program or project pursuant to a \n     congressional initiative unless more than one bid is received \n     for such contract.\n       (2) Grants.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, no funds may be awarded by the Department of Defense by \n     grant or cooperative agreement to implement a new program or \n     project pursuant to a congressional initiative unless the \n     process used to award such grant or cooperative agreement \n     uses competitive or merit-based procedures to select the \n     grantee or award recipient. Except as provided in paragraph \n     (3), no such grant or cooperative agreement may be awarded \n     unless applications for such grant or cooperative agreement \n     are received from two or more applicants that are not from \n     the same organization and do not share any financial, \n     fiduciary, or other organizational relationship.\n       (3) Waiver authority.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary of Defense does not \n     receive more than one bid for a contract under paragraph \n     (1)(B) or does not receive more than one application from \n     unaffiliated applicants for a grant or cooperative agreement \n     under paragraph (2), the Secretary may waive such bid or \n     application requirement if the Secretary determines that the \n     new program or project--\n       (i) cannot be implemented without a waiver; and\n       (ii) will help meet important national defense needs.\n       (B) Congressional notification.--If the Secretary of \n     Defense waives a bid requirement under subparagraph (A), the \n     Secretary must, not later than 10 days after exercising such \n     waiver, notify Congress and the Committees on Armed Services \n     of the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n       (4) Contracting authority.--The Secretary of Defense may, \n     as appropriate, utilize existing contracts to carry out \n     congressional initiatives.\n       (b) Annual Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2008, and \n     December 31 of each year thereafter, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on congressional \n     initiatives for which amounts were appropriated or otherwise \n     made available for the fiscal year ending during such year.\n       (2) Content.--Each report submitted under paragraph (1) \n     shall include with respect to each contract, grant, or \n     cooperative agreement awarded to implement a new program or \n     project pursuant to a congressional initiative--\n       (A) the name of the recipient of the funds awarded through \n     such contract or grant;\n       (B) the reason or reasons such recipient was selected for \n     such contract or grant; and\n       (C) the number of entities that competed for such contract \n     or grant.\n       (3) Publication.--Each report submitted under paragraph (1) \n     shall be made publicly available through the Internet website \n     of the Department of Defense.\n       (c) Congressional Initiative Defined.--In this section, the \n     term ``congressional initiative'' means a provision of law or \n     a directive contained within a committee report or joint \n     statement of managers of an appropriations Act that \n     specifies--\n       (1) the identity of a person or entity selected to carry \n     out a project, including a defense system, for which funds \n     are appropriated or otherwise made available by that \n     provision of law or directive and that was not requested by \n     the President in a budget submitted to Congress;\n       (2) the specific location at which the work for a project \n     is to be done; and\n       (3) the amount of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available for such project.\n       (d) Applicability.--This section shall apply with respect \n     to funds appropriated or otherwise made available for fiscal \n     years beginning after September 30, 2007, and to \n     congressional initiatives initiated after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to assure my colleague from \nOklahoma that this is a matter I personally have discussed with Senator \nMcCain many times. He would hope that the committee in the coming year \nwould address, once again, the amendment and the ramifications \ntherefrom.\n  I think that is the intention, is it not, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am sorry. I was distracted.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the committee will once again revisit this \nsubject with the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Virginia, but let me also thank the \nSenator from Oklahoma. The subject of competition is one which many of \nus have put in decades of effort on. As a matter of fact, I remember \nwhen Senator Bill Cohen of Maine was sitting a few desks from where you \nare now standing, a decade or so ago. On a bipartisan basis at that \ntime we adopted the Competition In Contracting Act and did a lot of \ngood over time. Gradually, over time, I think there has been some \nfraying in it.\n  The Senator points out some very significant issues. We are always \nhappy to work with him on issues. We don't agree with everything he \nsays, but on much of what he says and on his point, his major point, we \ndo agree, in terms of the critical importance of competition. There are \nsome provisions in this bill which the Senator from Oklahoma inspired--\nmany of them. A number of those come from that passion of his to \nimprove competition. It is in the section on acquisition reform. We \nthank him for his effort in that regard. I also thank him for his very \npersonal comments about me.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator and I join the chairman.\n  I was going to grant from our time allocation 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We very much appreciate that courtesy, as always.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep disappointment \nthat the Congress is taking up the conference report on the Defense \nbill without the hate crimes provision. I commend Chairman Levin for \nhis strong leadership in our efforts to have it included as part of \nthis measure. Despite his efforts, and the strong support of Majority \nLeader Harry Reid, it is an extraordinary missed opportunity that we \nare not able to send the hate crimes bill to the President before the \nend of the year.\n  The inclusion of the hate crimes provision in the Defense bill was \nappropriate. Our military stands for America's ideals and fights for \nAmerica's ideals. At a time when our ideals are under attack by \nterrorists in other lands, it is more important than ever to \ndemonstrate that we practice what we preach, and that we are doing all \nwe can to root out the bigotry and prejudice in our own country that \nleads to similar violence here at home.\n  In Iraq and Afghanistan, our soldiers are fighting for freedom and \nliberty. They are on the front line fighting against evil and hate. We \nare united in our effort to root out the cells of hatred around the \nworld. We should not turn a blind eye to acts of hatred and terrorism \nhere at home. We owe it to our troops to uphold those same principles \nhere at home. We should not shrink now from our role as the beacon of \nliberty to the rest of the world.\n  If America is to live up to its founding ideals of liberty and \njustice for all, combating hate crimes must be a national priority. The \nhate crimes bill would have advanced those values and goals, and we are \ncommitted to getting it enacted. It is long past time for this measure \nto become law.\n  We are now facing a time when the FBI reports that hate crimes are on \nthe rise, and there has been a sharp increase in the number of hate \ncrimes reported against Hispanics--at the highest levels since the \nreports were first mandated by the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, \ndemonstrating the real societal impact of anti-immigrant campaigns.\n  The Southern Poverty Law Center also reports that hate groups are on \nthe rise. Since September of this year, when thousands of Americans \nmarched for civil rights in Jena, LA, there have been more than 50 \nnoose incidents across the country. Just a few weeks ago, the New York \nTimes included a chart reflecting the ``Geography of Hate'' across \nAmerica. Over the last 2 years, it shows that nooses have been sighted \nin many different States.\n  This terrifying symbol of racism and prejudice has even appeared \nrecently on schoolyards and college campuses, creating fear in their \nwhole communities. Apparently, we have not succeeded in adequately \nteaching the lessons of America's long history of discrimination. \nEducation is an important part of prevention, but we also need strong \nnational legislation to punish\n\n[[Page S15610]]\n\nthose who engage in hate-motivated violence and to expand Federal \nresources available to investigate and prevent these vicious crimes.\n  As my colleagues here in the Senate know, Senator Gordon Smith and I \nhave been fighting this battle for a long time. Just a few months ago, \nthe hate crimes provision was adopted by the Senate with a vote of 60-\n39 as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. It's not the \nfirst time that the Senate voted to pass this bill. In 2000 and 2002, a \nmajority of Senators voted to pass this legislation.\n  In 2004, we had 65 votes for the bill and it was adopted as part of \nthe Defense authorization bill. But that time, like this time, it was \nstripped out in conference. Twice in the last 2 years, Chairman Conyers \nhas succeeded in getting the House to vote to pass this legislation--\nbut, once again, the House and Senate have not come together to get \nthis bill done.\n  We have been in this battle for nearly a decade, and we will continue \nto press ahead. It is long past time to stand up for the victims of \nthese senseless acts of violence--victims like Matthew Shepard, for \nwhom this bill is named, and who died a horrible a death in 1998 at the \nhands of two men who singled him out because of his sexual orientation. \nNine years after Matthew's death--9 years--we still haven't gotten it \ndone. How long are we going to wait?\n  This year, with Matthew Shepard's mother Judy at our side, we were \nfilled with hope that finally this would be the year that we would get \nthis bill to the President's desk. A broad and growing coalition of 210 \nlaw enforcement, civic, disability, religious and civil rights groups \nsupport the bill, including the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the Anti-Defamation League, the Interfaith Alliance, the \nNational Sheriff's Association, the Human Rights Campaign, the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association and the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights.\n  Over 1,400--1,400--clergy from a broad spectrum of religious \ntraditions from across the country have come together to support the \nMatthew Shepard Act. These leaders of America's religious communities \nhave called on Congress to stand united against one of the worst forms \nof oppression: violence based on personal characteristics and identity. \nTogether, we must work together to create a society in which diverse \npeople are safe as well as free.\n  We will continue to fight to protect the rights of our fellow \ncitizens, and not let a veto threat stop us from doing the right thing. \nWe are not giving up. We will continue to push to get the bill through \nthe Congress next year. I remain hopeful that the President will hear \nour call and that he too will finally support this much-needed measure.\n  Hate crimes are an appalling form of domestic terrorism that cannot \nand must not be tolerated anywhere in our country. We have made \nprogress over the years, and our focus now should be to strengthen \nprotections for hate crimes so that all Americans will be protected \nunder the law. No Americans should feel that they are second class \ncitizens because Congress refuses to protect them against hate crimes.\n  I am looking forward to voting for this conference report. At the \noutset I want to express a view that I know all of the members of the \nArmed Services Committee feel, and that is great respect for our \nchairman, Senator Levin, and Senator Warner, who has been past chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee and has a lifetime of commitment in \nterms of the security of our Nation and to the betterment of our Armed \nForces. We are grateful for their leadership, and the country should \nbe. I am also very grateful for their help and assistance, along with \nmy colleague and friend Gordon Smith, for a provision that was included \nin the Defense authorization bill but which has been subsequently \ndropped, and that is the hate crime legislation we had added which had \nbeen included at other times as well in the Defense authorization bill. \nIt was included in the year 2000, in 2002, and now, by a vote of 60 to \n39, was included in this legislation.\n  This legislation is to make sure our troops are going to be the best \ntrained, the best led, and the best equipped. Also, the very serious \nefforts that have been made in terms of the health care that has been \npointed out by the Senator from Washington and other various provisions \nof enormous importance.\n  What we are interested in doing is giving the support to our \nfrontline troops. We ask ourselves: What are they doing? What is their \ntask? Their task is fighting terrorism and fighting evil overseas--\nfighting terrorism and fighting evil overseas so that we are going to \nbe safe and secure. It does seem to me if they are fighting against \nterrorism and evil overseas and they are fighting for American values \noverseas, they ought to also be fighting for American values here at \nhome. The values here at home are to fight the terrorism and evil that \nexist here at home in terms of hate crimes--hate crimes--the types of \ncrimes that are devoted and focused on individuals because of who they \nare. The kind of crimes that hurt not just the individuals but \ncommunities; the kind of crimes that have expanded significantly over \nthe period of recent years.\n  America is a better America by not tolerating hate crimes. America is \na better America when we are fighting hate crimes in the best way and \nwith all of the tools we possibly can. We had that legislation. It was \nincluded. We had good debate on the floor of the Senate. We had \nbipartisan support for the hate crimes legislation. That same concept \nhad been passed as an individual bill in the House of Representatives. \nThe same concept was included in instructions from the House of \nRepresentatives 3 years ago that we should accept it. But this time, \nthe House of Representatives refused to address it and we have seen \nthat provision withdrawn. I think it was a significant and important \nmistake.\n  I wish to give to those who are committed to that program, that \neffort to try and deal with the problems of violence in America. We \nhave all seen the challenges of violence in these past weeks. As the \nSouthern Poverty Law Center reports, it is taking place in schoolyards \nand communities all over our Nation. This is violence caused by hatred, \nby people that are targeting individuals of different color skin, \ndifferent races, different ethnic backgrounds, different sexual \norientation.\n  So at another time we will bring this issue back to the floor of the \nSenate. We want to give the assurances of those who have been a part of \nthis whole march which has taken place over the period of years since \n1968 with the killing of Dr. King--this has been a continuing march. We \nhaven't stopped. We will not yield. We will not give in.\n  I am grateful to the Senator from Virginia for yielding me this time. \nWe will ultimately prevail. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts. He has been a strong, hard-working member of our \ncommittee these many years, and I was happy to accommodate him with \ntime.\n  On my side, the distinguished Senator from Georgia has indicated he \nwould not seek to speak. There is one remaining Senator, I understand, \nthe other Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe. When he appears, I \nwill recognize him for the purpose of making a few remarks.\n\n\n                  IRAQ SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA HOLDERS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am so pleased that Chairman Levin \nincluded in the conference report a critical component of the original \nIraq Refugee Crisis Act, which would defray the cost of transportation \nand provide prearrival admissions assistance and up to 8 months of \npostarrival resettlement assistance to those Iraqis who come here on \nSpecial Immigrant Visas or SIVs. SIV holders are those individuals \nwhose lives may be in jeopardy because of their support for the \nAmerican mission. My staff has learned that there is an effort by the \nadministration to limit the scope of the assistance provided to these \nbrave Iraqis. I know when Senator Smith and I introduced similar \nlanguage as an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 Labor, Health & Human \nServices, and Education appropriations bill, we certainly intended to \nprovide Iraqi SIVs with the full array of benefits normally provided to \nrefugees by the U.S. Government, the State Department's Bureau of \nPopulation, Refugees, and Migration as well as the Health and Human \nServices Department's Office of Refugee Resettlement.\n\n[[Page S15611]]\n\nWith this effort in mind, I want to be sure the conferees and the \nauthor of the Iraqi Refugee Crisis Act, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nhad the same intent when including the provision in the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 1585, the Department of Defense authorization \nbill. I would also ask my colleague from Oregon if he agrees with me.\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes, I concur with Senator Cardin; it was indeed our \nintent that Iraqi SIVs receive the full array of admissions and \nresettlement assistance offered to refugees. I also want to thank the \nconferees for including this important provision.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to echo the comments of my \nfriends from Maryland and Oregon. The original Iraq Refugee Crisis Act \nincluded language similar to the conference report and the Cardin \namendment to the Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill. \nAs the original author of the legislation, I can assure you it was my \nintention to provide Iraqi SIV recipients with the full array of \nbenefits available to refugees. Moreover, SIV recipients are not to be \ncounted against immigrant caps, nor are they counted against U.S. \nRefugee Admissions Program caps.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to thank my friends from Massachusetts, Maryland \nand Oregon for their support. As I have said before, the United States \nhas a special responsibility to assist those individuals fleeing Iraq \nand particularly to those individuals who assisted the United States. \nIn the case of this legislation, it is the intent of the conferees to \nprovide Iraqi SIVs the full array of benefits traditionally provided to \nrefugees as described by my friend from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I would like to thank the chairman for that important \nclarification. I also know that despite the provision of benefits, it \nwas never my intent that these SIVs would be counted against immigrant \nor U.S. Refugee Admissions Program caps set by the administration \nthrough consultations with Congress and would like to clarify whether \nthis was also the intent of the conferees?\n  Mr. LEVIN. My friend from Maryland is correct: despite provision of \nbenefits, these SIVs, due to their special status, are not to be \ncounted against immigrant or refugee caps. Does my friend from \nMassachusetts concur?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do. SIVs are not to be counted against immigrant or \nU.S. Refugee Admissions Program caps set by the administration through \nconsultations with Congress.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I would like to thank Chairman Levin and Senator Kennedy \nfor making the intent clear on this issue. I know these clarifications \nwill mean a great deal to the Iraqi men and women who have been so \ncritical to our mission in that country.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, today I was pleased to vote in favor of \npassage of the conference report on the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2008. This significant legislation will provide \nmuch needed funding for the brave men and women currently serving in \nour armed forces and includes critically important language addressing \nthe needs and care of returning servicemembers.\n  The provisions dealing with care at VA are a direct outcome of the \nclose collaboration that has occurred between the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee and the Armed Services Committee. It was a pleasure to work \nwith Chairman Levin of the Armed Services Committee and others on this \nkey legislation to help our Nation's servicemembers and veterans. It \ncontains provisions drawn from legislation which was reported by the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee to the full Senate in late August, \nlegislation that we have been seeking final passage of for many months \nnow.\n  A substantial portion of these provisions seek to address what has \nbecome the signature wound of this conflict: traumatic brain injury. \nWhile attempting to meet the immediate needs of veterans with TBI for \nhigh-quality care at VA and subsequent rehabilitation in their \ncommunities, it would also provide VA clinicians with increased \nresources to develop the expertise and the capacity to meet the \nlifelong needs of these veterans.\n  First, VA would be required to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation \nand community reintegration plan for each veteran with TBI, to be \nimplemented by a team of clinicians with appropriate expertise. The \nveteran, or the veteran's caregiver, would also have the opportunity to \nrequest a review of the rehabilitation plan, to ensure adequate \nresponsiveness to individual concerns. These provisions stem from \ntestimony from family members and advocates at the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee's March 27, 2007, hearing on transition issues and care for \nreturning servicemembers.\n  Second, to better meet the need of veterans who reside in areas that \nare not close to any of VA's five major polytrauma centers, the \nprovisions in this bill would authorize the use of non-VA facilities, \nwhen VA lacks the capacity to provide treatment or the veteran lives \ntoo far away to make VA treatment feasible. VA's lead polytrauma \ncenters have significant expertise in rehabilitative care, but in other \nlocations specialized rehabilitative care is frequently unavailable in \nVA facilities.\n  Third, veterans with severe TBI often end up in nursing home care. \nThis bill would require VA to provide ``age-appropriate'' care to these \nyounger veterans who are severely wounded but who sometimes end up in \nend-of-life care environments. Additionally, the bill would give VA \nproviders the ability to work with the Defense and Veterans Brain \nInjury Center to conduct research and treatment to potentially ``re-\nawaken'' some veterans with more severe TBI, who may still be able to \nachieve some level of cognitive recovery.\n  Finally, in response to the needs of veterans with TBI who are unable \nto manage routine activities of daily living, this bill would require \nVA to establish programs to maximize veterans' independence, quality of \nlife, and community reintegration. It would also establish an assisted \nliving pilot program for those with TBI. This would expand options to \nassist veterans who might otherwise be forced into institutional long-\nterm care.\n  One of the cornerstones of this section of the bill extends the \nperiod of automatic eligibility for VA health care. Under current law, \nany active-duty servicemember who is discharged or separated from \nactive duty following deployment to a theater of combat, including \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve, is eligible for VA health care for a \n2-year period. This bill would extend the period to 5 years.\n  A greater period of eligibility is essential for two primary reasons: \nprotection from budget cuts and ensured access to care for issues that \nmay not be apparent immediately upon separation from active duty, such \nas invisible wounds. In recent years, veterans with lower priority \nratings have been denied care due to budget delays and cuts through the \nlegislative and appropriations process. Combat veterans deserve 5 years \nof guaranteed health care immediately following discharge.\n  Two years is often insufficient time for symptoms of PTSD and other \nmental illnesses to manifest. These invisible wounds are often not \napparent until 3 or 4 years after discharge, and servicemembers \nfrequently delay treatment until their issues become serious. Studies \nindicate that up to 30 percent of OIF/OEF veterans will require some \nform of mental health or readjustment service. Over 1.5 million \nAmericans have served in those theaters of combat, and about 750,000 \nare currently eligible for VA health care. Extended eligibility will \nsmooth their transition to civilian life.\n  To further improve a timely response to veterans' mental health \nneeds, this bill would require VA to provide a mental health \nexamination within 30 days of the veteran's request. Senator Obama has \ndone excellent work on this provision, and I thank him for his efforts. \nPast wars have shown that delaying mental health care makes recovery \nfar more challenging.\n  In addition, this bill improves outreach to members of the National \nGuard and Reserves. The Reserve forces have been used in the current \nconflicts on an unprecedented scale. It is essential that VA include \nthem in their outreach efforts upon demobilization. This bill would \nspecifically include them in VA's definition of outreach. This change \nacknowledges the central role played by the Guard and Reserve.\n  In addition to the vital veterans-related legislation included in \nthis bill,\n\n[[Page S15612]]\n\nas a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management support, I am pleased \nthat this bill provides troops with the equipment and facilities they \nneed, as well as strengthens the oversight and management of the \nDefense Department. This includes the incorporation of the Acquisition \nImprovement and Accountability Act and the establishment of a full-time \nChief Management Officer and Deputy Chief Management Officer. I am \nespecially pleased that the conference report repeals the Department of \nDefense's authority to establish a new labor relations system under the \nNational Security Personnel System, NSPS, and restores collective \nbargaining and appeals rights. The original NSPS legislation stripped \nFederal employees of their basic rights and protections. I so \nvehemently opposed these provisions that I voted against the Defense \nAuthorization conference report creating NSPS. I am glad that Congress \nhas decided to restore these fundamental rights and protections to \nemployees who work every day to secure our Nation.\n  Once again, let me congratulate the members of the House and Senate \nfor their passage of this bill and I urge the President to sign this \ncrucial legislation into law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the conference report on the fiscal year \n2008 Department of Defense authorization bill now before the Senate \nincludes some significant mileposts of progress for the National Guard. \nThose sections of the bill come directly from the National Guard \nEmpowerment Act of 2007, a bill that I sponsored along with Senator Kit \nBond of Missouri, my fellow cochair of the U.S Senate National Guard \nCaucus. Well over half of the Senate--a significant portion of the \nNational Guard Caucus--cosponsored the empowerment bill. Working with \nthe Nation's Governors, key National Guard-affiliated organizations, \nand the Adjutants General of the United States, we make notable headway \nin this bill on several issues that go to the core of the Guard's \nmissions, preparedness and our national defense.\n  This legislation clears away organizational cobwebs in the Department \nof Defense and changes the Pentagon's structure to better reflect the \nvital role and responsibilities of the Guard. More importantly, we \ndirect the Department of Defense to begin the urgently needed process \nof tapping into the National Guard's extensive experience in homeland \ndefense issues--expertise the Defense Department has previously \nignored.\n  To give the Guard more bureaucratic muscle, especially in decisions \naffecting the Guard, the legislation elevates the Chief of the National \nGuard from the rank of lieutenant general to the rank of general, \nmaking the Chief the prime military adviser to the Secretary of Defense \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The National Guard \nBureau becomes what is called a Joint Activity, still closely \naffiliated with the Department of the Army and the Air Force, but now \nmore like other joint agencies like Combatant Commands and the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, capable of communication across the Department.\n  To focus the Defense Department more on homeland defense, the bill \nrequires that the Deputy Commander of the U.S. Northern Command come \nfrom the ranks of the National Guard, and it requires the Department of \nDefense to develop a plan in conjunction with the Guard to deal with \nhomeland defense situations.\n  These reforms are tangible progress for the Guard, and there is a \npressing need for them. The National Guard is a keystone to our \nNation's defense, ready to carry out missions at home and abroad. The \nGuard is ready to serve as the primary reserve to both the Army and the \nAir Force, while taking the lead in providing military support during \nemergencies situations at home. It would take a long time even only to \nlist the missions accomplished by the National Guard since September 11 \nin carrying out their assignments in Iraq and Afghanistan or to respond \nto natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina.\n  Despite all the Guard's achievements on our behalf, the force often \nhas gotten second-class treatment in the Department of Defense. The \nGuard has to beg and scrape and rely on the tender mercies of others \nfor every piece of equipment they need to do the jobs they are asked to \ndo, and they have to fight to be included in the long-range planning \nand budget and policy discussions that directly affect the Guard, its \nmissions, its people, its equipment and its other needs. The Guard \nworks extremely closely with state emergency responders, and they have \nspecial authorities and experience in working within the domestic \nUnited States. But despite this special expertise and these special \nauthorities, does the Pentagon listen to and learn from the Guard's \nideas and knowledge about domestic defense? Sad but true, the answer is \nno.\n  I wish we could have gone even further in this legislation. Dropped \nduring floor debate here in the Senate was a section of the Empowerment \nbill to make the Guard Bureau Chief a member of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. That would improve the quality of advice to the Secretary of \nDefense and the President on domestic defense matters. Another \nprovision, removed in conference with the House, would give the Guard a \nseparate budget for procuring homeland defense-related equipment, as \nwell as the ability to work with states to identify gaps in emergency \nresponse capabilities. Another clearly warranted section of our bill \nwould have ensured that our Adjutants General, who command units from \nthe both the Army Guard and the Air Force Guard, receive joint credit \nfor their experience. That would create a greater pool of candidates \nfor the senior positions that we have opened up in this bill. The \ninstitutional objections we heard to these provisions ranged from the \nweak to the unreasonable. But regrettably, in this case they carried \nthe day.\n  We did make clear progress. The joint activity provision, to take a \nless prominent example, is highly significant. The phrase ``joint \nactivity'' means exactly how it is used in the Goldwater-Nichols Act: \nan organization that performs joint missions under the auspices of the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, or the commander of a Combatant or a Combined Command. The \nNational Guard Bureau has now basically been given a legal license to \nwork not only with the two services--the Army and Air Force--but also \nwith a variety of unified commands, the Joint Staff, and the Office of \nthe Secretary of Defense. The National Guard Bureau now will have \nsimilar organizational standing as that granted to other joint \nactivities such as, among many other organizations, the Joint Staff or \nthe Defense Logistics Agency.\n  This coalition of National Guard supporters--which goes far beyond \nthe sponsors and co-sponsors to the Governors, the Associations, and \nmany others--must keep pushing. If we are to have a national security \nstructure that is as effective as the American people need and deserve \nit to be, we must ensure that the Guard's voice is heard loud and clear \nin key deliberations. We must ensure that the Pentagon takes the \nmilitary support mission seriously. We should consider re-introducing \nthe portions of the Empowerment legislation that have not yet been \nenacted. To keep a laser-like focus on domestic defense, we must take a \ncareful look at other Defense Department organizations involved in \ndomestic defense, like U.S. Northern Command.\n  I know that Senator Bond joins me in thanking the Nation's Governors \nfor their stalwart support of the empowerment bill, as well their \nunstinting energy in working with us on another successful effort on \nbehalf of the Guard, the similarly successful effort to repeal the \nrecent changes to the Insurrection Act, turning back an unjustifiable \nexpansion of a President's power to use the military for law \nenforcement. This provision of this Defense authorization bill was \ndrawn directly from legislation that I introduced with Senator Bond, \nwhich this year was the subject of a hearing by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Associations like the Adjutants General Association of the United \nStates, the National Guard Association of the United States, and the \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States were \nthere every step of the way, keeping their members informed and \nbringing enormous energy to this effort.\n  Special thanks go to Representatives Gene Taylor of Mississippi and \nTom Davis of Virginia who led a vigorous,\n\n[[Page S15613]]\n\ncompanion effort on the House side, as well as Senators Carl Levin of \nMichigan, John McCain of Arizona, and John Warner of Virginia for \nleading the Senate negotiations.\n  We owe the deepest thanks to the almost 500,000 members of the \nNational Guard. Their ability to balance their full-time jobs with \ntheir family responsibilities and Guard commitments is simply \nremarkable. They are indispensable to our national security structure, \nat home, and abroad. Their sense of pride, professionalism and duty \nrepresents the very best qualities of our military and our country. I \nam simply in awe of what they have done to protect this Nation, and I \nknow the whole Congress and the country share this heartfelt gratitude.\n  Throughout this whole process, we have been guided by the fact that \nthe Guard is always there for the people of the United States of \nAmerica. Our part is easier than theirs: We cannot afford to let our \nGuard down. The Guard Empowerment provisions of this bill will help us \nhonor that commitment to the men and women of the Guard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I commend the conferees for including \nthe Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act as part of this conference agreement.\n  I am grateful to the chairman and ranking member for supporting this \nneeded provision, and I also appreciate the support of Senators Smith, \nHagel, Biden, Brownback, Lieberman, Leahy, Snowe, Voinovich, Feinstein, \nCollins, Obama, Dole, Menendez, Mikulski, and Clinton, who joined in \nsponsoring the original amendment when it was adopted by the Senate by \nvoice vote during our debate on this bill.\n  The Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act requires the Secretary of State to \nestablish a refugee processing program in Iraq for Iraqis threatened \nbecause of their association with the United States. Applicants must \ndemonstrate they have a well-founded fear of persecution. Iraqis who \nwill now be able to apply directly to the United States rather than \ngoing through the United Nations referral system,--include: Iraqis who \nwere or are employed by or worked for the United States Government in \nIraq; Iraqis who were or are employed in Iraq by a media or \nnongovernmental organization headquartered in the United States, or by \nan organization that is closely associated with the United States \nmission in Iraq and that has received U.S. Government funding through \nan official documented contract, award, grant, or cooperative \nagreement; and Iraqis who are members of a religious or minority \ncommunity with close family members in the United States.\n  The act allows the Secretary to suspend in-country processing for \nperiods of 90 days, with a report to Congress on the reasons for any \nsuspension.\n  In addition, the act makes available 5,000 special immigrant visas \neach year for the next 5 years for Iraqis who have worked for the U.S. \nGovernment in Iraq and are endangered as a result. Applicants must have \na positive recommendation or evaluation from a senior supervisor and be \napproved by the U.S. Ambassador in Iraq or his designee. The provision \nsunsets after 5 years. These visas, because of their special status, \nare not counted against immigrant caps nor are they counted against \nU.S. Refugee Admissions Program caps.\n  Under the act, Iraqis granted special immigrant visa status are \neligible for 8 months for the full array of benefits traditionally \nprovided to refugees by the State Department's Bureau of Population, \nRefugees, and Migration and the Health and Human Services Department's \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement. The provisions under the act would \ndefray the cost of transportation and provide prearrival admissions \nassistance and up to 8 months of postarrival resettlement assistance to \nthose Iraqis who come to the U.S. on special immigrant visas. Senators \nCardin and Levin are the primary authors of this provision and, have \nspoken eloquently for it.\n  The act also allows reapplication by Iraqis in the United States who \nhave been denied asylum, in part, because conditions in Iraq changed \nafter the fall of Saddam Hussein's government.\n  In addition, the act directs the Secretary of State to designate a \nhigh-level special coordinator at the Embassy in Baghdad to handle \nissues related to Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons. The \ncoordinator will be responsible for overseeing in-country processing of \nrefugees and special immigrant visa applicants, and will have authority \nto refer persons directly to the U.S. refugee resettlement program. \nSimilar positions would be designated in the American embassies in \nEgypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.\n  The act also requires the Secretary of State to consult with other \ncountries about resettlement of refugee populations and to develop \nmechanisms in countries with significant populations of displaced \nIraqis to ensure the refugees' well-being and safety. U.S. financial \nassistance would be provided in such cases to help meet the cost of \ncaring for the refugees and protecting them.\n  These measures are urgently needed to address the immense human costs \nof the war in Iraq and its tragic effect on the millions of Iraqis--\nmen, woman, and children--who have fled their homes and often their \ncountry to escape the violence.\n  A significant number of courageous Iraqis have worked with the \nAmerican military, the staff of our Embassy, or with American \norganizations to support our mission in Iraq. Their support and loyalty \nhave cost too many lives already, and their families have often been \nforced to flee their communities or even their country because of the \ndanger.\n  The target of the assassin's bullet is on their back, and we owe them \nenormous gratitude. But instead of giving them needed help and \nprotection, we have too often offered only bureaucracy and dubious \nhopes.\n  Regardless of where we stand on the war, Congress is united in \nbelieving that America has a fundamental obligation to assist Iraqis \nwho have courageously supported our forces and our efforts in Iraq and \nwhose lives are in peril as a result. The provisions in the agreement \nare a long-needed attempt to fulfill our commitment to them.\n  Despite the clear and present danger faced by many Iraqis because of \ntheir ties to the United States, their religious affiliation, or their \nwork with media, nongovernmental or humanitarian organizations, the \nvast majority of Iraqi refugees must go through a long and complicated \nreferral process of approximately 8 to 10 months, in which the United \nNations serves as an intermediary outside Iraq. This act cuts through \nmuch of that redtape.\n  Obviously, we cannot resettle all of Iraq's refugees in the United \nStates. But we need to keep faith with the Iraqis who have worked so \nbravely with us and for us and supported our mission in Iraq, and whose \nlives are in serious danger now because of it.\n  A few months ago, I had the honor of meeting SGT Joe Seemiller, a \nyoung man who is haunted by the military motto, ``Leave No Man \nBehind.'' Sergeant Seemiller is dedicated to helping the translator he \nwas forced to leave behind in Iraq. On countless occasions, his \ntranslator helped to avoid serious American and Iraqi casualties. He \nbraved innumerable death threats and the horrific murder of his \nbrother. Finally, he had to flee to Syria, where he waited more than 2 \nyears for the opportunity to be resettled in the United States.\n  The Refugee Crisis Act, makes clear that America has a fundamental \nobligation to assist Iraqis whose lives are in danger because of their \nclose ties to our Nation. I look forward to working with the \nadministration in the months ahead to implement this important \nhumanitarian legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference agreement.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I want to take the \nopportunity to applaud the leadership of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee for their efforts on the Defense authorization conference \nreport. Chairman Levin and the ranking member, Senator McCain, have \ndone a Herculean job of working through the hundreds of conference \nissues in this bill with the House companion bill. The work and effort \nof all parties involved is one of the shining examples of the Congress \nworking together in a bipartisan, bicameral effort to support our men \nand women in uniform.\n  As a signatory to the conference report, I support this bill. There \nis much to like in this bill. We provide necessary benefits to keep our \nrecruiting and retention on the right track. This\n\n[[Page S15614]]\n\nbill includes a 3.5-percent pay increase for uniformed service \npersonnel, establishes a Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, prohibits the increase in TRICARE fees for retirees and \nreservists, increases the grade of the Chief of the Guard Bureau from \nlieutenant general to general. The bill also includes an increase in \nActive Army and Marine Corps end-strength, increases funding for Mine \nResistance Ambush Protected vehicles, increases funding for cooperative \nthreat reduction program efforts, and provides authorizations for \ncritical military construction projects.\n  In addition, as a response to the problems from the Walter Reed \nincidents reported earlier this year, we provide a comprehensive \nWounded Warriors Act as part of the authorization bill. The Wounded \nWarrior provisions would require the Department of Defense, DOD, and \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to jointly develop a \ncomprehensive policy on improvements to care, management, and \ntransition of recovering servicemembers, require DOD to develop a \ncomprehensive plan to treat traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic \nstress disorder and authorize respite care and other extended care \nbenefits for seriously injured servicemembers.\n  While I support this conference report, I want to point out one \nprovision in particular that I have concerns with. This particular \nissue, as I have expressed to the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, is a section of the bill that would require that \nprescriptions dispensed through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program be \nprocured at or below Federal ceiling prices. As I understand it, it is \nthe intent of the language and the intent of the conferees not to \nmodify the current master agreements. I hope that this clarification is \nappropriate, and I wanted to briefly point this out.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their hard work on this report. We \nas a Senate can be proud of this bill. Mr. President, I believe that \nthis is good legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to adopt this \nDefense authorization conference report.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I wish to applaud the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senators Levin \nand McCain, respectively, on passage of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2008.\n  Specifically, I would like to express my gratitude to the bill \nconferees for their inclusion of four amendments that I authored and \nwhich were unanimously adopted by the Senate during its consideration \nof this bill. These provisions will increase oversight of our country's \neconomic and security assistance to Afghanistan by creating a Special \nInspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, section 1229; help \nvictims of state-sponsored terrorism to achieve justice through the \nU.S. courts, section 1083; prevent military health care fees through \nthe TRICARE program from rising, sections 701 and 702; and increase \naccountability and planning for safety and security at the Warren Grove \nGunnery Range in New Jersey, section 359.\n  First, I was proud to be joined by my cosponsors, Senators Coburn, \nDodd, Hagel, Feingold, Webb, and McCaskill, in creating a Special \nInspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. I wrote this \nlegislation because I believe that while a democratic, stable, and \nprosperous Afghanistan is important to the national security of the \nUnited States and to combating international terrorism, I am concerned \nthat we are not achieving all of our goals there. The United States has \nprovided Afghanistan with over $20 billion in reconstruction and \nsecurity assistance. However, repeated and documented incidents of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the utilization of these funds have \nundermined reconstruction efforts. I therefore believe that there is a \ncritical need for vigorous oversight of spending by the United States \non reconstruction programs and projects in Afghanistan.\n  I would like to emphasize that the Government Accountability Office \nand the departmental Inspectors General have provided valuable \ninformation on these activities. However, I believe that the \ncongressional oversight process requires more timely oversight and \nreporting of reconstruction activities in Afghanistan. Oversight by \nthis new Special Inspector General would encompass the activities of \nthe Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the United \nStates Agency for International Development, as well as other relevant \nagencies. It would highlight specific acts of waste, fraud, and abuse, \nas well as other managerial failures in our assistance programs that \nneed to be addressed.\n  This new position will monitor U.S. assistance to Afghanistan in the \ncivilian and security sectors, as well as in the counternarcotics arena \nand will help both Congress and the American people better understand \nthe challenges facing U.S. programs and projects in that country. I am \npleased that this provision has been included by the conferees.\n  Second, this bill includes my legislation to provide justice for \nvictims of state-sponsored terrorism, which has strong bipartisan \nsupport. I believe this legislation is essential to providing justice \nto those who have suffered at the hands of terrorists and is an \nimportant tool designed to deter future state-sponsored terrorism. The \nexisting law passed by Congress in 1996 has been weakened by recent \njudicial decisions. This legislation fixes these problems.\n  In 1996, Congress created the ``state-sponsored terrorism exception'' \nto the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, FSIA. This exception allows \nvictims of terrorism to sue those nations designated as state sponsors \nof terrorism by the Department of State for terrorist acts they commit \nor for which they provide material support. Congress subsequently \npassed the Flatow amendment to the FSIA, which allows victims of \nterrorism to seek meaningful damages, such as punitive damages, from \nstate sponsors of terrorism for the horrific acts of terrorist murder \nand injury committed or supported by them.\n  Congress's original intent behind the 1996 legislation has been \nmuddied by numerous court decisions. For example, the courts decided in \nCicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran that there is no private \nright of action against foreign governments--as opposed to \nindividuals--under the Flatow amendment. Since this decision, judges \nhave been prevented from applying a uniform damages standard to all \nvictims in a single case because a victim's right to pursue an action \nagainst a foreign government depends upon state law. My provision in \nthis bill fixes this problem by reaffirming the private right of action \nunder the Flatow Amendment against the foreign state sponsors of \nterrorism themselves.\n  My provision in this bill also addresses a part of the law which \nuntil now has granted foreign states an unusual procedural advantage. \nAs a general rule, interim court orders cannot be appealed until the \ncourt has reached a final disposition on the case as a whole. However, \nforeign states have abused a narrow exception to this bar on interim \nappeals--the collateral order doctrine--to delay justice for, and the \nresolution of, victim's suits. In Beecham v. Socialist People's Libyan \nArab Jamahiriya, Libya has delayed the claims of dead and injured U.S. \nservice personnel who were off duty when attacked by Libyan agents at \nthe Labelle Discothque in Berlin in 1986. These delays have lasted for \nmany years, as the Libyans have taken or threatened to take frivolous \ncollateral order doctrine appeals whenever possible. My provision will \neliminate the ability of state sponsors of terrorism to utilize the \ncollateral order doctrine.\n  Another purpose of my provision is to facilitate victims' collection \nof their damages from state sponsors of terrorism. The misapplication \nof the ``Bancec doctrine,'' named for the Supreme Court's decision in \nFirst National City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba, \nhas in the past erroneously protected the assets of terrorist states \nfrom attachment or collection. For example, in Flatow v. Bank Saderat \nIran, the Flatow family attempted to attach an asset owned by Iran \nthrough the Bank Saderat Iran. Although Iran owned the Bank Saderat \nIran, the court, relying on the State Department's application of the \nBancec doctrine, held that the Flatows could not attach the \nasset because they could not show that Iran exercised day-to-day \nmanagerial control over Bank Saderat Iran. My provision will remedy \nthis issue by allowing attachment of\n\n[[Page S15615]]\n\nthe assets of a state sponsor of terrorism to be made upon the \nsatisfaction of a ``simple ownership'' test.\n\n  Another problem is that courts have mistakenly interpreted the \nstatute of limitations provision that Congress created in 1996. In \ncases such as Vine v. Republic of Iraq and later Buonocore v. Socialist \nPeople's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the court interpreted the statute to \nbegin to run at the time of the attack, contrary to our intent. It was \nour intent to provide a 10-year period from the date of enactment of \nthe legislation for all acts that had occurred at any time prior to its \npassage in 1996. We also intended to provide a period of 10 years from \nthe time of any attack which might occur after 1996. My provision \nclarifies this intent.\n  My provision also addresses the problems that arose from overly \nmechanistic interpretations of the 1996 legislation. For example, in \nseveral cases, such as Certain Underwriters v. Socialist People's \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, courts have prevented victims from pursuing \nclaims for collateral property damage sustained in terrorist attacks \ndirected against U.S. citizens. My new provision fixes this problem by \ncreating an explicit cause of action for these kinds of property \nowners, or their insurers, against state sponsors of terrorism.\n  Finally, in several cases the courts have prevented non-U.S. \nnationals who work for the U.S. Government and were injured in a \nterrorist attack during their official duties from pursuing claims for \ntheir personal injuries. My provision fixes this inequity by creating \nan explicit cause of action for non-U.S. nationals who were either \nworking as an employee of the U.S. Government or working pursuant to a \nU.S. Government contract.\n  I also want to make special mention of the inspiration for this new \nlegislation. On October 23, 1983, the Battalion Landing Team \nheadquarters building in the Marine Amphibious Unit compound at the \nBeirut International Airport was destroyed by a terrorist bomb killing \n241 marines, sailors, and soldiers who were present in Lebanon on a \npeace-keeping mission. In a case known as Peterson v. the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, filed on behalf of many of the marine victims and \ntheir families, the U.S. District Court ruled in 2003 that the \nterrorist organization Hezbollah was funded by, directed by, and relied \nupon the Islamic Republic of Iran and its Ministry of Information and \nSecurity to carry out that heinous attack. The judge presiding over \nthis case, Judge Royce Lamberth, referred to this as ``the most deadly \nstate-sponsored terrorist attack made against United States citizens \nbefore September 11, 2001.'' In September of this year Judge Lamberth \nfound that Iran not only is responsible for this attack, but also owes \nthe families of the victims a total of more than $2.6 billion for the \nattack. Congress's support of my provision will now empower these \nvictims to pursue Iranian assets to obtain this just compensation for \ntheir suffering. This is true justice through American rule of law.\n  Third, this Defense authorization bill includes my provision to \nprevent proposed increases in enrollment fees, premiums, and pharmacy \ncopayments for TRICARE, the military community's health plan. The \nprincipal coauthor of this provision is Senator Hagel.\n  Both career members of the uniformed services and their families \nendure unique and extraordinary demands and make extraordinary \nsacrifices over the course of 20-year to 30-year careers in protecting \nfreedom for all Americans. I believe they deserve the best retirement \nbenefits that a grateful nation can provide. Proposals to compare cash \nfees paid by retired military members and their families to fees paid \nby civilians fails to adequately recognize the sacrifice of military \nmembers. We must be mindful that military members prepay the equivalent \nof very large advance premiums for health care in retirement through \ntheir extended service and sacrifice.\n  The Department of Defense and our Nation have a committed obligation \nto provide health care benefits to Active Duty, National Guard, \nReserve, and retired members of the uniformed services, their families, \nand survivors, that considerably exceeds the obligation of corporate \nemployers to provide health care benefits to their employees. \nUltimately, the Department of Defense has options to constrain the \ngrowth of health care spending in ways that do not disadvantage current \nand retired members of the uniformed services, and it should pursue any \nand all such options as a first priority. Raising fees excessively on \nTRICARE beneficiaries is not the way to achieve this objective.\n  Finally, I thank the conferees for including my amendment to require \nincreased oversight and accountability, as well as improved safety \nmeasures, at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range in New Jersey. I wrote this \nprovision with Senator Menendez because a number of dangerous safety \nincidents caused by the Air National Guard have repeatedly impacted the \nresidents living nearby the range.\n  On May 15, 2007, a fire ignited during an Air National Guard practice \nmission at Warren Grove Gunnery Range, scorching 17,250 acres of New \nJersey's Pinelands, destroying five houses, significantly damaging 13 \nothers, and temporarily displacing approximately 6,000 people from \ntheir homes in sections of Ocean and Burlington Counties in New Jersey.\n  My provision will require that an annual report on safety measures \ntaken at the range be produced by the Secretary of the Air Force. The \nfirst report will be due no later than March 1, 2008, and two more will \nbe due annually thereafter. My provision will also require that a \nmaster plan for the range be drafted that includes measures to mitigate \nencroachment issues surrounding the range, taking into consideration \nmilitary mission requirements, land use plans, the surrounding \ncommunity, the economy of the region, and the protection of the \nenvironment and public health, safety, and welfare. I believe that \nthese studies will provide the type of information that we need to \nensure that there is long term safety at the range, both for the \nmilitary and the surrounding communities.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I oppose the fiscal year 2008 Defense \nauthorization conference report because it does nothing to end the \nPresident's misguided, open-ended Iraq policy, which has overburdened \nour military, weakened our national security, diminished our \ninternational credibility, and cost the lives of thousands of brave \nAmerican soldiers.\n  There are certain provisions of the report that I support strongly, \nincluding a pay raise for military personnel. I am pleased that the \nconference report contains a number of provisions I supported, \nincluding Senator Webb's amendment creating a Commission on Wartime \nContracting to examine waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nincluding the misuse of force by private security contractors, and \nSenator Lautenberg's amendment to create a Special Investigator General \nfor Afghanistan Reconstruction.\n  But on balance, I cannot vote to support a conference report that \ndefies the will of so many Wisconsinites--and so many Americans--by \nallowing the President to continue one of the worst foreign policy \nmistakes in the history of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield--what do I have, 9 minutes left? \nI yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank Senator Levin of Michigan and \nSenator Warner of Virginia. This is a big piece of work and it took \nthem a long time and a lot of patience and a lot of skill. It is \nvoluminous and contains so much of importance for our national security \ndefense, and I thank them and their staffs for the extraordinary job \nthey did.\n  A word of disappointment before I go into more praise. Troops to \nNurse Teachers is a program Senator Warner and I talked about 2 years \nago. We had hoped to include it in this bill. We passed it in the \nSenate, and we lost it in conference. The idea, of course, is to take \nretired military nurses and move them into nursing faculty positions, \nbecause we have such a shortage in our Nation of nurses. For reasons I \ncan't explain, our good idea turned into a study. Let's hope the study \nturns into a program that brings us more nurses, whom we desperately \nneed.\n\n[[Page S15616]]\n\n  Let me say a word about my vote on this bill. Everyone will have \ntheir own reason for supporting this bill. My reason is a young soldier \nnamed Eric Edmundson. Eric Edmundson, from North Carolina, had been in \nthe Army about 6 or 7 years, was a victim of a traumatic brain injury \nin Iraq, brought out to Walter Reed, went through numerous surgeries, \nsuffered some very debilitating and tough injuries. The VA system tried \ntheir best, sent him to Richmond without the kind of results that the \nfamily or Eric wanted to see. They told the family his only recourse \nwas to go to a nursing home--a nursing home--at the age of 26. His \nfather said: No way. My son is not going to a nursing home. His father, \nEd Edmundson, quit his job. He and his wife started this crusade to get \nEric into the best hospital they could find in America. He ended up in \nthe Rehab Institute in Chicago, paid for by the Federal Government \nafter a long battle. Then, after months of heroic rehabilitation, on \nthe day of his discharge Eric Edmundson walked out of that hospital. I \nwas there that day. I looked at the tears in the eyes of his family, \nhis wife, saw his little baby girl, and realized that we cannot give up \non these wounded warriors.\n  I introduced a bill and commended it to Senators Levin and Warner and \nthanked them personally for including it in this legislation. This bill \nis going to mean that we make extraordinary efforts, as we should, to \nstand behind these veterans and give them the very best care they can \npossibly receive. With that kind of care, many of them can be restored \nto the life they deserve.\n  We also need to start monitoring those who come into the military \nservice on the issue of traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic \nstress disorder to establish cognitive tests as baselines so some of \nthe subtleties of their injuries that aren't discovered for years can \nbe discovered. To go to Walter Reed now to the amputation unit and find \nthe average soldier telling you that he in Iraq has experienced at \nleast 60 concussions that they felt--even if they didn't personally \nharm them; they walked away from them thinking nothing of it, it is \ncumulative. It can come back to haunt them. I went to barracks with \nSenator McCaskill and we visited units and soldiers who went through \nthis. We know this is an ongoing concern and an ongoing obligation, and \nthis bill recognizes it.\n  I salute all of those who made this possible for the passage of this \nbill; the inclusion of the Wounded Warriors Act, the traumatic brain \ninjury bill I worked on. They say you get a lot done around Congress if \nyou don't care who takes the credit. I am glad this bill passes. Even \nthough the one I introduced with my name didn't, the major parts of it \nare included. My vote on behalf of this is for Ed and Beth Edmundson, \nwho did everything in their power for their son, and to Eric Edmundson, \nhis wife Stephanie, and his little daughter Gracie.\n  They are the ones who brought this to my attention and the ones I \nwill be thinking of when I vote today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, for his passion on this issue, this brain injury problem, which \nis bedeviling us. We have now incorporated the original screening so we \nknow where people are who come into the service. This bill has his name \non it as a cosponsor and has his spirit and effort incorporated in it. \nThat is a most important thing. We thank him.\n  Senator Byrd may want to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I spoke to our friend from West Virginia. \nHe said he will not speak now. He also wants to expedite this bill. On \nour side, it could be that Senator Inhofe may appear for a minute or \ntwo.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator McCaskill will ask to be \nrecognized. How many minutes do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Three minutes 48 seconds. The \nother side has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Without even asking, I know Senator Warner would be happy \nto yield a minute or two of his remaining time if she needs it.\n  I thank Senator McCaskill. She has been intrepid on so many issues, \nincluding the ones we talked about on mental health. She brings a \nbackground to the committee which is unique in terms of oversight. We \nare grateful she is on our team.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I have to express how lucky I have \nbeen this year to learn from two titans of bipartisan leadership in \nthis body. If the rest of the Senators would emulate Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin, America would be better off. I thank you for the \nincredible lesson I have had at your knee this year. I also thank \nCongressman Ike Skelton, a giant from Missouri, who, with his gentle \nsmile and steely resolve, helped shepherd this bill through.\n  I want to point out a few of the many provisions that are in here--\nthe ones put in with my auditor's hat on:\n  First, stronger provisions about the definitization of contracts. We \ncannot hold contractors accountable unless we tell them what we want, \nwe are clear about what we want, and then we demand that we get it. \nThat is important.\n  Second, the training of military personnel about contracting. My dad \npeeled potatoes in the Army in World War II. We are never going to have \nsoldiers doing that again; we are going to hire people to do that. We \nhave to make sure we are getting value for that. That means the \nmilitary needs to know how to oversee these contracts.\n  As Senator Levin mentioned, whistleblower protection for the \nemployees of the contractors. Many of them are Americans first, and \nthey want to tell us the bad things that are going on within these \ncontracts. We need to give them the same protection Government \nemployees have for whistleblowing. This legislation accomplishes that, \nand it will do great good for the American taxpayer in terms of \nprotecting our military.\n  Finally, the provision that, as freshmen, we are most proud of--\nSenator Webb and I worked very hard on the Contracting Commission. I \nthink over the next 2 years this country will have an opportunity, in a \nbipartisan way, to provide a high-profile look at contracting and how \nwe can do it better. It is important that we get this right. As Harry \nTruman said, nobody should be allowed to profit off the blood, tears, \nand the deaths of the men and women who serve us so bravely. It is very \nimportant that we get this done.\n  I thank the Senators for the opportunity to speak for a few moments, \nand I appreciate so much their willingness to work with myself and \nSenator Webb, the two freshmen on my side on the committee this year.\n  I am pleased to be supporting the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, a critical bill in setting policy for the Department \nof Defense. However, I unfortunately must note my deep disappointment \nwith some of the content of the legislation.\n  I have and will continue to oppose the practice of adding extensive \nnumbers of ``earmarks'' to Federal spending measures. I believe this \npractice is fiscally irresponsible. And it is earmarks in this \nlegislation that once again proves disconcerting to me.\n  I am aware that a series of unfortunate decisions by House leadership \nresulted in the House passing several appropriations measures, \nincluding the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs funding measure, \nbefore consideration of earmarks sought by House Members was completed. \nThis subsequently resulted in the exclusion of Military Construction \nearmarks for House Members when the National Defense Authorization Act \nwas taken up and passed by the House. The decision of House leaders to \nlater add House earmarks to the Military Construction accounts in the \nMilitary Construction-Veterans Affairs appropriations conference \nproduced a dilemma for authorizers, who had not yet reached a \nconference agreement on the National Defense Authorization Act. \nUltimately, in order to maintain proper order in the legislative \nprocess, authorizers chose to add the House Military Construction \nearmarks to their conference agreement. I find this terribly \nunfortunate and, frankly, unacceptable. But, in light of the special \ncircumstances under which it took place, I have decided not to oppose \nthe Defense Authorization Act.\n  I am pleased that the conference report states the disapproval by \nauthorizers of the process that led to adding these earmarks. I am also \npleased that a strong commitment has been made to not engage in such a \npractice again. I also note, as does the conference report, that the \nauthorized projects have\n\n[[Page S15617]]\n\npreviously been considered and voted on in the House so there has been \na degree of public vetting of these projects. Finally, I am pleased \nthat the National Defense Authorization Act contains no other earmarks \nadded in this offensive manner.\n  In closing, I fully recognize that this legislation contains many \nprovisions critical to today's fighting men and women and to our \nnational security, ranging from a well deserved pay raise to the \nfunding of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle. I am proud to \nhave been a part of developing this legislation and applaud Chairman \nLevin and Chairman Skelton for their efforts. I am also particularly \npleased with the inclusion of vital measures that I worked especially \nclosely on, from extensive acquisition reform and contracting \naccountability measures to a host of new protections and programs for \nAmerica's wounded warriors. Our troops deserve this legislation, but it \nis my hope that the Congress will utilize a better process in achieving \nit in the future.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask now that the remainder of my time be \ngiven to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend from \nVirginia and also the chairman of the committee. They have done a great \njob in getting this bill up, and I was concerned that we weren't going \nto get to it today. That wouldn't have been a good message to send.\n  I think we have a good authorization bill, although I think there are \nsome shortfalls. I am encouraged by the funding levels we are \nauthorizing for the F-22, the F-35, the KC-X, and the Future Combat \nSystem--although with the Future Combat System we did take a cut of \nabout $205 million. That is something I hope we will be able to get \nrestored next time. It is interesting that a lot of people don't \nrealize how important the Future Combat System is. We have not had a \nmajor renovation in transformation on the ground in decades. I do \nbelieve that cut needs to be restored, and I think we can work on that \nin the future.\n  I am further encouraged that the bill authorizes a 3.5-percent \nacross-the-board pay raise. I believe that is very important at this \ntime, as is the authorization of funding for Afghanistan and Iraq. I \nwill be going there again in about 3 weeks. Every time I go, I see the \ngreat successes they are having, and I get very excited. However, while \nwe have authorized something that is adequate in this case, the \nappropriations aren't there yet. I think it is vital that we get this \ndone immediately.\n  There are other areas I want to concentrate on next time. I think the \nTrain and Equip Program is one of the best things we have, the program \nexpanding the IMET Program, where we would be able to train a lot of \nthe military officers of other countries, primarily countries that are \nfound in Africa and others. There was a time when we thought that in \nour IMET Program we were doing them a favor by allowing them to come \nand be trained by us. But now I think we understand that if we don't do \nit, other countries will. There is no better way to ensure the \nallegiance of countries than to train them. I think that needs to be \nimproved.\n  I hope we will get to the point where we recognize that if we in the \nUnited States want to have the best of everything--I am talking about \nthe best lift programs, strike programs, ground programs--we are going \nto have to really do a better job at the top line. We went through 100 \nyears in this country of spending 5.7 percent of our GDP on military, \nand it went down, at the end of the nineties, to about 2.7 percent. It \nis now hanging at about 3.6. I think the expectations of the American \npeople are that we should have the best of everything to do that. We \nare going to have to increase the top line. I believe we will be able \nto address that in the next session.\n  I am glad the bill is here today. I look forward to getting this \npassed and sending the message to our very courageous fighting men and \nwomen that help is on the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. On our side, the distinguished Republican leader is the \nsole remaining speaker. I understand he will be coming to the floor \nshortly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we will close with thanking all of the \nmembers of the committee for their work. On our side, we have a couple \nof old lions, Senator Byrd and Senator Kennedy, and our wonderful \nfreshmen, Senators McCaskill and Webb, who led the way to give us a \nCommission on Contracting. All of the members made major contributions.\n  Since I am sitting in front of Senator Byrd, and I have 3 seconds \nleft, I pay my personal respects to the longest serving member of our \ncommittee as well as, obviously, the senior Member of the Senate. I \nwanted to look that wonderful Senator in the eye and express the \ngratitude of this body and of our committee for what he contributes to \nboth the Senate and the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague in \npaying tribute to our distinguished leader, Senator Byrd. I remember \nthe years when we served under him as majority leader. He always let \nthe Armed Services Committee get whatever time it needed on the floor \nto handle our bills. And then, of course, through all these many years, \nI pleaded with him to reunite West Virginia and Virginia, bring them \nback as one mighty State again. I indicated I would yield my position \nto the Senator and retire into oblivion and let him become the \ndistinguished Senator. He has not accepted my request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is no similar request by this Senator \nto reunite Ohio and Michigan, by the way.\n  I also thank Senator Jack Reed, who has meant so much to the \nCommittee and to me personally over the years.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is true.\n  I also thank the Republican leader for the support he has given me \nand Senator McCain in leading the work of our committee, together with \nour members. I thank each and every one of those members, some of whom \nare on the floor now prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, at the outset, this the penultimate DOD \nauthorization bill for the distinguished Senator from Virginia. What a \nleader he has been on defense issues for his 30 years in the Senate. He \nwill have an opportunity to do one more before he rides off into the \nsunset, much to our regret.\n  I also would like to congratulate Senator Levin for his work on this \nimportant conference report, which is, indeed, a bipartisan \nachievement. I was particularly pleased to see that the committee \nprovided full authorization for the supplemental funding for our troops \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. I was pleased to see the committee recommended \nno policy changes to the Petraeus plan.\n  The Wounded Warriors legislation, which we passed earlier in the \nyear, is also included. The Wounded Warriors bill is vitally important \nto our men and women in uniform and important to the people of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.\n  So I thank the managers of the conference report. This is an \nimportant accomplishment for our men and women in uniform, who we can \nall agree are deserving of this body's full support and our deepest \ngratitude.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the proud history of America's Armed \nForces, I fear that the Bush years will be known as a rare, even a dark \ntime.\n  At a time when we call upon our troops to face new challenges and \ngreat dangers, our President stretched them thin and neglected their \nprotection and care, in many instances. Military readiness levels have \ndropped to levels not seen since Vietnam. Tours of duty keep getting \nextended. We are so bogged down with over 160,000 troops in Iraq that \nwe cannot adequately respond to the grave and growing challenges \nelsewhere, such as bin Laden, who remains free to taunt and threaten \nus; his al-Qaida network, which is more powerful than ever; like \nAfghanistan, where the gains of the past are now backsliding, the drug \ntrade is rampant, and violence is on the rise; Pakistan, where the path \ntoward democracy is wavering significantly.\n  It will take years to recover from the mismanagement of the military \nin the\n\n[[Page S15618]]\n\npast few years by our Commander in Chief.\n  Today, we can take steps that will make our country safer, aid the \nfight against terrorism, and provide our heroic troops with the care \nand support they deserve.\n  Mr. President, my ability to express my appreciation, admiration, and \naffection for Senators Levin and Warner--I am incapable of doing that.\n  To me there are no two finer Senators whoever served this body. There \nare no two Senators who have done more for our armed services. They not \nonly take care of those who are now fighting for us, they take care of \nthose who have fought for us in wars passed.\n  I certainly am going to miss Senator Warner. He has another year with \nus. That is good for Nevada, it is good for Virginia, and it is \nwonderful for our country. He will contribute significantly to the \nwell-being of the Senate and our country during the next year. Senator \nLevin is someone I lean on all the time. He is a person who understands \nwhat legislation is all about, probably more than most all of us. There \nis no one who can look at a piece of legislation and make an analysis \nof what is good and bad about that legislation. It doesn't matter if it \nis a matter dealing with our military or a matter dealing with \nsomething important to his State or, as far as that goes, if there is \nsomething important dealing with my State and I want a real good \nanalysis of it. I don't turn to my staff; I turn to Carl Levin. I say \nto these two fine gentlemen that I speak not only for this Senator, but \nI speak for all Senators.\n  They, and all of us, understand rebuilding our Armed Forces must \nbegin with a sufficient number of troops, but today the military is \nstruggling to meet its recruiting goals. We are taking people into the \nmilitary when we would not have thought of taking them into it a few \nyears ago--people not graduating from high school, people with criminal \nrecords. That is why this Defense authorization bill provides funds to \nspeed the growth of the Army from 512,000 to 547,000, an increase of \n35,000, which is so important, and the Marine Corps, from 180,000 to \n202,000, an increase of 22,000, both of which are significantly above \nthe goals set by President Bush.\n  We also go beyond the President's request for $1 billion for the \nstrategic readiness fund and add $1 billion to replace equipment for \nGuard and Reserve that has been sent to Iraq. Every natural disaster \nexposes the depleted capacity of our Guard and Reserve, and this bill \nbegins to make that right.\n  This Defense bill also refocuses our military by saying there will be \nno permanent bases in Iraq. We need not be seen as an occupying force \nin Iraq. In a couple months, we will begin the sixth year of that war. \nWe don't need permanent bases in Iraq.\n  This legislation has important language addressing potential waste, \nfraud, and abuse by establishing a Commission on Wartime Contracting. \nThis is so important.\n  It beefs up our counterterrorist operations along the Afghan-\nPakistani border to help fight al-Qaida and capture bin Laden, an \neffort that has been abandoned, it seems.\n  Last, but not least, it honors our brave troops who have given so \nmuch and receive sometimes so little in return. We start by giving \neveryone in uniform an across-the-board 3.5 percent pay increase. Those \nin uniform did not join to get rich; they joined to serve our country.\n  This pay increase, as I said, will not make them rich. They did not \nenlist to get rich. They joined the military to serve this great \ncountry. Though a 3.5-percent increase certainly will not make them \nrich, it will help them make ends meet and help their families to do \nthe same as they face the burden of a husband, wife, mother or father \nserving an extended tour of duty someplace in the United States or \naround the world.\n  This pay raise didn't come from President Bush. He opposed it, or I \nshould say part of it. It comes from Congress. We provide care and \nsupport for our troops when they are back home because our commitment \nto them must not end when their combat tours end.\n  The Wounded Warrior Act is in this bill which will improve health \ncare and benefits for recovering veterans, servicemembers, and their \nfamilies.\n  Senator Patty Murray directed me and a number of other Senators to go \nto Walter Reed. She knew what was there. It was early in the morning, \nbut it was a trip that any time of the day would have been beneficial. \nWhat we learned there was the basis of the Wounded Warrior legislation \nled by the Senator from Washington, Patty Murray.\n  The American people will, for many years in the future, be indebted \nto her for this legislation, and I appreciate very much the managers of \nthis bill placing this important legislation in it.\n  I am especially pleased this bill has two provisions I have worked on \nfor years. These two fine managers continue the improvement. The first \nwill expand eligibility for combat-related special compensation for \ndisabled veterans whose combat wounds force them into medical \nretirement before attaining 20 years of service. The three of us have \nworked on this issue for many years. This is very important. Current \nlaw requires these wounded veterans to fund their own disability \ncompensation. We end that practice and do right by these heroes.\n  The second provision will restore equity for disabled retirees that \nthe VA has rated as unemployable. This is the only group of 100 percent \ndisabled retirees who still suffer the unfair disability offset from \ntheir retired pay. This legislation will right that wrong.\n  I would be remiss if I did not express my disappointment that there \nwere not enough votes in the House to pass the hate crimes portion of \nthe bill. There is a longstanding history of addressing hate crimes and \nactually hate violence in Defense authorization bills. It was only \nright and proper that we again did it this year.\n  The hate crimes portion would have made America a safer, better \nplace. It would have given State and local law enforcement agencies the \ntools they need and want.\n  At a time we fight for equality across the globe, we ought to ensure \nequality in America. This issue will not disappear. We will keep \nfighting to give all Americans protection from hate violence.\n  Despite this setback, this is a bill that all 100 Senators can \nproudly support. At times of unprecedented challenges throughout the \nglobe, this legislation will make us safe. At a time when we see a lot \nof waste, mismanagement, and misplaced priorities on the part of this \nadministration and the people with whom they choose to do business, it \nreaches for a higher standard of integrity. That is what this \nlegislation does.\n  At a time of tremendous strain on men and women in uniform, this \nlegislation sends a strong message that we honor them, we respect them, \nand will always stand by them. I urge all my colleagues to send that \nmessage today by overwhelmingly passing this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time consumed today \nbe counted postcloture. I thought consent was ordered last night that \ntook care of this issue. If not, I hope can have this approved.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Nevada for his thoughtful remarks. While we may have differences \non the course, direction, and policies, I don't know of any Senator who \ncomes to the floor and can speak with greater sense of compassion on \nbehalf of the men and women who wear the uniform and their families and \nthose who have borne the brunt of this conflict, not only in Iraq but \nin Afghanistan and other places.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Virginia, Mr. \nWebb, be granted 2 minutes. He worked with Senator Murray on the \nWounded Warrior Act. I knew him very well when he returned from \nVietnam. He served on my staff as a young Marine captain. Had it not \nbeen for what he suffered in that war, he might still be in the Marine \nCorps today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator is recognized, I wish to \nthank the majority leader, Senator Reid, obviously for the comments he \nmade about me, which were extremely meaningful to me and will be \nmemorable to\n\n[[Page S15619]]\n\nmy family, although they will discount it hopefully somewhat. I also \nthank him for his leadership in this body and for the way he has fought \nfor so many causes, not just for our veterans but our troops. Year \nafter year, he is on this floor improving the situation for those who \nhave been badly wounded, retired, and disabled. Without that effort, \nthe progress we have made in the last few years simply could not have \nhappened. I thank him.\n  I am glad Senator Webb was able to get to the floor. I have already \nthanked him for his work on the Commission on which he and Senator \nMcCaskill led an effort, a Commission on contracting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and there are so many other areas in which he is involved. \nI am delighted he was able to get to the floor for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I do not want to take up too much time on \nthe floor. All the salient points have been made, and I know the Senate \nis anxious to vote.\n  First of all, I echo the comments about the majority leader. He has \nto stand up and take a lot of hits on behalf of all of us. I know of no \none who is more highly and sincerely motivated.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with the chairman, Senator Warner, and \nSenator McCain on the Armed Services Committee. I am also on the \nVeterans' Committee. We were able to work with both committees on the \nWounded Warrior project.\n  I would like, very briefly, to give a special thanks to Senator \nWarner, my senior Senator from Virginia, for having stepped forward on \nthis wartime contracts commission and brought it to fruition after \nSenator McCaskill and I had spent a lot of time working on it and were \nin a situation where we didn't know if it actually was going to get \ninto the bill. It was Senator Warner stepping forward and ironing out a \nfew of these provisions and leading the Republican side that made that \npossible.\n  Obviously, I am very strongly in support of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to thank \nCongress for finally raising the mandatory retirement age for \ncommercial airline pilots from age 60 to age 65. This language was \nincluded as part of the ``Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act,'' \nand allows our most experienced commercial pilots to continue providing \nsafe air transportation for the Nation. The House approved the bill \nunanimously.\n  Since 1960, the FAA ``Age 60 Rule'' has restricted pilots age 60 and \nolder from serving on any commercial flight operations. Under the rule, \nit is estimated that our aviation system lost 50 pilots every week.\n  Many in the aviation community, the FAA, and now Congress, have \nreacted to the realization that the Age 60 Rule has become outdated and \ndiscriminatory against one of Alaska's greatest resources, its \nexperienced and seasoned pilots.\n  As my colleagues in the Senate know, the State of Alaska depends on \naviation more than any other State. In our State we find that 50 \npercent of the commercial pilots are over 55.\n  The lack of highway infrastructure creates a situation where aviation \nserves as the traditional road system. More than 70 percent of our \ncommunities can only be reached year around by air, making aircraft \nessential for personal, commercial, cargo, and mail transportation to \nmost parts of our State. Having experienced pilots to deliver goods and \nservices to our communities is essential for Alaskans.\n  Many of our pilots contacted me and told me how the Age 60 Rule was \nimpacting them.\n\n[[Page S15620]]\n\n  In fact, on Wednesday, I met with Gary Miller, a Vietnam veteran and \ncurrent FedEx pilot based in Anchorage. If Congress would not have \nacted on this outdated regulation, Gary would have been forced to \nretire in February.\n  In addition, there are pilots like Captain Bill Green, one of \nAlaska's best Hercules pilots. The Hercules aircraft are used for \ntransporting large cargo shipments. Captain Green turns 60 next April \nand would have been forced into retirement, despite the need for \nqualified, experienced pilots in Alaska.\n  Mike Redmond, who has experience flying every type of aircraft used \nin Alaska--in 2 years he will be 60 years old and under the Age 60 Rule \nAlaskans would have lost his wealth of knowledge and experience.\n  I have supported changing this rule for more than a decade, and I \napplaud the Senate's actions in finally taking hold and raising the age \nto 65.\n  These pilots are our most experienced aviators and are a valuable \nresource to the commercial aviation industry. This action today will \nallow them to continue serving our Nation.\n  It is rare that Congress passes legislation that has such an \nimmediate personal impact on our citizens. This is a proud moment for \nme and for the Congress. I am proud to say the President signed this \nbill immediately when he received it last night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15620-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15620-S15622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FHA MODERNIZATION\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to the important \nfloor debate that has just occurred with respect to FHA reform and the \nsubprime crisis.\n  Mr. President, this subprime crisis is one that is affecting folks \nall across the country, including my State of Minnesota. This isn't \njust a one-State issue or a regional issue, this is a national issue. \nThis is a serious problem for States from Minnesota to Ohio to Florida \nto Nevada. And when you look at the current foreclosure numbers and the \nmortgage reset projections for the next 2 years, it is clear that the \nproblem is not just short term but also one that will become worse in \nterms of the additional number of homeowners who will be affected.\n  Mr. President, when you consider my State of Minnesota, it may come \nas a surprise to some to learn that while Minnesota has consistently \nranked as a leader in homeownership, Minnesota also unfortunately ranks \nup there in terms of the subprime crisis. For the third quarter, \nMinnesota ranks third in the Nation in terms of subprime mortgages in \nforeclosure. In this year alone, foreclosures are expected to increase \nby 84 percent to 20,573.\n  In the State, the subprime crisis isn't just affecting folks in the \nTwin Cities. This is affecting people in the suburbs and in greater \nMinnesota. Just the other day, the Star Tribune ran a story, ``Mortgage \nForeclosures Ripple into Rural Minnesota,'' about how rural Minnesotans \nare being hit by the subprime crisis.\n  Behind all the terrible numbers are people like Ms. Shoua Yang, who \nspoke at last month's housing town hall forum I hosted in Minneapolis. \nMs Yang spoke about how her mortgage payment has gone through the roof, \nfrom $800 to $1,300 per month, because her adjustable rate mortgage has \nreset. Now she and her three children are close to losing the roof over \ntheir heads.\n  But it isn't just homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages who are \nsuffering.\n  It is renters, whose homes have been foreclosed through no fault of \ntheir own. It is construction workers--Minnesota has now lost nearly \n7,000 construction jobs over the year.\n  One of those families who has been directly impacted by the housing \ndownturn is the Buchite family of Zimmerman, MN. At last month's town \nhall forum, Audrey Buchite heart-breakingly spoke of how the loss of \nher husband's job as a house framer has left the family in dire \nfinancial straits, even though they have a fixed, 30-year mortgage. In \norder to make ends meet, they have dropped their health insurance and \ntheir college-bound daughter has decided to help with the family \nfinances instead of going to college.\n  And it is also folks in the timber industry. I was recently up in \nAitkin in northern Minnesota, timber country, as part of my tour of all \n87 Minnesota counties this year.\n  While I was up there, loggers were telling me how the housing \ndownturn is hurting their business by depressing softwood lumber \nprices.\n  Mr. President, as a former mayor, I strongly, believe that home \nownership brings about a boat load of social good. So it goes without \nsaying that if home ownership does so much good, anything that \nthreatens this social good threatens the whole community, not to \nmention the economy at large.\n  And so, Mr. President, with the worst still ahead of us, I approach \nthis crisis with a sense of urgency and commitment to helping at-risk \nand distressed homeowners in a fair and responsible way.\n  To that end I am pleased that we just passed FHA reform legislation \nto enlist the Federal Housing Administration in efforts to stem the \nsurge in housing foreclosures and also prevent buyers from resorting to \nrisky mortgages they may not be able to afford. This is an important \nstep in addressing the subprime crisis--the legislation will increase \nFHA single-family loan limits across the board, at both the high and \nlow ends and will help people refinance into safer mortgages.\n  I am also pleased that the administration has rightly helped to bring \nindustry together to come to terms on a voluntary, market-driven \nmortgage relief plan.\n  Some would argue that the relief plan amounts to a bailout; that it \nviolates free-market principles; that it merely kicks the can down the \nroad. And others claim that it doesn't go far enough.\n  Well, the way I see it, mortgage servicers and investors have a \ncollective self-interest in preventing mass foreclosures from \nhappening. No one wins in a foreclosure.\n  Under the plan, as many as 1.2 million folks can be helped either by \nrefinancing their mortgage or having their interest rates frozen for 5 \nyears, which for many should give them the time needed to keep their \nhomes. To put this in context, 1.8 million subprime mortgages will \nreset in 2008 and 2009.\n  It is important to also have the big picture in mind. If mass \nforeclosures happen, it isn't just the homeowner who has lost his or \nher house who is affected, but also the surrounding homeowners whose \nproperty values may decline, not to mention the impact on our \ncommunities. The key is to help folks who can be responsibly helped to \nkeep their homes.\n  So the way I see it, the administration's mortgage relief plan is an \nimportant, responsible step towards preventing what could be a \nforeclosure catastrophe.\n  In no way however, is the administration's plan the entire solution. \nThere is no one single solution. Rather it will require a comprehensive \nset of solutions including: the just passed FHA reform bill; making \nmortgage debt forgiveness tax free; allowing middle-income homeowners \npenalty-free access to their retirement savings in order to save their \nhomes from foreclosure, as I propose through the HOME Act, the Home \nOwnership Mortgage Emergency Act S. 2201. This legislation is modeled \nafter the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005; and providing \ntemporary, middle-class mortgage bankruptcy relie as proposed by \nSenator Specter's ``Home Owners Mortgage and Equity Savings Act,'' \nHOMES Act, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  We also clearly need better consumer safeguards, and to that end I am \nencouraged the Federal Reserve is planning to issue new rules relating \nto unfair or deceptive mortgage lending practices and mortgage \ndisclosures.\n  But as we work to address the subprime crisis, we need to be careful \nthat we do not unintentionally do harm with policies that could \nrestrict mortgage credit to future home buyers. We have to be mindful \nof the unintended consequences of the policies we pursue.\n  I am just concerned that we could very well end up 5 years from now \nwondering why mortgage credit is not readily available to first-time \nhome buyers.\n  Mr. President, I want to take some time now to speak to one aspect of \nthe\n\n[[Page S15621]]\n\nfallout from the subprime crisis which is near and dear to my heart as \na former mayor, and that is the collateral damage that is being \ninflicted upon communities by the subprime crisis.\n  The on-the-ground reality is that the subprime crisis is setting off \na terrible chain reaction in our communities that, if not mitigated, \nhas the potential to affect communities' standard of living for years \nto come.\n  According to Mayor Tim Howe of Coon Rapids, a suburban community just \nnorth of Minneapolis, one of the greatest effects of the subprime \ncrisis has been the vandalism of foreclosed homes and associated petty \ncrime in the hard-hit neighborhoods. To give you a sense of how quickly \na foreclosed home can become the target of crime and a problem for \ncommunities, consider that in Cleveland a home is looted and vandalized \nin just 3 days. I am sure this is a similar story for communities all \nacross the country.\n  I believe in the broken windows theory that it takes just one small \nact of crime to set in motion bigger troubles down the road. So the \nsooner we address the small problems, the better off we are.\n  For some communities in particular, the subprime crisis also has the \npotential to reverse years of hard-won economic and community \nrevitalization progress, and in no time at all. As mayor, CDBG grants \nhelped fund the Main Street Program helped to revitalize St. Paul, \ncreating thousands of jobs and bringing people back to the city. \nHowever, the current mortgage crisis threatens to undo this very \nprogress.\n  Another aspect of the subprime crisis is how renters, usually of \nmodest means, are finding themselves without a home due to foreclosure. \nThese are just one of the unintended victims of the subprime crisis.\n  So in an effort to enable communities to better deal with the impact \nof the subprime crisis, I introduced this week with Senator Leahy the \nCommunity Foreclosure Assistance Act, S. 2455, which would provide \nemergency community development block grant funding.\n  From the housing town hall forum to my conversations with community \nleaders, I have been told this funding will provide critical support to \ncommunities ranging from renter assistance to mortgage counseling to \ndealing with abandoned, boarded-up homes. Due to the unique flexibility \nof CDBG, communities will able to respond as they need do and quickly.\n  CDBG is a program that has served our communities well overall, and \nin particular, during extraordinary economic distress. We turned to \nCDBG to provide $16.7 billion in response to Hurricane Katrina and $2.7 \nbillion to New York following 9/11. Back home, Minnesota was helped by \nCDBG following the terrible 1997 Red River flood.\n  In a situation like this we cannot be penny-wise and pound-foolish. \nBottomline, this funding can help limit the terrible chain reaction \nthat can be set off by a foreclosure. For if we do not reach out and \nhelp communities in trouble today, the cost to communities will be far \ngreater and far more expensive to deal with in the future.\n  And so, Mr. President, as I have led the bipartisan fight against \nCDBG cuts in past years, I will fight to provide this emergency funding \nas a tool to help communities manage the mortgage crisis. Just because \na foreclosure happens does not mean the entire community needs to \nsuffer. That is the intent of this proposal.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter of support from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National \nAssociation of Counties, National Community Development Association, \nNational Association for County Community and Economic Development, and \nthe National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies, and letters \nof support from the Minnesota Association of Counties, the League of \nMinnesota Cities, and Mayor Mark Voxland of Moorhead, and an article \nfrom the Star Tribune.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune]\n\n           Mortgage Foreclosures Ripple Into Rural Minnesota\n\n                            (By Larry Oakes)\n\n       Duluth.--Theresa Ross had reservations about the subprime \n     mortgage she was offered three years ago but took a chance on \n     the deal. It's a decision she regrets.\n       A licensed practical nurse with an older, two-bedroom house \n     in Brainerd, Ross said the loan has wreaked havoc on her \n     finances and brought her to the verge of foreclosure. Her \n     monthly mortgage payment nearly doubled recently.\n       ``I don't want to end up homeless because of this,'' she \n     said.\n       Ross is part of a rural Minnesota demographic that might be \n     feeling the subprime mortgage crisis more acutely than their \n     urban counterparts.\n       Until the housing bubble burst, surging property values in \n     rural Minnesota combined with lower, often-stagnant incomes \n     made many rural residents targets for subprime loans, \n     according to experts who have been analyzing foreclosure \n     data.\n       In rural areas, many residents found themselves house rich \n     but cash poor--and took advantage of loan offers that allowed \n     them to convert some of their home equity to cash.\n       ``It wasn't people buying homes they couldn't afford,'' \n     said Dan Williams, whose work as senior program manager for \n     Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota includes counseling \n     rising numbers of homeowners near or in foreclosure. ``It was \n     lake and recreational property demand driving up the [local] \n     property values, which created huge markets for cold-calling \n     and `cash-out' refinancing.''\n       Although average overall foreclosure rates are higher in \n     the seven-county Twin Cities area, six of the seven counties \n     with the highest rates are in outstate Minnesota. Those six--\n     Chisago, Kanabec, Isanti, Mille Lacs, Sherburne and Wright--\n     are close enough to the metro area to be influenced by its \n     property values and exurban expansion.\n       In those counties, an increase in younger home buyers with \n     less wealth may explain some of the foreclosure problem, said \n     Richard Todd, a vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of \n     Minneapolis.\n       Just as rural areas lag behind metro areas in fashion and \n     other trends, the subprime wave took longer to reach outstate \n     Minnesota, and it will take longer for the negative effects \n     to fully materialize, Williams said.\n       And rural residents may have more difficulty getting back \n     on their feet because of their lower incomes and because \n     rural Minnesota has fewer housing options.\n\n\n                       ``I acted on blind faith''\n\n       While sheriff's foreclosure sales shot up 125 percent last \n     year in some metro counties, some of their rural \n     counterparts, such as Rock and Traverse counties, were hit \n     much harder, with increases of more than 200 percent, \n     according to a report by the Greater Minnesota Housing Fund \n     and Housing Link.\n       In Brainerd, Ross traces her troubles to a decision to \n     price new vinyl windows and siding. When she said a \n     contractor's quote of $21,000 was too steep, he said that a \n     mortgage company he worked with could refinance her house, \n     improvements included.\n       Ross, 49, who is single, balked at the adjustable 7.7 \n     percent interest rate; at the time she had a fixed rate of \n     5.4 percent. But the contractor and lender assured her that \n     her home's rising value would allow her to refinance again in \n     a couple of years at a favorable and fixed rate.\n       She said they also misled her about the projected payment \n     amount, saying it included taxes and insurance when it did \n     not.\n       Home values stalled, and now Ross is stuck with a mortgage \n     rate at 9 percent, little equity and no chance of \n     refinancing. Her monthly take-home pay barely covers her \n     $1,300 payment, and she ruefully longs for her old payment of \n     $695. Though she quit driving, canceled her cable and \n     Internet service and line dries her clothes, she said she \n     still can't make ends meet.\n       Even if she sells, the amount she's likely to get won't pay \n     off the mortgage, she said.\n       ``I acted on blind faith that they were sincere and trying \n     to help me, but they were just out to make a buck,'' Ross \n     said. ``Now, if I don't sell the house or get a renter, I'll \n     be in foreclosure in the next few months.''\n\n\n                        The worst is yet to come\n\n       In St. Louis County, which contains Duluth, records show \n     the Sheriff's Office handled 325 foreclosure sales in 2006, \n     up from 219 the year before.\n       Duluth real-estate agent Michelle Lyons said that since \n     March she's been inundated with requests by banks to sell \n     properties in foreclosure.\n       ``I went from two or three [requests] a month about a year \n     ago to two or three a week now,'' said Lyons, of Port Cities \n     Realty.\n       She predicts the numbers will only get worse in the next \n     two years as even more loans adjust to their higher rates and \n     borrowers find themselves unable to refinance.\n       ``Yes, there were predatory lenders,'' she said. ``But it \n     also involved people living above their means, as well as \n     divorces and medical problems.''\n       Some of those in foreclosure ``deserve to be foreclosed \n     on,'' she said, including owners of a Duluth property who \n     trashed their house before vacating. When the bank finally \n     took possession, even the copper pipes had been ripped out, \n     presumably for scrap value.\n       But others, she said, are good people who were misled by \n     unscrupulous lenders or overtaken by forces beyond their \n     control.\n       As an example, she cited her clients Dave and Marykay \n     Andert, a rural Duluth couple who are trying to sell to avoid \n     foreclosure.\n\n[[Page S15622]]\n\n       Dave Andert, 46, is perhaps an unlikely victim of the \n     subprime trap; he once worked as a loan officer, writing \n     mortgages for Beneficial Corp.\n       So in 2005, when the Anderts sought a $215,000 loan to buy \n     a nearly new home tucked on a wooded lot in Solway Township, \n     he spent four hours carefully reading the terms of the loan, \n     offered by a now-defunct company called New Century.\n       In particular, Andert said, he made sure he was getting a \n     fixed rate and disability insurance, which was important to \n     him because he suffers from neurological condition that had \n     been giving him chronic headaches.\n       Confident that he knew the terms, Andert didn't closely \n     read the documents he signed at closing. He now believes a \n     dishonest mortgage loan officer substituted new documents, \n     giving him an adjustable rate and no disability insurance.\n       Now on long-term disability and bringing in only 40 percent \n     of his previous income, Andert said his family will never \n     afford the $2,300 mortgage payment that will start next year, \n     up from $1,500 when they first got the loan.\n       Since then, the loan has been sold twice, and he's worked \n     with the latest bank to get extensions to gain time to sell \n     the house.\n       ``We didn't plan on moving again,'' Andert said. ``It's \n     beautiful out here. It gets very emotional some days, to \n     stand looking out my window and seeing the deer and thinking \n     we have to leave.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                                December 11, 2007.\n     Senator Norm Coleman,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coleman: The undersigned organizations of \n     local elected officials and housing and community development \n     practitioners write in support of the Community Foreclosure \n     Assistance Act of 2007. The legislation would provide $1 \n     billion through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) \n     program to local governments and states to address the impact \n     of foreclosures. Foreclosure-based rental assistance would \n     also be provided to renters through the legislation.\n       Local governments are experiencing the growth in sub-prime \n     mortgage foreclosures with dire predictions for citizens, \n     neighborhoods, and local economies. With the mortgage crisis \n     predicted to get worse over the next year, local governments \n     are poised to tackle the issue on multiple fronts: support of \n     strong federal anti-predatory and bankruptcy legislation, \n     support of reform and modernization of the Federal Housing \n     Administration (FHA), and through legislation such as the \n     Community Foreclosure Assistance Act, assistance to citizens \n     who have lost or are losing their homes.\n       We commend your legislative initiative which not only \n     provides additional funding for CDBG, but allows more \n     flexibility in the program by increasing the public services \n     cap from 15% to 25% and lowers the current low- and moderate-\n     income requirement from 70% to 50%. In addition, the bill \n     allows local governments and states to request a general \n     waiver to further provide foreclosure assistance.

Norm Coleman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coleman: The League of Minnesota Cities \n     supports measures incorporated into the Community Foreclosure \n     Assistance Act of 2007 that you introduced today to address \n     the growing problems and increasing costs that cities face to \n     retain and protect vacant homes in foreclosure.\n       Cities, both large and small, face deteriorating conditions \n     in many locations and are undertaking the often difficult and \n     costly challenge of preserving neighborhoods and affordable \n     housing stock threatened by growing numbers of foreclosures. \n     The loss of housing for families and individuals who are \n     often renting homes that are in foreclosure is another \n     troubling source of neighborhood instability and personal \n     hardship.\n       The Community Foreclosure Assistance Act proposes to \n     address the impact of these foreclosures on local units of \n     government through emergency appropriations to be added to \n     the FFY 2008 funding for the Community Development Block \n     Grant (``CDBG'') Program. League support is also offered in \n     view of the fact that funding for the Community Foreclosure \n     Assistance Act will not be off-set from the critically \n     important resources committed to current and future CDBG \n     activities.\n       The proposed provisions offer communities flexibility in \n     addressing the most pressing problems resulting from \n     residential foreclosures at the local level by raising the \n     CDBG cap for public service expenditures to 25 percent and \n     targeting the most at risk populations by lowering income \n     requirements to 50 percent of area median income, but also \n     allowing cities to request waivers from those requirements to \n     address their specific circumstances.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James F.

Norm Coleman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coleman: I am writing to you today in support \n     of the Community Foreclosure Assistance Act of 2007. The \n     legislation would provide $1 billion through the Community \n     Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to local governments \n     and states to address the impact of foreclosures. This \n     legislation would give tools to cities across the country to \n     address the negative effects of foreclosures on neighborhoods \n     and communities.\n       Your support of innovative legislation such as the \n     Foreclosure Assistance Act exemplifies your continued \n     commitment to local units of government. As Mayor, I can \n     speak firsthand to the positive impact that programs such as \n     CDBG have on cities and our residents, and I would like to \n     thank you for advancing this important piece of legislation. \n     Your continued support of communities throughout Minnesota \n     and the nation is very much appreciated.\n       I look forward to continuing our work with you on this and \n     other matters in the future. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mark Voxland,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an amendment \nthat will improve the nutrition and health of our Nation's school \nchildren.\n  Annually, the United States spends approximately $300 million for \nnutrition education for the Women, Infants, and Children, WIC Program \nand $500 million for nutrition education in conjunction with the Food \nStamp Program. However, there is virtually no funding being dedicated \nto nutrition education in our Nation's schools.\n  You might ask why nutrition education in the school setting is \nimportant. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n16 percent of children between 6 and 19 years old are overweight or \nobese--a number that has tripled since 1980. Experts agree that the \nlack of physical activity and poor eating habits contribute to this \nepidemic. While national guidelines recommend 150 minutes of physical \nactivity each week for elementary children and 225 minutes for older \nchildren, few schools meet these criteria. In addition, studies have \nshown that children who eat well-balanced meals at school are more \nlikely to practice lifelong healthy eating and help their families make \nsmart meal choices.\n  Accordingly, my amendment provides $18 million to States to educate \nschoolchildren on the importance of consuming a nutritious diet as well \nas increasing their level of physical activity. Funds will be directed \nto the Team Nutrition Network, which is administered by the USDA, and \nthen distributed to the States in the form of a grant.\n  In addition, this amendment also calls on USDA to conduct periodic \nsurveys of foods purchased by school food authorities participating in \nthe National School Lunch Program. According to USDA, the most recent \ndata on school food purchases are a decade old. New data would help \nUSDA to provide guidance to schools to create meals that conform to the \nmost recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans, better manage the types \nand varieties of foods procured by USDA on behalf of schools, and \nassess the economic impact of school food purchase on various commodity \nsectors.\n  During my tenure in the U.S. Senate, I have been a strong advocate \nfor nutrition programs, especially those that are targeted at our \nNation's children. During the last farm bill, I proposed an amendment \nthat directed a portion of loan rates to increase food stamp benefits \nfor the disabled and working families with children. This was a small \nprice to help provide for some of the neediest in our Nation.\n  In addition, I have introduced legislation in past Congresses that \nwould have encouraged the increased consumption of calcium-rich milk by \nschool children, provided grants to schools to make available healthy \nfood choices, and expanded the School Breakfast Program.\n  Federal nutrition programs are an important safety net for our \ncountry, especially our Nation's children. I hope my colleagues \nunderstand the importance of addressing this issue, and I urge them to \nsupport my amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the passage of \nthe 2007 farm bill reauthorization. First, I would like to thank \nChairman Harkin, Ranking Member Chambliss and their staff for their \ntireless efforts to compile comprehensive farm legislation that \naddresses many differing interests. I truly benefited from their \nguidance on agriculture matters and look forward to working with them \non the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.\n  The passage of this legislation is a testament to the will of the \nSenate to sustain our Nation's agriculture industry. A product of much \nnegotiation and compromise, this bill contains true reform and provides \nfor our Nation through improvements in nutrition, conservation, rural \ndevelopment and energy programs.\n  I applaud the Senate's commitment to maintaining and improving the \ncurrent safety net for producers. It is vital that we continue to \nsupport these programs so that our producers can remain competitive \nglobally and survive here in the United States. As a matter of national \nsecurity, we must support programs that will ensure a reliable and \nconstant food supply for all Americans.\n  The Senate-passed language touches the lives of millions of Americans \nwho benefit from food assistance, conservation and land stewardship, \nrural development, and energy programs. I am especially pleased by the \nprovisions relating to energy programs and our farming community. I \nbelieve that our producers can play an important role in addressing \nclimate change. This bill takes important strides towards the \nprotection of our environment through the authorization of energy \nprograms that build on the potential of cellulose-based ethanol as an \nalternative energy source.\n  This legislation is the product of many months of negotiations and \nundoubtedly the sacrifices of many in order to arrive at this juncture. \nI am hopeful that the Conference Committee will produce a conference \nreport similar to the Senate version of the farm bill, and that the \nSenate considers it in a timely manner so that all Americans can \nbenefit from these programs at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish today to state my support of the \nSenate farm bill and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \nmeasure. While this bill is not perfect, I believe that it contains \nstrong agriculture policy that will advance a number of initiatives \nimportant to Great Plains production agriculture and to farmers and \nranchers across America.\n  I would like to first thank my good friend from Iowa, Tom Harkin, \nwho, as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, shepherded this \nfine bill through the committee consideration process. Chairman Harkin \nhas been considerate to the contribution of the Great Plains region to \nour nation's agriculture economy and national food security, and this \nproduct reflects that recognition.\n  I am also pleased that this bill reflects many of the priorities that \nwere shared with me not only in roundtable discussions in South Dakota \nwith interested stakeholders, but also through letters, e-mails and \nphone calls from people in my home State.\n  I would like to take this time to speak to some of the provisions \ncontained in this legislation, and why these provisions will be good \nfor South Dakota agriculture. To begin with title I, this measure \noffers strong commodity safety nets, which is arguably the anchor of \nthe omnibus Federal Farm Bill that Congress reauthorizes every 5 years. \nUnder this legislation, our commodity payment structure is retained, \nwith modest, albeit important, increases made to the loan rates\n\n[[Page S15624]]\n\nand target prices for many commodities. Among those commodities seeing \nimprovements under this bill are sorghum--target price increase to \n$2.63/bu.--barley--loan rate increase to $1.95/bu. as well as a target \nprice increase to $2.63/bu.--oats--increase in loan rate to $1.39/bu. \nand increase in target price to $1.83/bu.--wheat--loan rate increase to \n$2.94/bu. and target price increase to $4.20/bu.--soybeans--target \nprice increase to $6.00/bu.--oilseeds--loan rate increase to $10.09/\ncwt. and target price increase to $12.74/cwt.--and wool and honey--\nestablished loan rates are $1.20/lb. and $.72/lb., respectively--in \naddition to desirable target prices and loan rates for dry peas, \nlentils, and chickpeas.\n  Producers will also have a choice for participation in the Average \nCrop Revenue, ACR, program, under which payments will be made when the \nState revenue for a covered commodity is less than the average \nguarantee for that particular commodity. I do retain concerns for the \nimplementation of this particular program because of the drastic \ndisparity in county-based revenue in my home State of South Dakota. I \nam, however, pleased that the basic farm safety net from the 2002 \nmeasure remains intact, and that the ACR program was delinked from crop \ninsurance during committee consideration.\n  Under this package, our farmers and ranchers across the nation will \nalso benefit from a structured response to emergency agriculture \ndisaster. This structured response program also will not, I am very \npleased to say, function as a disincentive for investing in coverage \nunder the Federal Crop Insurance Act, FCIA, and the Non-Insured Crop \nDisaster Assistance Program, NAP. The United States Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, and White House have been less than friendly toward \nour efforts to secure meaningful disaster assistance, going so far as \nto issue multiple veto threats against emergency spending initiatives \nbecause they contained meaningful relief for farmers and ranchers. The \nWhite House claimed that farmers and ranchers across America were \ngenerating remarkable revenue and enjoying tremendous profits, which \nclearly demonstrates this administration's disconnect with agricultural \ncommunities throughout the United States. Agriculture disaster is like \nany other natural disaster, and I am very proud to have pushed with my \nSenate colleagues for the proposal included in this bill.\n  As the author of the COOL provision included in the 2002 farm bill, I \nam pleased to see that this bill contains a very critically important \ncompromise on mandatory Country of Origin Labeling, COOL, that will \nallow for streamlined, commonsense implementation, which is something \nthat the USDA has been unable to accomplish in the 5-plus years since \nthe enactment of the 2002 farm bill. The USDA has mercilessly botched \nthe rulemaking process on this consumer right-to-know and producer \nmarketing program, promulgating unworkable regulations that would \nburden farmers and ranchers as well as retailers.\n  The COOL compromise language included in the committee version of the \nfarm bill, which was passed unanimously by that body, allows, for \nexample, for the use of records for origin verification which are part \nof daily business, in addition to allowing State, region or locality of \nthe United States information as being sufficient to identify the \nUnited States as the point of origin. These implementation guidelines \nare important to ensure that producers or retailers are not saddled \nwith unnecessary costs or recordkeeping burdens that the USDA would \nhave preferred, and that we can deliver a program that in excess of 91 \npercent of American consumers want.\n  The Senate version of the farm bill also contains another measure \nwhich I have championed for years, pertaining to the livestock sector. \nI am pleased that the ban on packer ownership of livestock was included \nin the en bloc amendments during committee consideration of the bill, \nwhich speaks to the significant support this measure retains within the \nSenate. The livestock industry is faced with ever-increasing horizontal \nconcentration and vertical integration, and our independent farmers and \nranchers are confronted with a shrinking number of opportunities for \nprice discovery and product promotion. The packer ban would rectify \nthis very negative and troubling transition in the livestock industry.\n  The packer ban adopted by the committee would ensure that packers \ncannot own livestock more than 14 days prior to slaughter. There are a \nnumber of reasonable exceptions to this prohibition, including packers \nthat own only one slaughtering facility, packers that are not required \nto participate in the Mandatory Price Reporting, MPR, program, and for \ncooperatives. The packer ban would ensure that farmers and ranchers are \nmaterially engaged with the management of their livestock.\n  I offered the packer ban during consideration of the 2002 farm bill \non the Senate floor, and it was adopted by the body of the Senate. It \nwas, unfortunately, stripped out of the final bill during conference \nconsideration, as was the ``competition title'' included in the Senate \nversion of the bill. Our livestock producers have waited long enough \nfor these provisions, and I will continue to work with the Chairman of \nthe Agriculture Committee to see the packer ban passed into law. It is \ngood policy.\n  In that same vein, I am pleased to see several other competition \nprovisions that are included in this bill. This farm bill would ensure \nthat contracts are fairer for growers, in that producers must agree and \nconsent to arbitration before it may be used for dispute settlement. \nThe bill also allows for the creation of a Special Counsel for \nAgricultural Competition within USDA. Both prosecutions and \ninvestigations will be combined within one office, and the counsel will \noversee enforcement activities in coordinating with the Department of \nJustice and Federal Trade Commission. It is my hope that this counsel \nwill serve to offer a greater level of transparency and that we may, in \nfact, see justice served with respect to egregious misdeeds in our \nlivestock sector.\n  I am, however, greatly disappointed about the exclusion of Dorgan-\nGrassley amendment No. 3695, of which I cosponsored, to enact \ncommonsense, meaningful farm program payment limitations.\n  The current farm program payment structure has, quite simply, failed \nrural America. Approximately 71 percent of our farm benefits are \nabsorbed by only 10 percent of the farming community. Our omnibus farm \nbill is intended to promote programs that function as a safety net for \nfarmers, in contrast to the cash cow they have become for a few \nproducers. I do not favor eliminating our farm program benefits, but \nrather prefer that they are targeted to small and medium sized \nproducers instead of large agribusiness.\n  The farm bill also includes a forward-looking energy title to grow \ndedicated energy crops and capture the ingenuity of agriculture \nproducers to use biomass for energy production. The title invests in \nthe applied agriculture research already occurring at State \nuniversities and land-grant colleges. Importantly, the bill also \nbalances the increasing demand to use working lands for energy \nproduction with safeguards for protecting air, land, and water quality.\n  The bill establishes a loan guarantee and competitive grant program \nto jump-start the construction of biorefineries producing renewable \nfuels from dedicated energy crops. To meet the ambitious goal of \nproducing 36 billion gallons of renewable biofuels in 2022, the farm \nbill establishes a program to provide access to capital for the \nconstruction of pilot and demonstration-scale biorefineries to produce \nadvanced biofuels. Up to 80 percent of the costs of eligible projects \ncould be covered through a loan guarantee. Also, the programs intent is \nclear that eligible projects include the conversion of existing fossil-\nfuel biorefineries powered by natural gas for loan guarantees and \ncompetitive grants to repower these facilities using renewable energy \nresources. South Dakota is a leader in producing ethanol from grains, \nbut there is the long-term promise of using biomass and dedicated \nenergy crops for producing advanced biofuels at a fraction of the \nenergy input requirement. I am glad that the program will include a \nfocus on biorefineries converting fuel generation sources for producing \nadvanced biofuels. This section in the bill is essential toward our \nability to significantly expand renewable fuel production.\n  The farm bill also builds on the 2002 act by providing $345 million \nin mandatory funding to enable biorefineries to\n\n[[Page S15625]]\n\nmake greater purchase of renewable biomass for advanced biofuel. These \npayments will increase the purchase of feedstocks for next generation \nbiofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol.\n  I am glad that the bill harnesses the expertise of land grant \nInstitutions by reauthorizing the Sun grant initiative and providing a \nmodest amount of dedicated funding for carrying out program goals. \nSince 2005, the Sun grant Initiative has enhanced coordination between \nthe Department of Energy and the United States Department of \nAgriculture to assess and improve resource availability and feedstock \neconomics. The research and applications pursued through Sun grant is \ncrucial toward the eventual commercialization of dedicated energy \ncrops. Assessing the potential availability of energy feedstocks within \ngeographic regions can target which energy crops are optimal for \nbiofuel production. In the Midwest and Great Plains that might mean \ncultivation of switchgrass while in the Southeast, poplar trees or \nother fast-growing biomass may be optimal. Ultimately the research \nconducted by the regional Sun grant centers will go a long way in \nanswering these regional questions and determining how best over the \nlong-term to produce fuel from non-grain biomass.\n  The conservation title included in this bill will encourage sound \nland stewardship and land management practices. I requested, for \nexample, that the Senate version of the farm bill extend the \nConservation Reserve Program, CRP, and this program was extended with a \n39.2 million acre cap through 2012. The Grasslands Reserve Program was \nalso included in the chairman's mark and extended at a $240 million \nauthorized level. I supported the payment limitations cap that would \nhave increased the authorization for this program, and while it is \nunfortunate that this program wasn't expanded, I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues to push for adequate funding.\n  The Wetlands Reserve Program was reauthorized in the bill at 250,000 \nthrough 2012, and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program was \nextended out with baseline funding. The program would provide for 75 \npercent cost-share, with the exception that beginning and young farmers \nor socially disadvantaged farmers would receive 90 percent cost-share \nor 15 percent above prevailing rates.\n  In several of my farm bill meetings, it was expressed to me that USDA \nlocal work groups should be exempted from the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act, FACA, by folding them into the State Technical \nCommittees. USDA local work groups coordinate USDA programs with other \nFederal, State and tribal programs. FACA prohibits nongovernment \nindividuals, including farmers, from the USDA working group formal \ndecisionmaking process, whereas the State Technical Committee is \nexempted from FACA. The farm bill includes this change, allowing for \nfarmers to be an integral and important part of the formal \ndecisionmaking process.\n  The Senate version of the farm bill contains a Sodsaver program, to \nensure that our nation's native grasslands remain intact. The program \nwould prohibit crop insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act or \nNoninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program payments on broken, native \nsod indefinitely, allowing for exceptions with plots under 5 acres and \ndiscretionary exemption by the Secretary of Agriculture for parcels \nbetween 5 and 20 acres.\n  When we talk about the farm bill, we naturally tend to focus on the \nprovisions that affect our Nation's agricultural producers. I am \npleased to note that we have crafted a farm bill that will also greatly \nimprove Federal policy in the area of rural development, whose purpose \nis to improve the quality of life for citizens of rural areas who are \nnot directly engaged in traditional agricultural production. With a \nbill that benefits our producers and as well as those who make a living \noff the farm, I believe citizens in the rural portions of our great \nNation can look forward to many brighter days ahead.\n  Last year, I announced my Hometown Prosperity Plan, which is an \neconomic development agenda that lays out my priorities for advancing \nSouth Dakota's economy from the Federal level. The strategies in my \nplan provided a framework for my priorities in the rural development \ntitle of the 2007 farm bill. These priorities include: (1) ``Promoting \nPartnerships,'' or encouraging greater regional economic cooperation to \nenhance competitiveness; (2) ``Emphasizing Entrepreneurship,'' or \nplacing more emphasis on cultivating the creation of new businesses, as \na supplement to the traditional strategy of luring existing businesses \nfrom elsewhere; (3) ``Investing in the Public Good'' by directing \nFederal funds to projects that yield a positive return in the form of \nhigher standards of living, more jobs, and more prosperity; and (4) \n``Protecting Pocketbooks'' by combating trends that sap economic \nstrength, such as rising health care costs, rising fuel prices, and \nstagnant wages.\n  In the spring of this year, as Chairman Harkin was assembling his \nproposals for the rural development portion of the farm bill, I wrote \nto him to outline my rural development priorities. I was pleased to \nfind a great deal of common ground in our respective priorities, which \nis not surprising, since our two States share a border and many common \ncharacteristics. Senator Harkin, the Agriculture Committee, and \nultimately the full Senate, have produced a farm bill that would enact \nmany of the proposals in my Hometown Prosperity Plan, and I would like \nto highlight a few of those.\n\n  One of the ways I proposed to act on the strategy of ``promoting \npartnerships'' was to relaunch the Northern Great Plains Regional \nAuthority, which was created in the 2002 farm bill. The authority is a \nvoluntary organization modeled after the successful Appalachian \nRegional Commission. Its mission is to enhance economic development by \npromoting greater interstate economic cooperation and collaboration \nacross North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota. The \norganization was created by Congress with the blessing of the \nPresident, and is authorized to receive $30 million each year for 5 \nyears to boost the competitiveness of our region. Unfortunately, the \nPresident inexplicably changed his mind about the organization, and has \nblocked its operation and most of its funding. The 2007 farm bill would \nmodify the organization's governance structure to allow the \norganization to begin operating even without active support from the \nPresident.\n  In addition to promoting economic partnerships between states, we can \nalso improve our economic performance through greater cooperation \nbetween rural communities within our respective states. The new farm \nbill would stimulate this kind of cooperation through the new Rural \nCollaborative Investment Program, RCIP. Under this program, communities \nwithin a region could receive Federal funds to leverage matching \nprivate contributions in support of regional economic planning and \nprojects.\n  My strategy of ``investing in the public good'' means providing \nFederal investments in activities the pay themselves back with \nincreased rural prosperity and quality of life. This farm bill would \nincrease the volume and quality of our investments in the public good \nby extending, refining, and expanding several existing grant and loan \nprograms operated by USDA rural development. These include community \nfacilities grants and loans, water and wastewater infrastructure grants \nand loans, the rural business enterprise grants, rural business \nopportunity grants, value added agriculture development grants, \nintermediary relending, distance learning and telemedicine grants and \nloans, and the broadband access program, among others. These programs \nhave proven their effectiveness in improving the quality of life for \nrural citizens across South Dakota, and they would have an even great \nimpact if we enact the farm bill approved by the Senate.\n  A great deal of research now demonstrates that my strategy of \n``emphasizing entrepreneurship'' is one of the most effective ways we \ncan generate new private-sector job growth in our rural communities. \nOne of the ways I proposed to act on this strategy was by providing \nincentives for greater private-sector equity investment in rural \nbusiness through the Rural Business Investment Program, RBIP. \nUnfortunately, venture capital and other forms of equity are relatively \nscarce in rural States, and the RBIP was created in\n\n[[Page S15626]]\n\nthe 2002 Farm Bill to address this scarcity. It was modeled on a \nsimilar program operated successfully by SBA. Unfortunately, overly \ncomplicated implementation rules have prevented this program from \nachieving its potential of luring more private investment to fast-\ngrowing companies in rural America. By modifying and streamlining the \nprogram, the new farm bill will catalyze more private investment and \nmore rapid private-sector job creation in rural communities.\n  Another way to emphasize entrepreneurship is by stimulating more \nbusiness startups through microlending. Many would-be entrepreneurs in \nlocal areas cannot get access to the small quantities of capital needed \nto implement sound concepts for new businesses. The delivery of \n``microloans'' to these individuals is a proven way of creating more \nsmall businesses. Because microloan programs require small quantities \nof capital, and the loans are repaid, the programs are also highly \ncost-effective. The farm bill's new Rural Microenterprise Assistance \nProgram would help to reverse the loss of rural population that results \nfrom inadequate economic opportunities.\n  Among other things, my strategy of ``protecting pocket books'' means \ntaking action to address economic trends that sap our economic \nstrength, such as exploding health care costs. One way we will do that \nin this farm bill is by providing federal funds for conversion to \nelectronic records at rural hospitals. Keeping these hospitals viable \nhelps rural citizens avoid lengthy trips to health care facilities in \nfar-away cities. And computerizing medical records at those hospitals \nshould increase their efficiency and reduce costs to consumers. Between \nthis initiative, and our extension of the Distance Learning and \nTelemedicine grant and loan program, I believe we can help to reverse \nthe rising healthcare costs that are especially hard on the pocketbooks \nof rural citizens.\n  In any piece of legislation as comprehensive and far-reaching as a \nfarm bill, there are always components whose final form leaves room for \nimprovement. Unfortunately, that maxim holds true in the case of the \nfarm bill approved by my Senate colleagues and me. Nevertheless, on the \nwhole I am pleased with this bill in general and its rural development \ncomponents in particular. By enacting many proposals from my Hometown \nProsperity Plan, this bill would improve the economy and quality of \nlife in the rural communities that South Dakotans call home. I \nappreciate my Senate colleagues' support for these initiatives, and am \nhopeful that we can realize their promise by enacting this bill into \nlaw.\n  We live in a country of great abundance, yet millions of Americans go \nto bed hungry each night. With more than 39 million people in the \nUnited States participating in federally supported nutrition programs \neach year, it is crucial that the farm bill contains a nutrition title \nthat not only feeds the hungry, but also works toward ending hunger, \npreventing obesity and improving diets. Given the budgetary constraints \nthat our Senate Agriculture Committee faced in crafting this farm bill, \nI applaud them for writing a strong nutrition title, which will well \nserve America's nutrition needs for years to come.\n  I was extremely pleased that the Food Stamp Program has been \nmodernized to meet the many needs that low-income families face every \nday. Roughly 58,000 South Dakotans currently receiving food stamp \nbenefits each month will now be able to buy more food with their \nbenefits and will be able to better afford child care. Families will \nalso be able to save for their futures, while still remaining eligible \nfor the program by exempting tax-preferred education and retirement \naccounts from counting against the asset limit.\n  As many of America's low-income seniors are being forced to choose \nbetween much-needed prescription drugs and paying their bills, sadly, \nmany are left unable to afford an adequate and nutritious diet. The \nCommodity Supplemental Food Program, CSFP, helps to fill in the \nnutrition gaps in participants' diets by providing nutritious items \nthat they might not otherwise be able to afford. I worked closely with \nmembers of the Senate Agriculture Committee to ensure that more seniors \nwill be eligible to participate in this important program by changing \nthe eligibility guidelines from 130 percent to 185 percent to reflect \nthe poverty guidelines of all other Federal nutrition programs. Once \nthe five new states that have applied to participate in CSFP receive \nfunding, then all States can apply to go up to 185 percent Federal \npoverty level, FPL, if they so choose. In addition, the preference \nrequirement for women, infants and children in the application process \nwas eliminated, allowing senior citizens equal access to the program.\n  The Emergency Food Assistance Program, TEFAP, is another vital \nprogram in our Nation's fight against hunger. With food banks across \nthe country experiencing critical food shortages and an increasing \nnumber of Americans in need of emergency food assistance, the increase \nin funding from $140 million to $250 million is especially crucial.\n  We must do all that we can to ensure our children grow up healthy, \nregardless of their family's income and I believe that expanding the \nFresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, FFVP, in all 50 States works toward \nthat goal. Since 2004, students on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in \nSouth Dakota have received fresh fruits and vegetables through the FFVP \npilot program. I am pleased that these students and others across the \nnation will now have regular access to fresh fruits and vegetables.\n  I was disappointed to see that the elimination of reduced price, ERP, \ncategory was not included in the nutrition title of the Farm Bill. The \nPresident's budget decisions have forced the Senate majority leadership \nto concentrate nutrition funding on existing programs, leaving little \nor no funding for new initiatives, such as eliminating the reduced \nprice category from the school lunch program.\n  This farm bill also strengthens the Food Distribution Program on \nIndian Reservations, FDPIR, program by ensuring that tribes will be \nable to obtain traditional foods, such as bison, in their food \npackages. I have long fought for more traditional food options for our \ntribes and I am pleased that Chairman Harkin included my request in the \nchairman's mark.\n  This farm bill is a strong proposal for South Dakota, for the Great \nPlains region and for the American agricultural community. While \nreauthorization is a critically important prong of our farm bill \npolicy, our Federal farm programs are only as strong as the dollars put \nbehind them. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and \nmore specifically, the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, \nI am well positioned to fight for South Dakota priorities and to \ndeliver promised farm bill programs into our rural communities. The \ndollars I work to obtain in this bill are vitally important, for \nexample, to continuing agriculture research within my home State and at \nSouth Dakota State University, my home State's land grant university. \nAs we work our way through the budgetary constraints with which \nCongress is faced, I will continue to promote our nation's farming and \nranching agenda.\n  Mr. President, farmers and ranchers have been anxiously awaiting a \nnew farm bill so they can make important management decisions in this \ncoming year, and I am hopeful that the Senate and House can meet \nquickly in this next congressional session to iron out the differences \nbetween the two measures.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, food safety is very much on the minds of \nmany Americans today, and the reason is as obvious as the newspaper \nheadlines in recent months.\n  From the Washington Post on November 29th: ``Bad Pet Food May Have \nKilled Nearly 350.''\n  From the October 31 New York Times: ``Chinese Chemicals Flow \nUnchecked to Market.''\n  From The Associated Press on September 27: ``Hamburgers may be \ntainted with E. Coli.''\n  Suddenly, there is a danger that E. coli is present in many typical \nfoods. An E. coli outbreak in spinach last summer killed 3 people and \nsickened more than 200 others. In recent months, E. coli has lead to \nthe recall of over 20 million pounds of ground meat. We have also had \nsalmonella in peanut butter and snack food and botulism in a chili \nproduct. Even unlabeled allergens can routinely lead to the recall of \nfood. These examples, and the sharp decline of consumer confidence in \nfood\n\n[[Page S15627]]\n\nsafety, make clear that Congress must act quickly to deal with the \nproblem.\n  The FDA Science Board issued an alarming report last month, \nconcluding that the ``FDA does not have the capacity to ensure the \nsafety of food for the nation.''\n  In his years in both the House and now the Senate, Senator Durbin has \nbeen a leader in efforts to improve food safety--from his Safe Food Act \nto the Human and Pet Food Safety Act. He offered a food safety \namendment on the FDA bill last May that we accepted 94 to 0, and it was \nincluded in the final bill approved by Congress and signed by the \nPresident in September. I commend his working with us to produce an \namendment to the farm bill to address the issue now with the new \nurgency it requires.\n  Because of the work of Senator Durbin, the farm bill includes a \ncommission to investigate food safety and make recommendations to the \nPresident and Congress, including specific legislative proposals and \nbudget estimates. The amendment we have offered builds on the work of \nthe commission. It requires the President to submit a legislative \nproposal in response to the commission's recommendations, with Congress \nfollowing up with appropriate action. It also includes a sense-of-the-\nSenate provision that the Congress must approve more resources for food \nsafety, must work for a comprehensive response on the issue, and that \nthe Federal Government must work cooperatively with foreign governments \nto improve the safety of imported food.\n  I agree with Senator Durbin that we need make more effective progress \non food safety. Both the European Union and Japan have stronger food \nsafety programs than we do. Most significantly, they have much stronger \nprograms on imported food, combining inspections in the country of \norigin and the testing of imported foods. We should be able to do at \nleast as well.\n  Federal food safety agencies need power to identify food safety \nproblems more quickly and respond more effectively, especially to \nprevent outbreaks in food. Every aspect of the food industry must have \nan effective plan in place to prevent hazards in the food it grows, \nprepares, or markets.\n  A hearing in the HELP Committee earlier this month began this \nprocess. I am committed to achieving a comprehensive response to food \nsafety, and I look forward to working with Senator Enzi, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Harkin, and my other colleagues on the committee to \ndevelop that proposal early in the new year. Our amendment to the farm \nbill will require the President to follow up in 2009 or early 2010 with \na further legislative proposal if additional efforts are needed to \nimprove the safety of our food supply.\n  Every day, parents across the Nation prepare breakfast, lunch, and \ndinner for their children. They expect these meals to nourish their \nchildren, not sicken them. Action by Congress is essential to avoid the \nrisk that a fruit served for breakfast is contaminated with salmonella \nor that the meat or cheese added to a lunch sandwich is contaminated \nwith listeria or that fish served for dinner contains antibiotic \nresidues or that the lettuce and other fresh produce in a salad is \ncontaminated with E. coli.\n  We all must act together, and I am grateful to Senator Durbin and the \nmanagers of the farm bill, Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss, for \nworking with us to make this amendment possible.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, for his hard work to improve his food safety \namendment No. 3539, which was accepted earlier this week. I had \nconcerns with this amendment as introduced because I think we should \nfocus on real solutions, not just abandon our current processes. I \nappreciate my colleague's willingness to listen to my concerns and \nthose of Senator Kennedy and work to address them. In this time of \npartisan bickering, I am gratified to see that cooperation is indeed \npossible.\n  Our food safety system is the best in the world. We have an \nincredible variety of foods available to us, at relatively low prices, \nand with a generally excellent track record for safety. But things \naren't perfect, and I think we have plenty of work to do to make things \neven better. The HELP Committee, which has jurisdiction over the FDA, \nheld a very informative hearing on food safety 1 week ago. We got some \ngreat recommendations from stakeholders during that hearing, and we \nplan to use those recommendations and the recent reports from HHS and \nFDA to develop bipartisan legislation.\n  Going back a little further, during floor debate on the FDA bill in \nMay, Senator Durbin and I, along with Senator Kennedy, worked on a food \nsafety amendment that was accepted 94 to 0. At that time, I pledged to \nwork with my colleagues on a comprehensive response to food safety. I \nstand by that commitment.\n  I know that our staffs have met on food safety and work well \ntogether. It is important that we get this right and that we get it \ndone. We can make real progress on real legislation to reform the food \nsafety system.\n  Let's keep working together. We can have real reform on this and on \nother important issues such as health care. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve victory for \nthe American people on these important topics.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, per rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate, I certify that I proposed an amendment to H.R. 2419, the \nfarm bill, that addresses income averaging for amounts received in \nconnection with the Exxon Valdez litigation. This amendment is a \nlimited tax benefit.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to give my reasons for \nsupporting the Senate passage of H.R. 2419, The Farm, Nutrition, and \nBioenergy Act of 2007, also known as the 2007 farm bill. I am voting \nfor it notwithstanding the subsidies that have grown since the \nAgricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, and I believe moving toward a free \nmarket for agriculture is highly desirable.\n  Many constituents in my home State of Pennsylvania have contacted me \nto express support for final passage of the 5-year 2007 farm bill as \nsoon as possible. Agriculture is Pennsylvania's No. 1 industry, \ncontributing about $45 billion to the economy through production, food \nprocessing, marketing, transportation and manufacturing. Since taking \noffice in 1981, I have fought hard for agriculture and nutrition \nprograms.\n  The many provisions in the bill that are beneficial to Pennsylvania \ninclude the Milk Income Loss Contract program for our dairy producers, \nincreased funding for specialty crops, increased funding for nutrition \nprograms, and increased funding for conservation programs. While other \nregions have received more money in previous farm bills through subsidy \nprograms for cotton, rice, wheat, soybean, and corn, this farm bill \ndirects more money to agriculture products in Pennsylvania than \nprevious farm bills.\n  The MILC program provides countercyclical payments to our dairy \nproducers when the price of milk falls below a set trigger price. Since \nits inception in the 2002 farm bill, it has provided more than $220 \nmillion to our Pennsylvania dairy farmers. Although I worked hard to \nensure that any dairy provisions addressed costs of production, there \nwas resistance from Senators from other regions in the United States. \nThe bill also requires mandatory price reporting of sales transactions \nof dairy commodities and calls for a study of collapsing the dairy \nclass system and a study of advance pricing. These provisions will help \ncreate an open, transparent dairy market benefiting dairy farmers and \nconsumers.\n  Pennsylvania's specialty crop producers that include mushrooms, \napples, freestone peaches, and grapes will get the assistance they need \nto market their products. The bill provides about $2.2 billion in \nresearch and marketing programs funding. This is the most ever set \naside in a farm bill to assist these farmers who are left out of \ntraditional Federal farm programs.\n  The bill includes about $197.5 billion for nutrition programs, as \ncompared to about $178.158 billion in the previous 2002 farm bill. The \nbill also includes $1 billion to expand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable \nProgram, FFVP, nationwide over 5 years to reach nearly 4.5 million low-\nincome children. FFVP allows schools to offer and promote free fresh \nfruits and vegetables during the day.\n  Finally, the bill includes increased money for conservation programs \nto help farmers use environmentally friendly farming practices. There \nis\n\n[[Page S15628]]\n\nabout $22 billion for conservation programs, which is about $5 billion \nmore than the 2002 farm bill. More specifically, the bill has $165 \nmillion for conservation programs in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, \nwhich includes large sections of Pennsylvania.\n  Taken together, these important programs benefit Pennsylvania. \nTherefore, I support this farm bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about \nagricultural inspection at the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I believe there is a serious problem with agriculture inspections at \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  The causes are many. The stakes are high. The impact is potentially \ndevastating.\n  Here are the facts--documented in a 2006 GAO report, a 2007 \nCongressional Research Service memorandum, and a 2007 report prepared \nfor the House Committee on Agriculture.\n  Agriculture inspection at several key American points of entry has \nsignificantly decreased. Inspections decreased in Miami by 12.7 \npercent, in Boston by 17.9 percent, and San Francisco by 21.4 percent; \nthe number of quarantine significant pest interceptions has declined by \n31 percent since its high of nearly 74,000 in 2002; 22 percent of \nagricultural specialists' time is spent on duties other than \nagriculture inspection; and agriculture inspection at DHS is \nsubordinate to the Department's other priorities for drug and weapons \nenforcement.\n  As the senior Senator from California, the largest agriculture State \nin the Nation--a $32 billion industry--I cannot stand by while three \ninfestations of Medfly have occurred in my State just this year.\n  And other States have similar problems. Florida has seen a 29-percent \nincrease in pest outbreaks over the last 4 years.\n  It was my intention to offer an amendment to move the agriculture \ninspection function back to the USDA--and I want to thank my lead \ncosponsors on this amendment, Senator Martinez and Senator Casey.\n  However, I recognize there is strong objection to considering my \namendment in the Senate.\n  I have had multiple discussions with Secretary Chertoff on this \nissue, and he has agreed to take action to improve agriculture \ninspection.\n  Specifically, he has agreed to create a new Deputy Executive Director \nfor Agriculture Operational Oversight that is responsible for: managing \nthe joint Customs and Border Protection and USDA Agriculture Quality \nAssurance program; monitoring agricultural inspection performance for \nrisk and efficiency; securing appropriate staffing and budget \nallocation for agriculture inspection; ensuring that all directives and \npolicies specific to the agricultural programs are executed in \ncompliance with the agriculture mission; and ensuring there is open \ndialogue with State and Federal counterparts to assure agricultural \ninspection activities are being properly handled at ports of entry.\n  Additionally, he has assured me that the agriculture inspectors' time \nwill no longer be used for anything other than agriculture inspection.\n  So in light of those commitments, I have agreed to defer the \namendment.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nDecember 13 letter from Secretary Chertoff, and the accompanying two \ndocuments, which are copies of the two memoranda from the U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection, establishing the actions to which we have \nagreed.\n  But I will watch carefully to see that what the Secretary has agreed \nto is implemented in the Department.\n  I want to thank the California Farm Bureau, the American Farm Bureau, \nthe State Departments of Agriculture and their association, the \nSpecialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance, and the many farm organizations that \nsupported this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the documents \nto which I have referred and the list of these organizations that wrote \nin support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13. 2007.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I appreciate the discussions we \n     have had over the last few weeks concerning the agricultural \n     mission within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). I \n     want to inform you of two actions the Department of Homeland \n     Security is taking to address the concerns you have raised.\n       First, at my direction, the Assistant Commissioner of Field \n     Operations at CBP has sent a memo to all field offices \n     (attached) reaffirming that the Agriculture Specialists are \n     to be specifically assigned to agricultural inspection \n     activities and will be dedicated to the mission of protecting \n     the Nation's food supply and agricultural industry from \n     pests, diseases. and related bio-threats, absent exigent \n     operational circumstances. To promote consistent \n     implementation of this policy, the memo also outlines \n     measures that CBP is taking to ensure that the activities of \n     Agriculture Specialists are accurately recorded in CBP's \n     Overtime and Scheduling System.\n       Second, as of January 2, 2008, a new position will he \n     established within CBP to improve oversight of the \n     agricultural mission across all CBP field offices. Named the \n     Deputy Executive Director, Agriculture Operational Oversight, \n     the new position will report to the Executive Director for \n     Agriculture Programs and Trade liaison at CBP headquarters. \n     The Deputy Executive Director will be charged with ensuring a \n     more consistent application of agriculture inspection policy \n     across all ports. The position will also serve as a primary \n     point of contact for Joint Agency Task Force coordination \n     issues for the Department, the Animal and Plant Health \n     Inspection Service (APHIS) within the Department of \n     Agriculture and stakeholders, and it will be responsible for \n     outreach to Federal and State officials on border inspection \n     issues. The Deputy Executive Director will oversee the Joint \n     CBP/APHIS Agriculture Quality Assurance program and monitor \n     agricultural performance measures for risk and efficiency. \n     This office will also ensure compliance with all directives \n     and policies specific to the agricultural programs, to \n     include conducting field audits and reviews of Agriculture \n     Specialist activities, and correcting deficiencies. In \n     addition, the Deputy Executive Director will work to ensure \n     that Agriculture Specialists have the equipment and resources \n     needed to perform the agricultural inspection function. (A \n     memo to field offices describing the new position in more \n     detail is attached.)\n       I greatly appreciate your engagement on these critical \n     issues, and I look forward to continuing our discussions with \n     respect to your questions on agricultural referrals to \n     secondary inspection. The measures we are undertaking are a \n     direct result of our constructive dialogue, your dedication \n     to the agricultural community, the essential work done by CBP \n     Agriculture Specialists, and the desire to protect American \n     agriculture from harmful pests and diseases.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Chertoff,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and \n           Border Protection,\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2007.\n     Memorandum for: Directors, Field Operations; Director, \n         PreClearance.\n     From: Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations.\n     Subject: Utilization of Agriculture Specialists and Related \n         Time and Attendance Information (TC-FY-08-0222).\n       The purpose of this memorandum is two-fold, first, to \n     ensure that Agriculture Specialists (CBPAS) are performing \n     inspectional activities directly related to the protection of \n     American agriculture; and second to provide clear guidance on \n     the utilization of Cost Management Information System (CMIS) \n     codes housed within COSS that are specifically designed for \n     use by CBPAS.\n       Directors, Field Operations must ensure that CBPAS are \n     assigned to agricultural inspectional activities at the \n     individual ports of entry. It is imperative that assignments \n     for these employees are dedicated to the mission of \n     protecting the Nation's food supply and agricultural industry \n     from pests and diseases absent exigent operational \n     circumstances.\n       Clear guidance on the use of CMIS codes are housed in the \n     Customs and Border Protection Overtime and Scheduling System \n     (COSS) and are structured to reflect the range of operational \n     functions combined within CBP. CMIS codes are focused on \n     Customs, Immigration- and Agriculture-related functionality \n     to reflect and define the totality of services offered by \n     CBP. CMIS aids the Agency in aligning the personnel labor \n     information in COSS to CBP financial reporting requirements. \n     Further, CMIS enhances the Agency's ability to track User \n     Fee-related activity costs, provide more accurate cost \n     information to external parties (i.e. Congress), and help to \n     establish baseline cost information necessary for developing \n     and monitoring annual budgets.\n       CBPAS perform the mission of protecting American \n     agriculture from harmful pests and diseases. Further, this \n     work must be accurately recorded in COSS using the \n     appropriate CMIS codes. To accomplish this, Directors of \n     Field Operations (DFOs) shall ensure that CBPAS are assigned \n     and utilized in alignment with that mission.\n\n[[Page S15629]]\n\n       As part of the continuing Unified COSS Location Rotation \n     Process (UCLRP) (TC-06-1630), Directors, Field Operations \n     (DFO) are responsible for monitoring and overseeing this \n     process to ensure agriculture-related work activities are \n     accurately recorded. For your convenience, the UCLRP tasking \n     and CMIS codes are posted to the CBPnet under the OFO tab. As \n     part of the UCLRP, DFOs must continue to complete the \n     quarterly analysis and submit findings to Headquarters for \n     analysis.\n       For clarification, CMIS codes beginning with the letter \n     ``Q'' should be utilized to capture agriculture-related \n     activities. The role of the CBPAS is to interpret and enforce \n     agricultural regulatory requirements through agricultural \n     inspections of travelers and cargo. Appropriate activities \n     are listed in the CBPAS position description and in Appendix \n     2 and 3 of the DHS--USDA Memorandum of Agreement of 2003 \n     (attached).\n       I am directing all DFOs to ensure that CBPAS are assigned \n     to agricultural inspectional activities at the individual \n     ports of entry. Assignments for these employees must be \n     dedicated to the mission of protecting the Nation's food \n     supply and agriculture industry from pests and diseases, \n     absent exigent operational circumstances.\n       If you have any questions regarding this matter, please \n     have a member of your staff contact Ava Fleming.\n     Thomas S. Winkowski.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations.\n     Subject: Establishment of Deputy Executive Director, \n         Agriculture Operational Oversight, Agriculture Programs & \n         Trade Liaison (APTL).\n       This memorandum addresses the establishment of a Deputy \n     Executive Director position in the Agriculture Operational \n     Oversight position within the Agriculture Programs & Trade \n     Liaison (APTL) division within Customs and Border protection \n     (CBP) Office of Field Operations (OFO).\n       In order to address the concerns of agricultural \n     stakeholders and to provide better operational oversight for \n     the Agricultural Mission within CBP, I am creating a new \n     Deputy Executive Director, Agriculture Operational Oversight \n     position in APTL. The Deputy Executive Director will report \n     to the Executive Director for APTL.\n\n\n                   BENEFITS OF CREATING NEW POSITION\n\n       CBP is creating a new position and office in OFO \n     Headquarters that will be charged with further coordinating \n     agricultural activities. Establishing this position will \n     result in more consistent application of agriculture \n     inspection policy across all ports. It will also provide a \n     primary point of contact for Joint Agency Task Force (JATF) \n     coordination issues for APHIS, USDA, UHS, and agriculture \n     industry stakeholders.\n       Program improvements that will be realized are coordination \n     and implementation of the JATF Action Plans, Agriculture \n     Partnership Council and stakeholder outreach. This position \n     will oversee the Joint CBP/APHIS Agriculture Quality \n     Assurance program and monitor agricultural performance \n     measures for risk and efficiency. It will allow CBP to \n     utilize trend analysis and redirect targeting and resources \n     to areas of highest risk. The office will also ensure that \n     all directives and policies specific to the agricultural \n     programs are executed and in compliance with CBP agriculture \n     mission.\n       To enhance operational oversight this office will ensure \n     resources are available for agriculture programs in the \n     field. This specific responsibility will ensure that all \n     Agricultural Specialists will have all the equipment and \n     other resources needed to facilitate and improve the \n     agricultural inspection function. Additionally, this Deputy \n     Executive Director will ensure appropriate staffing levels \n     and budget allocation for agricultural programs as well as \n     initiate and monitor special agricultural operations. The \n     Deputy Executive Director will meet regularly with state and \n     federal counterparts to maximize efficiencies. Emphasis will \n     be placed on ensuring that CBPAS are specifically assigned to \n     agricultural inspectional activities at the individual ports \n     of entry.\n       The new office will issue memoranda, musters, and conduct \n     conference calls, to clarify the expected activities, duties, \n     functions, roles and responsibilities of the Agricultural \n     Specialist (AS) in conducting CBP's mission. This individual \n     will ensure that AS accurately record agriculture inspection \n     activities in the CBP Overtime and Scheduling System (COSS). \n     This will better align the personnel labor information in \n     COSS to CBP financial reporting requirements. Furthermore, \n     the Deputy Executive Director will enhance the Agency's \n     ability to track User Fee-related activity costs and help \n     establish baseline cost information necessary for developing \n     and monitoring annual budgets. He will visit and conduct \n     field audits and reviews of the AS activities and compliance \n     with the CBP Agricultural commitment.\n\n\n                            CHAIN OF COMMAND\n\n       The new Deputy Executive Director will work through the \n     current chain of command in the field and is not in the \n     supervisory chain for field Agriculture Specialists.\n\n\n                 TIMEFRAME FOR CREATION OF NEW POSITION\n\n       The new Deputy Executive Director will be in place and the \n     office will be operational no later than January 2, 2008.\n                                  ____\n\n       American Beekeeping Federation.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Feed Industry Association.\n       American Mushroom Institute.\n       American Nursery and Landscape Association.\n       American Sheep Industry Association.\n       American Society for Horticultural Science.\n       Association of Floriculture Professionals.\n       Cherry Marketing Institute.\n       National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Chicken Council.\n       National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Milk Producers Federation.\n       National Pork Producers Council.\n       National Potato Council.\n       National Watermelon Association.\n       Nectarine Administrative Committee.\n       Peach Commodity Committee.\n       Produce Marketing Association.\n       Society of American Florists.\n       United Egg Producers.\n       United Fresh Produce Association.\n       U.S. Apple Association.\n       Winegrape Growers of America.\n       Blue Diamond Growers.\n       CalCot Ltd.\n       California Association of Nurseries and Garden Centers.\n       California Association of Wheat Growers.\n       California Association of Winegrape Growers.\n       California Avocado Commission.\n       California Citrus Mutual.\n       California Fresh Fig Growers Association.\n       California Grape and Tree Fruit League.\n       California Plum Marketing Board.\n       California Strawberry Commission.\n       California Table Grape Commission.\n       California Tree Fruit Agreements.\n       California Tree Fruit Marketing Board.\n       Empire State Potato Growers, Inc.\n       Florida Citrus Mutual.\n       Florida Citrus Packers Association.\n       Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\n       Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association.\n       Florida Strawberry Growers Association.\n       Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association.\n       Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation.\n       Holly Tree Farm.\n       Idaho Grower-Shipper Association.\n       Idaho Potato Commission.\n       Indian River Citrus League.\n       Maine Potato Board.\n       Miami-Dade County.\n       Michigan Apple Committee.\n       Michigan Agri-Business Association.\n       Michigan Bean Shippers Association.\n       Michigan Corn Growers Association.\n       Muddy Lake Cattle Company.\n       New York Wine & Grape Foundation.\n       New Mexico Department of Agriculture.\n       North Carolina Wine & Grape Council.\n       Northern Plains Potato Growers Association.\n       Northwest Horticultural Council.\n       Ohio Apple Growers.\n       Ohio Wine Producers Association.\n       Oregon Potato Commission.\n       Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Farmers Organization.\n       Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.\n       Pennsylvania Farm Bureau.\n       Pennsylvania Farmers Union.\n       Pennsylvania Landscape and Nursery Association.\n       Pennsylvania Pork Producers.\n       Pennsylvania Vegetable Growers Association.\n       Peace River Valley Citrus Growers Association.\n       Potato Growers of Idaho.\n       South East Dairy Farmers Association.\n       Sunkist Growers.\n       Sun-Maid Growers of California.\n       Texas Citrus Mutual.\n       Texas Produce Association.\n       Texas Wine and Grape Growers Association.\n       Virginia Apple Growers Association.\n       Washington Apple Commission.\n       Washington State Potato Commission.\n       Western Growers Association.\n       Western United Dairymen.\n       WineAmerica.\n       Wine Association of Georgia.\n       Winegrowers Association of Georgia.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased that Chairman Harkin has \nincluded a proposal of mine in his amendment. Under my proposal, \neligible elementary and secondary schools can offer grain products to \nstudents.\n  Grains are a critical part of a healthy diet. They are an excellent \nsource of fiber. The 2005 dietary guidelines for Americans recommend \nthat Americans consume three or more (2-ounce) ounce-equivalents of \nwhole grain products per day. A diet that includes higher levels of \nfiber-containing grain products provides many health benefits, such as \nreducing the risk of coronary heart disease. This proposal helps \nimprove the diet and health of our children.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I would like to take a few minutes \nto speak about a piece of legislation essential to Washington State and \nits agricultural community--the 2007 farm bill. This bill is the result \nof an incredible amount of hard work by many different people. In \nparticular, I\n\n[[Page S15630]]\n\nwould like to extend my gratitude to the Senate Agriculture Committee \nchair, Tom Harkin, and ranking member Saxby Chambliss and their staff \nfor the strong, bipartisan bill passed out of committee and to Senator \nDebbie Stabenow and her staff for their tireless work on behalf of this \nNation's fruit and vegetable growers. These individuals, along with \nmany others, have created a carefully crafted compromise, resulting in \nthe best farm bill in Washington State history.\n  Washington is blessed with a wide and diverse agricultural economy. \nWe lead the Nation in the production of 14 agricultural crops, \nincluding red raspberries, apples, hops, sweet cherries, pears, and \nconcord grapes. We rank second nationwide in the production of \nasparagus, third in the production of dry peas and lentils, and fourth \nin the production of wheat and barley. Washington's dairy industry \nmakes up over 14 percent of our agricultural economy, and we are second \nnationwide in the export of fruits and vegetables. Washington's \nagricultural products are pivotal to the Nation and the agriculture \nindustry is pivotal to Washington. From provisions dealing with \nspecialty crops to dairy to commodities and pulse crops, all of this \nfarm bill has a direct impact on my State and the many hard-working \nfarmers and producers living in it.\n  I was very pleased to work with Senator Baucus and others on the \nFinance Committee to authorize the agriculture disaster relief trust \nfund. The trust fund is a historic attempt to deal with agricultural \ndisasters in a logical and deliberate manner before they happen, as \nopposed to cobbling together ad hoc relief after disaster strikes. I am \nparticularly pleased with the focus on pest and disease management for \nour specialty crop growers. The fund also includes mandatory funding \nfor the Tree Assistance Program--a program that helps growers replace \nthe trees upon which their crop is grown after disaster strikes. I am \npleased that my amendment that will help in the implementation of this \nprogram and ensure that growers have access to the funds that have been \nprovided for them was accepted during floor consideration. I am \nconfident that it will be a significant improvement for growers in \nWashington and across the country.\n  This bill also includes a critical program for Washington asparagus \ngrowers--the Asparagus Market Loss Program. While the Andean Trade \nPreferences Act and Peru Trade Promotion Agreement are likely to have a \nsignificant positive effect on many different agricultural products, \nthey have led to devastation in the asparagus industry. Since the \npassage of the Andean Trade Preferences Act, Washington has lost 21,000 \nof its 30,000 acres dedicated to asparagus, and all three of \nWashington's asparagus canning facilities have now moved to Peru. In \nthe past 17 years, the $200 million Washington asparagus industry has \nbeen reduced to a $75 million industry. This is the reason that I \nworked so hard with Senators Stabenow and Murray to include the $15 \nmillion market loss program dedicated to asparagus growers in the farm \nbill. This program will support domestic asparagus producers, helping \nthem plant and harvest more efficiently and remain competitive in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  It is also important to remember that a farm bill is about more than \nfarms. It is also about addressing the Nation's nutrition needs and \nfinding ways to best conserve our land. As one of the pilot States for \nthe Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, Washington can attest to the \npositive impact created by this innovative program. Not only does this \nprogram provide fresh and nutritious food for our schoolchildren, but \nin doing so, it creates a domestic market for our fruit and vegetable \ngrowers. Well-nourished children are given a greater opportunity to \nsucceed in school, and children who are provided fresh fruit and \nvegetables as opposed to chips, cookies, and other junk foods, have a \nhead start in fighting the epidemic of childhood obesity. The $1.1 \nbillion provided for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program in this bill \nwill extend this program to 100 schools in each State so that children \nacross the country can benefit from the nutritious snacks provided by \nAmerica's farmers. This program is a key piece of the overall nutrition \nfocus in this bill. From children's advocates to the religious \ncommunity to college students and health organizations, I have heard \nfrom a wide variety of constituents on the importance of nutrition \nprograms, and I am pleased this bill prioritizes our country's \nnutrition needs.\n  In addition to agriculture and nutrition, the farm bill's \nconservation title is a high priority for Washington and \nWashingtonians. From the shimmering Puget Sound and the majestic \nCascade Mountains, to the breathtaking Columbia River Gorge and amber \nfields of our southeast counties, my State of Washington prides itself \non its diverse and iconic natural beauty. Protecting that natural \nbeauty is a top priority for me and is why I am pleased at this bill's \nfunding for popular conservation programs such as the Conservation \nReserve Program and measures to make popular programs like the \nConservation Security Program more accessible and easier to use for our \nwheat farmers, specialty crop growers, and other producers. \nAdditionally, this bill provides for biomass and bioenergy research \nprograms and focuses in part on cellulosic feedstock, which is key for \nWashington's farmers. These research programs are not only critical to \nthe creation of new, clean energy sources and reducing our dependence \non foreign oil, they provide another valuable domestic market for our \nfarmers. By focusing our efforts on expanding the involvement of our \nfarmers in creating clean renewable energy, we are helping our farmers, \nhelping our environment, and being good stewards of the taxpayer \ndollar. I commend the Agriculture Committee on a strong conservation \ntitle. I will look to find ways in which it can be strengthened even \nfurther and will vote against any attempt to weaken it.\n  From a historic investment in specialty crop programs to the \nsignificantly improved nutrition title and the strong conservation \ntitle, the committee bill before us today is the best bill for \nWashington in memory. Once again, thank you to Senators Harkin and \nChambliss for their work on this strong, bipartisan bill. I strongly \nurge all Senators to vote in favor of final passage.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the 2007 farm \nbill. I want to thank Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss for \nputting together a bill that starts us down the road toward Federal \npolicies that support small family farms, policies that protect our \nenvironment, and policies that provide adequate nourishment for our \nmost needy families.\n  It is, however, unfortunate that every serious effort on the floor to \nmove this bill further down the road of reform was defeated. The FRESH \nAct, Dorgan-Grassley, Senator Brown's crop insurance reforms, and \nSenator Klobuchar's amendment all would have moved us away from \noutdated costly farm programs toward more funds for conservation, \nnutrition, and help for small farms. Then, after these defeats, the \nlast reform amendment proposed by Senator Feingold and myself was \ndenied floor time after we had been promised a slot.\n  Yesterday was certainly a sad day in the Senate. First Big Oil \nstopped the Senate from taking oil subsidies to pay for renewable \nenergy, and then Big Agriculture successfully blocked all efforts to \nmake a more balanced and fair farm bill that helps small farmers \ninstead of mega factory farms.\n  In order for the Nation's farming economy to thrive, we need look no \nfurther than the successes of New Jersey. My home State has sensibly \npromoted healthy foods, local foods, environmentally friendly farming \npractices, and small family farms. As it turns out, these four things \ncould not fit together more perfectly.\n  The problem for small farmers is how to compete with the giant \nfactory farms for food processing or grocery store contracts. \nTragically, the answer is that far too often they cannot compete, and \nthey are forced to sell the family farm. Over the last 5 years, the \nnumber of small farms has decreased nationwide by over 80,000. Over \n80,000 families had to sell their land to factory farms or to \ndevelopers and choose a different line of work. The decline of the \nsmall farm means depressed rural economies, more suburban sprawl, and a \nloss of a way of life.\n  But in my home State of New Jersey the number of small farms has \nactually\n\n[[Page S15631]]\n\nrisen by 400 farms. So how is it that New Jersey has been able to \nincrease the number of small farms while the rest of the country has \nseen such a steep decline? There are two answers.\n  The first is that the State has a robust program to preserve \nfarmland. With help from the Farmland Protection Program, the State \npurchases the right to develop a farmer's land, so farmers get the \nadded income they need to keep the family farm and resist the \ntemptation of developers or large factory farmers. Farmers want to stay \nfarmers, and farming communities want to remain farming communities. \nSmart conservation programs allow this to happen and can help preserve \na way of life. To date, New Jersey has preserved more than 1,500 \nfarms covering approximately 157,000 acres. Unfortunately, this bill \ndoes not add any new money for this essential farmland protection \nprogram, and efforts to do so on the floor were thwarted.\n\n  The second reason small family farms are flourishing in New Jersey is \nthe expansion of farmers' markets. We have nearly 100 farm markets in \nmy home State, and we add about five or six more every year. These \nmarkets give our farmers access directly to the consumers. This keeps \nmore money in farmers' pockets by eliminating the need to do business \nthrough food distributors.\n  And farm markets do not just benefit farmers, but they also greatly \nbenefit urban communities that have limited access to healthy foods. \nFarm markets allow our city dwellers to enjoy the freshest blueberries, \npeppers, cranberries, and peaches straight from the field.\n  So in this way New Jersey has created a system whereby small farmers \nflourish, open spaces are preserved, and citizens get better access to \nhealthy foods. It is a win-win-win situation that must be continued and \nencouraged in New Jersey and across the Nation.\n  That is why I regret we could not have done more in this bill but am \npleased to see some small reforms that will help lead the country in \nthis direction. I specifically want to applaud the Agriculture \nCommittee for adopting a few policies that were in my Healthy Farms, \nFoods and Fuels Act of 2007.\n  First, the farm bill of 2007 expands the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable \nProgram to every State in the country and targets benefits to low-\nincome children. During a long school day, children often need a snack \nto keep them nourished and keep their minds focused on their \nschoolwork. Instead of filling up with candy or sodas, this innovative \nprogram provides children fresh fruits and vegetables. It is a \nhealthier option that will lead to healthier habits in school and at \nhome.\n  Another program expanded in my bill and here in the 2007 farm bill is \nthe Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program. After all, it is not just \nchildren who often lack access to healthy foods. The Senior Farmers' \nMarket Nutrition Program awards grants to State governments to provide \nlow-income seniors with coupons that can be exchanged for healthy foods \nat farm markets, roadside stands, and community-supported agriculture \nprograms.\n  One last point of agreement between my Healthy Farms bill and the \n2007 farm bill that I want to point out is the restoration of the \nauthority of schools to buy local foods in the School Lunch Program. By \npreferentially buying local foods, communities can support their local \nfarms while giving their children fresher and more nutritious food \noptions.\n  These three programs are great starting points for the Nation to \nemulate the great successes I have seen in New Jersey. These \nreforms will lead to a healthier, more profitable, and greener American \nfarm economy.\n\n  Another thing I want to applaud the Agriculture Committee for is what \nthey have done for specialty crop farmers. For the first time, \nspecialty crops were given their own title in the bill. Specialty crops \nare the fruits, vegetables, and other crops that keep America healthy \nand constitute half of the Nation's agricultural cash receipts but have \nreceived little recognition in previous farm bills. This farm bill is \ndifferent, with over $3 billion to fund specialty crops provisions. New \nJersey is a national leader in growing specialty crops such as \nblueberries, cranberries, peppers, peaches, and spinach, and these \nprovisions will be a huge help to farmers in my home State.\n  While the bill that left committee was a great step in the right \ndirection, there were several areas that needed improving.\n  One was the definition of the term ``rural area.'' The original text \nchanged the definition of ``rural area'' in a way that would have \nunfairly excluded many communities from rural development programs. But \nby working with my staff and the staffs of several of my colleagues in \nthe Northeast, I think we have come to an agreement with Chairman \nHarkin that is much more equitable.\n  A second issue Chairman Harkin was kind enough to work with us on, \nwas to include a study that will advance our understanding of the \nbenefits of local food production. This comprehensive study will \nchronicle the impact of localized food production on our environment, \nour economy, and nutrition. In addition, the study will document the \nbarriers for small farmers to participate in a local food economy and \nsuggest ways to overcome these barriers. I hope this study can provide \na roadmap for our country to follow in the next farm bill.\n  But I am sorry to say that it looks as if bold reform will have to \nwait until the next farm bill. The amendments that would have reformed \nthe direct payment system and used those savings for national \npriorities on nutrition and conservation all failed to pass the Senate.\n  Our country is ready to transition toward farm policies that \nconcentrate on small farmers, on healthy specialty crops, and on \nconservation. I am hopeful that one day soon, small, sustainable farms \nwill be the rule, rather than the exception.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like the record to reflect \nthat I would have voted for the Senate farm bill today.\n  The bill produced by Senator Harkin's Agriculture Committee takes \nmany positive steps to level the playing field in American agriculture \nby recognizing the importance of specialty crops to the Nation's \neconomy.\n  California is the Nation's largest agricultural State, with more than \n350 different crops worth $32 billion per year. Yet our State has been \nlargely overlooked when it comes to the billions in Federal support for \nagriculture.\n  The Senate bill provides important funding for programs that will \nbenefit California's growers, ranchers, consumers, and families.\n  I first would like to thank Chairman Harkin for including a number of \nprovisions I authored into the farm bill.\n  The bill includes a version of the Pollinator Protection Act and \nprovides $100 million over 5 years for high-priority research dedicated \nto maintaining and protecting our honey bee and native pollinator \npopulations. There has been a loss of about 25 percent of the Nation's \nhoney bee population, and it is estimated that crops that depend on a \nhealthy bee population are valued near $18 billion, and these funds \nwill help give scientists the resources they need to determine the \ncauses of colony collapse disorder and to work on protecting bee \nhealth.\n  The bill also includes my Early Pest Detection and Surveillance Act, \nand authorizes $200 million over 5 years to give USDA the authority to \nenter into cooperative funding agreements with States to enhance their \npest detection and surveillance programs, increase inspections at \ndomestic points of entry, and create pest eradication and prevention \nprograms.\n  With the assistance of consumer groups and labor unions, I was able \nto negotiate a compromise that prevented a rollback of 40-year-old meat \ninspection laws. The House version of the farm bill included dangerous \nlanguage that would have threatened the safety of meat and poultry, but \nworking with Senator Harkin, we were able to reach a compromise that \nprotects the integrity of the federal meat inspection process.\n  I also worked with Chairman Harkin to include an avocado marketing \norder agreement, a $2 million authorization for a National study on \nbiofuels infrastructure, language prioritizing edible schoolyards \nprograms in schools under the Community Foods Program, and a\n\n[[Page S15632]]\n\n$15 million asparagus market loss program.\n  The Senate also accepted two important amendments that I offered to \nthe bill during floor consideration.\n  The first amendment provides USDA with a framework under the existing \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, to allocate funds \ntoward air quality mitigation efforts in agricultural communities with \npoor air quality. In rural areas around the country, smog and soot are \nthreatening public health, fouling communities, and reducing crop \nproductivity from pollution generated on farms. This amendment will \nprovide farmers in high-priority agricultural areas with the tools to \nadopt new practices that reduce air pollution on farms.\n  The Klamath River Basin and the Sacramento/San Joaquin watershed have \nbeen identified by conservation groups as being watersheds most in need \nof watershed assistance programs. The Senate accepted an amendment that \nrecognizes these areas in California, as well as a number of other \nregional watersheds throughout the country, and prioritizes funding for \nthese watersheds under the Regional Watershed Enhancement Program.\n  This farm bill provides a significant amount of new funding for \nprograms important to the specialty crops industry. Specialty crops now \naccount for nearly 50 percent of the Nation's farm gate, and this bill \nrecognizes the industry's importance.\n  Included in the Senate bill is mandatory funding for specialty crops \nblock grants, organic farmers, farmers market programs, trade \nassistance and foreign market access programs, the community foods \nprogram, and important specialty crops and organics research.\n  The bill also provides $1.1 billion in funding for the Fresh Fruit \nand Vegetable Snack Program, expanding participation in the program to \nall 50 States. This program provides a critically important strategy in \nthe fight to prevent and reduce childhood obesity by providing 4.5 \nmillion low-income elementary schoolchildren in 5,000 schools \nnationwide the ability to receive a fresh fruit or vegetable snack \nevery day at school.\n  Numerous studies have indicated that eating fruits and vegetables can \nprevent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension, in \naddition to obesity. Yet less than one out of every six children eats \nthe USDA recommended amount of fresh fruit, and only one out of five \nchildren eats the recommended amount of vegetables. The funding \nincluded in the farm bill will ensure that schools in California and in \nevery State in the Nation can implement this important child nutrition \nprogram.\n  Also included in the nutrition title are provisions that update and \nmodernize the food stamp assistance program. Updates to food stamp \nassistance, like ending benefit erosion, increasing minimum benefit \namounts, and simplifying income reporting for seniors and the disabled, \nare long overdue and will help provide more assistance to disadvantaged \nfamilies.\n  The Emergency Food Assistance Program also receives an important \nfunding increase to $250 million per year, which will allow the \nNation's food banks to have more of an impact on those in need.\n  The farm bill also provides an important opportunity to protect the \nNation's natural resources and its open space. Farmers can enroll in a \nnumber of conservation programs that allow them to provide habitat \nprotection for native species, protect wetlands and grasslands, and \nundertake initiatives to make their farms more environmentally \nfriendly.\n  But the last farm bill has not done enough to provide farmers with \nthe resources they need to fully participate in conservation \nactivities.\n  In 2004, California had a $143 million backlog in payments and \nenrollments in conservation programs due to lack of funding and acreage \ncaps. An average of 4,000 farmers and landowners in California are \nrejected each year when they apply to USDA conservation programs. \nSixty-eight percent of California's farmers seeking EQIP funding turned \naway.\n  Nationwide, $18 billion worth of conservation applications have gone \nunfunded during the life of the 2002 farm bill.\n  As a result of not enough funding for conservation programs, \nCalifornia is rapidly losing thousands of acres of farmland and open \nspace. Ninety-five percent of the wetlands in the Central Valley have \nbeen lost, and 171,000 acres of farmland were lost in California from \n2002 to 2004.\n  The Senate bill takes important steps to provide farmers with more \naccess to conservation programs, but I was disappointed that during \nconsideration of the bill on the Senate floor, amendments to provide \nmore funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the \nGrasslands Reserve Program did not pass.\n  The farm bill also authorizes a number of programs that will benefit \nCalifornia's rural communities, such as low-interest loans to rural \nelectric cooperatives for renewable energy production and grants and \nloan guarantees to develop broadband access in rural areas.\n  Lastly, I am pleased that the bill contains over $1 billion in \ninvestments for farm-based energy, including the development of \ncellulosic ethanol. While corn ethanol has proven to be a useful \nalternative fuel, I worry about its impact on corn prices related to \nthe livestock industry, especially in light of the fact that \nalternative fuels can be created by a number of other agricultural \nsources, many of which are produced in California. The farm bill takes \nsteps to provide incentives for the development of cellulosic ethanol.\n  This farm bill is important for California's farmers, families, and \nfor the State's economy, and I am pleased to be supporting it.\n\n\n                            TAX CREDIT BONDS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the managers' amendment to the farm bill \ncontains a deal that raises my eyebrows. The proposal creates a half \nbillion dollars in strippable, tradable, ``forestry tax-credit bonds'' \nthat can be issued by a State or tax-exempt entity. Property must be \napproved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as subject to a ``native \nfish habitat conservation plan.'' So far, we can only find one plan \nthat qualifies for this proposal. The proposal also completely unwinds \nthe arbitrage rules that were placed on these tax-credit bonds last \nyear to prevent abuses.\n  Most Americans do not know what tax-credit bonds are or even that \nthey exist. Essentially, these are bonds in which the federal \ngovernment pays ``interest'' in the form of credits against Federal \nincome tax liability. Issuers borrow at a zero percent interest rate. \nThe Federal tax subsidy provided to the holder of a tax credit bond is \neven greater than the benefit derived from tax-exempt municipal bonds. \nThat is because a tax credit can be used to offset, on a dollar-for-\ndollar basis, a holder's current year tax liability. With tax credit \nbonds, the Federal Government bears virtually all of the cost of \nborrowing--in the form of forgone revenue--even if the bonds are issued \nby a non-Federal entity such as a State or local government. So, in \nshort, this is a rich deal.\n  When the tax credit bond program was initiated, the arbitrage rules \ndid not apply. However, we became aware of arbitrage abuses in 2006. In \nresponse, Congress enacted arbitrage restrictions for these bonds. They \nare the same restrictions that already apply to tax-exempt municipal \nbonds. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 enacted the first rules relating to \narbitrage. Congress was concerned that permitting interest exemption \nfor arbitrage bonds represented a waste of the Federal subsidy.\n  One of the concerns Congress addressed was the use of sinking funds \nto exploit the difference between tax-exempt and taxable rates. The \nbest way to understand these rules is to use an example. Let's assume \nCity X needs to borrow $10,000 to finance a project. City X could issue \nbonds that pay no principal or interest until year 10 and fund its year \n10 liability by depositing amounts into a special fund--a ``sinking \nfund''--that will build up over time and be used to pay off the \ninterest and principal in the 10th year.\n  In the absence of arbitrage restrictions, City X can invest amounts \nin the sinking fund over the term of the bonds at a higher yield than \nthe yield on the bonds--remember that tax-exempt bonds accrue interest \nat zero percent. This would allow City X to earn more than is needed to \npay both the principal and interest on the bonds at maturity. This is a \nsubsidy funded by the\n\n[[Page S15633]]\n\nFederal government and paid for by tax increases on Americans.\n  The tax credit bond program already provides a richer subsidy than \nthe long standing tax exempt bond program. This proposal further \nenriches this program, at the expense of taxpayers, and opens the door \nfor future abuse. This provision may set a dangerous precedent and \nunwind all of the good work that was done to ensure that arbitrage \nabuses of tax credit bonds were curtailed.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I wish to speak in favor of the farm \nbill, which looks close to a vote. Many of my colleagues have already \nexpressed how important this legislation is to our country and rural \ncommunities. I could not agree more with their statements and was \npleased to see the Senate finally begin legislating by considering \namendments. I would also like to thank again Chairman Harkin, Ranking \nMember Chambliss, and the members of the Agriculture Committee for \ntheir hard work on this bill.\n  Wyoming's agricultural community has always provided me with great \nadvice on how to approach our Nation's farm policy. Consistently, I \nhear that livestock producers and growers want to move in a direction \nthat provides greater access to competitive markets and limits \nGovernment barriers to conducting business. You see, the producers I \nhave spoken with believe their checks should come from an auctioneer or \nbuyer, not the Government. This is certainly a challenging goal \nrecognizing the competing global pressures on our Nation's farmers and \nranchers. However, I can say that the Senate has been able to inject \nsome commonsense reforms in this bill.\n  The livestock title is a great example of how you can go a long way \non a small budget. Reforms include a ban on packer ownership, improved \nlanguage on mandatory price reporting, better enforcement mechanisms \nfor the Packers and Stockyards Act, and efforts to improve how \nantitrust claims are arbitrated. Language in this title will implement \ncountry-of-origin labeling by September 30, 2008, something I have been \nworking on with my colleagues since I came to the Senate in 1997. Also, \nthe livestock title contains a ban on packer ownership and creates a \nspecial counsel in USDA for coordinating investigations of \nanticompetitive behaviors, two measures that will significantly improve \nthe enforcement of the 1921 Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  Although I am pleased to see that this farm bill contains a livestock \ntitle, I will say I am disappointed that the Senate wasn't able to \ninclude a number of additional measures that would have promoted \ncompetition in the livestock market. Earlier this week, we considered \nthe business justification amendment that would have leveled the \nplaying field for producers seeking recourse from anticompetitive \nmarketing practices. This amendment failed to reach the threshold for \npassage, but I expect to continue working with my colleagues to adopt \nthis measure in the future.\n  I did not have the opportunity to offer my amendment on captive \nsupply reform, but I look forward to continuing my work on this \nproposal. Senate Agriculture Committee hearings and numerous reports \nhave continued to indicate there is a need to improve the enforcement \nof the Packers and Stockyards Act. The livestock industry has changed \nsignificantly since the early days of the 20th century. The Senate \ncannot fail to overlook these changes and how they adversely affect our \nNation's independent livestock producers.\n  As a former small business owner, I appreciate another measure in \nthis bill that promotes the ability for independent livestock producers \nto market their products beyond the borders of their respective States. \nThe ban on State-inspected meat is a major barrier to small ranchers \nseeking to promote their products, most of which are valued-added and \npremium products, to buyers in neighboring States. State meat-packing \nfacilities have inspection regimes just as stringent as federally \nsupervised plants, and in the case of Wyoming better standards than \nthose at the Federal level. The United States already allows meat \nproducts into our country from other nations to move freely across \nState lines on the promise that their products comply with our Federal \nstandards. Why not allow meat products guaranteed to Federal \nspecifications to also cross State lines? I trust that as the \nlegislation advances I will be able to work with my colleagues to keep \nthis provision in the bill.\n  One provision in this bill that has gotten the attention of many \nrural landowners is a fix to an attack on farmers and ranchers. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security recently promulgated rules that \nclassify propane as a ``chemical of interest'' and would require \nindividuals to register certain amounts of the liquefied gas at a great \ncost to the rural landowner. I appreciate the efforts of the Department \nto protect our Nation from security threats, but these rules come at \nthe expense of ranchers and farmers who store large amounts of propane \nfor their operations. I am pleased to see language in this bill that \nexempts rural land owners from this rule while also serving the \ninterests of our national security.\n  Wyoming's vast open spaces benefit greatly from the working lands \nprograms in this legislation. Producers in Wyoming continually seek \nbetter tools that allow them to improve the productivity of their \noperation while ensuring that future generations can enjoy the \nlandscape we enjoy today. Although I would have preferred to see more \nenrollable acres and funding for programs such as EQIP and the \nGrassland Reserve Program, I am confident that the package before the \nSenate will continue the success of these popular programs.\n  Recognizing these improvements, I can say that I hoped to have \nadditional reforms included that would allow our farmers and ranchers \nto transition from existing farm support programs. The Grassley-Dorgan \namendment would have made significant advances in ensuring that crop \nassistance goes to the family farms most in need of support. \nAdditionally, the Senate had the opportunity to save money in this farm \nbill through the substitute amendment to the commodity title offered by \nmy colleague, Senator Lugar. I ask that my colleagues consider reducing \nthe spending levels of this bill as the farm bill advances to \nconference.\n  Mr. President, Wyoming's independent ranchers and farmers work hard \nto produce agricultural products for our country, and they deserve a \nfarm bill that promotes competitive markets and seeks to reform farm \nsupport programs. The Senate has been able to put together a reasonable \nfarm bill with realistic improvements in both of these areas. Saying \nthat, I encourage my colleagues to vote for the farm bill and continue \nthinking about the future of agriculture and our rural communities.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the 2007 U.S. farm \nbill, a tremendously important piece of legislation that will set the \ncourse of our Nation's agricultural policy for the next 5 years. My \ncolleagues and their staffs have spent months preparing it, hammering \nout its details, and weighing its implications for America's farmers. \nIt is an immense piece of legislation; and obviously, in any bill of \nthis size, any Senator will find provisions with which he or she will \ndisagree. I am no different. Certainly there are pieces I would like to \nsee crafted differently. But on the whole, I think it is a strong bill \nand a good compromise between countless different interests, and I am \ndeeply grateful to my many colleagues who have worked so hard on it. I \nam pleased that it has gained such strong bipartisan approval because I \nbelieve it successfully meets the needs both of our farmers and of our \ncountry as a whole.\n  First, it maintains a strong safety net for all American farmers. \nWith the safety net extended through the 2012 crop-year, and target \nprices and insurance rates adjusted accordingly, this farm bill \nprotects struggling farmers whose livelihoods can be threatened by \nabrupt shifts in the agricultural market. These farmers provide, in \nmany ways, the backbone of our economy; and this bill gives them the \nsecurity they deserve. This legislation also encourages those farmers \nby expanding programs that will help get them off\n\n[[Page S15634]]\n\nthe ground; and it opens up opportunity with aid to historically \ndisadvantaged farmers. The bill provides a strengthened safety net for \ndairy farmers, and for the first time ever, specialty crop producers \nare included within its protections.\n  While I applaud my colleagues, Senators Lugar and Lautenberg, for \ntheir efforts to reform title I and boost funding for critically \nimportant nutrition and conservation programs, I do not believe that \neliminating all direct payments is the best way to advance this goal. \nThis would represent a drastic turn away from decades of farm policy \nthat has given our Nation an abundant and stable domestic food supply. \nWith so many of our Nation's farmers operating on razor-thin margins, I \nworry that eliminating direct payments could seriously undermine the \nfarm safety net. I do, however, fully support the amendment offered \nyesterday by Senators Dorgan and Grassley to place a cap on subsidy \npayments. This would have helped to ensure that payments are targeted \nat those farmers who truly need them, and I am disappointed that the \namendment failed to gain the 60 votes required for its adoption.\n  I am, however, very pleased that this bill provides more than $1 \nbillion in new money for important conservation programs that help \nfarmers act as responsible stewards of the land they work. It enrolls \nmillions of new acres in the Conservation Stewardship Program; supports \nprograms that protect wildlife, game, and wetlands; and creates \nincentives for farmers to preserve their soil and conserve their water. \nProvisions like these reflect a growing awareness of the vital \nimportance of environmental stewardship and give farmers the resources \nto live out this laudable mission.\n  Lastly, the bill supports consumers along with producers, especially \nthose American families struggling on the verge of hunger or food \ninsecurity. When all is said and done, this bill will direct nearly $5 \nbillion in new money to nutrition programs such as food stamps. Mr. \nPresident, half of America's food stamp recipients are children--and I \nam gratified that the Senate has done a good deal to provide for them \nin this legislation by increasing both eligibility and benefits. \nFinally, the bill allocates $1 billion to extend to all 50 States a \nprogram that provides fresh fruits and vegetables to underprivileged \nschools. I have seen the success of the Fresh Fruits and Vegetables \nProgram firsthand, in its Connecticut pilot test. I know how vital \nfresh produce is to the health of all Americans; in the case of \nunderprivileged schoolchildren, those who need it the most have often \ngotten it the least--and I am glad this bill goes a long way toward \ncorrecting that disparity.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I am satisfied that the farm bill embodies a \ngreat deal of social responsibility. It takes steps to protect our \nstruggling farmers, our threatened environment, and our undernourished \nfamilies and children. With those worthy goals in mind, I am deeply \ngratified the Senate has passed this important bill.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, by passing the farm bill today, the \nSenate took an important step towards renewing our Nation's commitment \nto helping our farming communities and strengthening Rural America's \ninvolvement in our Nation's energy future.\n  This legislation provides robust new funding for conservation, \nnutrition, specialty crops, and rural development. It authorizes \nhundreds of millions of dollars in renewable energy initiatives to be \nundertaken by family farmers working to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. It maintains a strong safety net for those farmers for the \nnext 5 years. It creates a new permanent disaster assistance program so \nthat farmers need not rely on the unpredictability of Congress to \napprove emergency funding. And it includes important provisions to \nincrease market transparency for livestock producers in the meat \nprocessing industry.\n  I am especially proud that this legislation contains my proposal to \nensure that thousands of African-American farmers will have an \nopportunity to have their discrimination claims reviewed under the \nPigford settlement. For far too long, this country's hardworking black \nfarmers were discriminated against by our own Government, and this \nlegislation offers a chance for us to continue righting those wrongs.\n  There is a time to debate, and a time to act, and the timely \ncompletion of this farm bill is necessary so that farmers have the \ncertainty they need to begin their preparations for the new crop year. \nAlthough the farm bill has many provisions to laud, I am disappointed \nin the failure of the Senate to enact stronger payment caps to ensure \nthat assistance is better targeted to family farmers who need the help \nand away from big agribusinesses that often use these payments as a \nsuperfluous source of revenues. I am disappointed that interests in the \ncrop insurance industry were successful in weakening an optional \nrevenue insurance program authored by my distinguished colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, a forward-thinking and innovative pilot \nprogram designed to test a new kind of safety net mechanism for \nfarmers.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for his leadership on this issue, and will \ncontinue to work with him to stand up for America's family \nfarmers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the passage of the 2007 farm \nbill, which includes many important programs that benefit Michigan and \nthe Nation as a whole. Agriculture is Michigan's second largest \nindustry, and few States have such a diversity of agricultural crops. \nAs leading producers of traditional crops, such as corn, wheat and \nsoybeans, as well as specialty crops, such as apples, asparagus, beans, \nblueberries and cherries, Michigan's farmers have a wide variety of \nneeds, and I am pleased that this farm bill contains a range of \nmeasures that will benefit farmers throughout the State.\n  For too long, the farm bill has not included proper support for the \nspecialty crops that are such a vital part of Michigan's agricultural \neconomy. I am pleased that this bill will provide significantly more \nassistance to specialty crop growers than we have seen in the past, \nwhile protecting both specialty crop growers and traditional farmers by \nproviding disaster assistance and revenue protections in the event of \ncatastrophic crop losses. With measures such as specialty crop block \ngrants, increased incentives for organic farming, funding for specialty \ncrops research initiatives, and technical assistance programs, the farm \nbill will provide much needed support for the specialty crop community \nthroughout Michigan.\n  I was pleased that the Senate supported the inclusion in this bill of \nfunding for the Asparagus Market Loss Program. This program will \nprovide transitional assistance to asparagus farmers that suffered \nsubstantial market losses due to the Andean Trade Preferences Act, \nATPA. In addition, this bill includes funding for the Market Access \nProgram, which will help domestic farmers export their goods to foreign \nmarkets, thus helping to alleviate our international trade deficit.\n  The farm bill includes strong measures to improve conservation \nefforts on American farms. These programs, which are aimed at both \nworking lands and lands taken out of production, help protect and \nimprove soil quality, prevent erosion, benefit water quality, and \npreserve and restore habitats. This legislation will expand the amount \nof land that will benefit from conservation assistance by increasing \nthe Comprehensive Stewardship Program by millions of acres, and \nreauthorizing the Conservation Reserve Program and Wetlands Reserve \nProgram to protect environmentally sensitive lands.\n  This bill will strengthen nutrition programs by providing additional \nfunding to our Nation's critical food programs over the next 5 years. \nNutrition programs, such as the Food Stamp Program, provide assistance \nto children, low-income working families, seniors, and persons with \ndisabilities. It is of vital importance that we continue these food \nbenefits for our Nation's least fortunate and most vulnerable.\n  I am pleased that this bill also includes tax incentives that will \nencourage continued development of biofuels and provisions to spur the \nincreased production of renewable fuels. Cellulosic ethanol, in \nparticular, offers great potential for reducing oil consumption and \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the collective effect of the \nprovisions in the farm bill, and the\n\n[[Page S15635]]\n\nrecently passed Energy bill will provide an additional and necessary \nboost to production of these fuels.\n  This bill passed by the Senate today includes modest reforms to our \ncurrent producer protection programs. It eliminates some loopholes that \nhave allowed producers to circumvent existing payment limits and lowers \nthe adjusted gross income, AGI, limit for commodity programs from the \ncurrent level of $2.5 million to $1 million in 2009 and $750,000 for \n2010 and beyond. However, these reforms do not go far enough. During \ndebate on the farm bill, I supported a number of amendments that would \nhave provided additional reforms to our agricultural subsidy programs \nand would have redirected this funding to vital nutrition and \nconservation programs. Unfortunately, none of these reforms were \nadopted. I am hopeful that we can work to enact these reforms when the \nSenate next considers farm legislation.\n  This farm bill is a strong, bipartisan piece of legislation which \nincludes many programs that are beneficial to Michigan's communities. \nWhile this bill is not perfect, I believe the combination of additional \nassistance for specialty crops, enhanced conservation spending, and the \nincreased nutrition funding included in this bill warrants support. I \nam pleased the Senate was able to work in a bipartisan manner to pass a \nstrong farm bill to benefit our Nation's farmers and rural communities.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about an \namendment on illegal logging that I sponsored. This amendment is based \non S. 1930, the Combat Illegal Logging Act of 2007, which I introduced \nalong with Senator Alexander and 23 bipartisan colleagues. First, \nhowever, I want to thank Senator Harkin, Senator Chambliss, and their \nstaffs for working with me and my staff, to include this amendment in \nthe farm bill. I am very pleased that this amendment has been included \nin the Senate farm bill and I look forward to working with the House to \nmake this important legislation law.\n  This legislation would strike a critical blow to illegal logging by \nextending the enforcement capacity of the Lacey Act to include \nillegally harvested timber. Illegal logging destroys ecosystems, harms \noften poor and rural communities, forces American businesses and \nworkers to compete against unfairly low-cost forest products made from \nillegally sourced fiber, and contributes to carbon emissions.\n  The Combat Illegal Logging Act changes the incentives that drive \ntrade in illegal timber. This legislation will raise the risks for \nillegal trade without harming legal trade and will be an important step \ntoward leveling a playing field currently stacked against the U.S. \nforest products industry and importers and retailers committed to \ntrading in legal wood products. Furthermore, it will also bring the \npower of the U.S. market to bear on fighting the illegal logging \nproblem and will reinforce work being done with U.S. tax dollars to \nimprove governance in forest-rich developing countries.\n  My amendment enjoys the support of a very broad coalition that \nincludes members of the U.S. forest products industry, conservation \ncommunity and organized labor, and has already received bipartisan \nsupport from many of our colleagues and I am very pleased that it was \nincluded in the farm bill with wide support. S. 1930 has 23 bipartisan \ncosponsors, many of which joined me in sponsoring this bill as an \namendment to the farm bill. These include Senators Alexander, Bingaman, \nKerry, Snowe, Feingold, Sununu, Baucus, Dodd, Stabenow, Biden, Murray, \nCantwell, Salazar, and Gregg.\n  This bill is the culmination of hundreds of hours of work by \nstakeholders that might not naturally be seen as allies. The principal \nnegotiators of the compromise--the American Forest & Paper Association, \nthe Hardwood Federation, and the Environmental Investigation Agency--\ndeserve a tremendous amount of credit for sticking with this and \nfinding a solution that everyone could support. And as the bill has \nevolved we have picked up more and more supporters.\n  Organizations endorsing this bill include: American Forest & Paper \nAssociation, American Home Furnishings Alliance, Center for \nInternational Environmental Law, Conservation International, Defenders \nof Wildlife, Dogwood Alliance, Environmental Investigation Agency, \nForestEthics, Friends of the Earth, Global Witness, Greenpeace, \nHardwood Federation, International Association of Machinists and \nAerospace Workers, International Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners \nof America, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, International Wood \nProducts Association, Lowe's Home Improvement, National Association of \nHome Builders, National Lumber and Building Material Dealers \nAssociation, National Marine Manufacturers Association, National \nWildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Rainforest \nAction Network, Rainforest Alliance, Sierra Club, Society of American \nForesters, Sustainable Furniture Council, The Nature Conservancy, \nTropical Forest Trust, United Steelworkers, Wildlife Conservation \nSociety, and the World Wildlife Fund.\n  I again want to thank Senator Harkin, Senator Chambliss and their \nstaffs for working with me and my staff to include my amendment in this \nfarm bill. This will be a huge victory in the fight against illegal \nlogging.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the passage of the \nFarm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007, which also included an \namendment that added the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan \nImprovements Act. This vital amendment will equip the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, with the ability to provide a more comprehensive \nand aggressive response for future disasters. I especially thank \nSenator Kerry, chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, and Senators Vitter and Landrieu for their steadfast \nefforts in championing this disaster legislation and ensuring its \nsuccess. I would be remiss to not also mention, and thank, Senators \nHarkin and Chambliss for their tremendous leadership on the farm bill.\n  As we learned all too well in the aftermath of the devastating 2005 \ngulf coast hurricanes, it is imperative that government programs on the \nfrontlines are fully prepared when called upon to aid disaster victims. \nThe SBA's Disaster Loan program faced significant challenges in the \nwake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Unfortunately, the agency made \nnumerous well-documented mistakes and abdicated its responsibilities, \nleaving many disaster victims waiting months for loans to be processed \nor money to be disbursed.\n  Disaster legislation passed today will help ensure that the SBA \ncontinues to assist the country's small business community with the \nsame dedication to excellence found in the entrepreneurs it serves. I \nam hopeful that with the passage of this legislation, the Agency will \nbe better prepared, and not repeat the errors of its past.\n  In my former capacity as chair and now as ranking member of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, reforming and \nimproving the SBA's Disaster Loan program has been one of my top \npriorities. I have personally visited the gulf region, chaired multiple \nhearings, and repeatedly sent staff to the affected areas to oversee \nthe SBA's disaster response. In addition, the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship unanimously passed disaster legislation \nin each of the last two Congresses.\n  This disaster provision was a product of consensus and compromise. \nOver the last 2 years, the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship has worked hand-in-glove to craft bipartisan disaster \nlegislation that will help the SBA respond effectively and swiftly to \nfuture disasters.\n  Specifically the legislation: establishes a private disaster loan \nprogram to be used in the aftermath of catastrophic disasters, allowing \nbanks to make loans directly to victims with an 85-percent government \nguarantee; creates a new expedited disaster assistance business loan \nprogram to provide short-term relief to businesses damaged or destroyed \nin catastrophic disasters while they await other Federal assistance or \ninsurance payments; creates a new presidential declaration of \n``Catastrophic National Disaster,'' which will allow the SBA to issue \nnationwide economic injury disaster loans to small businesses affected \nby a large-scale disaster; provides key tools for processing disaster \nloan applications more quickly, such as working with qualified private \ncontractors to\n\n[[Page S15636]]\n\nprocess the loans and requiring the SBA to report to Congress on how \nthe application process can be improved; and increases the maximum size \nof a disaster loan from $1.5 million to $2 million and allows nonprofit \ngroups to be eligible for disaster loans.\n  I commend my fellow Senators for passing the farm bill, which \nincluded this crucial disaster loan provision. The President should \nquickly sign this legislation into law so our country will be better \nprepared to respond to potential disasters.\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, we have put a couple of good days \ntogether now.\n  Yesterday was a good step forward with the Energy bill. Now we are \nabout to achieve something else.\n  It is no mystery why: When the majority decided to work with us on \nEnergy, we achieved a consensus. And when they decided to work with us \non the farm bill, same thing.\n  This bill contains some very good things. And for that we all owe a \nlot to Senator Chambliss. And I want to thank him for his outstanding \nwork on this bill and for his patience. This one required a lot of it.\n  And I also want to thank the majority leader and Chairman Harkin for \nseeing this legislation through.\n  I am proud to represent one of the Nation's most important \nagricultural States and so many family farms, which enrich and sustain \nnot only Kentucky but the entire Nation.\n  Kentucky farmers are the best in the country. And the families who \nrun them and the rest of the people of the Commonwealth will all \nbenefit from this bill's new investment in nutrition, renewable energy, \nand rural development programs, as well as additional incentives for \nconservation of natural resources.\n  We have had some real accomplishments this week--some genuine results \nachieved through cooperation.\n  And at the risk of repeating myself, I think there is a lesson here. \nUnless we find a commonsense, bipartisan path forward on legislation, \nwe all end up empty handed.\n  But today, we will not have done that. And that, I think, is a very \ngood thing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I support the 2007 farm bill. I would like \nto begin by thanking the chairman, Tom Harkin, for his hard work and \ndetermination on this bill. I also would like to thank Senator Saxby \nChambliss for his efforts on this bill. Lastly, I would like to \nrecognize Senators Baucus and Grassley for putting together a tax \npackage to provide funding for agricultural disasters and other \nfunctions in the bill.\n  Farm bills are not easy to move through the legislative process. A \ngood farm bill must balance a host of competing funding priorities and \nthe policies and priorities of shifting alliances of regional \ninterests. This farm bill was further complicated by a shrinking \nbaseline due to projected increases in commodity prices and the pay-go \nrules put into place at the beginning of the 110th Congress. The \nchairman had a smaller pool of dollars for this bill compared to the \n2002 farm bill.\n  Through many hours of hard work, traveling the country, holding \nhearings, and writing the bill, a solid compromise package emerged. \nThis is by and large a good bill, but it could be better.\n  I am sure the chairman wishes he could have done more on \nconservation, energy, nutrition, and reform than was possible given the \nfunding constraints and the priorities of the committee. However, \nChairman Harkin and the members of the Senate Agriculture Committee \nshould be proud of what is in this package.\n  A couple of notable achievements were made. First and foremost, I \nthank Chairman Harkin and the members of the committee for including an \noptional Average Crop Revenue Program in the bill. The ACR is a State-\nlevel revenue countercyclical program that provides income support when \nfarmer revenue dips below expected revenue.\n  This is a market-oriented reform that targets taxpayer support to \nproducers in need. Rather than being based on target prices alone like \nthe current programs, this program protects producers against both \nyield and price declines, which combine to form a more accurate picture \nof a producer's viability. It is a better safety net for farmers. \nBecause it is based on market prices rather than politically determined \ntarget prices, and is targeted to those who suffer losses, it is more \ndefensible to taxpayers.\n  The program has broad bipartisan support. The administration supports \na revenue countercyclical program and Senators Chambliss, Conrad, \nThune, and others spoke in favor of the concept in the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. The program also generates significant savings \nthat Chairman Harkin was able to use to improve commodity programs and \nprovide resources to conservation, nutrition, and energy programs.\n  This is a proposal that closely resembles a bill Senator Brown and I \noffered this summer. Senators Brown and Harkin were leaders in \ndeveloping this model and moving it through the committee process.\n  Part of the ACR savings are used for improving our nutrition \nprograms. The farm bill's nutrition programs are critical for helping \nalleviate hunger. In 2005, 35 million people lived in food-insecure \nhouseholds, including 12.4 million children. Of these individuals, 7.6 \nmillion adults and 3.2 million children lived in households with very \nlow food security.\n  I thank the chairman for making some changes to the Food Stamp \nProgram and other nutrition programs that will allow more Americans to \nparticipate in these programs. For example, the bill modifies \neligibility criteria and allocations for nutrition that have not been \nupdated in 30 years. For example, under current law food stamp \nbeneficiaries can own no more than $2,000, a number that has gone \nunchanged since 1977. It is a disincentive for people to save and \nunnecessarily makes many who should participate ineligible. This bill \nraises the asset level to $3,500, allowing 23,000 newly eligible \nindividuals to participate in the Food Stamp Program by 2012 and \n115,000 by 2017.\n  In addition, the bill increases the minimum food stamp benefit from \n$10 per month to $18 per month by 2012. Like the asset test, the \nminimum benefit has not kept pace with inflation. It has not been \nadjusted for inflation in almost 30 years, meaning that households that \nreceive it can purchase only about one-third as much food as they could \nhave in 1979.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, approximately 615,000 \nhouseholds, or 738,000 people, will receive higher benefits under this \nprovision, nearly most of them seniors or people with disabilities.\n  Lastly, the bill provides $250 million per year for the Emergency \nFood Assistance Program, TEFAP, the program used by 25 million people \neach year to avoid going hungry. This funding will allow food pantries \nand soup kitchens to provide food to individuals who don't qualify for \nfood stamps or can't stretch their benefits to avoid going to bed \nhungry.\n  The most dynamic part of agriculture is the development of a robust \nbiofuels market and the expansion of renewable forms of energy. Our \nfarms and small towns have the potential to help free America from our \ndependence on imported oil. This bill builds on that trend and makes \nimportant investments in technologies that will strengthen our ability \nto produce renewable energy. Overall, the bill invests $1.3 billion \nover the baseline, which is a step forward but short of the $2.4 \nbillion invested by the House.\n  It moves us toward producing fuels from cellulosic biomass by \ninvesting in programs to help farmers transition to biomass crop \nproduction, harvesting, and storage. It also provides $300 million in \ngrants and loan guarantees for the development of biorefineries and \nbiomass conversion facilities.\n  The energy title contains $245 million for feedstock costs for \ncellulosic ethanol and biodiesel and adds $230 million for section 9006 \ngrants and loan guarantees for solar, wind, and methane digesters. \nLastly, the bill commissions a study on ethanol pipelines and adds $25 \nmillion for E-85 infrastructure.\n  The bill makes major investments in conservation. The bill provides \nabout $4 billion over baseline for important conservation programs that \nprotect wildlife and water quality and prevent soil erosion. Included \nin this funding is $1.2 billion for the Conservation Security Program \nand the reauthorization of the Wetlands Reserve Program. The\n\n[[Page S15637]]\n\nbill also extends the Grasslands Reserve Program and reauthorizes the \nimportant conservation and wildlife programs.\n  In other titles, I was glad to see the bill make modest gains in \ntrade promotion. The bill also increases the authorization for the \nMcGovern-Dole program, although it does not provide mandatory funding \nfor the program.\n  On food safety, the bill contains a Food Safety Commission that I \nhelped author with Chairman Harkin and Senator Chambliss.\n  The bill also contains a rural broadband mapping and access bill \nbased on the success of Connect Kentucky. It would expand this type of \nprogram to other States.\n  This bill could be better in a number of different areas. It provides \nabout $1 billion less in energy funding than the House bill. I think \nthat could be improved given the importance of this area.\n  It also does not go far enough in terms of targeting payments and \nincome support to producers in need of assistance. The investigative \nreports of the past several years have shown us that millionaires, \ndeceased landowners, and others who shouldn't qualify for Government \nsupport receive payments year in and year out.\n  Because of rules governing loan deficiency payments, producers can \nevade payment limits. Two-thirds of payments go to about 10 percent of \nproducers. Taxpayers provide $5.2 billion in the form of direct \npayments to farmers every year regardless of whether a producer has a \ngood year or a bad year.\n  Not only is this indefensible in a time of budget deficits and high \ncommodity prices, it makes our commodity support programs less \nsustainable for producers that really require some assistance. Now, the \ncompromise worked out by Senators Lincoln, Conrad, and Chambliss does \nsome good things--it eliminates the three-entity rule and anonymous \ncertificates, which are both very real improvements in the program. \nUnfortunately, this bill does not go far enough.\n  While it does lower the means test for eligibility for payments from \nthe current level of $2.5 million to $750,000, many very wealthy \nproducers will be able to circumvent this soft cap. I am disappointed \nthat amendments offered by my colleagues, Senators Dorgan, Brown, and \nKlobuchar, that would have tightened payment eligibility failed to pass \non the floor. I also would have hoped we could have improved the ACR \nProgram to provide producers with an even better option, and hope my \ncolleagues will work to improve it in conference.\n  Overall, though, this is a very good bill. I again thank the chairman \nand ranking member for their hard work.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3855\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the managers' package of amendments is at \nthe desk. Under the previous order, I ask that it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the managers' \npackage is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Reserving the right to object, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, under the cloture rules, I had an \namendment for which now it looks like there is the opportunity to have \na point of order raised against it, so I am not going to even call up \nthe amendment. I will spend a few minutes talking about it. I know \neverybody wants to get out of town. I will spend some time talking \nabout it, and I will take as short an amount of time as possible.\n  It was an amendment to eliminate things that are already being done \nin this country through the Agriculture Department. For example, \nspecialty cheeses, they have grown by 15 to 20 percent per year. We \nhave 16 different marketing agencies the Government, in one way or \nanother, is already funding.\n  We spend $2.5 million a year in Wisconsin already through the Ag \nDepartment. We are going to spend $1.6 million with the Vermont cheese \nmarketing program for artesian cheeses. Yet in this bill we are \nauthorizing another program. This amendment was designed to take that \nout.\n  Also, this amendment deals with areas in terms of USDA loans for golf \ncourses, for resorts, for entertainment complexes, to businesses that \nhave nothing to do with agriculture, to businesses that have assets in \nexcess of $60 billion apiece.\n  So the idea of the amendment was to, first of all, refine where we \nare loaning the taxpayers' money to businesses and, also, to look at \nthe $1.6 billion the USDA has lost on $15 billion in the last 5 years \non loan foreclosures to these types of areas and to redirect this into \nan area where we are getting better value for the taxpayers' money.\n  I am concerned we actually drafted this amendment, as the committee \nhad asked us to do it, and now we find a point of order will be raised \nagainst it following the committee's recommendations.\n  So I appreciate the good work of Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss \non this bill and the way they have worked with us. My hope is we can \nget a final farm bill through conference and take care of the needs of \nthis country.\n  I am somewhat depressed in the fact that there is a lot of wasteful \nspending we have put into this bill and we are not going to have an \nopportunity to amend that.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  Is it appropriate for me to make some comments on the underlying bill \nwhile we are awaiting the next action?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be appropriate.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today, the Senate provides certainty to \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers, conservationists, school lunch program \nbeneficiaries, environmentalists, and rural communities all across this \ngreat land. Today, the Senate sets aside partisanship in favor of \nassisting those in need. Today, we honor our commitment to the American \nagriculture sector with the passage of the Food and Energy Security Act \nof 2007.\n  The bipartisan bill before us today is the culmination of years of \nhard work on the part of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the \nmillions of constituents we work so hard to represent with dignity and \npurpose. As in any great endeavor, this accomplishment is the fruit of \nthe labor of so many.\n  As we approach final passage of the Food and Energy Security Act of \n2007, I would like to take a moment to express my thanks and \nappreciation to everyone who has made this historic day possible.\n  First, let me extend my appreciation to the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Tom Harkin.\n  Tom, you have truly been a leader throughout this process. You have \ndemonstrated a bipartisan work ethic that is essential to this body's \nwork. You have been a true friend and have been extremely cooperative \nwith me. I appreciate that.\n  Furthermore, each and every member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee has played a critical role in crafting this bill and \nformulating the fiscally responsible policy contained in this farm \nbill.\n  Every Senator, regardless of party affiliation or the region of the \ncountry they are fortunate to represent, came together to produce a \nfarm bill that will carry our agriculture sector into the next 5 years \nof prosperity. I would be remiss if I did not extend my praise to two \nother members of the committee. First of all, Senator Blanche Lincoln. \nSenator Lincoln has been a dear friend since our days in the House. We \nhave had the opportunity to work together on several different \nagriculture measures. I am extremely appreciative for the work she has \ndone on this particular bill.\n\n[[Page S15638]]\n\n  My friend, Kent Conrad, what a great champion for agriculture he has \nbeen. I would have to say that in my 13 years in public service, I have \nnever served with a finer individual or legislator than Kent Conrad, \nnor will I in however long I remain in public service. To Kent and to \nthe services he has rendered as chairman of the Budget Committee, as \nwell as a member of the Agriculture Committee on this endeavor, I \nappreciate it.\n  There are a number of other folks whom I wish to acknowledge.\n  I would also like to thank those individuals whose work behind the \nscenes was instrumental to the passage of this farm bill. I cannot say \nenough about my staff director, Martha Scott Poindexter. She is the \ntype of staff who you want in the trenches with you, and I am fortunate \nto have her on my team. Without her efforts, we would not be here \ntoday. Also, I would like to thank the chief counsel of the committee, \nVernie Hubert. Vernie's vast knowledge of farm policy was indispensable \nthroughout this process. All of my staff deserves a great deal of \nrecognition and I extend my thanks to: Hayden Milberg, Cameron Bruett, \nKate Coler, Betsy Croker, Anne Hazlett, Christy Seyfert, Dawn Stump, \nPatty Lawrence, Alan Mackey, Erin Hamm, Matt Coley, Jane Anna Harris, \nand Carlisle Clarke.\n  I would also like to recognize Senator Harkin's staff director, Mark \nHalverson and his entire staff; Jim Miller and Tom Mahr from Senator \nConrad's staff; Robert Holifield from Senator Lincoln's staff; Megan \nHauck from Senator McConnell's staff; and Ann Wright from the majority \nleader's office. Their leadership and commitment helped to ensure final \npassage of this critical legislation.\n  I am extremely proud of the legislation before us today and the \nexample it provides to the American people of what can be accomplished \nwhen we focus on the needs of those we serve. While not every Member \nmay be pleased with each and every provision in this bill; I am certain \nthat we can all agree that the Senate has taken up an honorable \nendeavor in securing the future of American agriculture. The \ninvestments in this bill will not only benefit our farmers and \nranchers, but will promote prosperity far beyond the farm gate.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for final passage.\n  Inside the Beltway, everyone knows that the Congressional Budget \nOffice is a critical part of the legislative process and provides us \nwith the information to make informed and balanced decisions. Sometimes \ntheir decisions frustrate us and the complex nature of their work \nsometimes confuses us. Nonetheless, they are professionals and their \ncommitment to public service should be commended.\n  Every time we embark on a farm bill, the ag team at CBO is called \nupon to make very difficult decisions and to analyze policy that is \nbased on hypothetical assumptions.\n  I would like to personally thank Jim Langley, Greg Hitz, Dave Hull, \nKathleen Fitzgerald, Dan Hoople, Megan Carroll, and Kathy Gramp for \ntheir hard work this past year. They all have been extremely responsive \nto my staff and helpful answering our questions.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Chambliss for his very \nkind remarks. I want to say how much I have enjoyed working with him on \nthis legislation. If there were ever a challenge putting together this \nfarm bill, this has been it. Senator Chambliss has been a tremendous \npartner as we put this legislation together. He has been a consummate \nprofessional. The staff has been superb. I also thank the chairman for \nhis vision and his leadership in bringing a bill to the American people \nthat is good for taxpayers, that is good for our farm and ranch \nfamilies, that is good for the economy. I see the chairman is here and \nperhaps ready to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we will very shortly go to final passage \nof this bill. I will ask unanimous consent shortly to wrap that up. But \nfirst, again, I want to respond in kind to someone I didn't know \nuntil--well, we knew each other sort of slightly when he was in the \nHouse and I was in the Senate during the last farm bill, when we did \nthat one, and then he came over and he took over as chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee here and did a great job. In fact, I say to \nSenator Chambliss that we wouldn't be here today were it not for his \nleadership of the Agriculture Committee in the previous years where he \ntraveled the country and chaired hearings all over the United States. \nHe came to Iowa and I appreciated that very much. He laid the \ngroundwork for what we did this year.\n  He has become a friend and a close worker. I can say honestly that in \nthe development of this farm bill, Senator Chambliss and his staff \nworked very closely with us. I can't think of any one instance in which \nwe were surprised or anything came up that we didn't know about. I hope \nthat worked both ways. We had a very open relationship on this, and I \nthank Senator Chambliss for his many kindnesses and for working so \nclosely with me personally and with others on the committee, and \nworking with his side of the aisle to bring us to this point today. It \nhas been a great relationship. I look forward to going to conference \nand getting this bill worked out as soon as possible after the first of \nthe year, and I look forward to getting this done, hopefully even \nbefore the end of January.\n  I also thank all of the members of the committee. We have a great \ncommittee. I can honestly say this farm bill has the imprint of every \nsingle member of our committee. There is something in here that each \none on both sides of the aisle contributed to, either specifically or \ngenerically, whether it is energy or conservation or farm income \nprotection or specialty crops or nutrition--literally every person on \nthis committee had his or her hand in developing it. So we have a great \ncommittee. I am very proud of every single member on this committee.\n  I also want to recognize and thank members of our committee who, as \nleaders on other committees, were instrumental in completing this bill. \nSenator Conrad, played a key role as chairman of the Budget Committee \nand senior member of our committee. Senator Baucus, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, and Senator Grassley, the ranking Republican member \nof that committee, worked to obtain critical funding for this \nlegislation and helped shape it in our committee.\n  The bill we are passing today, the Food and Energy Security Act, is a \nsolid, forward-looking, fiscally responsible bill. It conforms to a \nstrict budget allocation and pay-as-you-go budget rules, yet still \naddresses the varied geographical and philosophical views of Senators \nin a very balanced way. This is my seventh farm bill, and as I've said \nmany times before: farm bills are bipartisan, not partisan. There are \nregional, philosophical and other differences, to be sure. It is a very \nbipartisan bill. We obviously had regional concerns, budgetary concerns \nand differences of views, but I think we have answered those in a very \nbalanced way.\n  We do so much in conservation and nutrition, specialty crops, energy \ninitiatives, disaster assistance and crop insurance programs, stronger \nincome protection and promoting new opportunities for farmers and rural \ncommunities in this country. This is a bill that is good for farmers \nand ranchers. We have provisions in here for young, beginning farmers. \nWe have provisions in here to help people transition to organic \nfarming. We have major new investments in initiatives to help producers \nof specialty crops. And we continue and improve income protection for \ndairy producers.\n  I wanted to say thank you to Senator Chambliss and all of the members \nof the committee, and I also want to recognize all of the committee \nstaff members because these staff members have worked very hard and \nthey deserve recognition for the passage of this bill here today.\n  First and foremost, I thank our very capable staff director, Mark \nHalverson. Mark is a farmer in his own right, farms in my State of Iowa \nand works here, so he combines it all. He is a lawyer, he is a \nprofessional staff person, and he does actually farm. So he brings a \nlot of expertise and has been a guiding hand in all of this.\n  I thank Martha Scott Poindexter, the chief of staff on the Republican \nside,\n\n[[Page S15639]]\n\nfor all of her guidance and for all of her great work. I thank you very \npersonally, Martha Scott. Thank you.\n  And, I say thank you to Todd Batta, who did so much on credit and \nforestry; Richard Bender, on rural development; Eldon Boes, who did so \nmuch on energy; Phil Buchan, on conservation; Dan Christenson, on \nnutrition and specialty crops; Kate Cyrul, our communications director; \nKatharine Ferguson, who does some of everything, covering issues and \nkeeping our committee on track; John Ferrell, on livestock; Kerri \nJohannsen, on energy; Susan Keith, our general counsel, who has now \nworked her second farm bill with us and covers all of the commodity \ntitle. Then there is Peter Kelley, who set up all of our hearings; Amy \nLowenthal, our counsel; Tina May, again on conservation; Stephanie \nMercier, who did so much work on crop insurance and on trade; Derek \nMiller, who put together a great nutrition title; Adela Ramos, who did \nall of our title work on the research title and food safety; Jonathan \nUrban, who worked hard on getting the reauthorization of the Commodity \nExchange Act last night; and, of course, Dave White, who has done so \nmuch work on conservation.\n  I also thank our chief clerks, Bob Sturm, of course, and Jessie \nWilliams. As we know, Bob has retired, but he comes back once in a \nwhile to help and we appreciate that; and we appreciate Jessie \nWilliams' hard work.\n  I would also like to mention all of the staff on the Republican side. \nI thank Martha Scott Poindexter, the chief of staff on the Republican \nside; Vernie Hubert, Hayden Milberg, Cameron Bruett, Kate Coler, Betsy \nCroker, Anne Hazlett, Christy Seyfert, Dawn Stump, Patty Lawrence, Alan \nMackey, Erin Hamm, Matt Coley, Jane Anna Harris, and Carlisle Clarke. \nThey are all good, dedicated people who worked very hard on this bill.\n  I now wish to propound a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous \nconsent that all pending amendments be withdrawn, that no further \namendments be in order, that the substitute amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to, the bill--Mr. President, I am told the managers' package \nstill has not been worked out. I had assumed it was. It still has not. \nSo we are going to have to wait a few more minutes to get the managers' \npackage put together and make sure it is agreed to.\n  With that, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, as I understand the situation--and \nI stand to be corrected if I am wrong--we have a managers' package at \nthe desk, which has been cleared on both sides; that the amendments \nwhich were objected to previously now are put back in; that there is an \namendment in that package which sets a lower program level in a USDA \nprogram offsetting those amendments. With that, I understand the \nmanagers' package is acceptable; am I correct?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, that is correct. As I recall, I had \nreserved the right to object. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the managers' \npackage is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3855) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending \namendments be withdrawn; that no further amendments be in order; that \nthe substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the bill read the \nthird time, and that the cloture motion be withdrawn; that without \nfurther intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill; that upon passage, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and it is \nnot my intention to object, we have been working closely with the \nchairman's staff and with the ranking minority member to ensure that \nthe bipartisan ban on illegal logging would be included. I have not \nbeen informed. Has the ban on illegal logging been included?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am informed that it has.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3500), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the final \npassage of the farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the bill, as amended. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is laid on the table. The Senate insists on its amendment, \nrequests a conference with the House, and the Chair is authorized to \nappoint conferees.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again this is a great vote--79 votes in \nfavor of the farm bill is a great vote. I think it is an affirmation of \nthe hard work our committee put in all this year to get to this point, \non both sides of the aisle, with Senator Chambliss leading his side. On \nour side, we had great cooperation and great work from all the members \nof our committee.\n  So I look upon this very strong vote as an affirmation of this hard \nwork.\n\n[[Page S15640]]\n\nAnd, indeed, it was hard work. Someone said to me a little bit ago: \nGosh, December 14 is late in the year to do a farm bill. I remembered \nthe 1981 farm bill was passed on December 17 at 2 a.m. in the morning. \nHow do I remember that? Because my daughter was born 2 hours later, at \n4 a.m. in the morning. So, to me, this is early. But nonetheless, it is \na great bill and we are delighted to get it through. We look forward to \ngoing to conference now.\n  I wish to say one other thing. Late last night, I received a phone \ncall from Senator Biden and Senator Clinton and Senator Dodd and \nSenator Obama. They all reached out to me to ask: Do you need our vote \nfor the farm bill? Because we want to be there to vote for it. We had \ntaken a whip count, we knew we had a good bill, we knew we would have \nmore than enough votes on this, and so I told each of them their vote \nwas not needed. But they each assured me, Senator Biden, Senator \nClinton, Senator Dodd, and Senator Obama, if their vote was needed, \nthey would have been here, and had they been here, they would have \nvoted for that farm bill. So I wish to thank each of them, and I want \nthe record to show Senators Biden, Clinton, Dodd, and Obama would have \ncast their votes in favor of the farm bill were they able to be here \ntoday. I appreciate their support, and, of course, I wish each of them \nexcellent luck in the future.\n  With that, again I thank all my fellow Senators, I look forward to \nour conference and wrapping up our conference sometime soon, in \nJanuary, but this is a good bill, and you can take it home. It is a \ngood bill for rural America and for farmers and for everyone who eats \nfood in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, knowing the chairman is about my age, I \nhope he doesn't have another child in the next 2 hours.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I sure hope not.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to add to what I said a little \nearlier and some comments made before the vote.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate provides certainty to America's \nfarmers and ranchers, conservationists, school lunch program \nbeneficiaries, environmentalists, and rural communities all across this \ngreat land. Today, the Senate sets aside partisanship in favor of \nassisting those in need. Today, we honor our commitment to the American \nagriculture sector with the passage of the Food and Energy Security Act \nof 2007.\n  The bipartisan bill before us today is the culmination of years of \nhard work on the part of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the \nmillions of constituents we work so hard to represent with dignity and \npurpose. And, as in any great endeavor, this accomplishment is the \nfruit of the labor of so many. As we approach final passage of the Food \nand Energy Security Act of 2007, I would like to take a moment to \nexpress my thanks and sincere appreciation to everyone that has made \nthis historic day possible.\n  First, let me extend my appreciation to the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Tom Harkin. He has truly been a leader \nthroughout this process, demonstrating the bipartisan work ethic that \nis essential to this body's work. Furthermore, each and every member of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee has played a critical role in crafting \nthis bill and formulating the fiscally responsible policy contained in \nthis farm bill. Every Senator, regardless of party affiliation or the \nregion of the country they are fortunate to represent; came together to \nproduce a farm bill that will carry our agricultural sector into the \nnext 5 years of prosperity.\n  I would be remiss if I did not extend my praise to one particular \nmember of our committee, Senator Kent Conrad. I can say without \nequivocation, that there is no way we could have arrived where we are \ntoday without his leadership, budgetary skills, and tireless \nwillingness to set aside partisan differences in order to accomplish \nour common goal of continuing our commitment to the American farmer and \nrancher. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent has obviously \nplayed a key role throughout this process and I have not served with a \nfiner individual in all my years of public service.\n  Inside the Beltway, everyone knows that the Congressional Budget \nOffice is a critical part of the legislative process and provides us \nwith the information to make informed and balanced decisions. Sometimes \ntheir decisions frustrate us and the complex nature of their work \nsometimes confuses us. Nonetheless, they are professionals and their \ncommitment to public service should be commended.\n  Every time we embark on a farm bill, the Agriculture Team at CBO is \ncalled upon to make very difficult decisions and to analyze policy that \nis based on hypothetical assumptions.\n  I would like to personally thank Jim Langley, Greg Hitz, Dave Hull, \nKathleen Fitzgerald, Dan Hoople, Megan Carroll and Kathy Gramp for \ntheir hard work this past year. They all have been extremely responsive \nto my staff and helpful answering our questions.\n  I would like to thank also a number of individuals who have worked \nbehind the scenes and who were certainly instrumental and largely \nresponsible for the passage of this farm bill. I can't say enough about \nmy staff director, Martha Scott Poindexter. She is the type of staffer \nyou want in the trenches with you, and I am fortunate to have her on my \nteam. She has been with me now, off and on, for 13 years, and she is \none great southern lady from Mississippi who understands agriculture, \nhaving grown up on a farm. Without her, I simply wouldn't be able to \nfunction when it comes to agriculture, so I am very pleased she was as \ninstrumental as she was and here to help guide me.\n  I would also like to thank the chief counsel to the committee, Vernie \nHubert. Vernie, with his vast knowledge of farm policy, was simply \nindispensable in this process. As the chairman probably remembers, \nVernie was a staff director on the House side during the last farm \nbill, as well as a couple of others previous to that. But he was a \nstaffer on the Democratic side, and I was so impressed with Vernie \nduring the course of my years in the House, that when I was elected to \nthe Senate, I told Martha Scott the first thing she had to do was to go \nout and hire Vernie Hubert, and she did, and he has been a great one.\n  All my staff deserves a great deal of recognition, and I would like \nto extend my thanks to: Hayden Milberg, Cameron Bruett, Kate Coler, \nBetsy Croker, Anne Hazlett, Christy Seyfert, Dawn Stump, Patty \nLawrence, Alan Mackey, Erin Hamm, Matt Coley, Jane Anna Harris, and \nCarlisle Clarke.\n  Also, to those individuals on the Democratic side, and I mentioned \nMark a little bit earlier, but this is a bipartisan committee, both \nmemberwise and staffwise: Todd Batta, Richard Bender, Eldon Boes, Phil \nBuchan, Dan Christenson, Kate Cyrul, Katharine Ferguson, John Ferrell, \nKerri Johannsen, Susan Keith, Peter Kelley, Amy Lowenthal, Tina May, \nStephanie Mercier, Derek Miller, Adela Ramos, Jonathan Urban, and Dave \nWhite. What great folks they are and what a great service they have \nprovided to Senator Harkin as well as me.\n  There is also, over on Senator Conrad's staff, two guys over there, \nJim Miller and Tom Marr. These two men have worked extremely hard, and \nall these folks have put in hundreds of hours. I know how much time we \nhave put into it, but staff has two, three, and four times as many \nhours as we have. To all of them, I say thank you.\n  To Megan Hauck, from Senator McConnell's office; Ann Wright from the \nmajority leader's office; Robert Holyfield from Senator Lincoln's \noffice, their leadership and commitment helped to ensure final passage \nof this crucial legislation.\n  I am extremely proud of the legislation before us today and the \nexample it provides to the American people of what can be accomplished \nwhen we focus on the needs of those we serve. While not every Member \nmay be pleased with each and every provision in this bill, I am certain \nwe can all agree the Senate has made an honorable endeavor in securing \nthe future of American agriculture. The investment in this bill will \nnot only benefit our farmers and ranchers but will promote prosperity \nfar beyond the farm gate, and I am very pleased to have been part of \nthis with my chairman, Senator Harkin.\n\n[[Page S15641]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a landmark achievement. Let me \nindicate to my colleagues we have counted the votes--79 votes for this \nbill--and there are more votes for a farm bill than any farm bill going \nback to 1973, and that is with the Presidential candidates missing. \nThat would have been another four votes. No farm bill has had more \nvotes than this bipartisan bill since 1973.\n  That is a tribute to our leadership, the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Harkin, who came to this bill with a vision for moving \nagriculture in a new direction. This is a good beginning--not \neverything the chairman would have liked, and some of us had interests \nthat had to be addressed. So we were ready to follow his leadership, \nbut we also had to deal with some of the realities of our individual \nStates, and I know the chairman recognizes that. But we applaud him for \nhis vision because this bill moves in a different direction.\n  We have additional resources, important additional resources for \nconservation and for nutrition. The people of this country will look \nback on this bill, and they will also see the beginning of very \nimportant reform. The end of the three-entity rule, the direct \nattribution, dramatic reduction in adjusted gross income for \nnonfarmers. It will go from $2.5 million down to $750,000.\n  This bill is good for the economy and it is paid for. So we all \nsalute the chairman and his staff: Mark Halverson, the staff director, \nwho has been so dedicated to this cause. Mark, we appreciate the \nextraordinary efforts and energy you have put into this bill. To Susan \nKeith, who is a fierce advocate and somebody who is a real pro. She \nknows these programs backward and forward. Susan, we appreciate all the \ncontributions you have made.\n  To our ranking member, Senator Chambliss--``Cool Hand Luke.'' You \ncouldn't have a better ranking member for this committee, somebody who \nhas been calm in the eye of the storm. This has been tough to do, and \nthe occupant of the chair knows that is the case. Senator Chambliss has \nbeen a remarkable partner. So Saxby, we have enjoyed getting to know \nyou and working with you, and thanks for the extraordinary \nprofessionalism of your staff: Martha Scott Poindexter. Outstanding. \nUnflappable. Always there. Very smart, very knowledgeable, and very \ncommitted to producing a good bill for this country. Vernie Hubert, an \nabsolute pro. He has been on both sides of the aisle and respected on \nboth sides and somehow is able to maintain that respect. That is \nexactly the way the Senate ought to function. Thank you so much for the \ngood counsel we have received.\n  To other Senators on the committee, let's say a special thanks to \nSenator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, who helped us get \nvery important additional resources. Thank you, Senator Baucus. To \nother leaders on the committee, Senator Leahy, especially on the dairy \nprovisions. So many others.\n  Senator Stabenow, who led the fight for specialty crops. We deeply \nappreciate Senator Stabenow and all you did to help bring us together \nas well. Senator Klobuchar. Senator Klobuchar, who had special interest \nin renewable energy provisions. One of the exciting things about this \nbill is it is going to reduce our dependence on foreign energy.\n  A new Senator to the committee, Senator Casey, who has been \noutstanding, a quick learner, and we appreciate his contribution. \nSenator Sherrod Brown. Boy, he brings passion to this cause. You \ncouldn't have a better member of the committee than Sherrod Brown, who \nhas done his homework and is engaged.\n  To the other Members as well, we so deeply appreciate the \ncontributions that have been made. My partner right here, the Senator \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Salazar, who has that gift for bringing people \ntogether when it is especially difficult to do so. He has a gift, and \nhe is always there working to bring people in so we can reach \nconclusion. Certainly to Blanche Lincoln. Boy, I tell you, you want her \non your side when you are in a fight. She is fierce, she is determined, \nand she does not give up. Congratulations, Senator. We know you \nrepresented your people and you represented them well.\n  To the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Nelson, who is deeply \nknowledgeable. Of course, nobody knows more about crop insurance on our \ncommittee than Ben Nelson. He has been a huge help to us. We thank them \nall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in their \naccolades for what has happened here today. This is a historic move \nforward, especially when you look at the votes we have for this \nlegislation, because it is such a good piece of legislation. We had \nRepublicans and Democrats coming together saying this is a new way \nforward for America, for food security, for energy security, for \nnutrition and all the rest of it that is good in this legislation.\n  I wish to thank everyone who has been involved, from Ranking Member \nChambliss's leadership, to the chairman of the committee, Tom Harkin, \nand all his staff, who have been so tireless and so patient with us as \nwe have moved forward with this effort. It is always important, because \nthere are so many staff involved in this effort, to say thank you, and \nI wish to thank my staff: Brendan McGuire, Tommy Olsen, Grant Leslie, \nand Steve Black, and to others who have been with me working on this \nlegislation now for 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  Also, I wish to thank the staff of Senator Harkin, Mark Halverson, \nand Susan Keith, for their great work and leadership, as well as \nSenator Conrad's staff, Jim Miller and Tom Marr. Without them, it would \nhave been very difficult to get finalization on this legislation. \nThanks also to Senator Chambliss's staff, Martha Scott, who had a \nwonderful job of making sure we put all this together and Vernie as \nwell. Thank you.\n  I think it is important also for us to put this in the context of \nwhat has happened in the Senate. We ought to be very proud of what this \nChamber has done under the leadership of Senator Reid, who, coming into \nthis week, had a very tough agenda. When you think about it, the \nAmerican people should be proud of the Senate today because we have \npassed a historic energy bill, which is a giant step forward in terms \nof our quest for energy independence, and we have passed a Defense \nauthorization bill, to make sure we have the right strength in our \nmilitary forces who will defend our country and our homelands and our \nworld. Today, passing the farm bill, we have taken a huge step, making \nsure we lead the world in terms of security.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from North Carolina \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Let me add my congratulations to Senators Harkin and \nChambliss for their hard work and many accomplishments in passage of \nthe farm bill. I congratulate all involved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for about 10 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15641-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15641-S15642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HUNGER PROVISIONS IN THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of debate \nregarding many aspects of the farm bill; but, there is one issue that \nhas received relatively little attention on the Senate floor, yet it is \none of the most important matters facing our country. That issue is \nhunger, and it affects 1 in 10 U.S. households, including nearly 1 \nmillion of North Carolina's 8.8 million residents.\n  Fortunately, the farm bill we have just passed contains a number of \nprovisions that will support efforts to help the hungry. Take for \nexample, the Food Employment Empowerment and Development Act, or the \nFEED Act, which Senator Lautenberg and I have worked on together. I am \nvery pleased that this measure has been included in the managers \npackage. The FEED Act helps fight hunger by combining food rescue with \njob training, thus teaching unemployed and homeless adults the skills \nneeded to work in the food service industry. This provision will \nprovide much-needed resources to community kitchens around the country.\n  Successful FEED-type programs already exist. For example, in \nCharlotte,\n\n[[Page S15642]]\n\nNC, the Community Culinary School, which I visited last month, recruits \nstudents from social service agencies, homeless shelters, halfway \nhouses and work release programs. Just around the corner from the U.S. \nCapitol, students are hard at work in the DC Central Kitchen's culinary \njob training class. This is a model program, which began in 1990, and \nit is always a privilege for me to go over to the Kitchen and meet with \nfolks who have faced great adversity but are now on track for a \nmeaningful career. Earlier this year, I visited on their graduation \nday, and the graduates were so excited they were dancing in the \nkitchen. They were ready to start good jobs.\n  Of course, for the DC Central Kitchen, Charlotte Community Culinary \nSchool and other hunger relief organizations to carry out their \nmission, they must have food. To this end, I am very pleased that \nSenator Grassley and Senator Lugar have joined me as co-sponsors of my \nfood donation amendment included in the managers package. My thanks to \nChairman Baucus, and a special thank you to Ranking Member Grassley, as \nwell as their staffs, for working with me in this effort. My amendment \naddresses four tax issues that will encourage food donations and \nvolunteering to help the hungry.\n  First, my amendment extends a provision from the Pension Protection \nAct that allows any taxpayer to claim an enhanced deduction for \ndonations of food. This deduction is set to expire at the end of the \nyear; my amendment extends it for 2 additional years.\n  Second, my amendment allows restaurants to qualify for this \ndeduction. Unfortunately, a drafting error excluded most restaurants \nfrom utilizing this deduction due to their tax structure. My amendment \ncorrects this problem and provides restaurants with an extra incentive \nto donate food for hunger relief.\n  Third, it simplifies the rules that allow farmers and ranchers to \ntake advantage of this deduction for donating their products.\n  Finally, my amendment allows volunteers to receive a tax deduction \nfor mileage incurred while transporting food donations. As a former \nPresident of the American Red Cross, I know first hand the importance \nof volunteers--there would be no Red Cross without the 1.3 million \nvolunteers--and I understand that many charities, like Meals on Wheels, \ndepend on volunteers using their personal vehicles to deliver food to \ncountless tables across the country.\n  In addition, volunteers who glean and transport food could benefit \nfrom this tax deduction measure. Excess crops that would otherwise be \nplowed under or thrown out are taken from farms and other entities and \ndistributed to the needy. In the Old Testament, in the book of Ruth, we \nlearn that she gleaned in the fields so that her family could eat.\n  Each year in this country, 96 billion pounds of good, nutritious food \nis left over or thrown away. Gleaning helps eliminate this waste. I \nhave gleaned a number of times with an organization called the Society \nof St. Andrew, the latest being sweet potatoes in Harnett County, NC, \nin October.\n  While I have a number of concerns about the farm bill and its impact \non North Carolina agriculture, I welcome this bill's hunger and \nnutrition focus. Especially at this beautiful season of giving and \nthanksgiving we should remember our 35 million fellow Americans who are \nstruggling just to have enough to eat. The bill's provisions will help \nus keep up the fight in the battle against hunger. This is a campaign \nthat cannot be won in months, or even a few years, but with a caring \nGovernment and a caring people working together, ending hunger in \nAmerica is certainly a victory within reach.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a very important measure we have \nadopted in the Senate. In fact, today is a very important day for \nfamilies all across the United States who find themselves in this \nmortgage crisis that we have been hearing about, that we have been \ntalking about, that we have been meeting about. Two important actions \nhave taken place that will make a real difference in people's lives \ntoday. The first was, earlier today, modernization of the Federal \nHousing Authority, the FHA.\n  This had not been updated since the 1930s when people were in another \ntime of tremendous crisis, losing their homes.\n  We have come together today and put forward modernization that will \nallow more people to be able to get refinancing, to be able to get help \nand support from the FHA, to be able to keep their homes. That is what \nwe all want, the American dream of keeping our homes, of making sure \nour families have a roof over their head, that we can invest in equity \nin a home as part of creating that middle-class dream for ourselves, \nfor our families, and it is how we strengthen the community when we \nhave home ownership.\n  That is an important piece, and we just adopted the other piece that \nis very significant, particularly time-sensitive, and that is to make \nsure that no one who finds themselves in a mortgage foreclosure this \nyear, in 2007, or finds themselves having to refinance their home below \nthe value of their mortgage or through a short sale find themselves in \na situation where, on top of losing their home or losing money, they \nhave another tax bill.\n  Right now, up until the action we took a few moments ago, taxpayers, \nfamilies across America, would find themselves, for example, in a \nsituation of, if they had a $100,000 mortgage and they refinanced at \n$80,000 or the bank sold their home on a foreclosure at $80,000, they \nwould find themselves paying taxes on that difference between $100,000 \nand $80,000, that $20,000 difference. If it was forgiven by the lender, \nthey would pay taxes on that as if it were income. That makes no sense \nwhen families are challenged, facing the loss of their homes, \nstruggling to make ends meet--we are coming up to Christmas now--when \nfamilies are struggling to make sure they have what we all want, to be \nable to give our children a wonderful Christmas, to be able to have a \nhome for them, a place for the Christmas tree.\n  There are too many families who now find themselves in a real crisis. \nI am very grateful to everyone who has been involved in getting us to \nthis point. We have now said loudly and clearly that we understand and \nwe are not going to allow families to have an additional\n\n[[Page S15643]]\n\ntax burden as a result of being in a foreclosure or in the middle of \nthe mortgage crisis. And the FHA reform that we passed earlier today \nsays: We want to make it better by providing you alternatives and help \nto be able to keep your home.\n  I particularly want to thank, first, my cosponsors of the legislation \nthat is the underlying legislation that has resulted in this action \ntoday--my Republican cosponsor, Senator Voinovich, who has been just \nterrific. Both of us come from the Midwest, Michigan and Ohio. We both \nfind ourselves in many similar situations economically, with families \nwho have been faced with the issues of mortgage foreclosure and \nchallenging refinancing situations. I want to thank Senator Voinovich, \nwho is key to the place we are today, in getting to this point. He has \nplayed an incredibly important role, and I am grateful to him for that. \nSenator John Kerry has also been very helpful, and his staff; Senator \nLevin, my partner, who is always there, both of us working on behalf of \nMichigan; and Senators Snowe, Brown, Hatch, Coleman, Schumer, Harry \nReid, Nelson, Klobuchar, Lieberman, Harkin, and Salazar.\n  Of course, we would not be here without our leader, Senator Harry \nReid. I know this is a personal concern to him in Nevada. I know that \nin his State there is a real challenge, as in mine, as it relates to \nthe mortgage crisis, and he has made this a personal priority, and I am \nvery grateful for his support.\n  Of course, Senator Baucus, our chairman of the Finance Committee, \nwithout whom, also, we would not be here, if it was not for his \nleadership, and his partner, Senator Grassley, without their bipartisan \nworking relationship--they are so extraordinary--we would not have an \nopportunity to address this issue and pass this legislation.\n  We held a hearing earlier this week, and I want to thank again our \nFinance Committee chairman for focusing a bright light on this mortgage \ncrisis, what is happening not only in the subprime lending market but \nin the general economy as it relates to the ripple effect in the \nhousing crisis, and his commitment has brought us to this point. I want \nto thank him.\n  I also want to thank Senator Judd Gregg, who brought this issue to \nthe debate on the farm bill and, frankly, was very instrumental in \nbringing this focus to the Senate floor, very articulate in explaining \nwhat the problems are that families are facing, and he, too, deserves a \nlot of credit for being a part of the effort to get us to this point \nand getting the actual bill passed this year.\n  Finally, I want to thank the White House. I think it is fair to say \nthat there are not a lot of issues in which I find myself on the same \nside as our President, but this is one of those on which we have worked \nvery well together. I appreciate his staff's good will in working with \nus to be able to get this done.\n  This was an important bipartisan effort from top to bottom, and I \nthink we can all be pleased and grateful that we have the opportunity \nto work together to really get something done. That is what people want \nus to do. I know our Presiding Officer understands that, that people \nwant us to work together, they want us to understand what is going on \nin their lives and that it is not just a game, that there are real \nthings that need to be fixed, that we need to solve problems. I know \nthat is why we have come here. The examples today, working together on \nthe Mortgage Debt Forgiveness Act and FHA, are two examples of what \nhappens when we work together.\n\n  I am a member of the Agriculture Committee and proudly have worked \nwith our chairman and ranking member and all of the members of the \ncommittee to get a farm bill passed, a Food and Energy Security Act \nthat is good for the country, not just for rural America but for all \nAmericans and for our economy.\n  So this is a day--we have the Department of Defense authorization \nthat was passed--this is a day of good cheer, a day of showing what we \ncan do with the right kind of leadership, and I again thank Senator \nReid for providing that leadership. He and Senator McConnell, working \ntogether on the efforts that we were able to pass today, have made a \nreal difference.\n  We have, in fact, as it relates to families who find themselves in a \nvery difficult crisis or on the verge of a crisis related to losing \ntheir homes, said to them: We not only hear you, but we are going to \nstep up and we are going to help. That is what this bill does. That \ntakes away the tax liability for families. That is what we did earlier \ntoday with FHA modernization, and it is a good way to end a very hard-\nfought week, a very difficult, challenging week, to come together on \nthis Friday to be able to get work done for the American people, and I \nam very proud we have been able to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Michigan \nfor summarizing the important issues we worked on today that help the \nAmerican people. We are grateful for her work on these issues and her \ngreat leadership.\n  I wish to speak just for a few minutes, probably less than 2 minutes, \nabout the farm bill. It is hard to do that because it is such a massive \npiece of legislation, but suffice it to say that I think when we came \nto this Congress a year ago--it was a brandnew Congress--we said we \nwere going to focus on change in a new direction. I think the change we \nhave tried to bring is a change of priorities, really. I think this \nfarm bill is evidence of that. It is also a bipartisan effort, the \nwhole list of things you have already heard on the specialty crops for \nStates such as Pennsylvania, a brandnew part of the farm bill, whether \nit is the help that our dairy farmers in Pennsylvania will receive--not \nnearly enough help; we have more work to do there but certainly some \nnew changes there.\n  The energy title is so important to create the jobs of the future but \nalso reduce our dependance on foreign sources of energy. The \nconservation and the reform efforts that were made here are important. \nTo highlight something in the nutrition title in this bill, there is \nmore than $5 billion of new money for nutrition, so needed by families \nacross America.\n  So I think we can be very proud, and I wanted to say how much I \nappreciate the work of the whole Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nCommittee. Chairman Tom Harkin did a wonderful job. The ranking member, \nSenator Chambliss, spoke before about Senator Conrad's contribution as \nthe Budget chair, also sits on our Agriculture Committee. I am grateful \nthat so much work went into this for the people, in my case, of \nPennsylvania but also for the people of America.\n\n\n                                 S-CHIP\n\n  Before I turn the microphone over to one of our fellow committee \nmembers, and, like the Presiding Officer, a fellow freshman, Senator \nKlobuchar from Minnesota, who will be coming after me, I want to say \none word about the President's veto this week, yet again, the second \ntime, of the State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Once again, he is wrong. Once again, he is going counter to the \nbipartisan effort in America but especially here in Washington when it \ncomes to parties trying to work together where we could cover 10 \nmillion American children. Once again, the President has stepped in \nfront of that.\n  Unfortunately, in this season of hope, this holiday season, the \nPresident has made it much more difficult now to cover 10 million \nAmerican children. It is a mistake. It is bad for the country. It is \ncertainly bad for those children. But in the long run, it is bad for \nour future economy. I think the President should talk to members of \nboth parties and try to work something out to get 10 million children \nin America covered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15643-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15643-S15644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE ACTION\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today first to thank my staff \nfor their wonderful work on the farm bill: Hilary Bolea, who is a very \nsmart young woman, who has been working with us in Washington, DC, and \nthen also Dave Frederickson, experienced--he was the former head of the \nNational Farmers Union who came out of retirement to join my staff in \nMinnesota. They are quite a pair. My favorite\n\n[[Page S15644]]\n\nthing this summer is when Dave Frederickson took Hilary Bolea to a \ntractor pull at the Minnesota Farmfest. So we have a great team, and I \nam proud of their work.\n  I am happy the farm bill passed today with its forward-looking \nprovisions on cellulosic ethanol, the disaster relief, permanent \ndisaster relief that we worked so hard to get, the strong safety net \nfor our farmers. The reasons we had that safety net 75 years ago in the \nDepression with volatile prices, volatile weather, continue today.\n  As you know, I would have liked to have seen a little more reform in \nthis bill. I would like to see some income eligibility limits as well \nas the subsidy limits set down in the Dorgan-Grassley bill. We are \ngoing to continue to push for that reform. We will work with \nRepresentative Peterson, who is from Minnesota, the head of the Ag \nCommittee in the House, and our great leader, Senator Harkin, with our \nranking member, Senator Chambliss, as the bill goes to conference \ncommittee.\n  I am hopeful there will be some discussion with the White House about \nthe reform in the bill. We have a very good start here and we need to \ncontinue that discussion in the months to come.\n  The other thing, I wish to commend the Senate for passing the Energy \nbill yesterday. I came out of the Commerce Committee. We worked on that \ngas mileage standard. We are now seeing a 10-mile-per-gallon increase, \nnot only good for the environment but also, most importantly, good for \nthe American consumer. They can save money by having less cost for gas. \nThis energy bill is just the beginning of us starting to focus not on \nspending all our money on the oil cartels in the Middle East but \ninstead focusing on the farmers and workers of the Midwest and our own \nenergy independence.\n  Finally, on the FHA reauthorization and the work being done on the \nsubprime issue, I had a roundtable with a number of people involved in \nthis back in Minnesota. Minnesota is fourth in the country for subprime \nmortgage foreclosures. The chickens are coming home to roost in terms \nof predatory lending. We finally have started to work on the issue in \nWashington, and we see the problems it is causing not only for \nindividual homebuyers but for entire neighborhoods and communities.\n  All in all, I believe we got some things done at the end of the week.\n  The one last thing I commend the Senate for is the work on the pool \nsafety bill. I have spoken on the floor a few times about something of \nmaybe little note when you look at the larger scheme, but a very \nimportant note to one family, and that is the Taylor family of Edina, \nMN. Their girl Abby was severely injured in a wading pool this summer. \nShe may never eat again. She is sick but she is so strong in spirit. \nHer family called me literally every 2 weeks to check on the progress \nof this bill. Because of Abby, we were able to strengthen the bill. It \nwas named after former Secretary of State Jim Baker's granddaughter \nwhen she was so tragically killed in a similar accident. This puts in a \nstandard, a retroactive standard for public pools which includes \napartments, any pools used by the public. It includes stronger drain \ncovers, a vacuum suction system. It is a very good bill. The House bill \nis similar. I have every intention to get this thing done. I thank \nSenator Pryor, Senator Stevens, and others for their work to get this \ndone on a bipartisan basis in the Senate. One of the proudest moments \nmy year here was when I was able to call Scott Taylor last night at \nabout 9 p.m. from the Senate floor and tell him that that bill had \npassed and to know we were going to go home to Minnesota and have a \nlittle Christmas present for that family, something we worked so hard \non to make sure this wouldn't happen to another child.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. KLOBUCHAR). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15644-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15644-S15647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as I have announced several times in the \nlast few days, I am going to shortly move to proceed to S. 2248, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This is such an important piece \nof legislation. I spoke briefly on this subject earlier, but I want to \nprovide a more complete explanation of the process by which the Senate \nwill consider this vital piece of legislation.\n  Earlier this year, the Director of National Intelligence came to \nCongress and alerted us to what he described as a significant gap that \nhad emerged in our Nation's foreign intelligence-gathering capacity. \nMembers on both sides of the aisle and from all sides of this important \ndebate became convinced that this problem was real and that we had an \nobligation to address it. Although many of us differ on the solution, \nall Senators without exception, both Democrats and Republicans, want to \nensure that intelligence professionals have the tools they need to keep \nour country as safe as possible. We all worked in good faith with the \nadministration through July and August to provide those tools in a way \nthat protects the privacy and liberties of law-abiding Americans.\n  Unfortunately, the bill signed by President Bush fell well short of \nthat goal. I and many other Democrats opposed the so-called Protect \nAmerica Act. That is why we made sure it had a 6-month sunset, so we \ncould come back and do a better job of ensuring judicial and \ncongressional oversight of these sensitive activities. As we all know, \nhad the President been operating as we have always operated in the \npast, he would simply have come to the Intelligence Committee, the \nJudiciary Committee, and told them the changes that were necessary. But \nthey didn't do that.\n\n  As my colleagues know, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nIntelligence Committee share jurisdiction over the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act. As a result of the President not asking us to act in \na timely fashion, we find ourselves in a difficult position. But in \nspite of that, both committees have worked diligently over the past few \nmonths. This hard work has resulted in two different versions of \nlegislation to improve FISA, S. 2248, reported out of the committees.\n  I consulted extensively with Chairmen Rockefeller and Leahy about the \nbest way for the Senate to consider this delicate subject. I have \ndetermined that in this situation it would be wrong of me to simply \nchoose one committee's bill over the other. I personally favor many of \nthe additional protections included in the Judiciary Committee bill. I \noppose the concept of retroactive immunity in the Intelligence bill. \nBut I cannot ignore the fact that the Intelligence bill was reported \nfavorably by a vote of 13 to 2, with most Democrats on the committee \nsupporting that approach. I explored the possibility of laying before \nthe Senate a bill that included elements of both committee bills. \nEarlier this week I used Senate rule XIV to place two bills on the \ncalendar, first S. 2440, consisting of titles I and III of the \nIntelligence bill, but did not include title II on retroactive \nimmunity. The second bill, S. 2441, consists of title I of the \nJudiciary bill and titles II and III of the Judiciary bill. Senator \nLeahy and I favor the second bill, S. 2441. But for me to override \nSenate precedent and rules in this case would be wrong and unfair. \nAfter consulting with Chairman Rockefeller and Chairman Leahy, we \nrecognized--these two veteran legislators--that the best thing to do \nwould be to follow regular order. It is the right thing to do. It is \nnot right for me to pick and choose. After the committee structure has \nbeen established--and I believe in it--to simply say it doesn't matter \nin this case, it matters in every case. If it doesn't matter in one \ncase, then it doesn't matter in any case. We have to follow the rules \nwe have here; otherwise, it becomes very unfair, and it becomes a \nsituation where I am the one picking and choosing. That isn't the way \nit should be. Both chairmen, with their experience, agreed that this \nwas the right approach, even though, as I repeat, Senator Leahy and I \nwould rather have the Judiciary Committee bill that we believe \nstrengthens the position we had initially and not have to try to put \nthem in at a subsequent time.\n\n[[Page S15645]]\n\n  Under regular order, under the rules of the Senate governing \nsequential referral, I will move to proceed to S. 2248, the bill \nreported by each committee. When that motion to proceed is adopted, the \nwork of both committees will be before the Senate, all elements of both \npieces of legislation. All Senators will then be involved in the \nprocess. That is how it should be--all members of the Intelligence \nCommittee, all members of the Judiciary Committee, and all Members of \nthe Senate, Democrats and Republicans.\n  Because of the order in which they considered the bill, the \nIntelligence Committee version will be the base text. The Judiciary \nCommittee version will be automatically pending as a substitute \namendment.\n  I admire and respect the work done by these two committees on a \nbipartisan basis. Senators Leahy and Specter work extremely well \ntogether. Senators Rockefeller and Bond work extremely well together. \nThese are the two committees that will have matters before this Senate. \nIn the weeks since the two committees acted, Senators Rockefeller and \nLeahy have been working very hard to narrow the differences between \ntheir two versions of the bill. The ranking Republicans, Senators Bond \nand Specter, have been included in these conversations and \ndeliberations. I expect that when we begin debate on the bill there \nwill be amendments to incorporate many of the Judiciary Committee \nprovisions into the Intelligence Committee text. In my view, that will \nmake the final product stronger.\n  There is one issue that cannot be resolved through formal \nnegotiation. As some are aware, the Intelligence Committee bill \nprovides the telephone companies with retroactive immunity for lawsuits \nfiled by customers for privacy violations and other aspects of the law. \nFor me and many Members, there is a belief that such a grant of \nimmunity is not wise. Others disagree. We saw what happened in the \nIntelligence Committee. That is a committee that the Republican leader \nand I worked very hard to get people on that committee who are going to \nwork long hours. No committee in the Congress works longer hours than \nthe Intelligence Committee. They work in anonymity. They don't have \npublic hearings very often. Most of the time they are secluded in the \nHart Building in that confidential space they have alone. The press \ndoesn't know what is going on there. Staff, except for a few exclusive \nstaff members, have no idea what is going on in there. These people on \nthe Intelligence Committee work very hard and out of the purview of the \npublic. That is the way it has to be. I expect there will be full \ndebate on this subject of immunity next week as there should be.\n  Senators Specter, Feinstein, Whitehouse, Wyden, and others are \nworking to craft a compromise that might give the phone companies some \nrelief but would allow the lawsuits to go forward in a manner that \nwould preserve accountability. In one way or another, we must ensure \nthat President Bush is held accountable for his actions. Some people \nbelieve his actions were unwise and misdirected. It is important for \nthe Senate to complete work on this bill next week to allow time for \nthe Senate and House to produce a final product in conference. Our \nultimate goal is a bill that commands broad bipartisan support in the \nCongress and in the country. The process I have outlined offers us the \nbest opportunity to do so. It is going to be difficult, it is going to \nbe time consuming, and it is going to be important. It is for the \nsafety and security of our Nation.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, for nearly 30 years, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, as it has come to be known, has \nrepresented the ultimate balance between our country's need to fight \nterrorism ferociously and to protect the constitutional rights of the \nAmerican people.\n  I intend to outline several of the key issues in this debate this \nafternoon. First, though, I want to say a word about the process which \nthe distinguished Senate majority leader has just touched on.\n  I was one of two in the Senate Intelligence Committee to oppose the \nIntelligence Committee's version of the legislation. I am strongly \nopposed to granting telecommunications companies total retroactive \nimmunity when they have been accused of wrongdoing in the President's \nwarrantless wiretapping program. The Intelligence Committee legislation \nincludes such a grant of immunity, and it was the major reason I \nopposed the legislation.\n  I do, however, respect Senator Reid's decision to hold the debate on \nthis legislation under the regular Senate rules. Certainly, the \ndistinguished majority leader has been under a lot of pressure from all \nsides to change the rules that in one way might favor one side or the \nother, but I think the majority leader has made the right decision by \ninsisting that this debate go by the book.\n  I have had the chance now to work with the distinguished majority \nleader for more than a quarter century. I know how much respect he has \nfor the Senate and for this institution. He firmly believes in the \ncommittee process. He firmly believes in the Senate's rules and \ntraditions, and he worked to carry those beliefs out as both the \nminority whip and the minority leader. So we will have a chance, as \nSenator Reid noted, to try to work a compromise on several of these key \nissues.\n  I have said on a number of occasions, it may well be appropriate that \nthe phone companies deserve some measure of protection with respect to \ntheir role in this surveillance program. But at a time when there are \nscores of lawsuits, the idea of complete and retroactive immunity seems \nto me to be over the line.\n  It would be my intention, if we cannot reach a compromise on this \nissue--and it is my hope we will--it would be my intention, once again, \nto oppose legislation that grants total and complete immunity for the \ncompanies.\n  Now, when the Senate Intelligence Committee picked up on its work \nthis fall, coming back after the recess period, once again, we had a \nchance to meet with the director of the intelligence community, Mr. \nMcConnell. As usual, he laid out a thoughtful case on a key issue, and \nthat is that in some respects the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nhas not kept up with the times.\n  Clearly, there are threats overseas, when one foreigner communicates \nwith another foreigner, where it is important that our intelligence \nofficials are in a position to protect the interests of the American \npeople and run surveillance with respect to those conversations.\n  I and others said to the administration repeatedly that we would be \nsupportive of that effort, and we would be supportive of that effort \neven when on an incidental basis it might pick up the conversations of \ninnocent Americans. It was an effort to try to reach common ground with \nthe administration and, in particular, to acknowledge that Admiral \nMcConnell had a very valid point.\n  But, unfortunately, the administration would not take yes for an \nanswer. I and others said--Chairman Rockefeller, Senator Bond. I have \nhad the chance to work closely with both of them. Both of them have \nbeen supportive of a number of initiatives I have felt strongly about \nwith respect to accountability, holding the intelligence community to \nits word with respect to disclosure, declassification.\n  I have the view that when Chairman Rockefeller and Senator Bond have \na chance to work with a number of us on the committee, we can find \ncommon ground on a lot of these key issues. We can find common ground \non the issue that the administration said for months and months was \ntheir principal concern; and that was to be able to pick up on the \nconversations of individuals overseas who represented a real threat to \nthe security and well-being of the American people.\n  But, as I indicated, that was not enough for the administration. They \nwould not accept yes for an answer. At that point, they then began to \npush very hard for this idea of complete and retroactive immunity for \nthe telecommunications companies. This\n\n[[Page S15646]]\n\ncame, of course, after years and years of the administration saying \nthis program was lawful. I have had some difficulty squaring the fact \nthat the administration said for so long--for literally years--that the \nprogram was lawful and now, in the face of all these lawsuits, despite \nthe assertion that the program was so lawful, there should be this \nblanket grant of immunity. So that alone raised concerns on my part. I \ndecided to dig even more deeply into this issue.\n\n  There are a number of Department of Justice legal opinions that \nrelate to this program. The President has refused to make these \nopinions public or even share them with most Members of Congress. Our \ncommittee has reviewed the Department of Justice legal opinions related \nto the President's warrantless wiretapping program, and I have read \nthese opinions myself. In my judgment, the legal reasoning in these \nopinions is shaky at best, and in some areas it is exceptionally weak.\n  I think most Americans would be surprised and dismayed to learn that \ntheir President had ordered the NSA to conduct this program based on \nsuch flimsy legal justification. Nothing in any of these opinions has \nconvinced me that the President's warrantless wiretapping program was \nlegal. Now that the existence of the warrantless wiretapping program \nhas been confirmed, I see no national security reason to classify most \nof these opinions. As far as I can tell, these opinions are being kept \nclassified in order to protect the President's political security, not \nour national security.\n  Our committee has also reviewed written correspondence sent to \ncertain telecommunications companies by the Government, and I have read \nthis correspondence as well. I cannot reveal the details of this \ncorrespondence, but I can say that I remain unconvinced that the \nCongress should grant total immunity to the companies.\n  For years, there have been a number of laws on the books, such as the \nWiretap Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and, of course, \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that together make it very \nclear that participating in a warrantless wiretapping program is \nagainst the law.\n  Now, a number of our colleagues have argued that any companies that \nwere asked to provide assistance after September 11 should be granted \nleniency since they acted during a time of national panic and \nunderstandable confusion. I think this argument has some merit, but the \nbill that was reported by our committee would not just grant immunity \nfor 6 months or a year after September 11, it would grant immunity for \nactions taken up to 5 years after our country was attacked. I think \nthat is far too long, and I will explain why.\n\n  If a phone company executive was asked to participate in warrantless \nwiretapping in the weeks after September 11, it is understandable that \nhe or she might not take the time to question assertions from the \nGovernment that the wiretapping was legal, but this should not give a \nfree pass to participate in warrantless wiretapping forever. At some \npoint over the following months and years, this phone company executive \nhas an obligation to think about whether they are complying with the \nlaw, and as soon as you realize that you are breaking the law, you have \nan obligation to stop. In the months and years following September 11, \nit should have been increasingly obvious to any phone company that was \nparticipating in this program that it might not be following the law.\n  For starters, in the weeks after September 11, Congress and the \nPresident got together to review the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, including the wiretapping provisions. But Congress did not change \nthe sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that state \nwarrantless wiretapping is illegal. This should have been a giant red \nflag to any phone company that participated in the program.\n  Next, in the summer of 2002, the Director of the NSA, General Hayden, \nappeared before our committee in open session and testified about the \nneed to get warrants when someone was inside the United States. I am \nsure General Hayden would argue he was parsing his words carefully, but \nat a minimum it was clear, at this point, most of the Congress, and \ncertainly the American people, believes warrantless wiretapping was \nillegal. The President has argued he authorized this program under his \nauthority as Commander in Chief, but in the spring of 2004, the Supreme \nCourt issued multiple rulings clearly rejecting the idea that the \nPresident can do whatever he wishes because the country is at war. \nThese rulings should have also been a giant red flag for any phone \ncompany engaged in warrantless wiretapping.\n  Finally, as the Intelligence Committee's recent report noted, most of \nthe letters requesting assistance stated the Attorney General believed \nthe program was legal, but as our report points out, one of the letters \ndid not even say the Attorney General had approved. I have read this \nletter, and I believe it should have set off loud alarm bells in the \nears of anyone who received it. In my view, as the years rolled by, it \nbecame increasingly unreasonable for any phone company to accept the \nGovernment's claim that warrantless wiretapping was legal. By 2004, at \nthe very latest, any companies involved in the program should have \nrecognized the President was asking them to do things that appeared to \nbe against the law. The former CEO of Qwest has said publicly he \nrefused requests to participate in warrantless surveillance because he \nbelieved it violated privacy laws. I cannot comment on the accuracy of \nthis claim, but I encourage my colleagues to stop and think about its \nimplications.\n  I also encourage my colleagues to go read the letters that were sent \nto telecommunications companies. I think these letters seriously \nundermine the case for blanket retroactive immunity. The bill that \npassed the Intelligence Committee would grant immunity long past the \npoint at which it was reasonable for phone companies to believe the \nPresident's assertions. It would even grant immunity stretching past \nthe point at which the program became public. By the beginning of 2006, \nthe program was public and all the legal arguments for and against \nwarrantless wiretapping were subject to open debate. Clearly, any \ncompanies that participated in this program in 2006 did so with the \nfull knowledge of the possible consequences. I see no reason at all why \nretroactive immunity should cover this time period. When the Senate \nIntelligence Committee voted to grant total retroactive immunity, I \nvoted no because I thought it was necessary to take more time to study \nthe relevant legal opinions as well as the letters that were sent to \nthe communications companies.\n  Now that I have had a chance to study these documents, I am convinced \nthat granting 6 years of total retroactive immunity is not warranted. I \nwould very much like to support this important legislation because \ncertainly there are many good provisions and they have been put \ntogether under the work of Chairman Rockefeller and Senator Bond. It is \nmy hope, as Senator Reid noted earlier, we will be able to find a \ncompromise with respect to this issue. As I have said, it may well be \nclear at some point down the road that the phone companies deserve some \nmeasure of protection. We certainly want law-abiding citizens and \ncompanies to be supportive of our country in times of danger, and that \nis why I have made the point that if we were talking about a relatively \nshort period after 9/11, it would be one thing, but it is quite another \nwhen you are talking about year after year after year, when there were \nred warning flags going up.\n  So I look forward to working with Chairman Rockefeller and Senator \nBond, both of whom have great expertise in this field and have always \nbeen very fair, and I hope we can find a way to address the question of \nthe communications companies in a fair way.\n  I would also like to say, before I wrap up--I know it is late in the \nday--a quick word about an amendment I offered in the committee that \nhas been included in both versions of the legislation that the Senate \nIntelligence Committee wrote and that was written in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Many Americans may not realize the original FISA law only \nprovided protections for our people inside the United States and it \ndoes not cover Americans who travel overseas. If the Government wants \nto deliberately tap the phone calls of a businesswoman in Minneapolis, \nMN, or an armed services member in Roseburg, OR, the Government has to \ngo to a judge and get a warrant. But if that\n\n[[Page S15647]]\n\nMinnesota businesswoman or Oregon serviceman is sent overseas, the \nAttorney General can personally approve a surveillance by making his \nown unilateral determination of probable cause.\n  It is my view that in the digital age, it makes no sense for \nAmericans' rights and freedoms to be limited by physical geography. So \nwhen the Intelligence Committee was writing its legislation, I offered \nan amendment that would require the Government to get a warrant before \ndeliberately surveilling Americans who happen to be outside the \ncountry. That amendment establishing these ``rights that travel,'' so \nto speak, was cosponsored by Senators Feingold and Whitehouse, and it \nwas approved in the Senate Intelligence Committee on a bipartisan vote. \nThe White House, regrettably, called this amendment troublesome, and I \nwill only say I am prepared to work with colleagues on this issue. Just \nas I indicated I will be working with our Vice Chairman, Senator Bond, \non the issue of telecommunications immunity, I am prepared to work with \nhim and the chairman of the committee, Senator Rockefeller, on my \namendment to make sure there are no unintended consequences with \nrespect to the amendment I authored that is in the Intelligence \nCommittee legislation and that is also in the Judiciary Committee \nprint.\n  I am not prepared to agree that Americans who step outside the \ncountry should have fewer rights than they do here at home. I am going \nto fight for that amendment that ensures Americans in the digital age \nhave their individual liberties, have their constitutional rights \nwherever they travel, and I am going to fight for it even if the \nadministration continues to oppose it.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CON. RES. 21\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, section 302 of S. Con. Res. 21, the 2008 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for \nlegislation that improves certain services for and benefits to wounded \nor disabled military personnel and retirees, veterans, and their \nsurvivors and dependents. Section 302 authorizes the revisions provided \nthat the legislation does not worsen the deficit over either the period \nof the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of the \ntotal of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  I find that the conference report accompanying H.R. 1585, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, satisfies the \nconditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for veterans and wounded \nservice members. Therefore, pursuant to section 302, I am adjusting the \naggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation \nprovided to the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S.

Madam President, I support the passage of the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007, H.R. 6, which sets the U.S. \nenergy policy on the right path.\n  I am particularly supportive of the critical improvements that were \nmade in this bill to raise vehicle fuel economy standards while \nprotecting American jobs. It is vitally important to my hometown of \nJanesville, WI, and to other hard-working communities across the \ncountry that Congress strike the right balance on this issue. Since the \nSenate considered the Energy bill earlier this year, I have worked with \nmy colleagues to ensure that the final version includes strong but \nreasonable CAFE standards. I am glad that together we have accomplished \nthat feat, and the bill has the support of interests as varied as the \nUAW, General Motors, and environmental groups.\n  I also support the bill's renewable fuel standard, which will require \n36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022, of which 21 billion will \ncome from advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. \nThe bill also includes language I cosponsored urging that 25 percent of \nenergy come from renewable sources by 2025 and setting requirements for \nimproved energy efficiency for buildings, appliances, and lighting. The \nbill also includes an important provision, based on a bill I \ncosponsored, that makes it unlawful for an individual to knowingly \nmanipulate the price of oil or gas.\n  I am, however, disappointed that after hard work and negotiations \nthat produced a good, balanced energy bill, a minority of Senators \nrepeatedly blocked the bill. It is unfortunate that to overcome this \nRepublican roadblock, we had to remove the renewable electricity \nstandard and the energy tax provisions--these new or extended renewable \nenergy tax incentives were fully offset, so they would not have added \nto our deficit.\n  However, on balance, the version of the bill that the Senate passed \nis a positive step. It moves us away from our dependence on oil, \nincreases our\n\n[[Page S15648]]\n\nenergy security, encourages renewable energy and energy efficiency, and \nsupports hard-working families and communities around the country.\n  This year's Energy bill finally moves past the misguided debates of \nprevious Congresses and the fiscally and environmentally irresponsible \nproposals that were considered and passed in recent years. The United \nStates is at an important juncture. By supporting the Energy bill, I am \nsupporting a new direction for our Nation's energy policy: one that \nencourages renewable energy, conservation of the resources we have, and \nAmerican innovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15648-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TORTURE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as co-chairman of the Helsinki \nCommission, I chaired a field hearing this week at the University of \nMaryland College Park campus. The title of that hearing was ``Is It \nTorture Yet?''--the same question I was left with after Attorney \nGeneral Michael Mukasey's nomination hearings.\n  The day of the hearings was also International Human Rights Day, \nwhich commemorates the adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human \nRights nearly 60 years ago. The historic document declares, ``No one \nshall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment or punishment.''\n  In the Helsinki process, the United States has joined with 55 other \nparticipating States to condemn torture. I want to quote one particular \nprovision, because it speaks with such singular clarity. In 1989, in \nthe Vienna Concluding Document, the United States--along with the \nSoviet Union and all of the other participating States--agreed to \n``ensure that all individuals in detention or incarceration will be \ntreated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the \nhuman person.'' This is the standard--with no exceptions or loopholes--\nthat the United States is obligated to uphold.\n  I deeply regret that six decades after the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration, we find it necessary to hold a hearing on torture and, \nmore to the point, I regret that the United States' own policies and \npractices must be a focus of our consideration.\n  As a member of the Helsinki Commission, I have long been concerned \nabout the persistence of torture and other forms of abuse in the OSCE \nregion. For example, I am troubled by the pattern of torture in \nUzbekistan--a country to which the United States has extradited terror \nsuspects. Radio Free Europe reported that in November alone two \nindividuals died while in the custody of the state. When their bodies \nwere returned to their families, they bore the markings of torture. \nAnd, as our hearing began, we were notified that a third individual had \ndied under the same circumstances.\n  Torture remains a serious problem in a number of OSCE countries, \nparticularly in the Russian region of Chechnya. If the United States is \nto address these issues credibly, we must get our own house in order.\n  Unfortunately, U.S. leadership in opposition to torture and other \nforms of ill-treatment has been undermined by revelations of abuse at \nAbu Ghraib prison and elsewhere. When Secretary of State Rice met with \nleading human rights activists in Moscow in October, she was made aware \nthat the American forces' conduct at Abu Ghraib has damaged the United \nStates' credibility on human rights.\n  As horrific as the revelations of abuse at Abu Ghraib were, our \nGovernment's own legal memos on torture may be even more damaging, \nbecause they reflect a policy to condone torture and immunize those who \nmay have committed torture.\n  In this regard, I was deeply disappointed by the unwillingness of \nAttorney General Mukasey to state clearly and unequivocally that \nwaterboarding is torture. I chaired part of the Attorney General's \nJudiciary confirmation hearing and found his responses to torture-\nrelated questions woefully inadequate. On November 14, I participated \nin another Judiciary Committee hearing at which an El Salvadoran \ntorture survivor testified. This medical doctor, who can no longer \npractice surgery because of the torture inflicted upon him, wanted to \nmake one thing very clear: as someone who had been the victim of what \nhis torturers called ``the bucket treatment,'' he said, waterboarding \nis torture.\n  This week, this issue came up again--this time at the Senate \nJudiciary Committee's hearing on Guantanamo. One of the witnesses was \nBG Thomas Hartman, who was specifically asked whether evidence obtained \nby waterboarding was admissible in Guantanamo legal proceedings. Like \nJudge Mukasey, he would not directly answer that question. Nor would he \nrespond directly when asked if a circumstance arose--hypothetically--\nwhether waterboarding by Iranians of a U.S. airman shot down over Iran \nwould be legal according to the Geneva Conventions. In fact, the Geneva \nConventions prohibit the use of any coercive interrogation methods to \nobtain information from a Prisoner of War. I am deeply concerned that \nthe administration's efforts to avoid calling waterboarding what it \nis--torture--is undermining the interpretation of the Geneva \nConventions, which we have relied upon for decades to protect our own \nservice men and women.\n  The destruction of tapes by the CIA showing the interrogation of \nterror suspects raises a host of additional concerns. First, these \ntapes may have documented the use of methods that may very well have \nviolated U.S. law. Second, the tapes may have been destroyed in \nviolation of court orders to preserve exactly these sorts of materials. \nIf the administration is willing to destroy evidence in violation of a \nvalid court order, we have a serious rule-of-law problem. Finally, it \nis profoundly disturbing that materials formally and explicitly sought \nby the 9/11 Commission--mandated to investigate one of the worst \nattacks on American soil in the history of our country--were not turned \nover by the CIA. The destruction of the CIA tapes should be carefully \ninvestigated.\n  Mr. President, the Congress must act to ensure that abuses by U.S. \nGovernment personnel are not committed on the false theory that this \nsomehow makes our country safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15648-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15648-S15649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UPCOMING GENERAL ELECTIONS IN KENYA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, the last time I devoted a floor \nstatement to Kenya it was to condemn the assault by elite police and \nparamilitary commandos armed with AK-47s on the offices of the Standard \nGroup's offices in an attempt, by the government of that time, to \nprevent an independent newspaper from publishing a story on a sensitive \npolitical matter. That was nearly 2 years ago--in March 2006--when \nKenya's President Mwai Kibaki and senior members of his government were \nfacing serious charges of bribery, mismanagement of public funds, \ninadequate governance reform efforts, and political favoritism. \nUnfortunately, while some reform measures have been instituted, \ncorruption continues to choke Kenya's government and permeate society \nas efforts to curb such practices have been significantly \ndeprioritized. Transparency International's 2007 Corruption Perceptions \nIndex shows Kenya sliding down to number 150 out of 179 countries, on \npar with Zimbabwe and Kyrgyzstan.\n  More encouraging have been the increasingly engaged voices of the \nKenyan people and the dynamic media that has developed since the last \nelection. The last election showed the people of Kenya that their votes \ndid count enough to bring about a change, and the independent press has \nsimultaneously expanded and strengthened remarkably. Media outlets have \nnot allowed themselves to be intimidated as they persist in exposing \ngovernment mismanagement. Furthermore, while the courts are not \nentirely independent, they have taken up several high-profile cases, \nand some key ministers have been forced to resign. While Kenya's \ndemocracy is increasingly robust, it is nevertheless still quite young. \nThe new few weeks may reveal just how much progress has been made--and \nhow much progress is likely to be made in the future.\n  In two weeks--on Thursday, December 27--Kenyans will go to the polls \nto vote for their President, Parliament, and local officials. Five \nyears ago, the Kenyan people went to the polls and unambiguously \nrejected years of mismanagement, corruption, and declining economic \ngrowth by overwhelmingly electing the opposition National Rainbow \nCoalition, NARC, to power, ending\n\n[[Page S15649]]\n\nmore than 40 years of rule by the Kenya African National Union, KANU. \nPresident Kibaki and his administration deserve credit for advancing \nbasic freedoms and permitting the emergence of a vibrant civil society, \nbut his failure to rein in corruption in government ranks has him now \njust trailing Raila Odinga, his main contender in the presidential \nrace.\n  The fact that these elections are so close and hotly contested is a \ngood sign for Kenya's democracy. For the first time, a number of \nparties appear to be taking small but noticeable steps away from ethnic \nloyalties and towards more legitimate political platforms. Such a \ndevelopment is an essential component as the country moves towards \nbetter governance, and I am so pleased by all the work the \nadministration--and in particular the embassy in Nairobi--is \nundertaking by working closely with the Electoral Commission of Kenya, \npolitical parties, civil society organizations and other international \npartners through a new multidonor-funded, comprehensive electoral \nassistance program. Such initiatives are vital to help bring about a \nstrong democracy.\n  As the 2007 national elections approach, however, there are a number \nof challenges to a peaceful and fair multiparty process. Like other \nKenyan polls before it, this campaign period has been fraught with \nviolence and accusations of fraud. The electoral commission is \ninvestigating reports of voting cards being bought, and the primary \nconventions of the mainstream political parties were interrupted by \nviolence and chaos. On balance, there are those who say security has \ngotten better, but violence continues at unacceptable rates and around \n16,000 Kenyans have been displaced in election-related violence.\n  Last May, the United States Ambassador to Kenya, Mr. Michael \nRanneberger, addressed the Kenyan government and political community. \nHe promised that the United States would be neutral in the elections \nand in building the capacity of political parties and civil society, \nbut he made it clear that, and I quote, ``We are not neutral with \nrespect to . . . the conduct of elections. We want to see an inclusive, \nfair, and transparent electoral process.''\n  As voting day draws near, it is essential that the international \ncommunity speaks with one voice in calling for all parties to refrain \nfrom violence and fraud before, during, and after the upcoming polls. \nKenya's political elite, military officials, judicial bodies, and 14 \nmillion registered voters must understand that the world is watching \nclosely for signs that Kenya is truly committed to good governance and \nrule of law. Kenya's important leadership role in the region and \nthroughout the continent make it particularly important that the \ngovernment ensure the open flow of information, freedom of assembly, \nand nonpartisan conduct of the polls. Further, the government must \nrefrain from any misuse of its resources or authorities in the runup to \nthe election and on Election Day. All parties should renounce efforts \nto enflame tribal hatred, which means that politicians need to control \ntheir rhetoric, eschew violence, and avoid threats.\n  International support for Kenya's upcoming polls includes a large \nnumber of foreign observers who will be dispersed across the country to \nwitness the polling on Election Day. Reports from these monitors and \nindependent media will inform opinions around the globe not only when \nit comes to assessing the past 5 years of President Kibaki's \nadministration but also in determining the legitimacy of the next \ngovernment. In 2 weeks, all eyes will be on a country that is an \nimportant role model of stability and growth in a region beset by \nnatural and manmade disasters. It is not only Kenya's next president \nand other political leadership who will be decided on December 27, but \nit is also the state of its democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15649-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15649-S15650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise today to comment on the OPEN \nGovernment Act. This bill is only a slightly modified version of S. \n849, a bill that passed the Senate on August 3 of this year. At that \ntime, I made a more complete statement regarding the bill--see 153 \nCongressional Record at S10987 to S10989 in the daily edition of the \nRecord,, on August 3, 2007--as did Senators Leahy and Cornyn--see the \nRecord at S10986 to S10987 and S10989 to S10990. Thus my remarks today \nneed only describe the changes made to the bill and a few other \nmatters.\n  One section of the bill that makes important changes to the law and \nthus deserves comment is section 6. Although this section appeared in \nS. 849, I did not address the provision in August because final \nnegotiations regarding the language of that section were completed only \nan hour or so before we began a hotline of the bill. The purpose of \nsection 6 is to force agencies to comply with FOIA's 20-day deadline \nfor responding to a request for information. The original introduced \nversion of S. 849 sought to obtain agency compliance by repealing \ncertain FOIA exemptions in the event that an agency missed the 20-day \ndeadline, an approach that I and others argued would impose penalties \nthat were grossly disproportionate and that would principally punish \ninnocent third parties--see S. Rep. 110-059 at 13-14 and 15-19. The \ncurrent draft applies what is in my view a much better calibrated \nsanction, the denial of search fees to agencies that miss the 20-day \ndeadline with no good excuse.\n  Several features of this new system merit further elaboration. First, \nthe 20-day deadline begins to run only when a FOIA request is received \nby the appropriate component of the agency, but in any event no later \nthan 10 days after the request is received by a FOIA component of the \nagency. The reasoning behind this distinction is that requesters should \nreceive the full benefit of the 20-day deadline if they make the effort \nto precisely address their request to the right FOIA office, and that \nthey should also be protected by the secondary 10-day deadline if they \nat least ensure that their request goes to some FOIA component of the \nagency. So long as a misdirected request is sent to some FOIA component \nof an agency, it is reasonable to expect that such component will be \nable to promptly identify that missive as a FOIA request and redirect \nit to its proper destination.\n  On the other hand, if a FOIA request is sent to a part of an agency \nthat is not even a FOIA component, it is difficult to impose particular \ndeadlines for processing the request. For example, if a request is sent \nto an obscure regional office of an agency, it will probably simply be \nsent to regional headquarters. Many agencies have a large number of \nfield offices whose staff handle very basic functions and are not \ntrained to handle FOIA requests. Such staff probably will not recognize \nsome requests as FOIA requests. Implementing a deadline that extended \nto FOIA requests that are received by such staff would effectively \nrequire training a large number of additional agency staff in FOIA, \nsomething that Congress has not provided the resources to do.\n  Also, because this bill imposes significant sanctions on an agency \nfor a failure to comply with the 20-day deadline, it is important that \nthe deadline only begin to run when the agency can reasonably be \nexpected to comply with it, and that the law not create opportunities \nfor gamesmanship. If the deadline began to run whenever an agency \ncomponent receives the request, for example, sophisticated commercial \nrequesters might purposely send their request to an obscure field \noffice in the hope that by the time the FOIA office receives the \nrequest, it will be impossible to meet the deadline, and the requester \nwill thereby be relieved from paying search fees. Given the wide \nvariety of types of FOIA requesters, Congress cannot simply assume that \nevery requester will act in good faith and that no requester will seek \nto take advantage of the rules. The present bill therefore initiates \nthe 20-day deadline only when the request is received by the proper \nFOIA component of the agency, or no later than 10 days after the \nrequest is received by some FOIA component of the agency.\n  Section 6 of the bill also allows FOIA's 20-day response deadline to \nbe tolled while an agency is awaiting a response to a request for \nfurther information from a FOIA requester, but only in two types of \ncircumstances. Current practice allows tolling of the deadline whenever \nan agency requests further information from the requester. Some FOIA \nrequesters have described to the Judiciary Committee situations in\n\n[[Page S15650]]\n\nwhich some agencies have abused this process. For example, some \nagencies, when they are about to miss the 20-day deadline, allegedly \nhave contacted a requester to simply inquire whether the requester \nstill wants the request, or with other frivolous inquiries, all for the \npurpose of obtaining tolling of the deadline. Such practices should not \nbe permitted. On the other hand, agencies do have a legitimate need for \nsome tolling of the deadline. The language of subclauses (I) and (II) \nis the result of hard-fought negotiations between the FOIA requester \ncommunity and representatives of the agencies, negotiations to which \nSenator Leahy and I, frankly, served more as mere conduits rather than \nfull participants. This language allows tolling whenever and as often \nas necessary to clarify fee issues, and also allows one additional \ncatch-all request with the stipulation that this additional request \nmust be reasonable.\n  With regard to the tolling for requests for information relating to \nfee assessments that is authorized by subclause (II), neither agencies \nnor requesters would benefit if agencies could not contact requesters \nand toll the deadline while waiting to hear whether a requester still \nwanted the request in light of, for example, a substantial upward \nrevision in the search fees that would be assessed in relation to a \nFOIA request. And because such upward revisions might occur multiple \ntimes as a request is processed, it is not practical to impose a \nnumerical limit on such fee-related requests. Such requests need only \nbe necessary in order to be entitled to tolling under this subclause. \nPresumably, a request as to whether a requester still wanted his \nrequest in light of a trivial upward revision in the search-fees \nestimate would not be ``necessary,'' and therefore would not be \nentitled to tolling. Moreover, tolling only occurs while the agency is \nawaiting the requester's response. If an agency were to call or e-mail \na requester and inquire whether he still wanted the request in light of \na $100 increase in estimated review or search fees, and the requester \nimmediately responded yes, no tolling would occur. At least at this \ntime, it is not apparent how this tolling exception could be abused.\n  With regard to the catch-all requests authorized by subclause (I), \nrepresentatives of the agencies identified for the committee a wide \narray of additional reasons for which agencies reasonably need to \nrequest additional information from the requester and should be \nentitled to tolling. The agencies' representatives, however, also \nthought that an agency would not need to make more than one such non-\nfee-related information request. Since the agencies are the masters of \ntheir own interests, we have incorporated that limit into this bill, \nallowing the agencies to make a tolling-initiating request for any \npurpose and in addition to previous fee-related requests, with the \nadditional stipulation that these one-time requests also be reasonable.\n  Additional changes were made to this bill from S. 849. This bill \nomits section 8 of the August-passed bill. The former section 8 \nmaintained the requirement that previously enacted statutes only be \nconstrued to create exemptions to FOIA if the statute at least \nestablished criteria for withholding information, but required that \nfuture statutes instead include a clear statement that information is \nnot subject to release under FOIA. I only grudgingly accepted former \nsection 8 since I do not favor the use of clear statement rules in this \ncircumstance. The rule likely would serve as a trap for unwary future \nlegislative drafters. Under such a rule, even a statement in a statute \nthat particular information shall not be released under any \ncircumstances whatsoever would be construed not to preclude release of \nthe information under FOIA. On the other hand, some FOIA requesters \ncame to have second thoughts about section 8's elimination of the \nrequirement for future legislation that FOIA exemptions at least set \ncriteria for what information may be withheld. In my view, it would not \nbe practical to require a clear statement in addition to requiring that \nexemptions only be implied when release criteria are identified. At the \nvery least, it would pose a difficult question of statutory \nconstruction were a court asked to construe a statute to allow \ninformation to be ``FOIAble'', despite a clear statement in the statute \nthat the information was not subject to release under FOIA, because the \nstatute did not also set criteria for withholding the information. I \nhave never seen such a ``clear-statement-plus rule.'' I think that \nsimple clear-statement rules themselves reach the zenith of one \nlegislature's power to bind future legislatures, and that a ``clear-\nstatement-plus rule'' would cross that line. Given the preference of \nsome advocates for this bill for keeping the requirement that FOIA \nexemptions identify withholding standards or criteria, and my objection \nto combining a clear-statement rule with additional requirements for \nidentifying a FOIA exemption, the compromise reached in this bill was \nsimply to strike the previous section 8.\n  This draft also includes a provision that is now subsection (b) of \nsection 4 that requires that attorneys' fees assessed against agencies \nbe extracted from the agencies' own appropriated budgets rather than \nfrom the U.S. Treasury. This change was necessary in order to avoid an \nunwaivable point of order against the bill in the House of \nRepresentatives under that body's pay-go rules. I do not like this \nprovision. As I explained in my August 3 remarks, I believe that \nsection 4 already awards attorneys' fees too liberally in the \ncircumstances of a settlement. Effectively, it protects an agency from \nfee assessments not when the agency's legal position would prevail on \nthe merits, but rather only when the requester's claims would not \nsurvive a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. I believe that \nthis standard will discourage agencies from settling--even a case that \nthe agency believes that it will win at trial it likely will be \ndisinclined to settle if the agency believes that the claims would not \nbe dismissed on summary judgment. Subsection (b), by extracting the \nfees out of the agency's own budget, substantially aggravates section \n4's de facto no-good-deed-goes-unpunished rule, and will further \naggravate section 4's tendency to discourage agencies from settling \nFOIA lawsuits. Unfortunately, we have been unable to identify any way \nof solving the bill's pay-go problems other than by partly repealing or \ndelaying the implementation of parts of the OPEN Government Act, \nsolutions to which advocates for the bill balked. The effects of \nsubsection (b) should be monitored and, if the provision is as \ndiscouraging of settlements and disruptive to agency budgets as I fear \nthat it might be, perhaps the provision should be repealed or a \nseparate fund established to pay the fees assessed pursuant to FOIA's \nfee-shifting rules.\n  Finally, the bill includes two changes that were sought by the House. \nOne is to expand section 6's denial of search fees to agencies that \nmiss the response deadline to also include duplication fees in the case \nof media requesters and other subclause (II) requesters who already are \nexempted from search fees. Since these requesters already do not pay \nsearch fees, in their cases the threat of denying agencies such fees if \nthe 20-day response deadline is not met is not much of a sanction. \nAlthough duplication fees for idiosyncratic requests sometimes are \nmassive and denying such fees in all cases would be excessive--paper \nand toner do cost money--it is my understanding that media and other \nsubclause (II) requesters typically make narrow and tailored requests \nthat do not result in massive duplication costs.\n  The last change made in this bill is the addition of the new section \n12, which requires that when an agency deletes information in a \ndocument pursuant to a FOIA exemption, that it identify at the place \nwhere the deletion is made the particular exemption on which the agency \nrelies.\n  Overall, I believe that the bill that will pass the Senate today \nstrikes the right balance and that it will improve the operation of the \nFreedom of Information Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15650-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15650-S15651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING JOHN MOSES\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

John\n\n[[Page S15651]]\n\nMoses served as secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Veterans \nAffairs from 1962 to 1984. I had the great pleasure of knowing John \npersonally, and having him serve as a member of my Veterans' Advisory \nCommittee. I saw firsthand how committed he was to ensuring that \nWisconsin's veterans, who have given so much to our country, get the \ncare and services they deserve in return.\n  In fact, John was a veteran himself, who bravely served in World War \nII. He came under attack twice as part of an antiaircraft unit in the \nAleutian Islands, and later, in the European theater, led the point \nplatoon in General Patton's drive across the Moselle River to Siegfried \nline. He also survived a severe wound he received in combat on the \nGerman border, which put him in the hospital for more than a year. \nJohn's heroic military service said volumes about the kind of man he \nwas and how devoted he was to serving our country.\n  Service of every kind defined John's life, from his time in the U.S. \nmilitary to his tenure at the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, \nand through other efforts, such as his 10 years as president of the \nGays Mills School Board. John came from a tradition of public service; \nhis father was Governor of North Dakota, and he was then elected to the \nSenate. He briefly served in this body before he passed away in 1945.\n  John Moses was a man of outstanding character and uncommon commitment \nto both his State and his country. I feel fortunate to have known him, \nand I know that the State of Wisconsin is a better place for his \ndedicated efforts. That is a lasting legacy and one to which I am proud \nto pay tribute today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15651-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MICHAEL DOHENY\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise to express my sympathy over \nthe loss of Michael Doheny of Nebraska. Michael, a civilian contractor, \ndied in Iraq on December 9 when an improvised explosive device struck \nhis convoy vehicle. He was 35 years old.\n  Michael was raised in Broken Bow, NE, and graduated from Broken Bow \nHigh School in 1996. He joined the Marine Corps after high school, \nwhere he served 8 years and achieved the rank of sergeant. In 2005, \nMichael left the military and began work as a civilian contractor for \nSOC-SMG, providing security at military bases and other installations. \nHe was serving his third tour of duty as a civilian contractor in Iraq \nwhen he was killed.\n  All of Nebraska is proud of Michael's service to our country, as well \nas the thousands of brave men and women serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Michael is remembered as a devoted husband, son, and brother. In \naddition to his wife Melissa, he is survived by his mother, Kathy \nKugler; two brothers, Marine Sgt. Robert Kugler and John Doheny; and \nsister Amy Ritchie.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Michael \nDoheny.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15651-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15651-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15651-4", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2483.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe participation of physical therapists in the National Health Service \nCorps Loan Repayment Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Physical \nTherapist Student Loan Repayment Eligibility Act of 2007 with Senators \nJohnson, Cardin, and Brown on behalf of the folks across America who \nare in desperate need of access to qualified health care providers. \nThis bill will help bring physical therapists to the rural, frontier \nand underserved communities of America.\n  Many rural States have an inadequate number of health professionals, \nlet alone access to physical therapists whose services help shorten the \nrecovery time from injury or surgery, as well as provide noninvasive \ntreatment to conditions that might otherwise end up more severe.\n  We all know kids who go to school with dreams of becoming a health \ncare professional and serving their communities. But, they graduate \nwith so much debt that they have to take the highest paying job usually \nin an urban setting--leaving their dreams in the dust. My colleagues \nand I are offering this bill to help them fulfill that dream of working \nin underserved areas, often the very same areas they grew up in.\n  Like many other health care professionals serving in the National \nHealth Service Corps, physical therapy students are more likely to \nserve in rural areas if it is financially feasible through the loan \nrepayment program that is part of the National Health Service Corps.\n  The average total costs of tuition and fees for a physical therapist \nstudent attending an in-state public or private institution are $26,000 \nand $64,000 respectively. When they are starting out, they can expect \nto earn about $51,000 per year. One can easily understand why they \nwould be really tempted to find the highest paying job they can. \nDespite the health care needs, these jobs are not in places like \nCulbertson, MT; Martin, SD; Ironton, OH or Denton, MD, where \nreimbursement and salaries tend to be lower. However, a loan repayment \nprogram will make it possible for these committed health care \nprofessionals to be able to come into our communities, serve our \nfamilies and be able to pay off their school loans.\n  My cosponsors and I think this a very important bill and we welcome \nour colleagues support. Thank you.\n\n[[Page S15653]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2485\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 406\n\n       Whereas, in March 2006, the then-teenage woman known in \n     media reports as the ``Girl of Qatif'' was abducted and raped \n     by 7 men;\n       Whereas the ``Girl of Qatif'' endured significant physical \n     and emotional harm as a result of her rape--a crime that was \n     neither her fault nor acceptable under any circumstances;\n       Whereas, in October 2006, the General Court in Qatif, Saudi \n     Arabia sentenced the 7 rapists to prison terms ranging from \n     10 months to 5 years, but also sentenced the victim to 90 \n     lashes for being alone in a car with a man to whom she was \n     not related;\n       Whereas, on November 13, 2007, when the ``Girl of Qatif'' \n     appealed the decision of the General Court with her attorney, \n     Abdul-Rahman al-Lahem, the victim's sentence was increased to \n     200 lashes, a 6-month prison term was added, and the prison \n     terms of the rapists were increased to 2 to 9 years;\n       Whereas, also on November 13, 2007, the General Court \n     suspended Abdul-Rahman al-Lahem's license to practice law, \n     and he was summoned to appear before a disciplinary committee \n     of the Ministry of Justice of Saudi Arabia on December 5, \n     2007, for allegedly ``misrepresenting legal subjects through \n     the media to confuse the judicial establishment's image and \n     thus harming the country'', but his hearing was postponed to \n     an unspecified date;\n       Whereas, on November 20 and 24, 2007, the Ministry of \n     Justice issued statements on the case of the ``Girl of \n     Qatif'', alleging that the victim was guilty of an ``illegal \n     affair'' that is ``religiously prohibited'', that she was in \n     ``an indecent condition'' at the time of her abduction, and \n     that ``the main reason for the occurrence of the crime'' was \n     that the victim and her accompanying person ``violated the \n     provisions of Islamic law'', but Abdul-Rahman al-Lahem has \n     denied these accusations;\n       Whereas, when asked about the case of the ``Girl of Qatif'' \n     on November 20, 2007, Department of State spokesman Sean \n     McCormack stated, ``We have expressed our astonishment at \n     such a sentence. I think that when you look at the crime and \n     the fact that now the victim is punished, I think that causes \n     a fair degree of surprise and astonishment. But it is within \n     the power of the Saudi Government to take a look at the \n     verdict and change it'';\n       Whereas, on November 27, 2007, the Foreign Minister of \n     Saudi Arabia, Prince Saud bin Faisal bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, \n     stated that the judiciary of Saudi Arabia would further \n     review the case of the ``Girl of Qatif'';\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2006 Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices in Saudi Arabia (referred to in this \n     preamble as the 2006 Country Report), released on March 6, \n     2007, cited ``significant human rights problems'', including \n     ``infliction of severe pain by judicially sanctioned corporal \n     punishments'', ``denial of fair public trials'', ``exemption \n     from the rule of law for some individuals and lack of \n     judicial independence'', and ``significant restriction of \n     civil liberties--freedoms of speech and press, including the \n     Internet; assembly; association; and movement'';\n       Whereas the 2006 Country Report also stated that Islamic \n     law, or Shari'a, prohibits abuse and violence against all \n     innocent persons, including women, yet reportedly spousal \n     abuse and other forms of violence against women were common \n     problems, although the Government did not keep statistics on \n     such violence and abuse;\n       Whereas the 2006 Country Report also cited complaints that \n     ``judges often acted capriciously and did not base judgments \n     on precedent, leading to widely divergent rulings'';\n       Whereas the 2006 Country Report also stated that, ``A \n     woman's testimony does not carry the same weight as a man. In \n     a Shari'a court, the testimony of one man equals that of two \n     women'';\n       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, done at \n     Paris December 10, 1948, stipulates that all human beings \n     have the right to security of person, that, ``All are equal \n     before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to \n     equal protection of the law'', and that, ``No one shall be \n     subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading \n     treatment or punishment'';\n       Whereas the legal system of Saudi Arabia is based on \n     Shari'a and does not mandate specific punishments for many \n     offenses, leaving judges with wide discretion in issuing \n     verdicts; and\n       Whereas, in October 2007, the King of Saudi Arabia, \n     Abdullah bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, issued a decree to reform \n     aspects of the country's judicial system, including new \n     training for judges, changes to the appeals process, and the \n     establishment of two supreme courts to replace the Supreme \n     Judicial Council as the final recourse after courts of first \n     instance and appellate courts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) respects the sovereign rights of the Kingdom of Saudi \n     Arabia;\n       (2) welcomes the commitment of the Government of the \n     Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to reform its judicial system;\n       (3) condemns sexual violence in all forms;\n       (4) urges the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to \n     undertake robust efforts to address the significant problem \n     of violence against women in the society of Saudi Arabia, to \n     promote equal treatment of women in the country's legal \n     system, and to ensure that victims of sexual violence are not \n     punished for the crimes committed against them and have \n     access to and recourse through the country's legal system to \n     bring the perpetrators of such violence to justice;\n       (5) urges the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to \n     overturn the sentence of the ``Girl of Qatif'' of 200 lashes \n     and 6 months in prison; and\n       (6) expresses solidarity with the ``Girl of Qatif'' and the \n     women of Saudi Arabia in their efforts to address violence \n     against women and attain equal treatment in their country's \n     legal system, and with the many citizens of Saudi Arabia who \n     were outraged by the sentence of the ``Girl of Qatif''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15653-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3853.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Domestic Pet Turtle \n     Equality Act''.\n\n     SEC. __. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter have \n     been banned for sale in the United States by the Food and \n     Drug Administration since 1975 due to health concerns.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale \n     of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other \n     amphibians or reptiles that are sold as pets in the United \n     States that carry salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug \n     Administration also does not require that these animals be \n     treated for salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets.\n       (3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, and \n     make them safe for sale, has greatly advanced since 1975. \n     Treatments exist that can eradicate salmonella from turtles \n     up until the point of sale, and individuals are more aware of \n     the causes of salmonella, how to treat salmonella poisoning, \n     and the seriousness associated with salmonella poisoning.\n       (4) University research has shown that these turtles can be \n     treated in such a way that they can be raised, shipped, and \n     distributed without having a recolonization of salmonella.\n       (5) University research has also shown that pet owners can \n     be equipped with a treatment regimen that allows the turtle \n     to be maintained safe from salmonella.\n       (6) The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of \n     Agriculture should allow the sale of turtles less than 10.2 \n     centimeters in diameter as pets as long as the sellers are \n     required to use proven methods to treat these turtles for \n     salmonella.\n\n     SEC. __.

REPORT RELATING TO THE ENDING OF CHILDHOOD HUNGER \n                   IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has the highest rate of childhood \n     poverty in the industrialized world, with over \\1/5\\ of all \n     children of the United States living in poverty, and almost \n     half of those children living in extreme poverty;\n       (2) childhood poverty in the United States is growing \n     rather than diminishing;\n       (3) households with children experience hunger at more than \n     double the rate as compared to households without children;\n       (4) hunger is a major problem in the United States, with \n     the Department of Agriculture reporting that 12 percent of \n     the citizens of the United States (approximately 35,000,000 \n     citizens) could not put food on the table of those citizens \n     at some point during 2006;\n       (5) of the 35,000,000 citizens of the United States that \n     have very low food security--\n       (A) 98 percent of those citizens worried that money would \n     run out before those citizens acquired more money to buy more \n     food;\n       (B) 96 percent of those citizens had to cut the size of the \n     meals of those citizens or even go without meals because \n     those citizens did not have enough money to purchase \n     appropriate quantities of food; and\n       (C) 94 percent of those citizens could not afford to eat \n     balanced meals;\n       (6) the phrase ``people with very low food security'', a \n     new phrase in our national lexicon, in simple terms means \n     ``people who are hungry'';\n       (7) 30 percent of black and Hispanic children, and 40 \n     percent of low income children, live in households that do \n     not have access to nutritionally adequate diets that are \n     necessary for an active and healthy life;\n       (8) the increasing lack of access of the citizens of the \n     United States to nutritionally adequate diets is a \n     significant factor from which the Director of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention concluded that ``during the \n     past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in obesity \n     in the United States'';\n       (9) during the last 3 decades, childhood obesity has--\n       (A) more than doubled for preschool children and \n     adolescents; and\n       (B) more than tripled for children between the ages of 6 \n     and 11 years;\n       (10) as of the date of enactment of this Act, approximately \n     9,000,000 children who are 6 years old or older are \n     considered obese;\n       (11) scientists have demonstrated that there is an inverse \n     relation between obesity and doing well in school; and\n       (12) a study published in Pediatrics found that ``6- to 11-\n     year-old food-insufficient children had significantly lower \n     arithmetic scores and were more likely to have repeated a \n     grade, have seen a psychologist, and have had difficulty \n     getting along with other children''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is a national disgrace that many millions of \n     citizens of the United States, a disproportionate number of \n     whom are children, are going hungry in this great nation, \n     which is the wealthiest country in the history of the world;\n       (2) because the strong commitment of the United States to \n     family values is deeply undermined when families and children \n     go hungry, the United States has a moral obligation to \n     abolish hunger; and\n       (3) through a variety of initiatives (including large \n     funding increases in nutrition programs of the Federal \n     Government), the United States should abolish child hunger \n     and food insufficiency in the United States by the 2013.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     relevant committees of Congress a report that describes the \n     best and most cost-effected manner by which the Federal \n     Government could allocate an increased amount of funds to new \n     programs and programs in existence as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act to achieve the goal of abolishing child \n     hunger and food insufficiency in the United States by 2013.\n       On page 394, strike line 25 and insert the following:\n     as determined by the Secretary.\n       ``(i) Air Quality Improvement Practice.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall provide technical \n     and financial assistance to a producer to promote air quality \n     improvements and address air quality concerns associated with \n     agriculture.\n       ``(2) Priority.--In providing assistance for improvements \n     in air quality, the Secretary shall give priority to \n     applications that--\n       ``(A) are located in areas--\n       ``(i) that are nonattainment areas with respect to ambient \n     air quality standards;

CONTROL WORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) the Wildlife Services division of the Animal and Plant \n     Health Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture \n     (referred to in this section as ``Wildlife Services'' helps \n     agricultural producers manage nuisance wildlife problems;\n       (2) Wildlife Services personnel also manage nuisance \n     wildlife in non-agricultural settings, including urban areas;\n       (3) Congress granted the Secretary the authority to engage \n     in wildlife animal damage activities in the Act of March 2, \n     1932, and the Rural Development, Agriculture and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988;\n       (4) title I of the Rural Development, Agriculture and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988 expressly prohibits \n     the Secretary from performing ``urban rodent'' control but \n     does not define the term;\n       (5) There are more than 19,000 professional pest management \n     companies in the United\n\n[[Page S15678]]\n\n     States, a significant percentage of which manage nuisance \n     birds such as European starlings, house sparrows, and pigeons \n

market of the \n     United States;\n       (7) in areas where the private sector has the capacity to \n     provide nuisance wildlife services, the limited resources of \n     Wildlife Services would

cooperative agreement for wildlife damage management \n     activities, should inform cooperators of the availability of \n     and their right to acquire services from private service \n     providers;\n       (3) the Secretary of Agriculture should ensure that \n     Wildlife Services does not aggressively compete with the \n     private pest management industry for European starling, house \n     sparrow, and pigeon control work in urban areas where private \n     sector services are available;\n       (4) the Secretary of Agriculture should rely on scientific \n     and widely accepted definitions to define the term ``urban \n     rodent,'' as used in the Rural Development, Agriculture and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1988, in order to \n     clarify the express restrictions in that law on Wildlife \n     Services activities;\n       (5) The Secretary should direct Wildlife Services to work \n     with private industry, through a Memorandum of Understanding, \n     to delineate common areas of cooperation so that issues of \n     competition are addressed, taking into account the interests \n     of the wildlife resources and the need to

Madam President, I am pleased that we can take a break \nfrom the tired partisan sniping from the other side of the aisle to \ncontinue, as we have all year, making progress considering and \nconfirming the President's judicial nominations.\n  The complaints we hear more and more loudly as we approach an \nelection year from the President and others ring hollow. Last month, \nthe Judiciary Committee reached a milestone by reporting out 4 more \nnominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench, reaching 40 \nin this session of Congress alone. That exceeds the totals reported in \neach of the previous 2 years, when a Republican-led Judiciary Committee \nwas considering this President's nominees.\n  Today we consider the nomination of Joseph Normand Laplante, who has \nbeen nominated to fill a vacancy in the Northern District of Texas. \nJoseph is well known to many of us Vermonters as he has spent much of \nhis professional career working for our friends to the east in the old \nGranite State of New Hampshire and our friends to the south in the Bay \nState of Massachusetts. Joseph serves as the first assistant U.S. \nattorney for the District of New Hampshire. Before that, Joseph served \nas an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Massachusetts, a trial \nattorney for the U.S. Justice Department's Criminal Division, and a \nsenior assistant attorney general for the State of New Hampshire Office \nof the Attorney General. He also has experience as a private \npractitioner in New Hampshire. Joseph graduated from Georgetown \nUniversity in 1987 and from the Georgetown Law Center in 1990.\n  I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Sununu for their consideration of \nthis nomination and Senator Whitehouse for chairing the confirmation \nhearing.\n  When we confirm the nomination we consider today, the Senate will \nhave confirmed 38 nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal \nbench this session alone. That is more than the total number of \njudicial nominations that a Republican-led Senate confirmed in all of \n1997, 1999, 2004, 2005 or 2006 with a Republican Majority. It is 21 \nmore confirmations than were achieved during the entire 1996 session, \nmore than double that session's total of 17, when Republicans stalled \nconsideration of President Clinton's nominations.\n  When this nomination is confirmed, the Senate will have confirmed 138 \ntotal Federal judicial nominees in my tenure as Judiciary Chairman. \nDuring the Bush Presidency, more circuit judges, more district judges--\nmore total judges--were confirmed in the first 24 months that I served \nas Judiciary Chairman than during the 2-year tenures of either of the \ntwo Republican Chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts will list 45 judicial \nvacancies and 14 circuit court vacancies after today's confirmation. \nCompare that to the numbers at the end of the 109th Congress, when the \ntotal vacancies under a Republican controlled Judiciary Committee were \n51 judicial vacancies and 15 circuit court vacancies. That means that \ndespite the additional 5 vacancies that arose at the beginning of the \n110th Congress, the current vacancy totals under my chairmanship of the \nJudiciary Committee are below where they were under a Republican-led \nJudiciary Committee. They are only a little more than half of what they \nwere at the end of President Clinton's term, when Republican pocket \nfilibusters allowed judicial vacancies to rise to 80, 26 of them for \ncircuit courts.\n  Despite the progress we have made, I will continue to work to find \nnew ways to be productive on judicial nominations. Just last month, I \nsent the President a letter urging him to work with me, Senator \nSpecter, and home State Senators to send us more well-qualified, \nconsensus nominations. Now is the time for him to send us more \nnominations that could be considered and confirmed as his Presidency \napproaches its last year, before the Thurmond Rule kicks in.\n  As I noted in that letter, I have been concerned that several recent \nnominations seem to be part of an effort to pick political fights \nrather than judges to fill vacancies. For example, President Bush \nnominated Duncan Getchell to one of Virginia's Fourth Circuit Vacancies \nover the objections of Senator Webb, a Democrat, and Senator Warner, a \nRepublican. They had submitted a list of five recommended nominations, \nand specifically warned the White House not to nominate Mr. Getchell. \nAs a result, this nomination\n\n[[Page S15701]]\n\nthat is opposed by Democratic and Republican home state Senators is one \nthat cannot move.\n  When the President sends on well-qualified consensus nominations, we \ncan work together and continue to make progress as we are today.\n  I congratulate Joseph and his family on his confirmation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15701-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF THOMAS D. SCHROEDER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senate continues, as we have all \nyear, to make progress filling judicial vacancies by considering yet \nanother nomination reported out of Committee this month. The nomination \nbefore us today for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench is \nThomas D. Schroeder, to the Middle District of North Carolina. He has \nthe support of both home State Senators. I acknowledge the support of \nSenators Dole and Burr, and want to thank Senator Whitehouse for \nchairing the hearing on this nomination.\n  Last month, the Judiciary Committee reached a milestone by voting to \nreport our 40th judicial nominee this year. That exceeds the totals \nreported in each of the previous 2 years, when a Republican-led \nJudiciary Committee was considering this President's nominees.\n  Thomas D. Schroeder is a Partner at the Winston-Salem, NC, office of \nthe law firm of Womble, Carlyle, Sandridge & Price, PLLC, where he has \nworked almost his entire legal career. Mr. Schroeder served as a law \nclerk for Judge George E. MacKinnon on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe DC Circuit. He graduated from Kansas University and Notre Dame Law \nSchool, where he was Editor-in-Chief of the Notre Dame Law Review.\n  When we confirm the nomination we consider today, the Senate will \nhave confirmed 39 nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal \nbench this session alone. That exceeds the totals confirmed in all of \n2004, 2005, and 2006 when a Republican-led Senate was considering this \nPresident's nominees; all of 1989; all of 1993, when a Democratic-led \nSenate was considering President Clinton's nominees; all of 1997 and \n1999, when a Republican-led Senate was considering President Clinton's \nnominees; and all of 1996, when the Republican-led Senate did not \nconfirm a single one of President Clinton's circuit nominees.\n  When this nomination is confirmed, the Senate will have confirmed 139 \ntotal Federal judicial nominees in my tenure as Judiciary Chairman. \nDuring the Bush Presidency, more circuit judges, more district judges--\nmore total judges--were confirmed in the first 24 months that I served \nas Judiciary Chairman than during the 2-year tenures of either of the \ntwo Republican chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts will list 44 judicial \nvacancies and 14 circuit court vacancies after today's confirmations. \nCompare that to the numbers at the end of the 109th Congress, when the \ntotal vacancies under a Republican controlled Judiciary Committee were \n51 judicial vacancies and 15 circuit court vacancies. That means, that \ndespite the additional vacancies that arose at the beginning of the \n110th Congress and throughout this year, the current vacancy totals \nunder my chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee are below where they \nwere under a Republican led-Judiciary Committee. They are almost half \nof what they were at the end of President Clinton's term, when \nRepublican pocket filibusters allowed judicial vacancies to rise above \n100 before settling at 80. Twenty-six of them were for circuit courts.\n  When the President consults and sends the Senate well-qualified, \nconsensus nominations, we can work together and continue to make \nprogress as we are today.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15701-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration S. 2488.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Openness Promotes \n     Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007'' or the \n     ``OPEN Government Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Freedom of Information Act was signed into law on \n     July 4, 1966, because the American people believe that--\n       (A) our constitutional democracy, our system of self-\n     government, and our commitment to popular sovereignty depends \n     upon the consent of the governed;\n       (B) such consent is not meaningful unless it is informed \n     consent; and\n       (C) as Justice Black noted in his concurring opinion in \n     Barr v. Matteo (360 U.S. 564 (1959)), ``The effective \n     functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on \n     the force of an informed public opinion. This calls for the \n     widest possible understanding of the quality of government \n     service rendered by all elective or appointed public \n     officials or employees.'';\n       (2) the American people firmly believe that our system of \n     government must itself be governed by a presumption of \n     openness;\n       (3) the Freedom of Information Act establishes a ``strong \n     presumption in favor of disclosure'' as noted by the United \n     States Supreme Court in United States Department of State v. \n     Ray (502 U.S. 164 (1991)), a presumption that applies to all \n     agencies governed by that Act;\n       (4) ``disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of \n     the Act,'' as noted by the United States Supreme Court in \n     Department of Air Force v. Rose (425 U.S. 352 (1976));\n       (5) in practice, the Freedom of Information Act has not \n     always lived up to the ideals of that Act; and\n       (6) Congress should regularly review section 552 of title \n     5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of \n     Information Act), in order to determine whether further \n     changes and improvements are necessary to ensure that the \n     Government remains open and accessible to the American people \n     and is always based not upon the\n\n[[Page S15702]]\n\n     ``need to know'' but upon the fundamental ``right to know''.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF FEE STATUS FOR NEWS MEDIA.\n\n       Section 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``In this clause, the term `a representative of the news \n     media' means any person or entity that gathers information of \n     potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its \n     editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct \n     work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this \n     clause, the term `news' means information that is about \n     current events or that would be of current interest to the \n     public. Examples of news-media entities are television or \n     radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and \n     publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify \n     as disseminators of `news') who make their products available \n     for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to \n     the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. \n     Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, \n     the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers \n     through telecommunications services), such alternative media \n     shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance \n     journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media \n     entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for \n     expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the \n     journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication \n     contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; \n     the Government may also consider the past publication record \n     of the requester in making such a determination.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(E)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a complainant has \n     substantially prevailed if the complainant has obtained \n     relief through either--\n       ``(I) a judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement \n     or consent decree; or\n       ``(II) a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the \n     agency, if the complainant's claim is not insubstantial.''.\n       (b) Limitation.--Notwithstanding section 1304 of title 31, \n     United States Code, no amounts may be obligated or expended \n     from the Claims and Judgment Fund of the United States \n     Treasury to pay the costs resulting from fees assessed under \n     section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United States Code. Any such \n     amounts shall be paid only from funds annually appropriated \n     for any authorized purpose for the Federal agency against \n     which a claim or judgment has been rendered.\n\n     SEC. 5. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS FOR ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \n                   REJECTIONS OF REQUESTS.\n\n       Section 552(a)(4)(F) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(F)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) The Attorney General shall--\n       ``(I) notify the Special Counsel of each civil action \n     described under the first sentence of clause (i); and\n       ``(II) annually submit a report to Congress on the number \n     of such civil actions in the preceding year.\n       ``(iii) The Special Counsel shall annually submit a report \n     to Congress on the actions taken by the Special Counsel under \n     clause (i).''.\n\n     SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR AGENCIES TO ACT ON REQUESTS.\n\n       (a) Time Limits.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 552(a)(6)(A) of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended by inserting after clause (ii) the \n     following:\n       ``The 20-day period under clause (i) shall commence on the \n     date on which the request is first received by the \n     appropriate component of the agency, but in any event not \n     later than ten days after the request is first received by \n     any component of the agency that is designated in the \n     agency's regulations under this section to receive requests \n     under this section. The 20-day period shall not be tolled by \n     the agency except--\n       ``(I) that the agency may make one request to the requester \n     for information and toll the 20-day period while it is \n     awaiting such information that it has reasonably requested \n     from the requester under this section; or\n       ``(II) if necessary to clarify with the requester issues \n     regarding fee assessment. In either case, the agency's \n     receipt of the requester's response to the agency's request \n     for information or clarification ends the tolling period.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall take effect 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (b) Compliance With Time Limits.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Search fees.--Section 552(a)(4)(A) of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(viii) An agency shall not assess search fees (or in the \n     case of a requester described under clause (ii)(II), \n     duplication fees) under this subparagraph if the agency fails \n     to comply with any time limit under paragraph (6), if no \n     unusual or exceptional circumstances (as those terms are \n     defined for purposes of paragraphs (6)(B) and (C), \n     respectively) apply to the processing of the request.''.\n       (B) Public liaison.--Section 552(a)(6)(B)(ii) of title 5, \n     United States Code, is amended by inserting after the first \n     sentence the following: ``To aid the requester, each agency \n     shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall \n     assist in the resolution of any disputes between the \n     requester and the agency.''.\n       (2) Effective date and application.--The amendment made by \n     this subsection shall take effect 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and apply to requests for information \n     under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, filed on or \n     after that effective date.\n\n     SEC. 7.

Madam President, I am pleased that, once again, the Senate \nhas reaffirmed its bipartisan commitment to open and transparent \ngovernment by unanimously passing the Openness Promotes Effectiveness \nin our National Government Act, the ``OPEN Government Act--the first \nmajor reform to the Freedom of Information Act, ``FOIA'', in more than \na decade. I commend the bill's chief Republican cosponsor, Senator John \nCornyn, for his commitment and dedication to passing FOIA reform \nlegislation this year. I am also appreciative of the efforts of Senator \nJon Kyl for cosponsoring this bill and helping us to reach a compromise \non this legislation, so that the Senate could consider and pass \nmeaningful FOIA reform legislation this year.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed this historic FOIA reform \nlegislation, S. 849, before adjourning for the August recess. Now that \nthe Senate has unanimously passed a modified bill, to ensure that \n``pay/go'' and other concerns of the House are adequately addressed, I \nhope that the House will promptly enact this bill and send it to the \nPresident without further delay.\n  I have worked very hard to address the concerns of the House \nOversight and Government Reform Committee, to ensure that the Congress \ncan enact meaningful FOIA reform legislation this year. I commend \nCongressman Waxman, the distinguished Chairman of that Committee, for \nhis commitment to FOIA reform and I thank him and his staff for all of \ntheir hard work on this legislation.\n  The bill that the Senate passed today includes ``pay/go'' language \nthat has been requested by the House and it also eliminates a provision \non citations to FOIA exemptions in legislation that was in the previous \nbill. To accommodate other concerns of the House, the bill also \nincludes a new provision that requires Federal agencies to disclose the \nFOIA exemptions that they rely upon when redacting information from \ndocuments released under FOIA. In addition, the bill adds FOIA \nduplication fees for noncommercial requesters, including the media, to \nthe fee waiver penalty that will be imposed when an agency fails to \nmeet the 20-day statutory clock under FOIA. While I will continue to \nwork with the House and others to further strengthen this critical open \ngovernment law, I hope that the House will promptly take up the \nbipartisan FOIA compromise bill that we have been able to pass so that \nit may be signed into law before the end of the year.\n  As the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade, the OPEN \nGovernment Act will help to reverse the troubling trends of excessive \ndelays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help to restore \nthe public's trust in their government. This bill will also improve \ntransparency in the Federal Government's FOIA process by restoring \nmeaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA; imposing real \nconsequences on federal agencies for missing FOIA's 20-day statutory \ndeadline; clarifying that FOIA applies to Government records held by \noutside private\n\n[[Page S15704]]\n\ncontractors; establishing a FOIA hotline service for all Federal \nagencies; and creating a FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA requestors and, \nfederal agencies with a meaningful alternative to costly litigation.\n  Specifically, the OPEN Government Act will protect the public's right \nto know, by ensuring that anyone who gathers information to inform the \npublic, including freelance journalists and bloggers, may seek a fee \nwaiver when they request information under FOIA. The bill ensures that \nFederal agencies will not automatically exclude Internet blogs and \nother Web-based forms of media when deciding whether to waive FOIA \nfees. In addition, the bill also clarifies that the definition of news \nmedia, for purposes of FOIA fee waivers, includes free newspapers and \nindividuals performing a media function who do not necessarily have a \nprior history of publication.\n  The bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action, by \nensuring that the 20-day statutory clock under FOIA starts when a \nrequest is received by the appropriate component of the agency and \nrequiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests to the appropriate \nagency component within 10 days of the receipt of such requests. To \nensure accuracy in FOIA responses, the bill allows federal agencies to \ntoll the 20-day clock while they are awaiting a response to a \nreasonable request for information from a FOIA requester on one \noccasion, or while the agency is awaiting clarification regarding a \nFOIA fee assessment. In addition, to encourage agencies to meet the 20-\nday time limit the bill requires that an agency refund FOIA search \nfees--and duplication fees for noncommercial requestors--if it fails to \nmeet the 20-day deadline, except in the case of exceptional \ncircumstances as defined by the FOIA statute.\n  The bill also addresses a relatively new concern that, under current \nlaw, Federal agencies have an incentive to delay compliance with FOIA \nrequests until just before a court decision is made that is favorable \nto a FOIA requestor. The Supreme Court's decision in Buckhannon Board \nand Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health and \nHuman Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 2001, eliminated the ``catalyst theory'' \nfor attorneys' fees recovery under certain federal civil rights laws. \nWhen applied to FOIA cases, Buckhannon precludes FOIA requesters from \never being eligible to recover attorneys fees under circumstances where \nan agency provides the records requested in the litigation just prior \nto a court decision that would have been favorable to the FOIA \nrequestor. The bill clarifies that Buckhannon does not apply to FOIA \ncases. Under the bill, a FOIA requester can obtain attorneys' fees when \nhe or she files a lawsuit to obtain records from the Government and the \nGovernment releases those records before the court orders them to do \nso. But, this provision would not allow the requester to recover \nattorneys' fees if the requester's claim is wholly insubstantial. To \naddress House ``pay/go'' concerns, the bill also requires that any \nattorneys'' fees assessed under this provision be paid from any \nannually appropriated agency funds.\n\n  To address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA litigation, the \nbill also creates an Office of Government Information Services in the \nNational Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate agency-level FOIA \ndisputes. In addition the bill ensures that each federal agency will \nappoint a Chief FOIA Officer, who will monitor the agency's compliance \nwith FOIA requests, and a FOIA Public Liaison who will be available to \nresolve FOIA related disputes.\n  Finally, the bill does several things to enhance the agency reporting \nand tracking requirements under FOIA. The bill creates a tracking \nsystem for FOIA requests to assist members of the public and the media. \nThe bill also establishes a FOIA hotline service for all Federal \nagencies, either by telephone or on the Internet, to enable requestors \nto track the status of their FOIA requests. The bill also clarifies \nthat FOIA applies to agency records that are held by outside private \ncontractors, no matter where these records are located.\n  The Freedom of Information Act is an essential tool to ensure that \nall Americans can access information about the workings of their \ngovernment. But, after four decades, this open government law needs to \nbe strengthened. I am pleased that the reforms contained in the OPEN \nGovernment Act will ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated--so that it works \nmore effectively for the American people.\n  Again, I commend Senators Cornyn and Kyl and the many other \ncosponsors of this legislation for their dedication to open government. \nBut, most importantly, I especially want to thank the many concerned \ncitizens who, knowing the importance of this measure to the American \npeople's right to know, have demanded action on this bill. This bill is \nendorsed by more than 115 business, public interest, and news \norganizations from across the political and ideological spectrum, \nincluding the American Library Association, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, OpenTheGovemment.org, Public Citizen, the Republican Liberty \nCaucus, the Sunshine in Government Initiative and the Vermont Press \nAssociation. The invaluable support of these and many other \norganizations is what led the opponents of this bill to come around and \nsupport this legislation.\n  By passing this important FOIA reform legislation, the Senate has \nreaffirmed the principle that open government is not a Democratic issue \nor a Republican issue. But, rather, it is an American issue and an \nAmerican value. I strongly encourage the House of Representatives, \nwhich overwhelmingly passed a similar measure earlier this year, to \npromptly take up and enact this bill before adjourning for the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/14/senate-section/article/S15704-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15704-S15705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RELATIVE TO THE HANGING OF NOOSES FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTIMIDATION\n\n  Mr. REID.
