Senator Dorgan, though, under an order entered last night, may \nspeak for up to 30 minutes.\n  We all know this has been a long, hard week. We have had numerous \nvotes. I express my appreciation for staff who have worked so hard all \nweek--2 days in a row, and then last night we ended sometime this \nmorning. So I appreciate very much the hard work of all the very loyal, \ndedicated staff.\n  There will be no rollcall votes today.\n  Next week, I am happy to report and recognize we will have a lot to \ndo. Monday we are going to work on another education measure, a higher \neducation measure. There is an order that has been entered which \nprovides for the possibility--I say possibility--of 12 first-degree \namendments, and, of course, second-degree amendments. But this all must \nbe completed within 8 hours. First-degree amendments will be limited to \n30 minutes, and second-degree amendments will be limited to 15 minutes, \nso we are going to, hopefully, conclude this matter on Monday. If all \nthe amendments are not offered, it would, of course, shorten the time.\n  The two managers are Senators Kennedy and Enzi, who did such a good \njob on the bill yesterday, until they lost control of it with the rules \nwe have here, which I hope--I see my friend in the Chamber, the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Utah. I hope as one of the key \nmembers of the Rules Committee--being the ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee--he and Senator Feinstein will look at a way we can change \nthese rules. What went on last night was ridiculous. There is no way to \nstop that unless the rules are changed, and we should change those \nrules. I think it can be done with the Rules Committee. We have to take \na look at that. It did not help anybody.\n  But, anyway, that is what happened. But it is not going to be that \nway on this matter on Monday. As I said, Senators Kennedy and Enzi \nmanaged the bill very well, until it ran into the rule we have that \nallows unending amendments on any subject forever, literally, before \nyou get to final passage.\n  So we will have multiple votes starting at about 5:15 on Monday. \nMembers should plan accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/20/senate-section/article/S9646-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9646]]\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 980\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, after all the fireworks and contention on \nsome previous issues this week, I rise to speak about something that \nhas very little interest to most Americans but tremendous interest, I \nbelieve, to a certain portion of our economy. I want to use this \nopportunity to call it to the attention of the Senate.\n  I am talking about a practice that occurs in the stock market that \nhas the very interesting name of naked short selling. That conjures up \nall kinds of interesting images in many people's minds, but this is \nwhat it is: It is a practice where somebody sells short a particular \nstock and never ever has to cover the sale.\n  Now, even that may be too much stock-market-type jargon for people to \nunderstand what I am talking about. So let me quote from an article \nthat appeared in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Quoting from the article, it says:\n\n       The naked [short selling] debate is a product of the \n     revolution that has occurred in stock trading over the past \n     40 years. Up to the 1960s, trading involved hundreds of \n     messengers crisscrossing lower Manhattan with bags of stock \n     certificates and checks. As trading volume hit 15 million \n     shares daily, the New York Stock Exchange had to close for \n     part of each week to clear the paperwork backlog.\n\n  As an insert in the quotation, I remember those days. I was trading \nin the stock market at the time, and having the market shut down to \nclear the back office paperwork was not an unusual experience. Going \nback to the article:\n\n       That led to the creation of DTCC--\n\n  Those are initials for the Depository Trust and Clearing \nCorporation--\n\n       which is regulated by the SEC.\n\n  If I might, as an aside, I do not think that last statement is true. \nI am not sure that the SEC has control over the DTCC.\n\n       Almost all stock is now kept at the company's central \n     depository and never leaves there. Instead, a stock buyer's \n     brokerage account is electronically credited with a \n     ``securities entitlement.'' This electronic credit can, in \n     turn, be sold to someone else.\n       Replacing paper with electrons has allowed stock-trading \n     volume to rise to billions of shares daily. The cost of \n     buying or selling stock has fallen to less than 3.5 cents a \n     share, a tenth of paper-era costs.\n       But to keep trading moving at this pace, the system can \n     provide cover for naked shorting, critics argue. If the stock \n     in a given transaction isn't delivered in the 3-day period, \n     the buyer, who paid his money, is routinely given electronic \n     credit for the stock. While the SEC calls for delivery in \n     three days, the agency has no mechanism to enforce that \n     guideline.\n\n  This is where the practice of naked short selling comes in. I did not \nreally understand it until I had some investment bankers--not the kind \nyou find on Wall Street but the more modest kind you find in Salt Lake \nCity--sit me down in front of a screen and show me what happens with \nstock trading. To put it in the simplest terms, someone who wants to \nsell short--that is, sell stock he does not own--will place a sale \norder.\n  Now, when I first sold short as a participant in the market, my \nbroker gave me this crude little poem to remember. He said: ``He who \nsells what isn't his'n, must buy it back or go to prison.'' He said: \nYou have to understand, if you sell a stock short, the time is going to \ncome when you are going to have to buy it back to cover that sale by \ndelivering shares. In the days the Wall Street Journal talked about, \nthat meant buying a crinkly piece of paper--a stock certificate--and \ndelivering it so you have covered your short sale.\n  Today, that is not the case because all of the stock certificates are \ngone, and the crinkly pieces of paper have been replaced by electronic \nimpulses in a computer. So this is what happens. A short seller enters \nthe market and says: I want to short--I want to sell--1,000 shares of \nXYZ stock. That means at some point he has to produce 1,000 shares to \ncover his sale. How do you do that? You borrow the shares, and then you \nbuy them back at some future time.\n  All right. From whom do you borrow them? The DTCC. They have all the \nshares on deposit, and so you go to the DTCC and you say: I want to \nborrow 1,000 shares of XYZ stock. They say: Fine, we have them on \ndeposit. We will lend them to you so you can use them for your short \nsale.\n  All right, everything is fine--except in this electronic age, it is \npossible for you to keep shuffling around the electronic impulses that \nrepresent the stock and never ever have to buy it back.\n  Stop and think about that. That is a pretty good business plan. You \ncan sell as much as you want and never ever have to pay for it. If a \nstock is trading at $5 a share, you could go in and sell 1,000 shares, \nand you get paid $5,000 for selling 1,000 shares, and you never have to \nbuy them. Because you are constantly moving around the electronic \nimpulses that represent those shares, you never have to cover.\n  Now, when you talk to the DTCC people, they say: No, we always make \nsure there is a delivery. And if there is not, it is not our fault. It \nis not our responsibility to police this. It is up to the brokerage \nhouses to do this.\n  The SEC has spent enough time looking at this and enough time talking \nto me that they issued to me a three-page letter outlining the steps \nthey have taken to stop the practice of naked short selling.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letter be included \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. I think the SEC letter goes a long way--the SEC actions \ngo a long way. Without getting too technical about it, they have taken \na number of steps to prevent what are called ``fails to deliver'' and, \ntherefore, to try to stop the naked short-selling situation.\n  But I have discovered something that appears to be a way around the \nSEC rules. Here is the transaction: Broker A shorts 1,000 shares. At \nthe end of 13 days, which is the period he has to produce the shares, \nhe has been unable to find any--probably hasn't even looked--but he has \nthis requirement under the SEC rule to produce 1,000 shares. So he goes \nto broker B and says quietly: Sell me a thousand shares. Broker B says: \nI don't have any. Broker A says: It doesn't matter, sell me a thousand \nshares so I can cover. Broker B: All right. I will sell you a thousand \nshares so you can cover and there will be no passage of money; this is \na deal between the two of us--a rollover. At the end of 13 days, broker \nB has to deliver a thousand shares, so broker A\n\n[[Page S9647]]\n\nsells the same 1,000 phantom shares back to broker B, and they ping-\npong these back and forth for as long as they want.\n  So you can have a situation where people are selling shares that \ndon't exist, taking commissions on the sale, and the profits of the \nsale, and never, ever having to produce the shares.\n  I think it is serious enough that we ought to have a hearing about \nthis in the Banking Committee. I have spoken to the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator Dodd, and asked him if it wouldn't be \npossible for us to have such a hearing at some point in the future. He \nhas expressed a willingness to do that. I understand we can't set a \ntime for that right now; there are too many other things going on in \nthe Banking Committee. But I am delighted to know he is willing to \ncooperate with us in examining this issue.\n  I would like to suggest several things I would like to discuss at \nthat hearing. First, by the way, I want the officials of the DTCC to \nhave the opportunity to come in and explain how it works. I have seen \nletters to the editor in the Wall Street Journal, where they say this \narticle is inaccurate, and I don't want to be relying on this article \nif it is inaccurate. I think a congressional hearing is a good place \nfor those who are running the DTCC to explain to us how it works. I \nwould like the SEC to come in and give us their background and \ninformation as to how their rules are working to try to stop the naked \nshort selling. But I have these two additional recommendations that I \nwould hope we could get done by regulation and, if not, I am prepared \nto introduce legislation to deal with them.\n  First, I think there should be a rule which says there cannot be \nborrowing, that brokers cannot borrow for short sales more stock than \nis on deposit with the DTCC. I think that is obvious. If there are 3 \nmillion shares of XYZ Company on deposit at the DTCC, people should not \nbe able to short sell 4 million shares. I have seen the situation where \npeople with these small companies--and all this happens primarily in \nlittle companies--people with small companies, in an effort to defend \ntheir stock against the short sales that are rolling over, are buying \nstock, and it is electronically credited to them and end up on paper, \nor at least on computer, owning more shares than exist. How can that \nbe? If somebody buys the stock for his company and ends up owning 110 \npercent of the issued stock, and people are still selling that stock, \nyou know you are dealing with phantom shares.\n  So my first recommendation would be that the DTCC cannot make \navailable as loans for short sellers more stock than they have on \ndeposit. Once they have reached the point that 100 percent of the \nshares they have on deposit have been loaned out, they can't loan out \nany more. I think that is an obvious commonsense recommendation, but it \ndoesn't apply now.\n  Secondly, I think there ought to be a rule which says a broker cannot \nbe paid a commission on a short sale until the shares are delivered. \nBack to the business model. The broker sells $5,000 worth of stock. He \ncan do it every day. He can get $5,000 every day, without ever having \nto cover the stock, and he gets a commission on making the sale. So if \nyou say, no, there will be no commissions paid until the stock is \ndelivered, you will have a significant impact on stopping this \nactivity.\n  Now, people who hear the complaints about naked short selling say: It \nonly represents a tiny percentage of the trillions of dollars' worth of \ntrading activity that goes on in American markets every day. They are \nright. It is only a tiny percentage. But that is small comfort to those \nwho have gotten a few dollars together, formed a business, gone to the \nmarket to try to raise some capital to support the business, put on the \nmarketplace, say, 25 percent of their shares, holding the other 75 \npercent for themselves, and then getting some support in the market so \nthat the shares edge up from 25 cents to 50 cents to $1, to $1.25 and \nthen suddenly see the short sellers come in and say: OK, we will drive \nthat stock back down from $1.25 to 2.5 cents, and we will do it by \nselling stock that doesn't exist and in the process we will ruin the \ncompany.\n  The one thing that convinced me this was real was when the investment \nbankers sat me down in front of a screen and showed me the stock \ntrading of a company that has been out of business for 3 years, and the \nstock trades regularly, every 13 days. You know exactly what they are \ndoing. The brokers are rolling the stock back and forth every 13 days, \nso they are meeting the SEC requirements--they are delivering--but the \nshares they are delivering to each other back and forth do not exist. \nThe company was driven out of business by the short sellers who made it \nimpossible for them to go to the capital markets.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, this is a tiny matter. It does not \ninvolve very many people, but to the people who are involved, it, \nfrankly, can be a matter of life and death. There are enough of them \nstarting businesses and creating entrepreneurial activity in the United \nStates that we owe it to them to find out exactly what is going on with \nrespect to this activity. That is why I have asked Chairman Dodd to \nconsider a hearing on this matter to let us hear from the SEC, to let \nus hear from the DTCC, and to let us hear from those in the marketplace \nwho have actual experience and see if the present SEC rules are \nsufficient or if we need to do additional things along the lines of the \ntwo items I have suggested.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 5, 2007]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       Blame the ``Stock Vault''?\n\n\n Clearinghouse Faulted On Short-Selling Abuse; Finding the Naked Truth\n\n               (By John R. Emshwiller and Kara Scannell)\n\n       Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known \n     institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly \n     straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure \n     delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers.\n       About 99% of the time, trades are completed without \n     incident. But about 1% of the shares valued at about $2.5 \n     billion on a given a day--aren't delivered to the buyer \n     within--the requisite three days, for one reason or another.\n       These ``failures to deliver'' have put DTCC in the middle \n     of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors \n     are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices.\n       At issue is a nefarious twist on short-selling, a \n     legitimate practice that involves trying to profit on a \n     stock's falling price by selling borrowed shares in hopes of \n     later replacing them with cheaper ones. The twist is known as \n     ``naked shorting''--selling shares without borrowing them.\n       Illegal except in limited circumstances, naked shorting can \n     drive down a stock's price by effectively increasing the \n     supply of shares for the period, some people argue.\n       There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. \n     The fight is over how prevalent the problem is--and the \n     extent to which DTCC is responsible. Some companies with \n     falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the \n     keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say \n     it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked \n     shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate \n     efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last \n     month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding \n     when stock has to be delivered after a sale, But some critics \n     argue: the SEC still hasn't done enough.\n       The controversy has put an unaccustomed spotlight on DTCC. \n     Several companies have filed suit against DTCC regarding \n     delivery failure. DTCC officials say the attacks are \n     unfounded and being orchestrated by a small group of \n     plaintiffs' lawyers and corporate executives looking to make \n     money from lawsuits and draw attention away from problems at \n     their companies.\n\n\n                             historic roots\n\n       The naked-shorting debate is a product of the revolution \n     that has occurred in stock trading over the past 40 years.

While the SEC calls for delivery in three days, the \n     agency has no mechanism to enforce that guideline.\n\n\n                           ``phantom stock''\n\n       Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until \n     that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional \n     shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading \n     system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's \n     account, critics say. This ``phantom stock'' can put downward \n     pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply.\n       DTCC officials counter that for each undelivered share \n     there is a corresponding obligation created to deliver stock, \n     which keeps the system in balance. They also say that 80% of \n     the delivery failures are resolved within two business weeks.\n       There are legitimate reasons for delivery failures, \n     including simple clerical errors. But one illegitimate reason \n     is naked shorting by traders looking to drive down a stock's \n     price.\n       Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-\n     shorting problem.\n\n\n                             denver lawsuit\n\n       In a lawsuit filed in Nevada state court, Denver-based \n     Nanopierce Technologies Inc. contended that DTCC allowed \n     ``sellers to maintain significant open fail to deliver'' \n     positions of millions of shares of the semiconductor \n     company's stock for extended periods, which helped push down \n     Nanopierce's shares by more than 50%. The small company, \n     which is now called Vyta Corp., trades on the electronic OTC \n     Bulletin Board market. In recent trading, the stock has \n     traded around 40 cents. A Nevada state court judge dismissed \n     the suit, which prompted an appeal by the company.\n       DTCC says the roughly dozen other cases against it have \n     almost all been dismissed or not pursued by the plaintiffs.\n       Nanopierce garnered support from the North American \n     Securities Administrators Association, which represents state \n     stock regulators. The group filed a brief arguing that if the \n     company's claims were correct, its shareholders ``have been \n     the victims of fraud and manipulation at the hands of the \n     very entities that should be serving their interest.''\n\n\n                             dtcc's defense\n\n       DTCC General Counsel Larry Thompson calls the Nanopierce \n     claims ``pure invention.'' DTCC officials say the main \n     responsibility for resolving delivery failures lies with \n     the brokerage firms. DTCC nets the brokerage firms' \n     positions but it is the brokerages that manage their \n     individual client accounts and know which client failed to \n     deliver their stock.\n       DTCC officials say that Nanopierce had internal business \n     problems--including heavy losses--to explain its stock-price \n     drop. DTCC received support in the suit from the SEC, which \n     filed a brief defending the trade-processing system and \n     arguing that federal regulation pre-empted state-court \n     review.\n       In January 2005, the SEC made an initial swipe at the \n     naked-shorting problem by requiring that if delivery failures \n     in a particular stock reached a high enough level, many of \n     those failures would have to be resolved within 13 business \n     days. But some failures weren't covered by the rule. The SEC \n     action in June aimed to cover those remaining delivery \n     failures. Naked shorting could ``undermine the confidence of \n     investors'' in the stock market, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox \n     says.\n       However, it doesn't seem likely that the SEC's latest move \n     will end the debate that has been raging in the market for \n     years. While lauding the SEC action, critics are questioning \n     whether it is sufficient. The SEC still hasn't taken all the \n     steps necessary to ensure ``a free and transparent market'' \n     as required under federal securities laws, says James W. \n     Christian, a Houston attorney who represents several \n     companies that claim to have been damaged by naked shorting.\n       Among other things, authorities need to make public much \n     more trading data related to stock-delivery failures, he \n     says.\n       Critics contend that DTCC and the SEC have been too \n     secretive with delivery-failure data, depriving the public of \n     important information about where naked shorting might be \n     taking place. Currently, DTCC's delivery-failure data can \n     only be obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request \n     to the SEC, which has released some statistics that are \n     generally two months old.\n       In light of the controversy, DTCC has proposed making more \n     information available and the SEC says it is looking at \n     releasing aggregate delivery-failure data on a quarterly \n     basis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n       This memorandum has been compiled by the staff of the SEC. \n     This document has not been approved by the Commission and \n     does not necessarily represent the Commission's views.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Mike Nielsen, Office of Senator Robert F.

Introduction\n\n       During our meeting on June 20, 2007 regarding various short \n     sale-related items, Senator Bennett requested that we prepare \n     a memorandum outlining initiatives taken by the Commission \n     and staff of the Commission's Division of Market Regulation \n     (``Division Staff') that we discussed during the meeting. \n     Accordingly, this memorandum discusses: (a) remarks by \n     Chairman Cox at the June 13 Open Commission Meeting regarding \n     rulemaking related to abusive ``naked'' short selling, (b) \n     the expansion of short interest reporting requirements to \n     over-the-counter (``OTC'') equity securities and the \n     increased frequency of short interest reporting, (c) public \n     disclosure by the Commission of fails to deliver data, (d) \n     proposed amendments to eliminate the options market maker \n     exception to the close-out requirements of Rule 203(b)(3) of \n     Regulation SHO, (e) amendments to Rule 105 of Regulation M, \n     and (f) examinations by self-regulatory organization \n     (``SRO'') and Commission staff to ensure that options market \n     makers are complying with the close-out requirements of \n     203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO.\n       After you have reviewed the below information, please let \n     us know if there is any additional information you would like \n     us to provide.\n\n\n                             II. Discussion\n\n     A. Remarks by Chairman Cox at the June 13 Open Commission \n         Meeting\n       On June 13, 2007 at an Open Commission Meeting at which the \n     Commission considered recommendations by Division Staff \n     related to short selling, Chairman Cox stated that he had ``. \n     . . asked the staff to examine whether the market would \n     benefit from further rulemaking specifically designed to \n     correct the practice of abusive naked short selling. Such a \n     rule holds the potential of streamlining the prosecution of \n     this form of market manipulation and, if today's measures \n     leave any doubt, would direct still more Commission power \n     to stamping out such abuses. With its recommendation, the \n     staff should report the level of fails pre- and post-\n     adoption of the rules we consider today so we can assess \n     their effectiveness.''\n       Pursuant to Chairman Cox's request, Division Staff is \n     currently examining whether or not the market would benefit \n     from such further rulemaking.\n     B. Short Interest Reporting\n       On February 3, 2006 the Commission approved an NASD rule \n     proposal to amend NASD Rule 3360 to expand monthly short \n     interest reporting to OTC equity securities. The approval \n     order is available on the Commission's website at http://\nwww.sec.gov/rules/sro/nasd.shtml, or in the Federal Register \n     at 71 FR 7101.\n       Recently, on March 6, 2007 the Commission approved rule \n     proposals by the NASD, New York Stock Exchange LLC, and the \n     American Stock Exchange LLC to increase the frequency of \n     short interest reporting requirements from monthly to twice \n     per month. The SROs requested, and the Commission approved, \n     an implementation date of 180 days following Commission \n     approval to allow firms sufficient time to make any necessary \n     systems changes to comply with the new reporting \n     requirements. The approval order is available on the \n     Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nasd/\n2007/34-55406.pdf, or in the Federal Register at 72 FR 4756.\n     C. Public Disclosure of fails to Deliver Data\n       In response to requests from the public that the Commission \n     has received regarding disclosure of fails to deliver data, \n     including inquiries from various members of Congress, the \n     Commission is considering whether to post on its website \n     aggregate fails to deliver data that the Commission's Office \n     of Economic Analysis receives from the Depository Trust and \n     Clearing Corp. The data would not include confidential broker \n     information and would likely be on a delayed basis.\n     D. Proposed Amendments to Eliminate the Options Market Maker \n         Exception\n       On July 14, 2006, the Commission published proposed \n     amendments to limit the duration of the options market maker \n     exception to the close-out requirements of Rule 203(b)(3) of \n     Regulation SHO. The Commission proposed to narrow the options \n     market maker exception in Regulation SHO because it is \n     concerned about large and persistent fails to deliver in \n     threshold securities attributable, in part, to the options \n     market maker exception, and concerns that such fails to \n     deliver might have a negative effect on the market in these \n     securities.\n       Based, in part, on commenters' concerns that they would be \n     unable to comply with the amendments to the options market \n     maker exception as proposed in the 2006 Proposing Release, \n     and statements indicating that options market makers might be \n     violating the current exception, on June 13, 2007, the \n     Commission approved re-proposed amendments to the options \n     market maker exception that would eliminate that exception to \n     the close-out requirements of Regulation SHO. In addition, \n     the proposed amendments seek comment on two alternative \n     proposals to elimination of the options market maker \n     exception that would provide a narrow options market maker \n     exception that would require excepted fails to deliver to be \n     closed out within specific time-frames.\n       The proposing release has not yet been published on the \n     Commission's website or in the Federal Register. We \n     anticipate that the\n\n[[Page S9649]]\n\n     release will be publicly available within the next few weeks. \n     The Commission approved a shortened comment period of 30 days \n     from publication of the release in the Federal Register.\n     E. Amendments to Rule 105 of Regulation M\n       Rule 105 governs short selling in connection with a public \n     offering. It is a prophylactic anti-manipulation rule that \n     promotes a market environment that is free from manipulative \n     influences around the time that offerings are priced. The \n     rule fosters pricing integrity by prohibiting activity that \n     interferes with independent market dynamics prior to pricing \n     offerings, by persons with a heightened incentive to \n     manipulate.\n       The current rule prohibits persons from covering a short \n     sale with offering securities if the short sale occurred \n     during a defined restricted period (usually five days) prior \n     to pricing. The Commission is aware of strategies to conceal \n     the prohibited covering and persistent noncompliance with the \n     rule. Thus, in December 2006, the Commission proposed \n     amendments that would have prohibited a person selling short \n     during the Rule 105 restricted period from purchasing \n     securities in the offering.\n       On June 20, 2007 the Commission approved amendments that \n     would generally make it unlawful for a person to purchase in \n     an offering covered by Rule 105 if the person sold short \n     during the restricted period unless they made a bona fide \n     pre-pricing purchase meeting certain conditions. The \n     amendments will be effective 30 days from the date of \n     publication of the release in the Federal Register.\n     F. Options Market Makers and the Close-Out Requirement of \n         Regulation SHO\n       As we discussed in more detail during our meeting, SRO and \n     Commission staff are currently examining options market \n     makers for compliance with the close-out requirements of Rule \n     203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO.\n       Should you have additional questions, please do not \n     hesitate to contact Matt Shimkus in our Office of Legislative \n     and Intergovernmental Affairs at (202) 551-2010.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/20/senate-section/article/S9649-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9649-S9651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on Wednesday morning of this week, \nfollowing a discussion and debate--and we had a fairly robust debate--\nabout the issue of Iraq and the war in Iraq, on Wednesday morning of \nthis week, the President's Homeland Security Adviser, Frances Townsend, \nwas on the ABC ``Good Morning America'' program, and she said some \nthings about al-Qaida, about terrorists, that reminded me of a period \nseveral years ago, prior to the start of the Iraq war. It reminded me \nof being in a room where top secret, classified briefings are given to \nMembers of Congress--briefings by the now Secretary of State, briefings \nby the Vice President, briefings by the head of the CIA. Condoleezza \nRice, Mr. Tenet, Vice President Cheney, and others participated in \nthese top secret briefings.\n  They told us things in those top secret briefings leading up to the \ndecision about the authorization to use force against Iraq. They told \nus things we now know not to have been true.\n  Did they know that when they told us? I don't know. We now know, of \ncourse, that their claim that Saddam Hussein was trying to acquire \nyellow cake from Niger for nuclear weapons was bogus. Their claim that \nhe was acquiring aluminum tubes to reconstitute a nuclear threat was \nnot accurate. Their claim that he had mobile chemical weapons labs was \nnot accurate.\n  By the way, on that one, it only had a single source, a man we later \nlearned who had the code name of ``Curve Ball.'' We also later learned \nthat he was a fabricator and an alcoholic. Their claim was based on a \nsingle source we now discover to have been a fabricator. He was a \nformer taxicab driver, for God's sake, in Baghdad. A single source gave \nrise to the description to the world and to this Congress in top \nsecret, classified briefings that there were mobile chemical weapons \nlaboratories in Iraq.\n  The list of baseless or unsupported claims goes on. The \nreconstitution of nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction, \nconnections with al-Qaida, we now know, of course, the facts were at \nodds with what we were being told about these and the other claims they \nused to support going to war.\n  The reason I mention this is that at Wednesday's appearance by the \nPresident's Homeland Security Adviser, Frances Townsend, on the morning \nshow on ABC, reminded me a bit of what we experienced several years ago \nfrom this administration. A description by Frances Townsend about \nterrorism and the terrorist threat and al-Qaida is completely, and was \ncompletely, at odds with what we know to be the truth.\n  Let me go through a bit of what the President's Homeland Security \nAdviser said when she was being interviewed about the National \nIntelligence Report issued this week.\n  First, the report said al-Qaida is rebuilding, retraining, and \ngetting ready to strike in the United States again. In light of that \nreport, Ms. Townsend was asked if she still believed the United States \nis winning the war against al-Qaida and terrorism. ``Absolutely,'' she \nsaid. ``Absolutely, we are winning.''\n  She was asked about Pakistan and, specifically, about allowing al-\nQaida to have a safe haven in the country of Pakistan. She said: Well, \nit is a sovereign country, and the President of Pakistan has been a \ngood partner in our war against terrorism.\n  When asked, she said: The United States is ``safer'' today against \nal-Qaida because, she said: ``We have challenged them and we are on the \noffensive and the game is overseas.''\n  It is almost as if the President and his top homeland security \nadviser failed to read the National Intelligence Estimate. It made \nclear that al-Qaida is rebuilding its operational capacity and \nterrorism is the number one threat to our homeland. Those are the \nfacts. That's reality.\n  But even if she failed to read the NIE, perhaps she could have been \nexpected to read the newspapers, because they too have made it clear \nfor a long time that al-Qaida is rebuilding and that the terrorists are \ngetting ready to strike us again.\n  Let me go through a couple of examples.\n  On July 16, if one was reading in recent days, one would read an \narticle by Joshua Partlow in the Washington Post. It said sectarian \nviolence, a civil war, was the war in Iraq, not al-Qaida. It spelled \nthis out with facts:\n\n       The western Baghdad district of west Rashid confounds the \n     prevailing narrative from the top U.S. military officials \n     that the Sunni insurgent group al-Qaida in Iraq is the city's \n     most formidable and disruptive force. Over the past several \n     months, the [Shiite] Mahdi Army has transformed the \n     composition of the district's neighborhoods by ruthlessly \n     killing and driving out Sunnis and denying basic services to \n     residents who remain.\n\n  Pretty clear. Shiite and Sunni violence, not al-Qaida.\n  One might have read the newspaper reports on June 26, in the \nMcClatchy papers:\n\n       While the U.S. presses its war against insurgents linked to \n     al-Qaida in Iraq, Osama bin Laden's group is recruiting, \n     regrouping, and rebuilding in a new sanctuary along the \n     border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, senior military \n     intelligence and law enforcement officials said. The threat \n     from radical Islamic enclaves in Waziristan is more dangerous \n     than that from Iraq, which President Bush and his aides \n     called the ``central front'' of the war on terrorism, said \n     some current and former U.S. officials and experts. Bin Laden \n     himself is believed to be hiding in the region, guiding a new \n     generation of lieutenants and inspiring allied extremist \n     groups in Iraq and other parts of the world.\n\n  That is unbelievable. Al-Qaida is alive and well in Pakistan and \nAfghanistan. Let me say that again: It is ``recruiting, regrouping and \nrebuilding'' in this area. And bin Laden himself is believed to be \nhiding there, in that sanctuary. This is not Iraq, Mr. President. Did \nthe President or his homeland security advisor read this article?\n  Or perhaps one could go back to a New York Times article in February \nentitled ``Senior leaders of al-Qaida operating from Pakistan.''\n\n       Over the past year terrorists have set up a band of \n     training camps in the tribal regions near the Afghan border, \n     according to American intelligence and counterterrorism \n     officials. American officials said there is mounting evidence \n     that Osama bin Laden and his deputy, al-Zawahiri, have been \n     steadily building an operations hub in the mountainous \n     Pakistani tribal area of north Waziristan.\n\n  Bin Laden and al-Qaida are ``steadily building an operations hub'' in \nPakistan is the report.\n  Now, to the adviser to the President in the White House on terrorism \nissues, let me say this to her: August 2001, the Presidential Daily \nBriefing Report put in the hands of President George W. Bush one month \nbefore the attacks of September 11, the title was: ``Bin Laden \nDetermined to Strike in U.S.''\n  That was in August of 2001, the PDB, put in the President's hands.\n  What was the report in July 2007? The intelligence assessment from \nthe\n\n[[Page S9650]]\n\nU.S. National Counterterrorism Center in July 2007 says this: ``al-\nQaida better positioned to strike the West.''\n  Think of that. Six years have intervened--6 years. And the \nPresident's Homeland Security Adviser, one who deals with this issue of \nterrorism and counterterrorism, says that we are ``winning'' the war on \nterrorism; things are going just fine; things are better. Yet, in 6 \nyears, we go from this Presidential daily briefing entitled ``Bin Laden \nDetermined to Strike in United States'' in August of 2001 to this \nassessment 6 years later: ``Al-Qaida Better Positioned to Strike the \nWest.''\n  I ask the question: Are we really winning? I think we would expect \nthe Homeland Security Adviser to be dealing with facts.\n  Let me describe the facts as stated by the National Intelligence \nEstimate. The National Intelligence Estimate was released in both a \nclassified and unclassified version. The unclassified version says:\n\n       Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the homeland. . . .\n\n  It went on to say:\n\n       We assess the group has protected or regenerated key \n     elements of its homeland attack capability, including: a safe \n     haven in the Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas, \n     operational lieutenants, and its top leadership.\n\n  Now we have a report that says Osama bin Laden and his top deputies \nare in a safe haven. Six years after they murdered thousands of \nAmericans, they are in a safe haven.\n  There ought not be 1 square inch of ground on this planet that ought \nto be a safe haven for the leaders of al-Qaida. Ms. Townsend says, when \nasked about it, ``Well, Pakistan is a sovereign country.''\n  What does that mean? Therefore, a safe haven for al-Qaida and bin \nLaden must be all right? No. Absolutely not. There is no sovereignty \nanywhere in this world for Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and the al-\nQaida leadership. There ought not be safe harbor or safe haven or \nsovereignty anywhere in this world for them.\n  What have we done? Instead of deciding to destroy Osama bin Laden, \nal-Zawahiri, and the al-Qaida leadership, our country decided, based on \ninformation provided by the administration that I referred to earlier, \nto invade Iraq. It was information we now know not to have been true--\ndeliberate or not, I don't know, but information about yellow cake, \naluminum tubes, chemical weapons labs, and about weapons of mass \ndestruction which was not true. Based on that, we decided to take \naction against Iraq.\n  The facts are these: Al-Qaida was not in Iraq before we invaded. It \nis there now. But, it is not the central feature in Iraq. Our \nintelligence estimates tell us that. The central part of Iraq is \nsectarian violence, with Shia killing Sunni, Sunni killing Shia, and \nShia and Sunni killing American soldiers. It is a civil war, a \nreligious war of sorts, with problems between the Shia and Sunni that \ndate back many centuries.\n  Now people ask this question, and reasonably so: Should we, 6 years \nafter 2001, the devastating attack against our country that killed \nthousands of innocent Americans, should we expect or have expected that \nwe would have brought to justice, dead or alive, the leadership of al-\nQaida and destroyed them? In my judgment, the answer to that is yes.\n  The Homeland Security Adviser at the White House, Francis Townsend, \nsays: Well, we are winning. I wish that were true, but it is an \nassessment that comes only by ignoring all of the facts. Just read the \nNational Intelligence Estimate.\n  This administration made a calculation that turns out to have been \nwrong on many fronts. Instead of fighting terrorism first, which I \nthink most Americans would have understood and accepted and believed--\nthe most critical element in the fight to provide security for our \nfuture--instead of fighting terrorism first, this administration \ndecided to take action in other areas. We now have more than 160,000 \nAmerican troops in Iraq. Many are going door to door in Baghdad today \nas I speak. It is the case that there is an al-Qaida presence in Iraq \nbecause Iraq has attracted terrorists. As I said, the intelligence \ncommunity itself has said that is not the central feature of what is \nhappening in Iraq. The central feature of what is going on in Iraq is \nthe sectarian violence and a civil war.\n  That is why the majority of this Congress decided it is time to \nchange course. It has not been the case that the descriptions by those \nwho want to change course in this Chamber have said let's decide \nimmediately, precipitously, to withdraw all troops. That is not the \ncase. Troops would remain to fight the terrorist elements that do exist \nin Iraq where they can be fought successfully, for force protection, \nand to train Iraqi troops. After all, the Iraqi troops will be \nnecessary and the Iraqi soldiers and the police force will be necessary \nto provide security in the country.\n  It is long past time for this country to say to the Iraqis: You now \nhave a new government. Saddam Hussein is dead. He was executed after a \ntrial for his crimes and atrocities. He is gone. He was a brutal \ndictator. But, Saddam Hussein is dead. You have a new constitution, you \nhave a new government, and now the question remains: Do you have the \nwill to take back your own country and provide for your own security? \nAre there sufficient able-bodied Iraqis to take back the security \nresponsibilities for their country? If not, there is no amount of time \nin which American soldiers and this country can provide security for a \ncountry in the middle of a civil war.\n  So we must change course. That change in course, in my judgment, is \nwhat will allow us to fight terrorism first. If we do not do that, we \nwill, 6 years from now, continue to read about Osama bin Laden and the \nal-Qaida leadership in a safe harbor or safe haven, living free, \nescaping justice, and planning additional attacks against this country.\n  My point is, what has happened, in my judgment, is wrong. The first \nand central fight is the fight against terrorism. We are not waging \nthat fight because those who attacked this country previously are now \nin a safe haven planning additional attacks against our country. That \ncomes from the National Intelligence Estimate, not me. That NIE \nrepresents the best assessment by our country's best intelligence \nprofessionals from 16 different intelligence agencies.\n\n  One cannot solve a problem if one is going to ignore the facts or \ndistort the facts. I said that Ms. Townsend on Wednesday morning \nbasically misrepresented what is happening. It seems as if she has \nfailed to see, or refuses to see, all of the evidence that exists, the \nevidence we have received in the National Intelligence Estimate and \nother evidence as well, that al-Qaida and bin Laden are stronger today \nthan they have been for many years.\n  They are getting stronger, not weaker; they are planning more \nattacks, not hiding; they are recruiting and rebuilding, not running; \nand they want to strike us again as much as they every have.\n  But, they are in Pakistan, in a safe haven. They are in the border \narea near Afghanistan, not Iraq.\n  It doesn't surprise me that this administration is on a course that \nis not the course that represents this country's best interests. \nPresident Bush has said on previous occasions that we will deal not \nonly with the terrorists who dare attack this country, we will deal \nwith those who harbor and feed them and house them. That was the \nPresident's statement. The President said that, as a part of our \noffensive against terror, we will also confront the regimes that harbor \nand support terrorists.\n  When President Bush was asked about Osama bin Laden, he said:\n\n       I don't think much about Osama bin Laden. I don't care much \n     about bin Laden.\n\n  But, Bin Laden and al-Qaida represent the principal threat to this \ncountry. That is why Senator Conrad and I offered the amendment we did \non the Defense authorization bill last week.\n  The very day Ms. Townsend appeared on television, Wednesday, here is \nthe New York Times' headline: ``Same People, Same Threat.'' That's \nright, ``Same People, Same Threat.''\n\n       Nearly six years after the September 11 attacks, and \n     hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of lives \n     expended in the name of the war on terror, we are faced with \n     the ``Same People, Same Threat'' as attacked American on \n     September 11. I pose a single, insistent question: Are we \n     safer? This is what the New York Times reported:\n       . . . After years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq and \n     targeted kills in Yemen, Pakistan,\n\n[[Page S9651]]\n\n     and elsewhere, the major threat to the United States has the \n     same name and the same basic look at 2001: al-Qaida, led by \n     Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, plotting attacks from \n     mountain hide-outs near the Afghan-Pakistani border.\n       The intelligence report, the most formal assessment since \n     the September 11 attacks about the terrorist threat facing \n     the United States, concludes that the United States is losing \n     ground on a number of fronts in the fight against al-Qaida \n     and describes the terrorist organization as having \n     ``significantly strengthened over the past two years.''\n\n  If ever we needed good leadership, thoughtful leadership, leadership \nthat will act on the facts and understand the facts and not \nmisrepresent the facts, it is now, at a time when a terrorist \norganization is planning additional attacks against this country. For \nthis administration to say that things are fine, we are winning, don't \nworry, and there is a sovereign, apparently, safe haven for the \nleadership for those who plan to attack us, that is unbelievable, and \nit must change. If the administration won't change it, the Congress and \nthe American people must change it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/20/senate-section/article/S9651-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9651-S9652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COMPETENT LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a number of us have been concerned about \nthe issue of competence for some long while. I take no pleasure in \ncoming to the floor to point out someone's flaws or weaknesses or areas \nwhere we are not succeeding, but it seems to me that this country has \nto be brutally honest with itself, and that includes this \nadministration, in terms of what it is doing, how well, what kinds of \nchanges are necessary to fix what is wrong to safeguard and provide \nsecurity for this country.\n  One of the examples of serious trouble with respect to solving \nproblems and addressing issues was the response to Hurricane Katrina. \nThis devastating hurricane hit our country, and it laid bare a whole \narea of the gulf coast. It was unbelievable what it did to families, \nhomes, and structures. The consequences of it and the cost of it and \nits toll on human lives and treasure are not even yet calculated.\n  I think everybody in this country saw what happened as a result of \nthe response of FEMA. I come from a State in which flooding 10 years \nago caused the evacuation of a city of 50,000 people--the largest \nevacuation of an American city since the Civil War. We understand FEMA. \nThey rushed in in the middle of that unbelievable flood in the Red \nRiver, where almost the entire city of Grand Forks, ND, was evacuated. \nFEMA rushed in. Under James Lee Witt, it had become a world-class \norganization. It did an unbelievable job. I cannot say enough about \nthat organization. FEMA was first rate. I think everybody in that city \nwho was helped by that organization understood the quality of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency.\n  Fast forward and discover that the major appointments to FEMA under \nthis administration were political cronies who had no experience in \nemergency response or preparedness. So it wasn't surprising that FEMA \ndeteriorated dramatically as an agency, and its response to Hurricane \nKatrina was abysmal.\n  I want to describe it with one photograph, if I might. This describes \nwhat happened with respect to Katrina. I am describing this because \nthis week something happened that finally ended the chapter on this \nsorry story. This man is Paul Mullinax, sitting in front of an 18-wheel \ntruck in Florida. His truck is a refrigerated truck, and it is used to \nhaul ice. Katrina hit, and one of the needs in the deep South, when \npeople and property and everything was devastated and they were trying \nto figure out how to deal with it, they needed ice in the middle of \nthat scorching heat. So FEMA contracted with truckers to haul ice in \n18-wheel trucks, refrigerated trucks, to help the victims of Katrina.\n  Here is Paul Mullinax in the photo. Paul was in Florida at the time. \nHe got a call and was invited to contract to haul ice. He drove his 18-\nwheeler to New York City and picked up a load of ice. Let me tell you \nwhere he went. I have a map. Paul went from Florida up to New York City \nto pick up some ice--in Newburg, NY. Then they told him to go to \nCarthage, MO, with the ice. He went there, to Missouri, to deliver ice. \nFEMA said, when he got there: No, we want you to go to Montgomery, AL, \nwith your truckload of ice for the victims of Katrina.\n  Then he got to Montgomery, AL, and here is what happened to him. He, \nwith over 100 other truckers, refrigerated trucks holding ice for the \nvictims of Katrina, sat for 12 days. This is a picture of Paul Mullinax \nsitting in his lawn chair, with a little grill. For 12 days, he sat \nthere. Finally, they said to him: We want you to take your ice to \nMassachusetts.\n  Think of this. Taxpayers paid over $15,000 for this load of ice. He \nwas told the ice was for the victims of Katrina, and hundreds of other \ntruckers had the same circumstance. He was sent from Missouri to \nAlabama, sat for a dozen days on the tarmac of a military installation, \nand then told he should take that ice up to Massachusetts and put it in \nstorage.\n  This week, 2 years later, after spending over $20 million, that ice \nwas taken out of storage in Massachusetts and discarded because they \nfelt it was probably contaminated after 2 years. So finally it ends, \nthe saga about hauling ice to the victims of Katrina.\n  How do I know Paul Mullinax? I asked Paul Mullinax to come to \nWashington to testify about what happened. He didn't want to do it. I \nsat in a parking lot of a grocery store one Sunday on the phone with \nPaul Mullinax and said: Paul, I want you to come to a hearing we are \nholding to tell this story. People need to understand what is wrong. \nOnly by understanding what is wrong can we get this fixed.\n  Paul came up to Washington, DC, and testified before a hearing and \ntold us what had happened. Some people wouldn't believe it. You are \ngoing to haul ice from New York to Missouri to Mississippi and then are \ntold to offload it at a warehouse in Massachusetts, ice for the victims \nof Katrina? If there is one story that demonstrates the complete absurd \nincompetence of the response to Hurricane Katrina, it is the story of \nPaul Mullinax, a good American who wanted to do the right thing, and in \ncontracting with the Federal agency that was incompetent came up with \nthis absurd experience.\n  I have tried since to find out who was the decision maker in \nGovernment, who decides we are going to haul ice from New York to \nMassachusetts through Missouri and Mississippi that is supposed to go \nto victims of Hurricane Katrina, and we are going to spend all of that \nmoney and do it incompetently, who was responsible, who made those \ndecisions, and you cannot find out who that unnamed person is who makes \nthat kind of Byzantine decision that in my judgment fleeces the \nAmerican taxpayer, that injures those who were victims of Hurricane \nKatrina by not getting the ice to the victims who needed it.\n  I wanted my colleagues to know, because I have spoken about this \nbefore, that this week at last--at long, long last--the ice that was \nput in storage as a result of this gross incompetence has now been \ndiscarded because they felt perhaps after 2 years the ice was \ncontaminated.\n  It is a sad story, in my judgment, of the fleecing of America. My \nhope is we have sufficiently embarrassed and sufficiently made \naccountable those in FEMA and in this administration so that this will \nnever, ever happen again. It is not what the taxpayers deserve, and it \ncertainly isn't what the victims of Hurricane Katrina deserve.\n  That same incompetence, regrettably, is steeped in other areas of an \nadministration that, as I indicated as of Wednesday morning's interview \nwith Ms. Townsend, seems content to ignore facts.\n  I have come to the floor on occasion and spoken well of those who I \nthink do a good job in this administration and elsewhere. I wish I \ncould do that this morning. It is very important for this Congress and \nthis country, when we see incompetence and when we see we are \ndeveloping a strategy that doesn't work and is not going to work, that \nwe must change course, we must expect better.\n  My hope is a group of us in Congress, through the hearings I have \nheld on these issues and through the discussions of Senator Reid and \nothers who have worked on it in our caucus in the last couple of weeks, \nmy hope is that we will change course with respect to the issue of \nIraq, for example, which is the overriding important issue.\n  I hope one of the changes in course will be we decide our priorities \nare to\n\n[[Page S9652]]\n\nfight terrorism first, and that is not what we are now doing. Let us \ndecide to fight terrorism first. That ought to be the goal. If the \nterrorist camps are reconstituted, if the threat to our country from \nal-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, and al-Zawahiri represents a greater threat \nnow, then we must, it seems to me, change course to address that \nthreat, and that threat requires us to fight terrorism first.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/20/senate-section/article/S9652-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9652-S9653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               PETE GEREN\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I hoped to speak earlier this week when we \nwere engaged in debate on the Defense authorization bill. That was a \nnight, I am sure our Acting President pro tempore recalls, when folks \ndidn't get much sleep around here. A lot of my colleagues decided as \nthey spoke they wanted to speak for a long time. As a result, I suspect \nfewer than half of us got to speak, and I had just a few thoughts I \nwanted to share with respect to not just the Defense authorization bill \nbut the war in which we find ourselves in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Before I do that, I wish to mention that I think it was last Friday \nat the end of the regular business session--maybe it was Thursday--we \nwent through the Executive Calendar. As the Senator from Ohio knows, on \nthe Executive Calendar we actually take up nominations submitted by the \ncommittee that need confirmation by the Senate and we deal with those. \nOftentimes, if they are not controversial, we deal with them by \nunanimous consent.\n  One of the nominations that came before us last week, under unanimous \nconsent, was that of Pete Geren, who had been nominated to be Secretary \nof the Army. Our Acting President pro tempore spent a number of years \nin the House of Representatives. I was there 10 years. I think he was \nthere for about as long, maybe even longer.\n  One of the finest people I ever served with in the House of \nRepresentatives was a Democratic Congressman from Texas who actually \nsucceeded Jim Wright. Jim Wright stepped down as our Speaker, resigned \nfrom the Congress, there was a special election, and who ended up \ngetting elected but Pete Geren. He became a Congressman for four terms \nand was admired by Democrats and Republicans alike. Before that, he had \nserved as an aid to a legendary Senator from Texas, a fellow named \nLloyd Bentsen, who was also our party's nominee for Vice President.\n  Pete went to Georgia Tech and the University of Texas. He got a law \ndegree from the University of Texas, married well, had three kids, and \nended up here in the Congress with all of us. He resigned after his \nfourth term and went back to Texas to become a businessperson and to \npractice law. He did that for I think about 5 years, and lo and behold, \nhe got a call from a Republican administration to ask him to serve in \nthe Department of Defense, where he was a senior aid in the Secretary's \noffice, a role he played for I think about 3 or 4 years.\n  Subsequent to that, Pete Geren was asked to serve in a variety of \nroles. He has been our Acting Secretary of the Air Force, he has been \nthe Under Secretary of the Army, the Interim Secretary of the Army, and \nfor the last week or so now, he has been the Secretary of the Army.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record his statement \nbefore the Armed Services Committee, his confirmation hearing \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [Congressional Hearings, June 19, 2007]\n\n  Senate Armed Services Committee Holds Hearing on the Nomination of \n               Preston Geren to be Secretary of the Army\n\n       GEREN: Mr. Chairman and Senator Warner and members of the \n     committee, it truly is an honor to be before you today as the \n     president's nominee.\n       I want to thank the president for his confidence in me and \n     Dr. Gates for his confidence, as well. It's truly a privilege \n     to have this opportunity.\n       Let me thank Senator Hutchison and Senator Cornyn for their \n     very kind remarks, two great leaders for our state and two \n     great leaders in this Senate, and I deeply appreciate, and I \n     know my family did, as well, their kind and generous remarks.\n       Mr. Chairman, I'd also like to note Senator Hutchison's \n     predecessor, who was the person who brought me into public \n     life, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, and had it not been for the \n     opportunity to work for Senator Bentsen, I'm confident I \n     would not have the opportunities to serve in our government \n     today.\n       Senator Bentsen passed away over the past year, a great \n     American, a great Senator, and I want to acknowledge my debt \n     to him.\n       Senator, I had introduced my family earlier. I've got, as \n     you do, three wonderful girls, three great kids, and, again, \n     I want to thank them for standing with me and standing with \n     Beckie and me in our time here in Washington and all the \n     time.\n       My family and I came to Washington planning a three-year \n     hitch and six years later, we're still here.\n       I joined the Department of Defense in August 2001, \n     expecting a peacetime assignment in business transformation \n     of the Department of Defense. Then came September 11 and the \n     war.\n       There's a sense of mission working among our military \n     during time of war that's hard to walk away from. For the \n     past six years, I've watched soldiers, sailors and airmen go \n     off to war and I've watched their families stand steadfast \n     and unwavering in their support of their departed loved ones \n     and live with the uncertainty of whether he or she would \n     return home.\n       And they live with a certainty that there would be \n     birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, graduations and the ups \n     and downs of everyday life that their loved one would miss \n     for 12 months, originally, and now 15 months and too often \n     watch those families live with a loss when their loved one \n     did not return.\n       I've been inspired by the selfless service of our soldiers \n     and humbled by the sacrifice of their families. I've held \n     staff and leadership jobs in the Pentagon over these past six \n     years and consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have the \n     opportunity to work on behalf of our men and women in our \n     nation's military and their families during the time of war.\n       Our grateful nation cannot do enough and I'm honored to \n     play a part, a supporting role in their service to our nation \n     on the front lines.\n       When I came before you seeking confirmation as under \n     secretary of the Army, I told you my top priority would be \n     taking care of soldiers and their families. I reaffirm that \n     commitment today with a greater understanding of that \n     responsibility.\n       My year as under secretary of the Army taught me much. My \n     four months as acting secretary of the Army has taught me \n     much more.\n       We have over 140,000 soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. We \n     can never take our eye off of that ball. They're counting on \n     their Army, big Army, to continue to provide them the \n     training, equipment and leadership to take the fight to the \n     enemy and defend themselves.\n       They count on their Army leadership back home to move the \n     bureaucracy on the home front. They count on their secretary \n     and their chief to stand up for them, get them what they need \n     when they need it.\n       We must act with urgency every day, every day, to meet \n     their needs. Today, the issue is MRAP. Tomorrow, it will be \n     different. The enemy is forever changing and forever \n     adapting.\n       Mr. Chairman, further, as an Army, we pledge never to leave \n     a fallen comrade. That is not an abstract notion. That means \n     on the battlefield, in the hospital, or in an outpatient \n     clinic or over a life of dependency, if that is what's \n     required to fulfill this pledge.\n       I've witnessed the cost in human terms and to the \n     institution of the Army when we break faith with that pledge, \n     as a handful did at Walter Reed. A few let down the many and \n     broke that bond of trust.\n       But I have seen soldiers, enlisted, NCOs and officers \n     respond when they learned that someone has let down a \n     soldier. They step up and they make it right. They make it \n     better and they do not rest until the job is done and they \n     expect and demand accountability.\n       And I've seen the strain of multiple deployments on \n     soldiers' families. A wife and mother said recently, ``I can \n     hold the family together for one deployment. Two is harder \n     and three is harder still.'' Over half of our soldiers today \n     are married with families. Over 700,000 children are in the \n     families of our soldiers.\n       The health of the all volunteer force depends on the health \n     of those families. We must expect that our future offers an \n     era of persistent conflict. We will continue to ask much of \n     the Army family. We must meet the needs of our families, \n     provide them with a quality of life comparable to the quality \n     of their service and sacrifice.\n       It's the right thing to do and the future of our all \n     volunteer force depends on it.\n       And as President Lincoln pledged to us as a nation, our \n     duty does not stop when our soldier or our nation leaves the \n     field of battle. We must care for those who have borne the \n     battle, his widow and his orphan.\n       That commitment extends over the horizon and we have \n     learned we have much to do to fulfill that commitment. \n     Lately, we have come face to face with some of our \n     shortcomings, a complex disability system that\n\n[[Page S9653]]\n\n     can frustrate and fail to meet the needs of soldiers, a \n     system that often fails to acknowledge, understand and treat \n     some of the most debilitating, yet invisible wounds of war, \n     leaving soldiers to return from war only to battle \n     bureaucracy at home and leaving families at a loss on how to \n     cope.\n       The Department of Defense, working with the Veterans \n     Affairs Department and this committee and this Congress have \n     a opportunity that does not come along often to move our \n     nation a quantum leap forward in fulfillment of that \n     commitment. We cannot squander this opportunity.\n       And, Mr. Chairman and Senator Warner, I commend this \n     committee for the step forward you all took last week in your \n     bill to start the process of meeting the needs of those \n     wounded warriors and we look forward to working with you, \n     again, to push that initiative.\n       Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you for all \n     you do for our soldiers and their families. The Army has no \n     greater friend than this committee.\n       Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution makes the Army and \n     the Congress full partners in the defense of our nation and \n     in the service of our soldiers and their families.\n       If confirmed, I look forward to continuing to work with you \n     in discharging our duty to those soldiers.\n       I look forward to your questions. Thank you.\n       LEVIN: Secretary Geren, thank you for a heartfelt and a \n     powerful statement. I can't remember that I've ever heard a \n     better one, frankly, coming from a nominee. It was very \n     personal and I think it had power.\n       I just wish every American, every soldier and everyone of \n     their families could have heard your opening statement.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Subsequent to his giving his statement, the chairman of \nthe committee, Carl Levin, and later on Senator Joe Lieberman--both \npraised the statement, Senator Levin saying, ``I can't remember that \nI've ever heard a better one, frankly, coming from a nominee. . . .'' \nHe said it was ``a heartfelt and a powerful statement.''\n  One of my favorite sayings is: In politics, friends come and go, but \nour enemies accumulate. For a lot of us in this business, that is the \ntruth. Pete Geren is the exception to that rule. He is admired and \nliked by people with whom he served in the House and Senate, Democrat \nand Republican. For a Democrat in Congress ending up to be asked to \nserve as Acting Secretary and Secretary of the Army is a compliment and \nreally reflective of the kind of person he is. He is a person who tries \nto figure out what is the right thing to do and to do it. He routinely, \nconsistently treats other people the way he would want to be treated. \nHe has great values, great work ethic, and is just a terrific public \nservant to the people of this country.\n  I am delighted he has now been asked to serve and was confirmed by \nall of us unanimously to serve as our Secretary of the Army. It is a \nbig job, a tough job at a tough time to serve in that capacity, but I \nknow he will have our full support. He certainly has my support and my \nlong-time admiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/20/senate-section/article/S9653-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9653-S9655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to step back for a few \nminutes and reflect on the debate that occurred here a few nights ago \nwith respect to the war in Iraq. One of the things I like to do is to \ntry to see if we can't find consensus--rather than just disagreeing on \nissues, to try to find ways to bring us together. I have been \nreflecting a good deal on that debate.\n  I had an opportunity, along with two of our colleagues, Senator Ben \nNelson and Senator Mark Pryor, to have a breakfast meeting with \nSecretary Gates at the Pentagon earlier this week. That was the first \ntime I had ever had a chance to spend any personal time with Secretary \nGates, who came to us as one of the people who served on the Iraq Study \nGroup. You may recall that, Mr. President, he served there for most of \nits time and has been president of Texas A He served in a number of \nleadership posts here in earlier administrations and was a senior \nofficial in intelligence. He is a very bright, able guy and also of \nvery good heart, someone who, over breakfast with us, was remarkably \ncandid in his observations, not someone who tried to sugar-coat what is \ngoing on in Iraq but who just was as honest and forthright with us. \nThat was enormously refreshing.\n  He is a person of strong intellect, obviously, and a person who dealt \nwith a faculty senate at Texas A and I think is not uncomfortable \ndealing with the U.S. Senate. I have been told by any number of people \nwho have been presidents of universities that the transition to working \nhere in this body is not all that hard. If you can work with a faculty \nsenate, you can work with the U.S. Senate. We have a couple of people \nhere, ironically, who have been university presidents and now serve \nhere, among them Lamar Alexander from the University of Tennessee.\n  I left the breakfast meeting actually feeling encouraged about maybe \nthe prospects, somewhere down the line, of finding consensus.\n  Here in the United States, our patience grows thin with respect to \nour involvement there. We have been involved for over 4 years. We have \nlost thousands of lives, we spent hundreds of billions of dollars--\nmoney we have largely borrowed from folks such as the Chinese, South \nKoreans, and Japanese because these are moneys we don't have, so we \nsimply increase our Nation's indebtedness to pay for this war. \nMeanwhile, those in this country who pay the taxes, whose sons and \ndaughters, husbands and wives have gone over and been shot at, in some \ncases been shot, hurt, wounded, in some cases killed--they paid the \nprice and have borne the burden. In many cases, they are tired of it, \nas I think most of us are. We would like to see the beginning of the \nend and, frankly, a new beginning at the same time for the people of \nIraq.\n  I think for the most part most of us realize we are going to have a \nmilitary involvement there, we are going to have a presence in Iraq, \nmaybe for several years. If you look at Kosovo, we have been out of \nKosovo for 10 years, but we are still there militarily. The war ended \nin Korea over 50 years ago; we still have a significant military \npresence there. I think it is likely we are going to have a military \npresence in Iraq for some time. The question is, What should they be \ndoing? What should our troops be doing?\n  Today, as you know, we are policing a civil war, trying to keep \nSunnis and Shiites from killing each other while at the same time going \nafter insurgents and training Iraqi troops and trying to help secure \nthe borders of Iraq. My hope is a year from now--and I suggest a year \nfrom now--we will still have troops in Iraq, probably tens of \nthousands, hopefully not 140,000 or 150,000 troops. What will they be \ndoing? My hope is they will not be policing a civil war. My hope is \nthey will not have to be involved in trying to keep Sunnis from killing \nShiites and vice versa. My expectation is there is going to continue to \nbe a need to train and equip and supply Iraqi armed forces and police. \nThere will be a need for our troops to protect U.S. assets, the \nembassy, and other physical infrastructure we have, that we own or \noccupy. There will be a need in some cases to join the Iraqis in \ncounterinsurgency operations against the really bad guys. There may be \nan opportunity and need for us to help police the borders of Iraq with \nSyria and Iran, borders which leak like sieves today.\n  Those are the kinds of responsibilities I suspect our troops will be \ncalled upon to perform. But my hope is we will not need as many of \nthem, not nearly as many of them, that they will not be as numerous nor \nas visible and hopefully not as much in danger as they have been the \nlast 4 years.\n  On the Iraqi side, what I heard 4\\1/2\\ weeks ago, about a month ago \nwhen I was last there, is a lot of the Iraqis don't want us to be there \nin such great numbers. They don't want us to be as visible. They don't \nwant us to be as numerous. Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki suggested about \na week ago that whenever we are ready to step out they are ready to \nstep up. I wish that were true. He later sort of spoke again or someone \nstepped in, one of his spokespeople stepped in and said that is not \nexactly what he said or what he meant.\n\n  I believe the Iraqis are not of one mind with regard to our presence. \nSome would like it if we would leave tomorrow, but a number realize we \nhave sacrificed and given our life's blood, a lot of money, a lot of \npatience with them, and I think for a lot of the folks there they \nrealize that and they appreciate that. But they don't want us to be as \nnumerous or visible, and eventually they want to have their country \nback with us not as an occupying force, although some may see us as \nthat, but have us playing a diminishing role.\n  What I think we have here is a growing consensus in this country to \nbegin\n\n[[Page S9654]]\n\nreducing our presence--not this month, not this summer, maybe not until \nlater this year. I think we need to send a signal, our President needs \nto send a signal to the people of our country, to the Congress, that \nthis is not going to continue forever. We don't want it to, it is not \nsustainable, and it should not be our responsibility forever. \nEventually, the Iraqi people have to decide whether they want a \ncountry. They have to step up. They have to be willing to make the \ndifficult choices that at least to this point in time their leaders \nhave been reluctant or unable to do.\n  I don't want to provide a strong defense for inaction on behalf of \nthe Iraqi Parliament and Iraqi leaders, but I remind us, and we have \nseen it here this week, the U.S. Senate, an institution that has been \naround for over 200 years, how hard it is for us to come to consensus \non difficult issues. We saw that as recently as last night. We saw that \nas recently as 2 nights earlier, when we were up all night. We, in a \ncountry that has worked with democracy and democratic traditions for \nover 200 years, should not be surprised that in a country where they \nhave basically 2 years of experience, in the middle of a war and \ninsurgency, sometimes they struggle through a democratic process to \nmake difficult situations. It is not a surprise to me, and I don't \nthink it should be a surprise to them or to any one of us.\n  Having said that, I am impatient with their inability to make tough \ndecisions. Around here, sometimes we will hold off making a difficult \ndecision unless we are almost staring into the abyss, we have almost no \nchoice, they have figuratively a gun to our heads, and then when we \nfind ourselves in that predicament, Congress--House, Senate, Democrats, \nRepublican, the administration--will come to a consensus.\n  The Iraqi Parliament, Iraqi leaders are, in my view, at that abyss. \nWhen I was over there a month ago with Senator McCaskill, we met with, \namong others, the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, an impressive fellow. \nHe is a Kurd, from the northern part of the country. His name is Salih. \nWe were talking about a sense of urgency and the fact that the Iraqi \nleaders don't feel this sense of urgency about making the difficult \ndecisions, about sharing oil wealth and power, any decision with \nrespect to the greater involvement for the Sunnis, providing an \nopportunity for the Baathist party folks, who enjoyed great power under \nthe old regime but who basically are enjoying no responsible role at \nall, to give them a role to play--those kinds of decisions; municipal \nelections out in the provinces--they are supposed to have them, and \nthey have not had them.\n  But I talked with Deputy Prime Minister Salih. We spoke about the \nlack of a sense of urgency on behalf of his country's leaders. He \nreadily acknowledged that was the case.\n  I was looking for a sports analogy to draw with him and his \ncountrymen, and I said to him: Do you play basketball here? I know you \nplay soccer--you call it football, but do you all play basketball here?\n  He said: We do. We don't play baseball or what you call football, but \nwe do play some basketball.\n  I said: Do you recall that basketball is a four-quarter game? The \nIraqi leader and the Iraqi Parliament are acting as if you are in the \nfirst quarter of the game. In truth, you are in the fourth quarter. \nThis is the fourth quarter of the game. It is not a game, but it is the \nfourth quarter. We are late into the fourth quarter.\n  I said to the Deputy Primary Minister: Have you ever heard of \nsomething called the shot clock? He had not. Well, in American \nprofessional basketball, we have a shot clock that begins when the ball \nis inbounded and you have so many seconds for the team on offense, with \nthe ball, to take a shot; if you do not, you lose possession of the \nball.\n  I said: We are in the fourth quarter. We are deep into the fourth \nquarter here. The shot clock has begun to run. And the Iraqi team, half \nof the team, is still on the sidelines. You are arguing about what the \nrules of the game are, who is going to get into the game, what play to \ncall, who is going to take the shot. Meanwhile, the shot clock is \nrunning.\n  What the Iraqis need to do, in the Parliament where the hatred \nbetween the Sunnis and Shias is such that it makes them hard to ever \nfeel or think like a team, somehow they have to find a way to put that \nbehind them. They have to begin making the difficult decisions they \nhave been unwilling and unable to make.\n  The Iraqi people are waiting for leadership. As in this country or \nany country with democratic tradition, the people yearn for strong \nleadership, fair leadership. The Iraqi people are looking to their \nleaders to show that they can work together, to figure out how to share \nthis enormous oil wealth of their country, a country where they are \ncapable of pumping today something like 300 million barrels of oil at \n$70 a barrel. Do the math. I should say 5 million barrels of oil a day, \n$70 dollars a barrel. That is $350 million. They are pumping less than \n2 million. They are literally leaving oil on the table, something like \n$180 million, almost $200 million a day on the table. These are \nrevenues they will not realize because they simply cannot figure out \nhow to work together. They need to figure that out.\n  The cabinet has figured that out. They submitted to the Parliament a \nplan for sharing the oil revenue. The Parliament has to act on it.\n  We are going to take the month of August off, not the entire month \noff. We will be in session until probably the first week in August, we \ncome back right after Labor Day, so we will be out about 28 days. \nMeanwhile, I am told that the Iraqi Parliament was thinking about \ntaking 2 months off this summer. They since have said they will take \nmaybe August off. Our soldiers are not. Our soldiers, marines, our \nairmen, are not taking August off. They are going to be there exposed, \nat risk, every day for the month of August. The idea that the Iraqi \nParliament will not be in session is unconscionable at a time when our \ntroops are being asked to make such sacrifices. They need to be in \nsession. They need to be figuring out how to deal with these difficult \nissues.\n  I am convinced if they do that, the Iraqi people will respond. As the \nIraqi people respond, it provides us with an opportunity to begin \nredeploying our troops this year. There is plenty of work they can do \nin Afghanistan. In some cases there is an opportunity for them to be \nstationed not far away if needed. In other cases, frankly, there is \neven a need to have them back here. As an old Governor, commander in \nchief of my National Guard, I understand full well how much we relied \non the National Guard, especially in times of emergency. Whether in the \nmiddle of winter or hurricane season as we have right now, there is \nplenty of work for them to do. Plus, they have families here. Guard and \nReserves, they are being asked to do things that--as a former national \nflight officer, having served in Vietnam, 18 years as a Reserve naval \nflight officer--we were never asked to do. We are asking our troops to \nmake extraordinary sacrifices as Reservists and Guardsmen.\n  There is plenty of opportunity for meaningful engagement, both in \nAfghanistan, in the Middle East region, not far away from Iraq, and \nfrankly back at home for these troops to do, and simply in some cases \nto come back and be with their families after an extended separation; \nin some cases to come back and go to work with their old employers; in \nsome cases to go back to their businesses, which are, in too many \ninstances, in trouble in some cases out of business, and be able to \nresuscitate their business or breathe fresh life into it. There is \nplenty to do.\n  In the meantime, the Iraqis have 350,000 people in their military and \npolice. Think about that. We have about 150,000 troops over there. They \nhave 350,000. We have been working to train them now for several years. \nI am told some of the battalions have stepped up; they are able to go \nout alone. Some of them can lead, but they need our help not too far \naway. They have got to continue to improve their readiness and their \nability to go out and lead the fight. And my counsel to the Iraqis is: \nYou can do this, we can help, just like they say in the Home Depot ad: \nYou can do this, we can help. We will help. God knows we have done a \nlot and we are prepared to do more.\n\n  The signal I hope the President would send us, once we hear from \nGeneral Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker in the middle of September, is \nnot we are going to surge for another year or two or three, but that we \nare going to begin redeploying our troops.\n\n[[Page S9655]]\n\n  They are not going to all be out a year from now. There will be \nplenty for them to do. I have talked about the four or five major \nresponsibilities they can pursue a year or so from now and for some \ntime after that. But I think that sends the kind of signal the American \npeople are waiting to hear. I think it sends a real strong message to \nthe Iraqis as well that our patience is not infinite, that we have \nexpectations of them, that they need to step up. Again, another sports \nanalogy: They need to step up to the plate. This is their time. This is \ntheir country. It is not our country, it is their country. If they want \nto have a country, they have to make the decisions. If they want to \nhave a country, they need to do what is necessary to bring their people \ntogether and to build an institution in their country that can survive \nand persevere and hopefully can prosper.\n  As we end this week, a week that has seen a lot of ups and downs here \nin the Senate, a week that has seen more than its usual degree of \nacrimony, this is a place where we actually mostly like each other, \nhave a pretty good ability to work together with a fairly high degree \nof civility and comity. A lot of times too often this week that \ncivility and comity has been lacking. Fortunately, when we left here \nthis morning about 1 o'clock, I felt some of the bumps and bruises were \nnow at least behind us, and we were back to a better footing. I hope as \nwe rejoin here on Monday, we will pick up where we left off early this \nmorning with the near unanimous passage of the Higher Education Act, \nsomething Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi and others have worked on, \ncrafting together a very fine bipartisan bill, that the spirit we \nwalked out of here with this morning will be waiting for us when we \nreturn on Monday.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/20/senate-section/article/S9655-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9655-S9658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came to the floor a month or two ago and \nindicated at that time that I had had conversations with my \ncounterpart, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell. I \nrelated to the Senate that Senator McConnell had said to me that \njudicial nominations were very important to him. I said if that is the \ncase, then they are important to me, and that I would do everything I \ncould to expedite judicial nominations in spite of what had gone on in \nrecent years relative to how Republicans had treated Democratic \nnominees of President Clinton.\n  As the majority leader, I take very seriously the Senate's \nconstitutional duty to provide advice and consent with regard to all \nPresidential nominees, but especially judicial nominees. The judiciary \nis the third branch of our Federal Government and is entitled to great \nrespect. The Senate shares a responsibility with the President to \nensure that the judiciary is staffed with men and women who possess \noutstanding legal skills, suitable temperament, and the highest ethical \nstanding.\n  In a floor statement I have given on more than one occasion--I just \nrecounted one I gave--I expressed regret that the process for \nconfirming judicial nominees had become too partisan in recent years. \nFrom 1995 to 2000, the Republican-controlled Senate treated President \nClinton and his judicial nominees with great disrespect, leaving almost \n70 nominees languishing in the Judiciary Committee without even a \nhearing. Some of them were there for 4 years with nothing happening. Of \ncourse, Republicans have had their complaints--most of which I feel are \nunjustified, but they are entitled to their opinion--about the way a \nhandful of nominees were treated in the early years of the Bush \nadministration.\n  The partisan squabbling over judicial nominees reached a low point \nlast Congress when Majority Leader Frist threatened to use the so-\ncalled nuclear option, an illegitimate parliamentary maneuver that \nwould have changed Senate rules in a way to limit debate on judicial \nnominations. It would have had long-term negative ramifications for \nthis body. At the time I said that it was the most serious issue I had \nworked on in my entire time in Government, that the Republicans would \neven consider changing the rules so the Senate would become basically \nthe House of Representatives. The Founding Fathers set up a bicameral \nlegislature. The Senate has always been different from the House. That \nis what the Founding Fathers envisioned. That is the way it should \ncontinue. But the so-called nuclear option would have changed that \nforever.\n  The effort was averted by a bipartisan group of Senators that was \nunwilling to compromise the traditions of the Senate for momentary \npolitical advantage. I was never prouder of the Senate than when it \nturned back this misguided attempt to diminish the constitutional role \nof the Senate just to confirm a few more judges. I believed that had a \nvote taken place, that never would have happened. There were people who \nstepped forward. I had a number of Republicans come to me and say: I \nwill not say anything publicly, but what is being attempted here is \nwrong. But remember, we only had 45 Democrats at the time, so we had to \nbe very careful what would happen. Rather than take the chance on a \nvote, I was so happy that we had 14 Senators, 7 Republicans and 7 \nDemocrats, who stepped in and said: That is not the way it should be. \nWe were able to negotiate. As a result of that negotiation, we let some \njudges go that with up-or-down votes here, it wouldn't have happened. \nBut it didn't work out that way.\n  We averted the showdown as a result of the goodwill of 14 Democratic \nand Republican Senators. It went away. That is the way it should have \ngone away.\n  But in the 2 years since the nuclear option fizzled, I have worked \nhard, first with Senator Frist and now with Senator McConnell, to keep \nthe process for considering judicial nominees on track. I said then \nthat if the nuclear option had been initiated, and I became leader, I \nwould reverse it. I believed so strongly it was wrong, even though we \nwould have had an advantage at the time.\n  As Senate leaders, we have worked hand in hand with the very able \nleaders of the Judiciary Committee, Senators Leahy and Specter. In the \nlast Congress the Senate considered two Supreme Court nominees--I \nopposed both--Roberts and Alito. In hindsight, I did the right thing \nwith the decisions they have made. But I worked with Senators Leahy and \nSpecter to make sure both nominees received prompt, fair, and thorough \nconsideration in the committee and on the Senate floor.\n  After Senate Democrats gained a majority in last November's \nelections, I publicly pledged that the Senate would continue to process \njudicial nominees in due course and in good faith. I explained that I \ncould not commit to a specific number of confirmations because the \nright way to measure the success of this process is the quality of the \nnominees, rather than the quantity of nominees and, ultimately, judges. \nI said the Senate will work hard to confirm mainstream, capable, \nexperienced nominees who are the product of bipartisan cooperation. \nPresident Bush made a wise decision at the beginning of this Congress \nby not resubmitting a number of controversial judicial nominations from \nprevious years. I took that as a sign of good faith and have tried to \nreciprocate by working with Chairman Leahy to confirm noncontroversial \nnominees in an expeditious fashion.\n\n  So far this year we have confirmed three court of appeals nominees. \nAgain in hindsight, that is three more than were confirmed in a similar \nyear in the last Clinton term. But we have confirmed three, including a \nnomination to the Ninth Circuit about which there was some dispute as \nto whether the seat should be filled by a Californian or someone from \nIdaho. We have also confirmed 22 district court nominees, and we \ncontinue to vote on those at a steady pace.\n  The judicial confirmation process is working well. We have confirmed \n25 judges. It is certainly working much better than it worked when \nthere was a Republican Senate processing President Clinton's nominees. \nAs a result, the judicial vacancy rate is at an all-time low. I have \nsaid on the floor and\n\n[[Page S9656]]\n\npublicly, this is not payback time with judges. We are going to treat \nthe Republican nominees differently than they treated our nominees.\n  But all of this hard work cannot prevent good-faith disagreements \nabout the merits of particular nominations. There is one nomination \npending in the Judiciary Committee that has aroused significant \ncontroversy, the nomination of former Mississippi State Judge Leslie \nSouthwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Senator Specter \nrecently said that I told Senator McConnell that Judge Southwick would \nbe confirmed by Memorial Day. Obviously, I can only commit to my own \nactions, not the actions of others. But I did urge strongly that the \nJudiciary Committee hold hearings on this, and they did. I urged \nstrongly that this matter be moved as expeditiously as possible, and it \nhas. I urged the Judiciary Committee to do everything it could to move \nthis along, and they did. The problem was, the nomination proved to be \ncontroversial and, therefore, it has not moved forward.\n  The Judiciary Committee has not yet voted on Judge Southwick. But as \nreported in the press, some Republicans are already threatening to \nretaliate against the rejection of the Southwick nomination by slowing \ndown Senate business. How much more could they slow it down? What has \ngone on this year is untoward. Cloture has been filed about 45 times on \nthings that, really, I don't understand why they are doing what they \ndo. To threaten, because of the Southwick nomination, that they are \ngoing to slow things down is absurd because they have already slowed \nthings down. They were gearing up to oppose judicial nominees of future \nDemocratic Presidents. That is what they have said. This is so \nsenseless. I think the reaction would be completely unjustified.\n  My pledge that the Democratic majority would consider judicial \nnominees in due course and in good faith was hardly a guarantee that \nevery Bush nominee would be confirmed. I was told early on that Judge \nSouthwick was noncontroversial. He had a high rating from the ABA. He \nhad participated in lots of cases. There was no problem. I accepted \nthose representations and, after having accepted them, pushed very hard \nto move this nomination along. But the facts of his background and his \ndecisionmaking are different than had been represented to me. The \nJudiciary Committee must still do its work with care, and it should \nonly report those nominees who deserve a lifetime appointment to the \nFederal bench.\n  The nomination of Judge Southwick has already been treated more \nkindly than dozens of Clinton nominees, including nominees to the Fifth \nCircuit. We have held a hearing. I repeat, during the Clinton \nadministration, almost 70 languished with no hearings. If Southwick has \nbeen unable to convince Judiciary Committee members of suitability for \nthe Federal bench, that is his misfortune. Remember, about 70 \nnominations of President Clinton never even had a hearing. Southwick \nhas had a hearing, and to this point, he has been unable to convince \nthe Judiciary Committee he is the person for the job. Senator Leahy has \nstated that anytime Senators Lott and Cochran ask him to put him on the \ncalendar for a vote, he will do so. They haven't asked him to do that \nyet. Why? Because at this stage it appears Democrats are going to \noppose this nomination. But Senator Leahy said anytime they want to \ntest the vote, they may do that.\n  I know the administration has sent Judge Southwick around to meet \nindividually with Democratic Judiciary Committee members. Anytime they \nwant that vote, they can have it. Chairman Leahy and I can only \nestablish a process. We can't promise that the outcome of that process \nwill be to the liking of Republican Senators.\n  The primary concern that has been raised by Judge Southwick is that \nhe has joined decisions on the Mississippi Appellate Court which \ndemonstrate insensitivity to the rights of racial minorities and \nothers. For example, in the Richmond case, he voted to uphold the \nreinstatement, with back pay, of a White State employee who used a \nracial epithet about an African-American coworker.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the dissent in that opinion by Judge \nKing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nBonnie Richmond, Appellant v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, \n                                Appellee\n\n\n                          no. 96-cc-00667 coa\n\n                    court of appeals of mississippi\n\n           1998 miss. app. lexis 637, august 4, 1998, Decided\n\n       I dissent from the majority opinion.\n       The standard of review applied [*19] to administrative \n     decisions is that they must be affirmed if (1) not arbitrary \n     or capricious, (2) supported by substantial evidence and (3) \n     not contrary to law. Brinston v. Public Employees' Retirement \n     System, 706 So. 2d 258, 259 (Miss. 1998).\n       In this case, the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board, \n     (hereinafter referred to as ``EAB'') made no specific \n     findings of fact. Instead, it merely entered an order which \n     affirmed ``the Order of November 29, 1994'' \\1\\, entered by \n     the Hearing Officer Falton O. Mason, Jr. Because the EAB made \n     no findings of its own, we can only conclude that it \n     incorporated by reference and adopted the findings and order \n     of the hearing officer. It is therefore the findings and \n     opinion of the hearing officer which we subject to our \n     review.\n       \\1\\ The hearing officer's order read as follows:\n       This came on to be heard on November 16, 1994, at 9:30 a.m. \n     in the Supervisors Board Room, in the Desoto County \n     Courthouse, Hernando, Mississippi, Falton O. Mason, Jr., \n     Hearing Officer;\n       After receiving testimony and hearing argument of counsel, \n     the Court being fully advised in the premises finds:\n       Bonnie Richmond appealed her termination by the Mississippi \n     Department of Human Services (hereafter MDHS), for an alleged \n     racial statement made in a private meeting, and later made to \n     the individual after she returned to the DeSoto County \n     Office. The proof shows that she made the alleged \n     statement in a private meeting where the atmosphere and \n     setting were for the free flow of comments and ideas and \n     complaints, her statement was in effect calling the \n     individual a ``teachers pet'' and that she did not repeat \n     that statement, but did in fact apologize to that \n     individual and that individual did in fact accept the \n     apology.\n       That based upon the allegations set out in the termination \n     letter, the Appealing Party did in fact sustain her burden of \n     proof, and the Appealing Party is reinstated as of July 8, \n     1994, with back pay and all benefits restored.\n       SO ORDERED this the 29th day of November, 1994.\n       [*20] To facilitate that review, I have included at this \n     juncture the full text of the Hearing Officer's opinion, \n     which reads,\n       I think in my--it appears to me very simply that the \n     department overreacted on this because first I don't find if, \n     in fact, these employees, Bonnie Richmond and Renee Elmore, \n     were in a meeting with Ms. Johnson and Mr. Everett and Ms. \n     Johnson testified that she tried to make them comfortable and \n     relaxed, if it was an open meeting with a give and take \n     atmosphere and this comment was made in the context it was \n     made in, I don't think it was intended at that time for a \n     racial slur.\n       If the department--if that's correct, if the department \n     takes that as a racial slur, then I see anytime somebody \n     refers to somebody as a honkie or a redneck or a mick or \n     chubby or a good old boy or anything else, it's an action to \n     file an appeal and try to get some response. I think it \n     overreacted.\n       I do think it would be unprofessional and it is \n     unprofessional to make that remark. I wouldn't be comfortable \n     making it. At the same time, it depends on what company I'm \n     in and under what circumstances.\n       The other part is as has been pointed out, the termination \n     letter very [*21] clearly states and the testimony in direct \n     opposition to this, further on May 24 you returned to the \n     DeSoto County office. You approached this black employee and \n     told her that you had been in a meeting with Ms. Johnson and \n     had told them that she was a ``good ole nigger.'' That \n     statement is--that's not true. I mean, the testimony \n     indicated that she didn't approach her, she didn't raise it, \n     that it was Renee Elmore that brought it up. She didn't seek \n     out this black employee to tell her anything about it.\n       Further, I don't find anywhere where it is--the other \n     comments, your conduct in returning and repeating, which she \n     didn't do. To return to the DeSoto County office and repeat \n     that phrase, had she repeated that phrase, it would have been \n     unacceptable totally as though it was acceptable to the \n     Mississippi Department of Human Services. I don't find it \n     having created a distraction within the DeSoto county office. \n     Nobody testified to that, or the surrounding areas. I don't \n     think it's caused employees to question whether the \n     department condones the use of racial slurs. You know, I \n     think the department overreacted.\n       The part that bothers me is to allow you to continue in \n     this position [*22] would discredit the agency, impair the \n     agency's ability to provide services, violates the agency's \n     responsibility to the public to administer nondiscriminatory \n     services, violates the agency's duty to administer working \n     environment free of discriminatory practices and procedures \n     and subject the department to potential liability for \n     unlawful discrimination.\n       If, in fact, she had returned to the DeSoto County office, \n     had brought this subject up\n\n[[Page S9657]]\n\n     again, and the only person--the only testimony that we have \n     about anybody else hearing about this thing was somebody who \n     Ms. Johnson and Mr. Everett had to make the comment to \n     somebody else. Ms.--what's her name?\n       Mr. Lynchard: Varrie Richmond.\n       The Hearing Officer: Ms. Varrie Richmond said she didn't \n     tell anybody else. She said she didn't call the state office \n     about the situation, and apparently, until she was contacted \n     by the state office, she had accepted Bonnie Richmond's \n     apology. I just think the agency overreacted, and if the \n     agency might find itself in a situation where every time \n     somebody in the agency is called a redneck by some other \n     employee, that they are going to be calling the state office \n     and wanting some relief or [*23] a honkie or a good old boy \n     or Uncle Tom or chubby or fat or slim.\n       I mean, I understand that the term ``nigger'' is somewhat \n     derogatory, but the term has not been used in recent years in \n     the conversation that it was used in my youth, and at that \n     point--at that time it was a derogatory remark. I think that \n     in this context, I just don't find it was racial \n     discrimination. I just don't find--she possibly should have a \n     letter of reprimand, but I don't think she needs to be \n     terminated.\n       I'm going to reinstate her with back pay. The agency can do \n     what they feel like they have got to do.\n       The Department of Human Services (hereinafter referred to \n     as ``DHS'') gave written notice of its intent to terminate \n     Richmond on June 21, 1994. That notice identified two \n     separate Group III violations (numbers 11 and 16) and \n     provided separately the underlying facts upon which each \n     violation was based.\n       The first offense was a violation of item number 11, which \n     is ``Acts of conduct occurring on or off the job which are \n     plainly related to job performance and are of such nature \n     that to continue the employee in the assigned position could \n     constitute negligence in regard to the agency's duties to the \n     [*24] public or to other state employees. (emphasis added)\n       The factual basis given to support this allegation was:\n       On May 23, 1994 while in conference with Joyce Johnson, \n     Division Director of Family and Children's and Jerald Everett \n     of the Division of Human Resources, you referred to one of \n     our black employees as ``a good ole nigger.'' Further on May \n     24, 1994 upon returning to DeSoto County you approached this \n     black employee and referred to her using exactly the same \n     words as you used when you were in conference with Joyce \n     Johnson and Jerald Everett the day before.\n       The hearing officer resolved this issue by finding:\n       (1) DHS overreacted;\n       (2) the remark was made in an open meeting with an \n     atmosphere of give and take;\n       (3) the term ``good ole nigger'' was not a racial slur; \n     (transcript 129)\n       (4) calling Varrie Richmond a ``good ole nigger'' was \n     equivalent to calling her ``teacher's pet''\n       (order by Hearing Officer Falton Mason, Jr., November 29, \n     1994,), and;\n       (5) Renee Elmore, not Bonnie Richmond, initiated the \n     conversation of May 24, 1994 with Varrie Richmond.\n       The meeting of May 23, 1994, while hastily scheduled, was a \n     formal meeting with two top tier DHS executives, intended to \n     [*25] allow Bonnie Richmond and Renee Elmore to address what \n     they perceived as problems in the DeSoto County office. While \n     the atmosphere was intended to allow for honest discussion, \n     there is no indication that this was intended as an informal \n     or unofficial meeting. Its purpose was to identify problems, \n     and if necessary to address them.\n       The fact that a business meeting may be conducted in a \n     relaxed and open atmosphere, is not license to engage in \n     boorish, crude, loutish or offensive behavior. The actions of \n     Bonnie Richmond in referring to Varrie Richmond as a ``good \n     ole nigger'' was indeed boorish, crude, loutish and offensive \n     behavior. This behavior was not merely inappropriate, but \n     highly inappropriate.\n       That a white employee would suggest the use of the term \n     ``good ole nigger,'' is less inappropriate in a relaxed \n     meeting, raises significant questions about that person's \n     judgment and whether the agency would be negligent in \n     retaining her. That judgment is demonstrated as especially \n     questionable, when one realizes that Bonnie Richmond worked \n     in a division which is approximately 60% black, in an agency \n     with in excess of 50% black employees. Such a demonstrated \n     gross lack of judgment would [*26] justify the dismissal of \n     Bonnie Richmond.\n       The hearing officer's ruling that calling Varrie Richmond a \n     ``good ole nigger'' was equivalent to calling her ``teacher's \n     pet'' strains credulity, finds no basis in reason and would \n     appear to be both arbitrary and capricious. The word \n     ``nigger'' is, and has always been, offensive. Search high \n     and low, you will not find any non-offensive definition for \n     this term.\\2\\\n       2 1. a. Used as a disparaging term for a Black person: \n     ``You can only be destroyed by believing that you really are \n     what the white world calls a nigger'' (James Baldwin) b. Used \n     as a disparaging term for any dark-skinned people. 2. Used as \n     a disparaging term for a member of any socially, \n     economically, or politically deprived group of people.\n       There are some words, which by their nature and definition \n     are so inherently offensive, that their use establishes the \n     intent to offend. Words such as ``nigger'' when referring to \n     a black person, or the words, ``bitch'' or ``whore'' when \n     referring to a female person. The character [*27] of these \n     terms is so inherently offensive that it is not altered by \n     the use of modifiers, such as ``good ole.''\n       Much is made of the fact that Renee Elmore indicated she \n     was not offended by the use of the term, ``good ole nigger.''\n       The test is not whether Renee Elmore was offended by the \n     use of this term. Rather it is (1) whether this term is \n     universally offensive, Brown v. East Miss. Electric, 989 F.2d \n     858, 859 (5th Cir. 1993), and (2) whether the use of this \n     term is inappropriate and reprehensible. The answer to each \n     of these is a most definitive ``yes.''\n       The majority quotes Elmore on page 7, as saying, ``Because \n     I felt as if she was describing the actions of a person, I at \n     that time didn't allow myself to feel anything other than \n     what I felt she was doing and I allowed her that leeway to \n     describe her.'' I suggest that effect must be given to all \n     portions of that quote. Particularly the phrase, ``I at that \n     time didn't allow myself to feel anything.'' (emphasis \n     added).\n       It is clear that Renee Elmore made a determination to not \n     personalize or allow herself to become emotionally involved \n     in Bonnie Richmond's remark. It is not uncommon for people to \n     deal with offensive remarks [*28] by refusing to associate \n     the remarks with themselves on a personal basis. This makes \n     the remark no less inappropriate or offensive.\n       However, the resolution of this matter does not hinge upon \n     that fact. The use of the term by Bonnie Richmond in a \n     meeting with two of the top executives of DHS, an agency with \n     about 5000 employees of whom in excess of 50% are black, and \n     where the Division of Family and Children Services has a 60-\n     40 black-white employee ratio demonstrates such a lack of \n     judgment and discretion that to retain her ``could'' \n     constitute negligence in regard to the agency's duties to the \n     public or to other state employees.\n       The hearing officer and majority opinion seem to suggest \n     that absent evidence of a near race riot, the remark is too \n     inconsequential to serve as a basis of dismissal. Such a view \n     requires a level of myopia inconsistent with the facts and \n     reason.\n       It is (1) the remark, and (2) the lack of judgment in \n     making it in a professional meeting with top departmental \n     executives, which satisfy the requirement, ``that to continue \n     the employee in the assigned position could constitute \n     negligence in regard to the agency's duties . . . to other \n     state employees.''\n       The majority [*29] opinion is a scholarly, but sanitized \n     version of the hearing officer's findings and is subject to \n     the same infirmities found in that opinion.\n       The second reason given for termination of Bonnie Richmond \n     was ``Willful violation of State Personnel Board policies, \n     rules and regulations.''\n       The factual basis for this second allegation was the same \n     as the first, except it raised the issue of DHS's \n     consideration of this behavior and its impact upon the \n     integrity of DHS. The record does not reflect that DHS \n     identified any specific Personnel Board policies, rules or \n     regulations.\n       However, it must be presumed that an agency has the \n     authority to mandate civil conduct from its employees.\n       The actions of Bonnie Richmond exceed (1) acceptable civil \n     conduct, (2) acceptable social conduct, and (3) acceptable \n     business conduct.\n       This conduct was, by definition, offensive to the \n     individual referred to and the black employees of DHS in \n     general.\n       The actions of the EAB were not supported by substantial \n     evidence, and I would therefore reverse.\n       PAYNE, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n\n  Mr. REID. Judge Southwick says the decision was about technical \nissues, but the dissent in the case by Judge King is eloquent. I mean \neloquent. I hadn't read that opinion prior to my conversations with \nSenator McConnell, but I have read it. I understand it. I have a \ntotally different view than I had prior to reading that opinion.\n  The judge's words are eloquent. Here is part of what he said:\n\n       There are some words, which by their nature and definition \n     are so inherently offensive, that their use establishes the \n     intent to offend.\n\n  Race is a highly sensitive issue throughout the entire United States, \nbut especially in the States that comprise the Fifth Circuit. It took \nthe courageous action of judges, mostly Federal judges, on the Fifth \nCircuit especially, to carry out the Supreme Court's desegregation \ndecisions and destroy the vestiges of the Jim Crow era. Yet even today \nno African American from Mississippi sits on that court, despite the \nmany qualified African-American lawyers in that State. Concerns about \nJudge Southwick need to be seen in that context.\n  I say that Judge Southwick is not being looked at with lack of favor \nby the Judiciary Committee because of the color of his skin. It is \nbecause of his judicial participation in various opinions.\n  The members of the Judiciary Committee will decide whether to report\n\n[[Page S9658]]\n\nthis nomination to the full Senate. If they choose to report the \nnomination, I will schedule action as quickly as I can. If they reject \nthe nomination, that action will also be on the merits.\n  After I had read the opinion and understood the case, I visited \npersonally with Thad Cochran. I think the world of Thad Cochran. I have \nserved with him now in the Congress for 25 years. I have served with \nSenator Lott for 25 years. I went to both of them and said: I know how \nstrongly you feel about Judge Southwick, but here are the facts. I read \nto them the dissent of Judge King. I read to them the full dissent. \nAnyone who cares to hear what Judge King had to say only has to look at \nthe Congressional Record.\n  I also told them that the Magnolia Bar Association, the African \nAmerican Bar Association in the State of Mississippi, opposes Judge \nSouthwick. The NAACP opposes Judge Southwick.\n  Republican Senators may disagree with the decision of the Judiciary \nCommittee when and if it comes, but they should not treat it as an \naffront or an outrage. It is simply the way in which the Founders \nenvisioned the Senate would work as a partner with the President in \ndeciding who is entitled to lifetime appointments to the Federal bench.\n  Again, the Judiciary Committee didn't stall Southwick. They scheduled \na hearing at a time that was convenient to everyone. It was precise. It \nwas to the point. Everyone was able to ask their questions. They had a \nfull hearing. If he can't convince that committee that he is the man \nfor the job, that is our process. Certainly, at a subsequent time, if \nand when we get a Democratic President, if they process these \nnominations in the manner that we have, that will be fine. It is the \nway we are supposed to work.\n  Whatever happens with the Southwick nomination, the Senate will \ncontinue to process judicial nominations in due course and in good \nfaith, as I have pledged. I repeat, I know how strongly the \ndistinguished Republican leader feels about judges. I think there are a \nlot of things that are just as important. He feels strongly about this. \nI accept that. But I would like everyone to look at the record as to \nwhat has happened with this nomination. It has been moved \nexpeditiously. They can have a vote anytime they wish in the \ncommittee. There are votes that take place almost every Thursday. They \ncan schedule it anytime they want. But I think it would be asking quite \na bit for someone to think that when the committee of jurisdiction on \nan issue turns something down, we should take it up on the floor. That \nis not how things work.\n\n  I would only say, I would think, based on the decisions participated \nin by Judge Southwick, anyone who has any concern about the feelings of \nthe members of the Judiciary Committee who are Democrats should read \nthis record because it explains very clearly what the problem is in \nthis case.\n  Mr. President, we were hoping to clear a number of the President's \nnominations today--the Export-Import Bank of the United States, two \nnominees we were ready to clear; the Securities Investor Protection \nCorporation, one, two, three nominations; the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, we have someone there to clear; the \nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, we have an individual there \nwho has been cleared on our side.\n  All these nominations have been cleared on our side. The holdups are \nwith the minority. So we are trying to clear the President's \nnominations. We cannot do it unless the Republicans agree to it. They \nare his nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/20/senate-section/article/S9658-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 980.

Bennett, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Dole, \n        Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, \n        and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 1841. A bill to provide a site for the National Women's History \nMuseum in Washington, District of Columbia, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the National Women's \nHistory Museum Act of 2007, a bill that would clear the way to locate a \nlong-overdue historical and educational resource in our Nation's \ncapital city.\n  In each of the last two Congresses, the Senate has approved earlier \nversions of this bill by unanimous consent. I appreciate that past \nsupport, and I appreciate the cosponsorship today from 18 of my \ncolleagues, Senators Akaka, Bennett, Boxer, Cantwell, Clinton, Coleman, \nDurbin, Dole, Klobuchar, Landrieu, Lincoln, McCaskill, Mikulski, \nMurkowski, Murray, Snowe, Stabenow, and Voinovich.\n  Women constitute the majority of our population. They make invaluable \ncontributions to our country, not only in traditional venues like the \nhome, schools, churches, and volunteer organizations, but in \nGovernment, corporations, medicine, law, literature, sports, \nentertainment, the arts, and the military services. The need for a \nmuseum recognizing the contributions of American women is of long \nstanding.\n  A presidential commission on commemorating women in American history \nconcluded that, ``Efforts to implement an appropriate celebration of \nwomen's history in the next millennium should include the designation \nof a focal point for women's history in our Nation's capital.''\n  That report was issued in 1999. Nearly a decade later, although \nCongress has commendably made provisions for the National Museum for \nAfrican American History and Culture, the National Law Enforcement \nMuseum, and the National Building Museum, there is still no national \ninstitution in the capital region dedicated to women's role in our \ncountry's history.\n  The proposed legislation calls for no new Federal program and no new \nclaims on the budget. It would simply direct the General Services \nAdministration to negotiate and enter into an occupancy agreement with \nthe National Women's History Museum, Inc. to establish a museum in the \nlong-vacant Pavilion Annex of the Old Post Office building in \nWashington, DC.\n  The National Women's History Museum is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, \neducational institution based in the District of Columbia. Its mission \nis to research and present the historic contributions that women have \nmade to all aspects of human endeavor, and to present the contributions \nthat women have made to the Nation in their various roles in family, \nthe economy, and society.\n  The Pavilion Annex to the Old Post Office was a commercial failure \nand remains a continuing drain on Federal maintenance budgets. Putting \nthe building to use as a museum would provide lease payments and \nestablish a new historical and educational destination site on \nPennsylvania Avenue that would bring new visitor traffic and new \neconomic activity to the neighborhood.\n  These are sound reasons for supporting this bill. The best reason, \nhowever, is the obligation to demonstrate the gratitude and respect we \nowe to the many generations of American women who have helped build, \nsustain, and advance our society. They deserve a building to present \ntheir stories, as well as the stories of pioneering women like \nabolitionist Harriet Tubman, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nastronaut Sally Ride, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.\n  That women's roll of honor would also include a distinguished \npredecessor in my Senate seat, the late Senator Margaret Chase Smith, \nthe first woman nominated for President of the United States by a major \npolitical party, and the first woman elected to both Houses of \nCongress. Senator Smith began representing Maine in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1940, won election to the Senate in 1948, and \nenjoyed bipartisan respect over her long career for her independence, \nintegrity, wisdom, and decency. She remains my role model and, through \nthe example of her public service, an exemplar of the virtues that \nwould be honored in the National Women's History Museum.\n  I thank my colleagues for their past support of this effort, and urge \nthem to renew that support for this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Akaka, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. \n        Whitehouse):\n  S. 1842. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for patient protection by limiting the number of mandatory \novertime hours a nurse may be required to work in certain providers of \nservices to which payments are made under the Medicare\n\n[[Page S9660]]\n\nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce the Safe \nNursing and Patient Care Act today, and I am pleased to have my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, joining me in this effort. \nThis important bill will limit mandatory overtime for nurses in order \nto protect patient safety and improve working conditions for nurses.\n  The widespread insistence on mandatory overtime across the country \nmeans that over-worked nurses are often forced to provide care when \nthey are too tired to perform their jobs. The result is unnecessary \nrisk for their patients and for the nurses themselves. A recent study \nby the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing found that nurses \nwho work shifts of 12\\1/2\\ hours or more are three times more likely to \ncommit errors than nurses who work a standard shift of 8\\1/2\\ hours or \nless.\n  A study by researchers at Columbia University Medical Center and RAND \nCorporation found that when nurses work too much overtime, their \npatients are more likely to suffer hospital-related infections.\n  These studies, and many more like them, compellingly illustrate the \ncritical threat to patient safety when nurses are overworked.\n  The grueling conditions in which nurses are obliged to work \njeopardizes the future of this essential profession. We face a critical \nshortage of nurses. The American Hospital Association reports that \nhospitals needed 118,000 more RNs to fill immediate vacancies in \nDecember 2005. This is an 8.5 percent vacancy rate, and it is expected \nto rise to 20 percent in coming years, undermining their ability to \nprovide emergency care. In addition, nearly half a million trained \nnurses are not currently working in the nursing profession, even though \nthey are desperately needed.\n  Job dissatisfaction and harsh overtime are major factors in the \nnursing shortage. As a 2004 report by the CDC concluded, poor working \nconditions are contributing to difficulties with retention and \nrecruitment in nursing. Nurses are not treated with the respect they \ndeserve in the workplace, and many caring nurses refuse to work in an \nenvironment in which they know they are putting their patients at risk.\n  Our Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act deals with these critical \nproblems. By restricting mandatory overtime for nurses, the act helps \nensure that nurses are able to provide the highest quality of care to \ntheir patients. By improving the quality of life of nurses, the act \nencourages more dedicated workers to enter nursing and to make it their \nlifetime career.\n  This legislation is obviously needed to protect public safety. \nFederal safety standards already limit work hours for pilots, flight \nattendants, truck drivers, railroad engineers and other professionals. \nWe need to guarantee the same safe working conditions for nurses, who \ncare for so many of our most vulnerable citizens.\n  Some hospitals have already taken action. In recent years, after \nnegotiations with their nurses, Brockton Hospital and St. Vincent \nHospital in Massachusetts have agreed to limit mandatory overtime. Mr. \nPresident, 11 States have adopted laws or regulations to end forced \novertime. These limits will protect patients and improve working \nconditions for nurses, and will help in the recruitment and retention \nof nurses in the future.\n  Improving conditions for nurses is an essential part of our ongoing \neffort to reduce medical errors and improve patient outcomes. But it is \nalso a matter of basic fairness and respect. Nurses perform one of the \nmost difficult and important jobs in our society. They care about their \npatients and want to provide the best possible treatment. They cannot \ndo their job when they're exhausted and overworked. Nurses, and the \npatients they care for, deserve better. The Safe Nursing and Patient \nCare Act respects the dignity of hardworking nurses, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Obama, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Ms. Stabenow, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1843. A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nand the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to clarify that an \nunlawful practice occurs each time compensation is paid pursuant to a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other practice, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's an honor to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Fair Pay Restoration Act to correct the Supreme Court's \nrecent 5-4 decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, \nwhich undermined basic protection for workers against pay \ndiscrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The decision also \nundermines pay discrimination claims under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Our bill \nwould restore the clear intent of Congress when we passed these \nimportant laws that workers must have a reasonable time to file a pay \ndiscrimination claim after they become victims of discriminatory \ncompensation.\n  No American should be denied equal pay for equal work. Employees' \nability to provide for their children, save for retirement, and enjoy \nthe benefit of their labor should not be limited by discrimination. The \nCourt's decision undermined these bedrock principles by imposing \nunrealistically short time limits on such claims.\n  The jury in this case found that Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company \ndiscriminated against Lilly Ledbetter by downgrading her evaluations \nbecause she was a woman in a traditionally male job. For over a decade, \nthe company used these discriminatory evaluations to pay her less than \nmale workers who held the same position and performed the same duties. \nSupervisors at the plant where she worked were openly biased against \nwomen. One told her that ``the plant did not need women,'' and that \nthey ``caused problems.'' Ms. Ledbetter's pay fell to 15 to 40 percent \nbehind her male counterparts.\n  Finally, after years, she realized what was happening and filed suit \nfor the back pay she had been unfairly denied. The jury found that the \nonly reason Ms. Ledbetter was paid less was because she was a woman, \nand she was awarded full damages to correct this basic injustice.\n  The Supreme Court ruled against her, holding that she filed her \nlawsuit far too long after Goodyear first began to pay her less than \nher male colleagues. Never mind that she had no way of knowing at first \nthat male workers were being paid more. Never mind that the company \ndiscriminated against her for decades, and that the discrimination \ncontinued with each new paycheck she received.\n  The Supreme Court's ruling defies both Congress's intent and common \nsense. Pay discrimination is not like other types of discrimination, \nbecause employees generally don't know what their colleagues earn, and \nsuch information is difficult to obtain.\n  Pay discrimination is not like being told ``You're fired,'' or ``You \ndidn't get the job,'' when workers at least know they have been denied \na job benefit. With pay discrimination, the paycheck typically comes in \nthe mail, and employees usually have no idea if they have been paid \nfairly. They should be able to file a complaint within a reasonable \ntime after receiving a discriminatory paycheck, instead of having to \nfile the complaint soon after the company first decides to shortchange \nthem for discriminatory reasons.\n  The decision actually creates a perverse incentive for workers to \nfile lawsuits before they know a pay decision is based on \ndiscrimination. Workers who wait to learn the truth before filing a \ncomplaint of discrimination could be out of time. As a result, the \ndecision will create unnecessary litigation as workers rush to beat the \nclock in their claims for equal pay.\n  The Supreme Court's decision also breaks faith with the Civil Rights \nAct of 1991, which was enacted with overwhelming bipartisan support, a \nvote of 93 to 5 in the Senate, and 381 to 38 in the House. The 1991 act \nhad corrected this same problem in the context of seniority, \noverturning the Court's decision in a separate case. At the time, there \nwas no need to clarify Title VII for pay discrimination claims, since\n\n[[Page S9661]]\n\nthe courts were interpreting Title VII correctly. Obviously, Congress \nnow needs to act again to ensure that the law adequately protects \nworkers against pay discrimination.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has made clear that this bill will \nnot create costs for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the \nFederal courts. It simply restores the status quo as Congress intended \nand as it existed on May 28, 2007, before the Ledbetter decision was \nmade.\n  It is unacceptable that some workers are unable to file a lawsuit \nagainst ongoing discrimination. Yet that is what happened to Lilly \nLedbetter. I hope that all of us, on both sides of the aisle, can join \nin correcting this obvious wrong.\n  In recent years, the Supreme Court also has undermined other \nbipartisan civil rights laws in ways Congress never intended. It has \nlimited the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, made it harder to \nprotect children who are harassed in school, and eliminated peoples' \nright to challenge practices with a discriminatory impact on their \naccess to public services. The Court has also made it more difficult \nfor workers with disabilities to prove that they're entitled to the \nprotection of the law.\n  Congress needs to correct these problems as well. The Fair Pay \nRestoration Act makes sure that what happened to Lilly Ledbetter will \nnot happen to any others. As Justice Ginsburg wrote in her powerful \ndissent, the Court's decision is ``totally at odds with the robust \nprotection against employment discrimination Congress intended.'' I \nurge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, to restore the law \nas it was before the decision, so that victims of ongoing pay \ndiscrimination have a reasonable time to file their claims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/20/senate-section/article/S9661-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9661-S9668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007\n\n  On Thursday, July 19, 2007, the Senate passed H.R. 2669.\n  The bill, as amended, is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2669\n\n         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2669) entitled ``An Act to provide for reconciliation \n     pursuant to section 601 of the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2008.'', do pass with the following \n     amendment:\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Cole, which killed 17 United States sailors.\n       (6) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo \n     Bay also include Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, who played a major \n     role in the East African Embassy Bombings, which killed more \n     than 250 people.\n       (7) The Department of Defense has estimated that of the \n     approximately 415 detainees who have been released or \n     transferred from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, at \n     least 29 have subsequently taken up arms against the United \n     States and its allies.\n       (8) Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, said in his \n     1998 fatwa against the United States, that ``[t]he ruling to \n     kill the Americans and their allies--civilians and military--\n     is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any \n     country in which it is possible to do it''.\n       (9) In the same fatwa, bin Laden said, ``[w]e--with God's \n     help--call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to \n     be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill the Americans \n     and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it''.\n       (10) It is safer for American citizens if captured members \n     of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are not housed \n     on American soil where they could more easily carry out their \n     mission to kill innocent civilians.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, including senior \n     members of al Qaeda, should not be released into American \n     society, nor should they be transferred stateside into \n     facilities in American communities and neighborhoods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/20/senate-section/article/S9668-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOTICE: REGISTRATION OF MASS MAILINGS\n\n  The filing date for 2007 second quarter Mass Mailings is Wednesday, \nJuly 25, 2007.
