Mr. President, in the State of Nevada, one of the things we \nso appreciate is this great treasure we share with the State of \nCalifornia, Lake Tahoe, which Mark Twain called the fairest place in \nall the Earth. Some have said he said: The fairest picture the whole \nEarth affords. But the picture we get from Mark Twain is it was a \nbeautiful place, and it is. There is only one other lake like it in the \nworld, and that is in Russia. It is a wonderful alpine glacial lake \nabout a mile deep.\n  It is a wonderful resource we share with California. But as we speak, \nthere is a fire raging on the eastern side of the lake. It has, at last \ncount, burned 2,500 acres, four square miles. It has engulfed and \ndestroyed 250 homes; 500 more are in danger of being lost. Only 10 \npercent of the blaze has been contained.\n  One bright spot in this tragedy is that as of now, no injuries have \nbeen reported, and we hope these residents and emergency teams remain \nsafe.\n  Many of these firefighters live in the area. They are battling this \nfire while their own homes are in danger. If we think about that for a \nmoment, their own homes are at risk, their own families are in harm's \nway, and they are working to protect the homes and families of others. \nThat is real bravery, and that is what a firefighter is all about. We \nowe a great deal to these men and women. We will surely owe them much \nmore when this fire is brought under control. There is no way\n\n[[Page S8316]]\n\nto protect a firefighter, other than to quote Fire Chief Edward Croker, \nwho was with the New York Fire Department almost 100 years ago. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       I have no ambition in this world but one, and that is to be \n     a fireman . . . Our proudest moment is to save lives. Under \n     the impulse of such thoughts, the nobility of the occupation \n     thrills us and stimulates us to deeds of daring, even of \n     supreme sacrifice.\n\n  This is as we learned from South Carolina last week upon the death of \nthose nine firefighters. We will keep an eye on this blaze and give the \nStates of California and Nevada--the blaze is burning on the California \nside at this time--give the States of California and Nevada all the \nresources we can help them with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8316-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the period of these last few days, \nwe have had a number of our colleagues on this side who have spoken, \nand spoken very well, about the Employee Free Choice Act. We have had \nSenator Durbin, Senator Brown, Senator Clinton, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Murray, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Menendez, Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Webb, Senator Casey. I have spoken myself. We have a \nnumber of additional Senators. I see my friend from Maryland, Senator \nCardin, will be addressing the issue this afternoon.\n  I think we have had some excellent presentations about this issue and \nabout the importance of this issue, about the fact that there are about \n60 million men and women across this country who wish to be able to \nparticipate in the trade union movement, but because of the realities \nof the current election process are denied the opportunity to do so.\n  There are millions of people across this Nation who are enormously \nconcerned about the growing disparity which has taken place in this \ncountry between the explosion of wealth in terms of the top one-tenth \nof 1 percent of our population and the fact that those at the lower end \nof the economic ladder most recently had to wait 10 years to get an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  I can remember going back to a period of time when the increase in \nthe minimum wage was a bipartisan event. People understood at that time \nthey were trying to make the minimum wage about half of what the \noverall national wage was going to be, to say to American workers: If \nyou worked at the lower end of the economic ladder in our economic \nsystem, we still appreciated your work and you would not have to live \nin poverty here in the United States of America.\n  We have in recent years seen where millions of our fellow citizens \nhave had to live in poverty because we have failed to get the increases \nin the minimum wage. It has become a more partisan issue here in the \nSenate and also in the House of Representatives, regretfully. I am \nbasically suggesting that we are seeing America growing apart. That is \na matter of enormous concern to Americans everywhere. It does not have \nto be this way. It was not this way when I think America was at its \nbest. It was not this way.\n  What we are seeing now is the increasing factor that those who have \nthe resources and have the wealth and have the superwealth are \naccumulating it more and more; those who are at the lowest end are \nfalling farther and farther behind, and the great middle class that is \nrepresented by workers and used to be the trade union movement is being \nconstantly challenged.\n  For many in that middle class, they feel they are slipping farther \nand farther behind, and they are slipping farther and farther behind. \nThey were not slipping farther and farther behind when we had a strong \ntrade union movement. They weren't. They were moving ahead with the \nrest of the country. But now, they are falling farther and farther and \nfarther behind. They know that. The option before the Senate now is to \nat least give American workers an opportunity, if they so desire, to be \nable to participate in a union so that their economic interests, their \nhealth insurance interests, a decent retirement, can be addressed, \nbecause as we have seen, working families, increasing numbers of those \nworking families, are losing health insurance, are finding their \ndeductibles and copays are on the rise, and it is getting more and more \ndifficult for them to continue to afford this. An increasing number of \nretirees, who thought they had commitments to health insurance, are \nbeing dropped. We are finding an increasing number of those Americans \nwho rely on a defined benefit system losing out on their pensions.\n  We are finding out that the costs across the spectrum for working \nfamilies are going up through the roof--the price of gasoline, the \nprice of health care, the price of prescription drugs, the price of \ntuition, the price of any kind of retirement income.\n  Books have been written about this great shift from the kind of \ncommon responsibilities and common involvement Americans had with each \nother, commitments we had with each other, to a different perspective \nand a different paradigm where everyone is sort of effectively on their \nown.\n  That means you are on your own with regard to retirement, health \ninsurance, and education in the workplace. That is happening \nincreasingly. You are on your own when the employer won't give you a \nraise. You are on your own when you are put in working conditions which \nmay very well jeopardize your health.\n  I wish to review exactly where we have come as a country on the issue \nof growing apart and growing together. Most of us remember clearly the \nMayflower compact that was signed a few miles off Provincetown, MA, \nwhen extraordinary men and women had sailed the seas to escape \nreligious persecution and, after 6 long weeks and the loss of a number \nof those who had set sail on the ships, before they got off the ship, \nthey gathered on the deck and made a compact between each other about \nthe importance of working together for the common good as a community \nand as a society. The Federal Constitution talks about the general \nwelfare and about moving ahead together as a country and a society. We \nhave seen that when America has been at its best.\n  Here we have a chart that shows the years 1947 to 1973. It is titled \n``A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats.'' What this chart shows is income for \nfive different sectors of our economy--this is from the Economic Policy \nInstitute--the lowest 20 percent, the second 20 percent, the middle, \nfourth, and top 20 percent. This chart shows clearly from these colors \nthat from 1947 to 1973, America's income moved along together. Those in \nthe lowest sector of our economic society moved along. As a matter of \nfact, they moved along a little higher than those at the very top. But \nAmerica was moving along together.\n  It is interesting that this is a period of time when we had the trade \nunion\n\n[[Page S8317]]\n\nmovement at its peak. One of their strong themes during that time was \neconomic fairness, economic justice. If we were going to see an \nincrease in productivity as a result of their own enterprise and \nworking with the employer, the benefits were going to be shared. It was \ngoing to be shared between those at the top and those who were working. \nThat was the concept we had seen reflected in this growth from 1947 to \n1973.\n  Look at what is beginning to happen from 1973 to 2000. We begin to \nsee now the lowest is growing the least and the top 20 percent is \ngrowing at a rate of three or four times higher than the lowest. This \nwas the beginning of significant tax cuts that benefited the wealthiest \nindividuals. We see the economic indicators reflected here in the \nincome for those individuals across the board.\n  Now look at what has happened in the most recent time. We see that \nthose in the lowest economic income have been falling further and \nfurther behind, and those in the top 1 percent have been going further \nand further ahead. All of this is going on at a time when we have seen \nthe weakening of the trade union movement.\n  How is this reflected in what has happened with corporate profits? \nHere we see at the same time corporate profits were going up some 84 \npercent at the time from 2001 to 2007, where wages and salaries have \nbeen virtually stagnant. They haven't moved. They have gone up a total \nof 4 percent over this 6-year period. The profits have been growing; \nwages and salaries have not been growing. Benefits are going up in \nterms of corporate profits, but the workers' are not. We have seen what \nhas happened.\n  This chart is interesting. It tells the story of what I have just \nmentioned in a different way. For the first time, young men make less \nthan their fathers did. We have grown up in this country believing that \nthe future generation was going to have a better opportunity and a more \nhopeful future than the current generation. Those certainly were the \nhopes and dreams of those who came to this Nation. It has been \ncertainly generally true, right? Wrong. We saw that was true from 1964 \nto 1994, the purple colors reflecting the son; the green, the father. \nWe talk about income. You see that the son's income exceeded the \nfather's. Now look from 1974 to 2004. There has been a 12-percent \ndecline of the son over the father--again, the decline in the voice to \nspeak for workers, the strong voice that is going to speak for workers.\n  Now look at what happened again, if we can go back. Remember the \nfirst chart where I talked about 1947 to 1962 when all of the different \neconomic groups went along and went up together. This is the time of \npeak union membership. What this chart shows is that wages and \nproductivity rise together. What does this chart show? It shows right \nalong here increasing productivity. That means the workplace is \nbecoming more productive. They are producing more. What happened when \nwe had the height of the trade union movement during this time, we \nfound out wages were keeping up with productivity; therefore, workers \nwere working harder, but they were getting more in terms of wages. They \nwere keeping pace with their increasing productivity. Now we see the \nunions begin to decline, and the workers are falling further behind. \nProductivity is still going up, but real wages are in decline and \nproductivity grew more than 200 percent more than wages, reflected in \nthat earlier chart which showed the profits going up.\n  All this is at an interesting time where the workers' voice in the \nworkplace is being constantly diminished. On the far left, we find peak \nunion membership; wages and productivity rise together.\n  Now you can ask: What happened after 1966? Why this sudden disparity? \nHow could it be doing so well with union membership during this period \nand then suddenly we find a decline? Well, we had decisions made by the \nNational Labor Relations Board and the Supreme Court that decided \nbusinesses can veto majority signups as a result of elections. I will \ngo through that in more detail. But they have it as an art at the \npresent time where an election can be held, let the workers make a \njudgment, a majority can say: We want to join a union, and next you \nknow that those individuals who are involved in that activity are being \nfired, lose their jobs, are out of jobs--not just for 1 month or 2 \nmonths, not just for 6 months, not even for 1 year, sometimes 3, 4, 5 \nyears. It is the cost of doing business. A whole industry has grown up \nto help employers defeat the voices of workers in the workplace. That \nis what happened during this period of time in the 1960s and 1970s. We \nhad our Republican friends appointing members to the National Labor \nRelations Board during this period of time--also the Supreme Court--who \nmade these judgments to disadvantage workers. We have seen the abuses \nskyrocket.\n\n  This chart is from a Peter Hart Research Associates poll from a year \nago. It shows that 58 percent of nonmanagement workers would vote for \nunion representation. This represents 60 million workers who want to \njoin. We can ask ourselves: If they want to join, why don't they join? \nLet me point out, before we get there, what else has been happening in \nthe workplace.\n  We find there have also been assaults on unemployment insurance. This \nis the fund for when we have extended unemployment periods. This is an \nunemployment insurance fund which is paid into by workers so they will \nbe able to receive it when they are unemployed. It has been generally \nused historically in times when we have had a downturn in the economy. \nBut we have had administrations which have refused to extend the \nunemployment insurance, even though the fund itself is in surplus, to \nlook out for the workers. We have seen 6 million individuals who \nqualified for overtime who were workers 3 years ago lose their overtime \npay. We saw the results of administration action in Hurricane Katrina \nwhere they refused to extend the Davis-Bacon provisions. We have the \nundermining of family and medical leave. We have had Supreme Court \njudgments and decisions which have also compromised the worker.\n  One of the most notorious was the Supreme Court decision that was \nmade probably 4 weeks ago where a woman who had been working in a plant \nfor a number of years and had been working alongside a number of men \nfor all these years found out she was being paid significantly less \nthan the men. That is unfair under legislation we have passed in the \nCivil Rights Act. When the case finally went up to the Supreme Court, \nthe Supreme Court said: Well, it is too bad that has been her case \nbecause under the legislation, she should have complained in the first \n180 days. Since she didn't complain in that time, she lost all her \nrights.\n  That is the most cockamamie decision I have heard of the Supreme \nCourt making in recent years. I can give you another one, the Grove \nCity case on civil rights, but imagine this individual didn't even know \nshe wasn't being paid fairly. She had no notice of it. The payroll was \nbeing kept by the employer. This is what is happening in real America.\n  We all know what happened with carpal tunnel syndrome. We had rules \nand regulations under the previous administration. More than a million \npeople, most of them women, are doing the kind of repetitive work which \nendangers their health. We had the National Academy of Science make \ndeterminations that these individuals, by and large women, are being \nharmed by this kind of activity. We had the previous Democratic \nadministration issue rules and regulations to provide protections and, \nand bam, under this administration, under the current administration, \nthe Bush administration, they have been eliminated, all of them.\n  So we see the series: elimination of overtime pay, elimination of \nprotecting people in terms of pay on the job, eliminating rules and \nregulations to protect people from carpal tunnel syndrome--all of these \ngoing on at the same time. They are the kinds of situations the trade \nunion movement speaks about and fights about. They fight for an \nindividual member who is being abused like the woman being abused in \nthe workforce. They have been a principal spokes-group for the \nprotection of people doing repetitive work and being affected by carpal \ntunnel syndrome. But they have been weakened, their voice has been \nweakened. As a result, we see the great economic disparities, and we \nsee the great threat to the workers.\n\n  Now, you can say: Well, that is very interesting, Senator, but what \nare\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\nthese kinds of barriers to workers, if they have an election and they \nare successful? Well, here are some of the roadblocks. Workers who lead \nthe union efforts are fired. We have 30,000 a year who get backpay. Mr. \nPresident, 30,000 a year get backpay from employers for violations of \ntheir rights. What kind of message do you think that sends to other \nworkers who have to provide for their children and their family, seeing \nthe individuals dismissed or their rights violated?\n  The employer challenges the election results. No matter what the \ndisparity, they still challenge it and delay it. Then the employer \nappeals the NLRB ruling in the courts. I might, later on this \nafternoon, go over some of the court decisions as to the National Labor \nRelations Board and how they have changed from protecting the worker to \nprotecting the employer and how the DC court--because the DC court is \nthe special court of jurisdiction--how they have altered and changed in \nterms of protecting the workers. But the workers, effectively, are not \ngetting protection either from the National Labor Relations Board, \nwhich was set up to protect them, or in the courts, which are supposed \nto be protecting their interests.\n  The employer stalls or refuses to bargain for a first contract. They \nare able to kick this over for a year. The employer can seek to stop \nrecognizing the union. Then the workers start all over again.\n  This is what we have: The employees are fired in one-quarter of all \nprivate sector union-organizing campaigns--one-quarter of the \ncampaigns. Talk about discouraging those who want to speak up. One in \nfive workers who openly advocate for a union during an election \ncampaign is fired. This has not varied or changed. You would have \nthought the Department of Labor or the National Labor Relations Board \nor the courts would try to protect these workers. Oh no, they have not, \nand we have the current situation we have.\n  In 2005, over 30,000 workers received backpay after employers had \nviolated their rights. This gives you an idea of the warfare that is \ngoing on in the workplace--absolute warfare. Can we do something about \nit? Yes. That is what the legislation which is before us is trying to \ndo. That is exactly the issue this legislation is trying to face. We \nwill explain that. But that is exactly the point.\n  We see why some 60 million workers want to join unions. This chart \ndemonstrates the percentage of wages for union members over nonunion \nmembers. This next chart is very interesting because it draws the \ndistinction, the effect of union organizing for women. It makes a very \nsignificant difference in protecting women and women's rights, for \nAfrican Americans, and Latino Americans. It is a very major force and \nfactor in terms of making sure we are going to protect the rights and \nthe civil rights of our fellow citizens.\n  This chart gives you a pretty clear idea. This is what we are talking \nabout: people with wages that are $22,000, $23,000, $17,000, or \n$18,000. These are the people we are talking about. We are talking \nabout, as demonstrated on this chart, that the cashier, if they do not \nbelong to a union, is making $15,000; if they do, they are making \n$24,000. For childcare workers, if they are nonunion, they are making \nprobably $16,000; if they are a union member, they are probably making \n$21,000. And we have demonstrated on the chart the wages for a cook, a \nhousekeeper, across the board.\n  Look at the Federal poverty line on the chart. Those who are not a \npart of the union movement are below the poverty line, and those who \nare members of a union are slightly above it.\n  So let me point out what we are attempting to do. We are saying we \nwant to give individuals the opportunity to be able to join unions \nthrough a card check, effectively. If a majority of those in a union \nare going to check the card, they are going to be a majority, and they \nhave the opportunity to do so. But we do not eliminate the secret \nballot. We are saying the secret ballot is still available.\n  Today, the secret ballot is decided, effectively, by the employers. \nSince the employees are the ones whose interests are at stake, we give \nthem the option to go either through the secret ballot or to be able to \ndo it through a card checkoff.\n  We have heard a lot on the floor about how the secret ballot in the \nworkplace is comparable to the great American tradition of elections in \nthe United States. But, of course, that is completely untrue. For \nexample, if you take what we call the NLRB--that would be the elections \nin the workplace--versus a Federal election, in regard to equal access \nto the media, do we think the workers have equal access with the \nemployer? No, of course not. It is the employer who has all of the \naccess. Now, in a Presidential or a congressional campaign, there is \nrelatively equal access. Maybe one candidate is able to get additional \nkinds of resources and able to get more of the media, but at least \nthere is some degree of fairness and some degree of comparability. But \nhere it is all one-sided, all with the employer. The freedom of speech \nis with the employer.\n  Access to the voters: No union members can come onto a grounds and \nsay: Look, we would like to talk to these individuals who are trying to \nmake up their mind. But the employer has access to these individuals \nall day long.\n  Campaign finance regulations: The employer spends whatever they wish \non these issues.\n  The timely implementation of the voters' will: The federal elections \nall have them but not here. As we have just pointed out, employers \ncontest the elections.\n  The way these elections are conducted now in the workplace, the odds \nare all stacked against the workers. So the workers have been \ndiscouraged from doing so, from being able to express themselves. As a \nresult, they have not been able to move ahead. As a result, they have \nfallen further and further behind.\n\n  Now, we also hear on the floor: Well, we can't have this kind of a \ncheckoff because we will have intimidation of these workers in a \ncertain way, we will have intimidation for those in the workplace. \nWell, the fact remains there are very strong laws against any kind of \nintimidation or coercion of workers. We can go through that in greater \ndetail, which I am glad to do.\n  I know some opponents on the other side have cited a study by the \nHuman Resource Policy Association that identified 113 NLRB cases that \ninvolved union deception or coercion. Over the last 60 years, one \nexpert--who testified at the House hearing of the employee free choice \nlegislation--who examined the cases found they contained only 42 such \ninstances. We should not have any, but they had 42. In any event, those \n113 claimed examples of coercing or intimidating workers over the past \n60 years are next to nothing compared to the NLRB statistics that show \nacts of coercion alleged in a single year, which, in 2005, equaled \nabout 30,000 workers getting backpay for firings or violations of their \nrights who were involved in union activity--firing them, throwing them \nout of their jobs or otherwise violating their rights.\n  So experience has shown, too, that when the majority signup replaces \nthe battlefield mentality of the National Labor Relations Board \nelection process, conflict is minimized and the workplace becomes more \ncooperative and productive--a win for both sides.\n  I might mention that this chart shows Cingular Wireless, and this one \nshows Kaiser Permanente. They provide for what is permitted under this \nbill. Of course, if the company wants to do it, it can do it now. It \ncan do it today. But this will institutionalize it to encourage \ncompanies all over the country to do it.\n  Here is Kaiser Permanente, a well-known company. Mr. President, 800 \nnurses were able to choose a union based on the model of the Employee \nFree Choice Act. Kaiser Permanente proves that respecting workers' \ndesire to have a voice on the job, rather than fighting the unions, is \nnot only the right thing to do, but it makes good business sense. Says \nthe president of Kaiser Permanente:\n\n       We not only believe it's the fair thing to do, but we also \n     believe it's the right thing to do for our employees, our \n     health plan members, and also our business. It has been their \n     experience.\n\n  This is Cingular Wireless. A majority signed up. This is what one of \nthe workers, Larry Barrett, said:\n\n       Management didn't pressure us or try to interfere. . . . We \n     didn't attack the company and they didn't attack us. We were \n     focused on improving our jobs and making Cingular a better \n     place to work.\n\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\n\n  This is what the executive vice president of Cingular said:\n\n       We believe that the employees should have a choice. . . . \n     Making that choice available to them results . . . in \n     employees who are engaged in the business and who will have a \n     passion for their customers.\n\n  We can either do it right or we can do it wrong. That is what this is \nreally all about. It is permitting, on a voluntary basis, the \nopportunity to be able to permit workers to make a judgment and a \ndecision as to who can be their voice and representative in terms of \ntheir economic conditions, their work conditions, their retirement \nconditions, their health conditions, and the rest. If they want to so \ndo it, let's let them do it. If they do not want to do it, let them \nmake that judgment and choice. But today, the system is effectively \nbroken. It is unworkable. The workers know it. The employers know it. \nToo many of the employers want to keep it that way.\n  We have an opportunity to provide some real democratization in the \nworkplace. When we do that and we have workers who can have a voice in \ndetermining their economic future, their future in terms of other \nissues, we are going to have a stronger economy. It is going to be \nstronger in dealing with our competition around the world, and we are \ngoing to have increasing productivity.\n  I know there are those who say: Well, if we have a weaker trade union \nmovement, we are going to have a stronger economy. I will just show the \nexample of Ireland. Ireland has one of the strongest economies in all \nof Western Europe at the present time, and 35 percent of their workers \nare union members, as compared to 12 percent in the United States. Look \nat the economic growth of Ireland, which is at 6 percent; the United \nStates is at 3.3 percent.\n  So I am hopeful the Senate will at least give us a chance to move \nahead on this legislation. The time to act is now. This legislation \nwill make a major difference in terms of our ability to deal with the \nchallenges of a stronger economy, a fairer economy, an economy where \nworkers have a voice as well as a vote. It is the right thing to do, \nand now is the time to do it.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, more than three centuries ago, settlers \nin the New World began to put into practice the political ideals that \nbrought them here and for which many of their descendants would later \nfight and die.\n  One of the most important of these was the ideal of political \nfreedom, and one the most concrete expressions of it was the right to \nvote in secret, without harassment and without coercion. Rejecting the \nEnglish Parliamentary tradition, several colonies, including all the \nNew England colonies, established secret elections as the norm.\n  The secret ballot has been standard everywhere else in this country \nfor more than a century. It simply hasn't been questioned. Americans \nhave come to assume that in everything from electing their high school \nyearbook editor to their President, their vote is sacred and it is \nsecret.\n  That is, until now. The so-called ``Employee Free Choice Act'' is an \nassault on the centuries-old practice of secret voting, and the fact \nthat we are here in this Chamber discussing it at all is a scandal.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act was not written to help employees. It \nwas written to help union bosses, who are angry because their \nmembership has been plunging for decades.\n  This bill aims to reverse that trend by stripping workers of the \nright to vote privately for or against a union. They'd be forced to \npublicly sign a card instead, exposing them to coercion and \nintimidation by employers and union bosses alike.\n  When union bosses convince more than half the employees at a work \nsite to sign a card authorizing a union, they will be free to organize.\n  Meanwhile, employers would be free to check whether their workers \nfavor labor or management.\n  Look, Congress settled this issue 60 years ago when it amended the \nNational Labor Relations Act to provide secret ballots at the \nworkplace. Congress changed the existing law then precisely because of \nwidespread intimidation and coercion at the workplace.\n  Now our Democratic friends want to strip that right away from 140 \nmillion American workers, rolling back the clock 60 years on employee \nrights and potentially eroding the broader voting rights that \ngenerations of Americans have fought to secure for themselves and their \nchildren.\n  This is really a disturbing development. For years, American voters \nhave been able to depend on Democrats to be loud persuasive supporters \nof voting rights. Their sudden conversion is shocking, but its cause \nisn't a secret.\n  Speaking to a union rally on Capitol Hill last week, the \ndistinguished majority leader gave us a clue into the origins of this \nanti-Democratic bill. Here's what he told the unions that showed up: \nDemocrats are in control of Congress now because of you. You made all \nthe difference--and let me start with two words: thank you.\n  Well, are we to expect that blowing these folks a kiss at a pep rally \nwas all they wanted? I think not.\n  The unions haven't been coy about their legislative wish list. And \naccording to the Las Vegas Review Journal: ``The Employee Free Choice \nAct is at the top of their wish list.''\n  The Review Journal is calling this a textbook case of payback. Well, \nfor all you civics students out there, you are about to see a textbook \nexample of something else: how this kind of thing backfires when it \nthreatens to undermine something that Americans hold dear, and that is \nthe right to vote without somebody looking over your shoulder.\n  Historians tell us that once secret ballots gained near-universal \nacceptance a little over a century ago, the only Western country that \ndidn't continue to observe the practice religiously was the Soviet \nUnion.\n  Yet even there, communist leaders were careful to maintain at least \nthe formal appearance of secret ballots. An ad that recently appeared \nin a number of national newspapers illustrates my point. I think I have \nit here behind me. At least I thought I was going to. I guess I don't.\n  Leading with the quote; ``There's no reason to subject the workers to \nan election,'' it asks: ``Who said this?''\n  We are given three choices: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Idi Amin, and \nAmerican union leader Bruce Raynor. It was Raynor in fact who said that \nin defense of the Employee Free Choice Act.\n  No wonder the Communist Party USA endorsed the bill at its national \nconvention in 2005.\n  It's understandable why my good friends on the other side hoped they \ncould introduce this bill quietly--just slip it in, watch it fail with \na whimper, then crow about their support for Big Labor at political \nrallies.\n  They knew as well as I do that if voters knew they were looking to \nroll back a basic protection like the right to vote in secret, they \nwould be in trouble.\n  The polling data is overwhelmingly on this one: Nine out of ten \nAmericans--including 91 percent of Democrats--favor the right to a \nfederally supervised secret ballot election when deciding whether or \nnot to form a union. The main provision in this bill is about as \npopular as poison ivy, which is why this was supposed to all be quiet.\n  Incredibly, my good friend the majority leader has even indicated \nthat he doesn't expect the bill to pass. Last week he was worried that \nsome Republicans who are opposed to the immigration bill would vote for \nthis bill just to delay debate on that one.\n  He said such a move would be made out of pure spite, which could only \nmean that he doesn't expect--or want--this bill to go anywhere.\n  So what are we doing here?\n  I'll tell you what: we are being told to squeeze in a vote on this \nanti-Democratic bill between two of the most important pieces of \nlegislation in this Congress, in the hope that it will fail.\n  Well, it will fail. But not quietly.\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\n  Democrats can't put voting rights on the table and expect to get away \nwith it.\n  So first, Republicans will indeed block this bill.\n  But we won't be quiet about it. We're not going to forget about it. \nWe will make sure Americans don't forget about it either.\n  We'll remind our constituents that our friends on the other side \ndidn't mind promoting a bill that would lead to voter intimidation by \nemployers and union bosses.\n  All but two Democrats in the House passed their version of the bill \nin March. Apparently they have no problem with union bosses following \nemployees to their cars after work and telling them to vote union.\n  Apparently they have no problem with these guys following workers \nhome at night and knocking on their doors for a chat.\n  I am not making this stuff up.\n  We have read about a case in Louisiana where a worker was forced to \nseek an arrest warrant for a union boss who showed up at his home eight \ntimes trying to get him to sign a unionization petition.\n  Under this bill, the threat of employer intimidation is just as \nworrisome. Imagine having to announce in front of the person who writes \nyour review, who sets your bonuses, approves your raises, and controls \nfuture promotions that you prefer labor to management.\n  This is no different than the days when landowners sent their agents \ninto the fields to tell their tenant farmers how to vote in local \nelections. It was because of practices like these that the first \ncolonists fled to America in the first place.\n  Another reason Democrats wanted to keep this bill quiet is that so \nmany of them are on record opposing any abridgement to the right to \nsecret ballots.\n  On the first day of this session, the Senate's Democratic leadership \nintroduced a bill outlining the purpose of U.S. Democracy-building \nefforts abroad. This Congress' Democratic leadership introduced this \nbill. Here's what it said:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to use \n     instruments of United States influence to support, promote, \n     and strengthen democratic principles, practices, and values, \n     including the right to free, fair, and open elections, secret \n     balloting, and universal suffrage.\n\n  Apparently, our good friends on the other side believe the right to a \nsecret ballot is essential for everyone--except the American worker.\n  Time and again, Democrats have expressed their belief that the right \nto a secret ballot is sacred in a democracy.\n  Six years ago, 16 Democrats in the House sent a letter to a group of \ngovernment officials in Mexico chastising them for even considering a \nswitch away from secret ballots.\n  They wrote:\n\n       We feel that the secret ballot is absolutely necessary to \n     ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a \n     union they might not otherwise choose.\n\n  Support for the secret ballot in the Senate has been just as \npassionate. My good friend the senior Senator from Vermont has called \nit ``one of the great hallmarks of this Democracy. ``\n  The senior Senator from Connecticut has referred to ``the sanctity'' \nof a private ballot.\n  The junior Senator from Iowa went even farther, saying in 2005 that:\n\n       Perhaps what we need is a Constitutional Amendment \n     guaranteeing the right of every citizen of the United States \n     a secret ballot and to have that ballot counted.\n\n  Nine out of 10 Americans agree with these Democratic Senators, which \nis why their party's effort to roll back this right for workers is so \nalarming, and why it promises to be so alarming to voters next year.\n  Unions have every reason to be worried about their membership, which \nhas been in steady decline for decades. In 2005, only 12.5 percent of \nworkers nationwide belonged to unions. In the private sector, the \nfigure was even more anemic. It is now less than 8 percent.\n  But the price of reversing this trend shouldn't be one of the \nfundamental tenets of a free society, nor should elected officials be \ncomplicit in the effort.\n  According to the Associated Press, organized labor spent some $100 \nmillion on get-out-the-vote efforts last year, reaching tens of \nmillions of voters by phone and other means on behalf of labor-backed \ncandidates. Labor PACs contributed $60 million for federal candidates, \nincluding $40 million from the AFL-CIO.\n  According to news reports, Big Labor explicitly traded their \nendorsements of prospective freshman Democrats last year for the \npromise that the candidates would later vote in support for the \nEmployee Free Choice Act.\n  After the election, AFL-CIO's chief John Sweeney told a reporter it \nwas money well spent. Big Labor had a plan when it poured money into \nthe election last year.\n  Look, you don't need to be John Locke to figure out what's going on \nhere. The unions are losing the game, so they have decided to change \nthe rules.\n  But the rule they want to change isn't some little provision in the \nlabor code it is a fundamental right that the citizens of this country \nhave enjoyed without interruption for more than a century.\n  This was bold, it was desperate, and it was stupid.\n  Republicans will proudly block this bill from becoming law, and we \nwill just as proudly remind people who forced a vote on it in the first \nplace.\n  Today happens to be the birthday of George Orwell, a great enemy of \ntyranny who had some harsh things to say about political speech.\n  Orwell saw how rhetoric was used in his own day to excuse the \ninexcusable.\n  We now call it doublespeak--or speech that is meant to conceal the \nactual thought of the person speaking.\n  I can think of no better example of this than the Employee Free \nChoice Act.\n  This bill isn't meant to help employees; it is meant to help unions. \nIt is not about increasing employee choice, but limiting it.\n  I will vote against it. And I strongly urge--and fully expect--my \nRepublican colleagues to join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be \nnecessary.\n  I have been looking at a lot of the charts the other side of the \naisle has presented. We are going to have a vote on cloture to proceed \nto H.R. 800, which is the so-called Employee Free Choice Act. It would \nbe better named the ``lose your secret ballot by intimidation act.''\n  This legislation attempts the most radical, unacceptable, and \nunwarranted change in our system of labor-management relations in over \n60 years, since Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act. We have watched \nthe other side of the aisle grasping for ways that this might be \njustified. We heard about the minimum wage, health insurance, pensions, \ncosts going up, gas, food, and that it is all related to people having \na secret ballot. The secret ballot is causing that? That is a stretch--\nsaying that unions cannot organize because they are required to have \nsecret ballot elections. I grant you it is going to be much easier for \nthem if they don't have to have secret ballot elections, and can rely \non intimidation.\n  I was fascinated by the chart on voting that was shown earlier, and \nthe things that are supposedly not available in a union election as \nopposed to the things that are available to the American public in \nfederal elections. Most of them just are not accurate.\n  One was ``equal access to media.'' If one side is buying ads, the \nother can do it, too. You cannot tell me unions don't have money or \ndon't know how to run ads because I have seen them run ads against \npoliticians. They are both free to run ads under current law. Another \nwas ``Freedom of speech.'' I don't know where they allege the National \nLabor Relations Act takes that away. We have freedom of speech under \ncurrent law. My favorite category on the chart is ``equal access to \nvoters.'' Under current law, the union gets a list of the home \naddresses of every single person who works in that business. Now, the \nemployer cannot go to their home, but the union can go to their home, \nand we've heard some examples of how that works. That is why I call it \n``lose your secret ballot by intimidation act.'' If you have half a \ndozen people show up at your door, some of whom you know and some of \nwhom you\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\ndon't know, and they are going to try to persuade you to sign a check \ncard, is that equal access to voters? If you don't let them have a \nsecret ballot afterwards to see if they meant to sign that check card \nor if they only did so because the intimidators were there, it is \nsimply not fair to the employee.\n  You have to agree this card checking system is kind of a joke and \nthat it isn't a real election where rights are protected. The National \nLabor Relations Board watches those very carefully. In fact, they run \nthe election and guarantee a secret ballot to every potential union \nperson who votes.\n  Despite its cynical and deceptive title, this legislation is not \nabout employees, nor is it about enhancing employee rights. This \nlegislation certainly has nothing to do with free choice either. It is \nplain and simple; this bill is about unfairly and artificially boosting \norganized labor's steadily declining membership at the expense of \nessential employee democratic rights. We need to begin by understanding \njust how radical a departure this objective is from our longstanding \nnational labor-management policy.\n  Under our system, the Government's role has never been to guarantee a \nlevel of membership for unions, or to change the rules in order to \nboost a union's membership numbers. The role of Government has been--\nand should be--to remain neutral with respect to the positions of both \norganized labor and management. Its most important rule is to guarantee \nthat employees have the maximum freedom possible to make their own \nchoice as to whether they do or do not wish to be represented by a \nunion in their workplace. In short, our system of labor-management \nrelations is based on employee rights, not organized labor rights, and \nnot employer rights, and certainly not on some supposed right to a \ncertain level of membership among private sector employees.\n  This legislation would turn that national labor policy on its head. \nIt would sacrifice the fundamental democratic rights of working men and \nwomen in order to artificially boost union membership levels, increase \nunion bank accounts with employees' dues, and enhance the political \nleverage of organized labor. That is what such money buys. We saw the \nresults of that last week at some of the rallies put on by this bill's \nsupporters. The speeches given at those rallies offer a real \nappreciation for that kind of political leverage. They implied that now \nis the time to pay up. This is a totally unacceptable perversion of our \nlongstanding national labor policy. More important, it is outrageous to \neven suggest we should sacrifice the democratic rights and freedoms of \nworking men and women to further such an effort.\n  Despite the radical nature of what is proposed in this legislation, \nand despite the fact that it would constitute the largest attempt to \nchange basic Federal labor law in more than 60 years, it is telling how \nthe proponents of this legislation have sought to move this bill. In \nthe House, those who opposed this legislation were effectively cut out \nof the process. Leadership in the House brought this bill to the floor \nand allowed little opportunity for amendment or debate. Indeed, it was \non the floor in that Chamber for only a few hours. Here in the Senate, \nthe proponents now seek to move this legislation outside the regular \norder. It hasn't been to committee. Even though this bill falls \nsquarely in the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee--Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions--of which I am the ranking member, the proponents \nof this legislation bypassed the normal committee process and brought \nthis measure directly to the floor. With the committee process comes \nincreased scrutiny and a decreased prospect that legislation would ever \nmove based on rhetoric rather than sound facts and reasoned policy.\n\n  There may be those who believe that by short circuiting the committee \nprocess, it would be less likely that the public would see the \nlegislation for what it is--that the true dimensions of this devil's \nbargain would be hidden behind a wall of rhetoric. We cannot and will \nnot let that happen.\n  Let's briefly look at what the legislation does. For nearly seven \ndecades, millions of employees have decided for themselves, and for \ntheir individual workplaces, whether they want a union to become their \nexclusive legal representative. In the vast majority of instances, this \ncritical decision has been made through the use of the most fundamental \ninstitution of our democracy, the private ballot. In a democratic \nsociety, nothing is more sacred than the right to vote, and nothing \nensures truly free choice more than the use of a private ballot.\n  The current system provides that the question of union representation \nin the workplace is determined by a Government-supervised secret ballot \nprocess overseen by the NLRB. For over 60 years, the NLRB has conducted \ntens of thousands of elections involving millions of workers, and has \ndeveloped and refined complex rules and procedures designed to \nguarantee that the entire process is fair and regular and free from \nthreats, intimidation, and coercion. It carefully monitors the conduct \nof all parties to the election process and acts quickly and effectively \nto remedy any misconduct that interferes with the free choice of \nemployees. Those who understand the National Labor Relations Board's \nprocesses know that it conducts union elections in a free and fair \nmanner, as evidenced by the fact that only around 1 percent of all \nelections are rerun due to misconduct on either side. More recently, in \n2005, over 2,300 certification elections were conducted by the National \nLabor Relations Board. Yet the National Labor Relations Board conducted \nrerun elections because of misconduct by either the employer or the \nunion in only 19 cases. Yes, that is what they do, they force rerun \nelections because of misconduct by either the employer or the union. So \nin 2,300 certification elections in 2005, misconduct by either the \nemployer or union, there were only 19 cases.\n  The current private ballot election system is not only fair, it \nactually favors unionization. The win rate by unions in the National \nLabor Relations Board elections has increased for the last 10 years in \na row. This is an unmatched run of electoral success. The win rate for \nunions in 2005 and 2006 was over 61 percent, again an unmatched record. \nContrast this with the fact that during the entire 1980s, the average \nwin rate was below 50 percent. For example, in 1982, unions won less \nthan 45 percent of the time. The same is true for the decade of the \n1970s, where unions again averaged losing more than they won. But they \ndidn't ask the heavily Democratic Congress at that time to change the \nlaws. In light of unions' increasing electoral success, and the fact \nthat the legal rules have not changed in 60 years, there is absolutely \nno basis to claim that a change is warranted, particularly where that \nchange is to strip workers of their rights.\n  Unions want to now change this carefully developed democratic system \ninto one that is totally one sided, unsupervised, and an invitation to \nundue pressure, coercion, and even outright intimidation.\n  Imagine you are a worker at a nonunion facility and you are \napproached at work by people with whom you must interact day after day, \nor visited at home by union organizers. Remember, they have all the \naddresses. Imagine you are repeatedly asked to ``sign up'' for the \nunion and that you are given a sales pitch that may or may not be true. \nDo you think you might sign just to avoid the hassle, just to get \npeople off your back, just so you don't offend a coworker, or just \nbecause you haven't heard both sides? Do you think you might sign up \neven though your truly free choice would be not to have a union? Think \nabout it: visitors to your own house. Most people would sign for any \none of those reasons, and that is exactly why we have private ballot \nelections.\n  Beyond assaulting free choice and the right to vote, this bill would \ngravely damage the freedom of contract that has been a hallmark of our \nprivate sector labor-management relations. Our system recognizes the \nreality that in the workplace, as in other contractual situations, the \nparties who must live by the contract are the parties who must make the \ncontract. Instead, under this bill, if an agreement was not reached \nwithin a mere 90 days, the contract would be placed in the hands of a \nGovernment arbitrator who would have the power to determine every \ndetail of the employee-employer relationship. They could determine \nhours, pay, conditions, benefits, insurance, pensions,\n\n[[Page S8322]]\n\neverything. Neither the employees nor the employer could contest this \ncontract, and both would be bound to the terms for 2 years. There would \nnot even be a right for the union members to even vote to approve or \ndisapprove the contract agreement, none at all. That right, which they \nhave under current law, would be taken away, too.\n  Can you imagine either buying or selling a house and being told that \nsomeone from the Government would decide the terms of the sale? And \neven if you didn't agree, you would be forced to go through with the \ndeal? Whether it is buying a house or negotiating a labor contract, \nthis notion is simply untenable.\n  Lastly, the bill would substitute a tort-like remedy system for the \nmake-whole remedy system that has served so well since the inception of \nthe National Labor Relations Act. The vast majority of labor-management \ndisputes are voluntarily resolved. A tort-type system, while it would \ncertainly keep the trial lawyers busy, will clog the system with \nlitigation and simply delay the resolution of claims.\n  The bill seriously infringes on due process and the right to manage a \nprivate business through its mandatory injunction provision. This is \nhow that works. If an individual claimed he was terminated because of \nhis union sentiments, the Government would require that he return to \nwork before the merits of his claim are determined. The law already \nprovides that this extraordinary step can be taken in appropriate \ncases, but it doesn't require it in every case. We should not require \nthat the Government take action based on the presumption that a party \nis guilty unless proven innocent, except in the rarest of \ncircumstances. We certainly should never make that practice the norm. \nIn a host of other statutes, we quite rightly outlaw all types of \nemployment discrimination. However, in none of those statutes do we \npresume guilt and require the individuals who merely claim to have been \ndischarged be returned to work before the merits of their claims are \ndetermined, and we shouldn't do so here. The law provides for them to \nbe reinstated, but it doesn't require it in every instance.\n  I am not alone in the view that this legislation is fundamentally \nflawed, unnecessary, and destructive to employee rights. That view is \nwidely shared with others, as shown by some of the poll numbers that \nwere mentioned earlier. Even union members oppose this bill by a wide \nmajority--80 percent. I suspect that doesn't include union bosses, but \nit includes union members.\n  These views were, at one point, shared by my colleagues across the \naisle. In 2001, the lead sponsor of this misguided legislation in the \nHouse, along with the current House and Senate Members, wrote a letter \nto the Mexican Government regarding its labor laws in which they noted:\n\n       The secret ballot election is absolutely necessary in order \n     to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a \n     union they might not otherwise choose.\n\n  Incidentally, that was the chairman of the Labor Committee on the \nHouse side. It is simply incomprehensible that my colleagues would \nlecture foreign governments about the importance of industrial \ndemocracy while simultaneously advocating we strip American workers of \nthe same rights.\n  The signatories of this letter are not the only Members supporting \nthis bill who, previously, consistently upheld the importance of the \nsecret ballot. My colleagues have rightly noted:\n\n       One of the most fundamental of all rights that make us \n     uniquely American [is] the right of the secret ballot.\n\n  Yes, that was Senator Harkin. Another colleague said:\n\n       The sanctity of a private ballot is so fundamental to our \n     system of elections.\n\n  That was Senator Dodd.\n  Second, not only have my Democratic colleagues previously insisted on \nthe necessity of a Government-supervised private ballot, so, too, has \norganized labor when it has suited their purpose.\n  In 1998, two of the AFL-CIO's most prominent unions argued to the \nNational Labor Relations Board that the National Labor Relations Board \nsupervised election process ``is a solemn . . . occasion, conducted \nunder safeguards to voluntary choice . . . '' Other means of \ndecisionmaking are ``not comparable to the privacy and independence of \nthe voting booth,'' and the secret ballot election system provides the \nsurest means of avoiding decisions which are ``the result of group \npressures and not individual decision.''\n\n  I remind both my colleagues and organized labor that such statements \nare ones of principle that are not to be twisted or abandoned for \npolitical expediency. Advocating these positions and supporting this \nlegislation are so inconsistent as to be the height of hypocrisy.\n  At least some labor organizations are willing to stand for the true \npreservation of employee rights by directly opposing this legislation. \nLast Thursday, the Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of over \n300,000 law enforcement professionals, sent an open letter to Senator \nReid advising of its strong opposition to H.R. 800. In its letter, the \nFraternal Order of Police noted:\n\n       The National Labor Relations Board provides detailed \n     procedures that ensure a fair election, free of fraud, where \n     employees may cast their vote confidentially, without peer \n     pressure or coercion from unions, employers or fellow \n     employees.\n\n  The letter concludes by noting:\n\n       The only way to guarantee worker protection from coercion \n     and intimidation is through the continued use of a federally \n     supervised private ballot election so that personal decisions \n     about whether or not to join a union remain private.\n\n  Third, not only do my colleagues and labor unions agree that the \nprivate ballot is the most fair, the most accurate, and the most \ndemocratic way to determine employee free choice, and that all other \nmethods are seriously flawed, so, too, do the Federal courts.\n  I have a chart from the U.S. Supreme Court which, along with every \nFederal circuit court of appeals, has uniformly and over the course of \ndecades held that the private ballot is the best, most reliable, and \nmost democratic means of determining employees' free choice in the \nmatter of unionization, and that all other methods, most particularly \ncard signing, are inherently flawed and unreliable.\n  With respect to signed cards, the Supreme Court noted that cards are \nnot only unreliable because of the possibility of threats surrounding \ntheir signing, but because they are inherently untrustworthy since they \nare signed ``in the absence of secrecy and in the natural inclination \nof most people to avoid stands that appear to be nonconformist and \nantagonistic to friends and fellow employees.''\n  With respect to the importance of the private ballot, one Federal \ncourt of appeals put it best when it observed that its preservation \nmattered ``simply because the integrity and confidentiality of secret \nvoting is at the heart of a democratic society, and this includes \nindustrial democracy as well.''\n  The long line of those who oppose this legislation and its outrageous \nassault on the democratic rights of American workers does not end here. \nI received a letter from a half dozen former members of the National \nLabor Relations Board regarding this legislation. The National Labor \nRelations Board is the Federal agency that overseas private sector \nlabor-management relations, and enforces this very statute that this \nlegislation would alter so radically. It supervises the entire secret \nballot process under which workers currently make their free choice for \nor against union representation.\n  These are the experts in this area of the law who were nominated by \nboth Democratic and Republican Presidents. Here is what they have to \nsay about this grossly misnamed legislation:\n\n       We, the undersigned are all former Members of the National \n     Labor Relations Board, and were nominated to serve by both \n     Republican and Democrat Presidents and confirmed by the \n     Senate. In addition, each of us has devoted our respective \n     professional careers to work in the field of labor/management \n     relations. Each of us has carefully reviewed H.R. 800, \n     legislation entitled ``The Employee Free Choice Act''; and, \n     based on that review believe that the legislation is \n     fundamentally flawed and should be rejected by the Senate. We \n     fully agree with the position consistently expressed by the \n     Federal courts and by virtually all experienced practitioners \n     that authorization cards are inherently unreliable indicators \n     of true employee choice. There simply is no more fair, \n     accurate or democratic way to determine an individual's free \n     choice on any matter than through the use of secret ballot \n     election. We are also deeply disturbed by the legislation's \n     binding arbitration provision. This provision would radically \n     change the process of private sector collective-bargaining in \n     the United States and such change is neither required nor \n     beneficial. The success of private sector\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\n     collective-bargaining in the United States has long been \n     premised on the traditional precept of contract law that the \n     parties that must live up to a contract are the ones that \n     must make the contract. The legislation would, in our view, \n     do grave damage to the process of collective bargaining in \n     the United States.\n\n  Again, I mention that these are both Republican- and Democratic-\nnominated people to the National Labor Relations Board who were \napproved by the Senate.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Lastly, we believe that the remedial provisions contained \n     in the legislation are unnecessary and counter-productive. \n     Since its inception the National Labor Relations Act has \n     provided that individuals who have suffered a loss because of \n     violation of the act be made whole. The act has never made a \n     provision for punitive sanctions. Because of this, the vast \n     majority of claims before the National Labor Relations Board \n     are voluntarily adjusted and fully resolved in a very short \n     amount of time. Were the remedial provisions of H.R. 800 \n     enacted, board litigation would increase dramatically, and \n     the voluntary adjustment of claims that has been a hallmark \n     of the board process would inevitably become a thing of the \n     past. While this might be a boon to trial lawyers, it would \n     result to no benefit to employees whose rights have been \n     violated. Indeed, the sole effect on such employees would be \n     to substantially delay the receipt of compensation to which \n     they may be entitled.\n       For the reason noted, we would respectfully urge the Senate \n     to reject H.R. 800 or, any other legislation, containing like \n     or similar provisions.\n\n  That is signed by Marshall B. Babson, J. Robert Brame, Charles I. \nCohen, Dennis M. Devaney, Peter J. Hurtgen, and John N. Raudabaugh.\n  Let's listen to what our Democratic colleagues have said in their \nmore candid moments, which I quoted earlier. Let's listen to what the \nFederal courts have consistently told us. Let's listen to what the \nlabor unions honestly believe, and to labor law experts who enforce the \nNLRA and were nominated by both Democratic and Republican Presidents \nand confirmed by a bipartisan Senate. Let's hear what they say. Let's \nlisten to what they say. Most of all, let's listen to common sense. \nOnly in a totalitarian country or a society imagined by George Orwell \ncould anyone assert that the Government was going to afford free choice \nby stripping them of the right to vote by secret ballot.\n  It is plain to anyone who takes a moment to look that this \nlegislation is not about employee rights, it is not about enhancing \nfree choice, it is a transparent payback to organized labor at the \nexpense of employee rights and employee choice.\n  I urge my colleagues to flatly reject the notion that we should even \nfurther consider this unwarranted and destructive legislation. The \nSenate, quite frankly, has too many matters of genuine substance and \nimportance to be spending time on legislation that is plainly designed \nto profit the special interests at the cost of fundamental employee \nrights. Help me to be sure we do not take away the right to a secret \nballot.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nMaryland may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at \n3:15 p.m. the Senate suspend its deliberation of the motion to proceed \nfor the swearing in of the Wyoming Senator, and that any time consumed \nby that and speeches thereon not be counted against either side in the \ndebate, with Senator Session's time delayed accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for yielding me this time and for his \nleadership on behalf of working families and among the poor American \nworkers.\n  I listened with great interest to the Republican leader talk about \nthe concerns of protecting workers' rights to a secret ballot. He had \none complaint. It seems this legislation is lopsided in taking away the \nright of a secret ballot. The Republican leader then said, well, we are \ngoing to not be quiet about this. We are going to talk about this and \nmake sure people understand exactly what this bill does.\n  What I don't understand, and I think people listening to the debate \nwill not understand and be somewhat confused about, is if you read H.R. \n800, you will see the protection for a secret ballot is preserved. It \nis an option the workers have to be able to have a supervised election. \nIt is still in this law. I think they are going to be more confused \nbecause we have a vote tomorrow where we are going to have a chance to \nbring this bill before this body where we can have a full debate and \nconsider amendments.\n  Quite frankly, I have heard from a lot of my constituents about this \nlegislation--some for, some against. Workers are concerned about the \ntactics being used by some employers to prevent unions from being able \nto collectively bargain. There are worker intimidations, where workers \nare fired; there are threats made that plants are going to be relocated \nif they dare choose to be represented by a union; there is propaganda \nput out by employers that is downright intimidating. Those things do \nhappen and they deny workers the real freedom of choice.\n  Some employers have expressed concerns about the arbitration \nprovisions in this legislation and about making sure they do preserve \nan equal opportunity to be able to talk to their employees. These are \nmatters we can debate, if the Republican leader will allow us to bring \nthis issue to the floor. After all, he said he wanted an open debate on \nthis subject. Let us have an open debate. There are troubling concerns \nin this country. Nothing is more American than an honest day's pay for \nan honest day's work. America's great economic strength has been \ncreated because of fairness in the workplace, because of collective \nbargaining, because of the importance of workers in our economy, and \neffective collective bargaining. But as Senator Kennedy pointed out a \nfew minutes ago, we have some very troubling economic trends in this \ncountry--very troubling.\n  Real wages for U.S. workers are lower today than they were in 1973, \neven though productivity has increased by 80 percent. We do pride \nourselves that each generation of Americans will live a more prosperous \nlife than in previous generations. That will not be true for a large \nnumber of Americans. Today, wages are not keeping up with productivity. \nThere is a problem in the workforce, and it affects all of us in this \ncountry. We need to do something about it.\n  Real median household income in my own State of Maryland has declined \nby 2.1 percent from 2000 to 2005. We find a widening of the income gap \nin America, a widening of the wealth gap in America. We should be \nmoving to narrow that gap, not to see it continue to increase. We have \na problem we need to deal with, and this legislation, H.R. 800, gives \nus an opportunity to debate these issues and determine whether the \ndecline of unionization is one of the factors in contributing to these \ndifficult economic trends.\n  CEOs are now paid 411 times what workers are paid in America--411 \ntimes. In 1990, it was bad enough at 107 times--once again, a widening \nof the gap. I remember when I was in college talking about the strength \nof America. The strength of America was that in all the western \neconomic powers we had the narrowest gap between wealth and income. Now \nwe have the widest. We need to do something about it. Unionization \nhelps bridge that gap.\n  What has happened to unionization? In 1973, 24 percent of Maryland \nworkers worked in a company that offered union representation. In 2006, \nthat number dropped to 13 percent.\n  The United States has exercised international leadership. I listened \nas my colleagues talked about the letters we have written to other \ngovernments. We have been the leader in saying that workers rights is \nan international human rights issue. It is. America should be \nexercising leadership internationally on these issues. Some of us have \nargued on trade legislation that we should be doing a better job in \nprotecting international workers' rights. But it also starts with what \nwe do here at home, and we should be troubled that nationwide only 12 \npercent of U.S. workers have a union in the workplace. Surveys show \nthat 53 percent want to have unions in the workplace.\n  I listened again to what the Republican leader said about secret \nballots, and I know there is a disconnect here, because, again, this \nlegislation doesn't\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\nget rid of that. What this legislation tries to say is we want workers \nrights to be adhered to. If the majority wants to have a union, they \nshould be able to have a union without intimidation from the employer. \nAnd if the majority does not want to have a union, they should be able \nto do that without intimidation from the union. Both are true. But in \ntoday's workplace, it is not balanced. H.R. 800 gives us the \nopportunity to debate this issue and, hopefully, act on this matter.\n\n  Why do we need this? As I have pointed out, we already have \ndocumented examples. Senator Kennedy pointed out how many back wages \nhave had to be paid because of wrongful firings. We can go through the \nlist, but it is clear it is not effective today--not effectively giving \nworkers a real freedom of choice.\n  This bill increases the penalties for illegal activities; allows the \nmajority will of employees in joining a union; gives the framework for \nachieving negotiated contracts. It is a comprehensive bill. It is a \nbill that deals with more than just one subject, as the Republican \nleader keeps mentioning. It is a bill that tries to say, let us do a \nbetter job so that workers rights are protected in our economy and that \nworkers who want to join a union are able to join that union and those \nwho do not are equally protected.\n  We will never be able to get into that debate unless 60 Senators join \nus tomorrow to vote to bring up this issue. As the Republican leader \nsaid, this is an issue that shouldn't be kept quiet. Everybody should \nknow where people stand on it. Tomorrow, Senators will have a right to \ndo that by voting to bring this issue forward so we can have this \ndebate in this body and in this Nation.\n  We should take every opportunity we can to act on behalf of \nprotecting the rights of workers and working families here in this \nNation. The statistics tell us we are not doing what is necessary for \nthe growth of our economy. We need to make sure everyone prospers by \nour economy and we are not doing everything we need to do in that \nregard. That is why this Senator will vote to allow us to move forward \nto consider H.R. 800 when this issue is before us tomorrow.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership over so many years on \nthese issues. He has been truly our leader in trying to speak up for \nwhat this Nation should be standing for. We are proud of the economic \ngrowth of America. Let us make sure all families can prosper in that \ngrowth. Senator Kennedy has been our champion on those matters.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the effort to consider this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And, Mr. President, I yield myself such time as we might \nuse.\n  I listened to the very eloquent and persuasive speech of my friend \nfrom Maryland, and one of the points he made which I think deserves \nmentioning is the underlying disparity between the wealth of the \nNation, between the very rich and basic workers in the country; and his \npointing out that in the 1960s that difference was the narrowest in the \ngreatest economy in the world--which is the United States of America--\nand now it is the largest between the very wealthy and the neediest \npeople in our society.\n  I am sure the Senator remembers Henry Ford, who we all understand was \nthe creator, the early entrepreneur of automobiles, and Henry Ford's \nconcept at that time was to have a million people who had $10,000 a \nyear to be able to support selling those cars and begin building the \nAmerican economy. American workers brought us out of the Depression, \nfought in World War II, took a nation of close to 16 million men and \nwomen who had served in the military, came back, and transitioned again \nto being the most important economy in the world. Henry Ford understood \nit was important that there be a million people in America with \n$10,000.\n  I am sure he would be perplexed today that we have 10,000 people with \nmore than $1 million. It is an extraordinary kind of irony that we have \nseen a small number with enormous kinds of wealth at that time in \nAmerica, which had the strongest economy, as compared to now.\n  I share the concern the Senator from Maryland has, the direction we \nare going in, the indicators of where we are going and what is going to \nhappen to that middle class, as the Senator pointed out; what is going \nto happen as tuitions go up and gasoline goes up, prescription drugs go \nup, and the pensions and security retirement are threatened, and the \nlaws regarding what happens to workers.\n  As in Maryland, the same will happen to the workers in Massachusetts. \nThese were always issues that workers and working families felt were \nimportant not only to their own families but to their neighborhood's \nfamily, their community family, and to the Nation's family. I am \nwondering if the Senator is not perplexed somewhat about his sense of \nthe individual kind of activity, that we can let every individual sort \nof take care of themselves. They do not need health insurance; they can \nsurvive. They do not need much retirement to somehow be able to \nsurvive. They do not need much assurance about the cost of their house \nbecause they are going to survive. They are on their own, versus the \ncoming together of a worker who is concerned about the common community \nand the common good.\n  I wonder if the Senator would talk a minute or two about how he sees \nwhich type of America he thinks is more in tune with our traditions and \nvalues.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for those comments \nand those questions.\n  As I said, I was in college during the 1960s, and I did listen to my \nprofessors when they talked about the strength of this country, and it \nwas unions that brought us the sensitivity in the workplace to provide \nhealth care benefits for people who never had health care insurance, \nwho brought retirement plans for people who didn't have economic \nsecurity when they retired. We made tremendous progress during the \n1960s, the 1970s, and the 1980s as more people got health insurance and \nas retirement plans were readily available to workers.\n  When we look at the record today, we find 46 million people without \nhealth insurance and we know there has actually been a reduction of \nemployer-provided health benefits in this country. Every year more and \nmore of the cost of health care is being put on the backs of the \nemployees. There has been an erosion of middle-income families being \nable to afford health care, so many are now forced into bankruptcy \nbecause they can't pay for health care bills.\n  For two-thirds of Americans, when they retire, Social Security is \ntheir largest source of income. It was never intended to be that way.\n  We always thought private retirement would be a major security for \npeople when they retired. We have not met those goals. So we have a \nshrinking middle class in America, and the middle class is critically \nimportant, as Henry Ford said, for the manufacturers and producers and \nfarmers to be able to sell their wares here in America. To have \neconomic strength, you need to have the middle class. You need to have \nthe sharing of wealth among the people of this country, and we do not \nhave that in America today. We are moving in the wrong direction. I \nthink that is what troubles me the most. I know how important a growing \nmiddle class is to an economy, to the economic strength of our entire \ncountry, so everyone can benefit from this great economy. I agree, we \nhave a great economy. We are the strongest economy in the world. But we \nhave to tend to it, we have to deal with it. Protecting the growth of \nworker rights will help everyone in our economy, including the owners \nof our large companies. That is what is so troublesome about this \ndebate. It is not employers versus employees. We want a level playing \nfield. We want companies to grow in America because we want more good \njobs in America and we want employees to be able to get fair \ncompensation for their work. That is what this debate should be about.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for bringing this issue \nforward because it really does talk about what type of country we want \nfor our children and our grandchildren.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator understands--as we listened to this debate--\nwho brings support for this legislation. The Senator suggested broadly, \nduring his comments, we have civil rights groups supporting the \nEmployee Free Choice Act. Civil rights groups, community, religious, \nand poverty groups\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\nall support it. Whether it is ACORN, Sierra Club, the Presbyterian \nChurch, public health associations, the Churchwomen United, the \nMethodists, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the Mexican-American \nLegal Defense--this is a group, not only of workers, it is a \nrepresentation of civil rights groups, of women's groups, church groups \nthat talk about the morality and the fairness. They talk about the \nmorality of this issue as well, the fairness of this issue. I think \nthat is what I find so persuasive.\n  I wonder, if the Senator just had a minute, if he would not agree \nwith me, in the outline of this legislation, that he finds this is an \neffective summary of the legislation? It requires the employer to \nrecognize the union if a majority of employees sign valid authorization \ncards. So a majority has to find it. We have heard a lot of talk about \nexpressing the minority and majority views.\n  It preserves, as the Senator has said, the elections if employees \nchoose to ask for one. The employees, after all, are the ones who are \ngoing to be affected by this choice. We hear a lot about free \nelections. Here, this legislation preserves free elections if the \nworkers want that. It then instructs the NLRB to make clear and fair \nrules for a majority to sign up to protect workers' rights. Not if you \nlisten to some of the comments and statements on the floor about how \nradical this proposal is. Does the Senator not agree with me that this \nis a fairly straightforward proposal to give those workers who are \nworking in a setting the opportunity to express their will as to \nwhether they choose to join a union?\n  Mr. CARDIN. The Senator is absolutely right. To bring home the reason \nthis is needed today, 53 percent of workers would like to have a union \nin their employment. Only 12 percent today have union opportunities. \nThe will of the worker today is not being adhered to because of the \ntactics used by some employers to prevent a fair and open process for \nemployees to choose a union.\n  Just to underscore one more time, this is allowing the employees to \nhave the freedom of choice. We will never be able to get to a full \ndebate unless we get the opportunity to proceed with this legislation, \nand that is what this vote is about. I think the point of the Senator \nis very well taken. This is not taking away private, secret ballots. \nThat is still an option which is available to the employees. But it \nallows the employees to have a level playing field, which in many cases \ntoday is not true.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for an excellent presentation.\n  I see my colleagues desiring to address the Senate. I withhold.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield such time as he desires to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 800, the \nEmployee Free Choice Act. While the bill's title suggests it would \nprotect an employee's right to join a union, my belief is it would \nactually jeopardize that right. Actually, I would like to vote for \ncloture to allow this bill to be debated because I, frankly, think it \nwould be defeated were that to be the case, and I would strongly oppose \nit. However, I will oppose cloture, not because I wouldn't like to have \na debate on the bill but because I want to get to the next item of \nbusiness before us, which is the immigration bill, which I hope we can \ncomplete before July 4.\n  As to the Employee Free Choice Act, as I think it is rather \ndeceptively titled, it would remove the requirement that elections of \nunion representation and leadership be conducted by secret ballot. The \nsecret ballot, of course, is the ultimate protection for workers \nbecause it guarantees anonymity for every worker and protects workers \nfrom being submitted to coercion. Opposition to the bill even comes \nfrom the hometown newspaper of the bill's author, which notes in an \neditorial:\n\n       [B]asing representation on whether a majority of signatures \n     has been collected is a bad idea. . . . A worker who refuses \n     to sign, or changes his or her mind and wants to revoke the \n     signature, immediately becomes a target for pressure or \n     retaliation by the union.\n\n  That is from an editorial, ``Want a Union? Vote One In,'' the Boston \nHerald, February 11 of this year.\n  Currently, if a union has signed cards representing 30 percent of the \nworkers, it can inform the employer, and the employer can either accept \nunionization or request a secret ballot. The secret ballot must pass a \n50-percent threshold among employees for unionization to take effect. \nWhat is more fair? That is democracy. That is what this country has \nbeen built on. It is how we have operated in this country ever since \nour inception. The so-called Employee Free Choice Act would remove the \noption of a secret ballot and allow a majority vote of the signed cards \nto justify the certification instead.\n\n  As someone who was elected to my office by secret ballot, I am \nhesitant to uproot a process that is a cornerstone of American \ndemocracy, as I mentioned, and has proven to work very well. If \nAmerican voters were forced to choose their Representatives and \nSenators by being presented with a card and then told to choose in \nfront of the candidate's own staffer, let's say, I think we would \ndismiss this as nothing more than political thuggery. Why should union \nrepresentation be anything different? In some cases, union \nrepresentation affects a person's health care and wages more directly \nthan Congressmen do, so the integrity of these elections is important, \nand it must be upheld.\n  Speaking of the American voters, it is interesting to note that, \naccording to recent surveys, 79 percent of voters oppose this so-called \nEmployee Free Choice Act. Further, 89 percent of voters believe a \nworker's vote on union organization should remain private.\n  My friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, spoke of fairness and \nmorality and mentioned various organizations. The one I remember was \nthe church of which I am a member, the Presbyterian Church. I am a \nPresbyterian, and I don't think it is fair to remove the secret ballot, \nso I am not exactly sure what point that makes. It is best to stick \nwith what has been the cornerstone of American democracy from our \ninception--the secret ballot; majority rule. It has been common \npractice for unions and employers for the better part of the 20th \ncentury and into this century, and it doesn't seem to me it needs to be \nchanged now, especially with an extreme lack of compelling evidence to \nindicate that the current process has failed and in view of strong \npublic and union opposition to doing away with the secret ballot. The \nEmployee Free Choice Act crushes employee democracy, eliminates free \nchoice for workers to unionize, and could expose workers to coercion; \ntherefore, it should be defeated.\n  As I said I will join my colleagues in voting against cloture, not \nbecause I fear the debate--I think that would be healthy--but because \nclearly it is not going to pass. We might as well move on to our next \nitem of business, which is the immigration bill.\n  I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Maryland, and \nI need to clear up some misunderstandings. I hope they are just \nmisunderstandings. He said we should vote for cloture and let us \ndebate. That really was not the intention of the other side of the \naisle. If they really wanted us to have a debate, it would have gone \nthrough the regular process. This would have gone through the committee \non which I am the ranking member, and we would have had a debate in \ncommittee. We would have had an opportunity for some amendments, maybe \namendments that make the bill actually do what that side of the aisle \nis saying this bill would do.\n  I am most upset that they keep saying that under this bill, employees \ncan still get a vote. This bill does not say the employees can get a \nvote if they want a vote. It simply does not. That is not just me \nsaying it. We had the Congressional Research Service take a look at the \nbill and see if it requires the National Labor Relations Board to \ncertify a union without any vote--and it does. Not vote. Only if the \nunion sends in cards for only 30 percent of the employees will a vote \noccur as it does under current law. But the union organizers don't \nbother trying when they only have 30 percent of the people signed up. \nIt is my understanding they seldom go for a vote unless they have\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\n75 percent of the people signed up, and with 75 percent of the people \nsigned up, in a secret ballot election they still lose 39 percent of \nthe time.\n  This bill does not guarantee a vote. An employee who prefers to make \nhis choice in a secret ballot election is not entitled to one under \nthis bill. It does not guarantee a vote. That is not just my opinion. \nThe Congressional Research Service, the Library of Congress folks who \nare dedicated to being impartial when they review bills, agree with me \nthat there is no guarantee for a vote--unless there is only 30 percent \nof the people who sign up. That has been the rule for a long time.\n  I wish to point out one more inconsistency--maybe more than one. I \nreally am kind of floored at the list of civil rights groups the other \nside presented--that those people put their name down as wanting to do \naway with a secret ballot. I would be no more surprised if they \nsuddenly were for a poll tax.\n  Here is another little inconsistency in the debate here. There was a \ncomment that there were 30,000 backpay orders for terminations during \norganizing drives. That is a misstatement. There were 30,000 backpay \norders, but the vast majority of these claims have nothing to do with \nemployee terminations during organizing drives. The vast majority of \nthem have to do with bargaining claims and they are with members of \nalready-established unions. For example, in 200, two thirds of the \nrecipients of backpay orders were involved in a single contract \ninterpretation dispute.\n  Union studies we've heard cited claim that half the employees who are \noffered reinstatement were illegally terminated during an organizing \ndrive. There is not any basis for that estimate, but even assuming it \nis true, the number of discharges is very low. For example, in 2000, \nusing the unions' own estimate, there were 600 unlawful terminations. \nIn that same year, over a quarter of a million employees were involved \nin National Labor Relations secret ballot elections--hardly the 1 in 5 \nthey are claiming; 600 out of a quarter of a million. That is about 1 \ndischarge for every 416 employees. And that figure includes a huge \npercentage of settled cases in which there was never any finding that \nthe termination was unlawful to begin with.\n  I have been fascinated by the charts we have seen, many of which--I \nam not sure what the sources were. We will be checking those and \nquestioning them. But they really didn't have anything to do with \ntaking the right to a secret ballot away from employees.\n  We have forgotten to mention that I have passed the Workforce \nInvestment Act through this body unanimously on two occasions and then \nbeen blocked from having a conference committee with the other end of \nthe building. The Workforce Investment Act would have provided training \nfor 900,000 jobs in this country--900,000 people who could have had a \nhigher wage. How come we are not watching out for those folks? A lot of \nthem would have gone through union apprenticeships. But, no, we are not \ngoing to do the Workforce Investment Act. Instead, let's concentrate on \ntaking away the secret ballot.\n  I have a lot more people coming over to speak on our side, people who \nreally do think there needs to be debate on this issue. I am told that \nif we want to debate, we ought to vote for the cloture motion. That is \ninteresting because we have already agreed to a unanimous consent \nrequest that will keep us from debating that after we vote for it--yes, \nthere is an agreement that we will go to immigration after this vote no \nmatter what the outcome. So there is no intention to debate this bill.\n  It is very unusual. To me it is a realization by the other side that \nthis bill to take away an employee's right to a secret ballot is not \ngoing anywhere.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY Mr. President, I wanted to mention at this time, I know \nmy friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, is on his way, so I will speak for \njust a few moments until he comes about who is affected by this \nlegislation.\n  We hear these words used around here: ``free and open elections,'' \n``nonintimidation,'' ``under the existing program.'' Let me give you a \nfew examples of what is happening in the real world.\n  Here is Ivo Camilo, a vend pack operator at Blue Diamond Growers. \nThis is from the hearing we had on February 8, 2007. These are his \nquotes.\n\n       In group captive audience meetings and one-on-one talks, \n     company officials and supervisors threatened we could lose \n     our pensions and the other benefits if the union came in. We \n     told them we knew our rights. Less than a week later I was \n     fired.\n\n  This is free and open election that we are talking about. This is the \nreal world where the employer has the power, the power of intimidation.\n  Then he continues: After they were found guilty and had to rehire me \nand a coworker, they fired another union supporter. Getting a union \nshouldn't be so hard.\n  Here is another person: I thought the laws protected workers. I was \nwrong.\n  Jose Guardado, a former meatpacker, Omaha, NE:\n\n       My coworkers and I wanted a union at work to fight back \n     against the dangerous working conditions, the lack of \n     respect, and abusive treatment.\n\n  Working conditions are one of the principal concerns that many of \nthese workers have, not only the economic rights but the dangerous \nworking conditions. He continues:\n\n       The company terrified workers for standing up for their \n     rights. They threatened to fire union supporters, threatened \n     to close the plant, brought in a bunch of strange workers on \n     the day of the election, just to get them to vote against the \n     union.\n       Then they began firing workers who had supported the union. \n     This company took away my livelihood, hurt my family, just to \n     keep us from organizing unions.\n\n  This is what was happening in Nebraska.\n  Here is a nurse who was pulled away--this is important because it is \nnot just working conditions or the economic conditions, but it is the \npatients, what happens to the patients. Here is Linda Merfeld, Dubuque, \nIA:\n\n       Fewer and fewer nurses have been taking care of more and \n     more patients. These staffing patterns jeopardize the quality \n     of care of our patients. In 2003, I joined with other nurses \n     to gain a voice on the job. Managers started holding meetings \n     one on one and in small groups with nurses to spread myths \n     and half-truths about forming a union. Not only were these \n     meetings mandatory--mandatory--the employer mandates that \n     these workers show up at the meeting, but the nurses were \n     pulled away from patient care to attend them.\n\n  Nurses were pulled away from patient care to attend them. These are \nthese free and open elections that we just heard referenced on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  A nurse with 30 years of experience was fired for speaking out about \npatient care issues. No one should be fired for trying to have a voice \nin the decisions that affect their jobs and patient care.\n  I see my friend from Iowa is here. I was just talking about Linda \nMerfeld from Dubuque, IA, Finley Hospital out there, and how she was \ndismissed out there. I see the Senator from Iowa here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I yield him 10 minutes. I believe at a quarter after 3 there is a \nprevious order. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So I yield the time until quarter after 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Kennedy for his great leadership on this \nissue and so many other issues that pertain to the rights of working \nfamilies in America.\n  There is a need for organized labor in our country. When workers join \ntogether and act collectively, they can achieve economic gains and \nworker safety that they would not be able to get if they negotiated \nindividually.\n  History tells us this: Union members were on the front lines fighting \nfor the 40-hour workweek, paid vacations, minimum wage, employer-\nprovided health insurance and pensions. Organized labor led the way in \npassing legislation to ensure fair and safe workplaces, and in \nchampioning many other safety nets we have such as Social Security, \nMedicare, and the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  But, unfortunately, continued forward progress is not inevitable. We \nhave seen in recent years, as union membership has declined, wages have \nstagnated, the numbers of uninsured have risen, and private companies \nhave been allowed to default on their pensions threatening the \nretirement security of millions of Americans.\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\n  It is clear to me that in order to rebuild economic security for the \nmiddle class in America, we must first rebuild strong and vibrant \nunions; and to rebuild strong unions, we must first reduce the unfair \nbarriers to union organizing. A recent study by the Institute for \nAmerica's Future confirms this by comparing organizing campaigns in the \nUnited States and Canada. The study found that more worker-friendly \ncertification rules resulted in increased union participation.\n  But, of course, this is all just common sense. If you reduce the \nbarriers to workers joining unions, more workers will join. What does \nthat mean? Well, as the study made clear, by passing this Employee Free \nChoice Act, by making it easier for workers to band together, more than \n3\\1/2\\ million Americans would be able to secure health coverage, more \nthan 3 million Americans would have access to employer-based pensions.\n  Middle-class families in this country have an increasingly difficult \ntime making ends meet. More than 47 million lack health insurance, that \nis including 251,000 Iowans, and even those who get it find it covers \nless and less. This should not be happening in America. When \nproductivity rises, everyone should see a fair share of the gain. But \nin the past several years, increasing productivity has gone hand in \nhand with a growing wage gap.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: Adjusted \nfor inflation, average worker pay rose 8 percent from 1995 to 2005; but \nmedian CEO pay at the 350 largest firms rose 150 percent over the same \nperiod.\n  In my home State of Iowa, real median household income fell by 3.4 \npercent between 1995 and 2005, at the same time productivity increased. \nSo workers are working and becoming more productive, but they are not \ngetting any of their fair share.\n  By passing the Employee Free Choice Act, by giving workers a seat at \nthe table, we can start to reverse this negative trend. Union \nparticipation in the workplace means everybody wins. When employees \nhave a voice, not just to ask for better wages and benefits but to make \nsuggestions on how to do things better, employers benefit also.\n  Union employees take pride in their work and they work to get more \ntraining. They are happy to help find other efficiencies in the \noperation because they know if they do they get a share of the savings.\n  Unfortunately, the scaremongers out there are trying to tell us that \nthe Employee Free Choice Act takes away employee rights to a secret \nballot. Nothing can be further from the truth. This bill does not \nestablish a new election process. It merely requires employers to honor \nthe employee choice.\n  Right now a company gets to decide whether it will recognize a \nmajority signup vote. Well, why should just the company get to decide \nthat? Why should employees not get to decide that? That is what this \nbill does. It levels the playing field. It says the employees get to \ndecide as well as the company.\n  If the employees want to use the National Labor Relations Board \nprocess, they can do that also. But we know from hard experience--the \nbest teacher, hard experience--that process can be threatening and \nintimidating to many employees.\n  So in addition to making it easier to form a union in the first \nplace, the Employee Free Choice Act provides for arbitration for the \nfirst contract. I know from personal experience how a company can bust \na union and cause major hardships for their employees.\n  My brother, Frank, was a member of the UAW for 23 years. He worked at \na plant called Delavan in West Des Moines, IA, for 23 years, a proud \nunion member. He had a good job as a machinist, operating machines, \nmade parts for the military, had good pay, good benefits, a good \npension.\n  In 23 years he had only missed 5 days of work. In 23 years the union \nnever went on strike, never had a work stoppage. But then Mr. Delavan, \nthe owner, decided to sell the plant. And he sold it to a group of \ninvestors. One of those investors bragged openly--it was in the Des \nMoines Register--if you want to see how to bust a union, come to \nDelavan, we will show you how. He openly bragged about it.\n  What happened? Well, the investors took over. When the union contract \ncame up, the company put forward conditions with which no union could \never agree. So what was the union forced to do? To go out on strike. \nFor the first time ever in 23 years they went out on strike.\n  Well, then what did the company do? They brought in replacement \nworkers. Then what happened? There was a long bitter strike. I remember \nit well. After 1 year, as allowed by labor law, they had a \ndecertification vote. Who votes to decertify? Well, the replacement \nworkers. So they voted them out. They did not want to lose their jobs. \nSo they voted to decertify.\n  So after 23 years, my brother Frank was out of a job. He lost his \nunion job with excellent pay, vacation, pension. Now, I ask you, what \ndoes a 54-year-old deaf man--and my brother was deaf. He is disabled. \nWhat does a 54-year-old deaf man do when he loses that kind of a job? I \nwill tell you what he did. The only job he could get was as a janitor \nworking in a store at night in a shopping mall--minimum wage, no union, \nno pension, no benefits, nothing.\n  This is a real-life story, folks. That happened to my family. Not \nonly did it just destroy my brother's livelihood, it broke his spirit. \nThat is what happens when unions are weakened and destroyed, \njeopardizing our middle-class way of life. That is what is happening \ntoday, my friends, to tens of millions of workers all over this \ncountry.\n  I will close with this, from a December 2005 letter by 11 Nobel Peace \nPrize winners:\n\n       Even the wealthiest nation in the world, the United States \n     of America, fails to adequately protect workers' rights to \n     form unions and bargain collectively. Millions of U.S. \n     workers lack any legal protection to form unions, and \n     thousands are discriminated against every year for trying to \n     exercise these rights.\n\n  It is time to level the playing field and to give them a truly fair \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8327-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT AND CREDENTIALS\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Everything Bill Frist \ndid was through the eyes of someone trying to heal people. I am \nconfident our new Senator, the esteemed Dr. Barrasso from Wyoming, will \nbe the same. As everyone knows, my personal relationship with Bill \nFrist was a very warm, close one.

I thank the distinguished Senator from Wyoming and offer \nmy congratulations, together with the entire Senate family, to our new \nSenator from Wyoming. He has big shoes to fill, but I know he is ready \nto work hard, and he certainly couldn't have come to this body at a \nmore propitious and challenging time.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we continue to debate proposed \nsolutions to our Nation's immigration crisis, we have heard a lot of \nstrong language about how important it is that we find a solution. I \ncouldn't agree more. At the same time we have been treated to some \nincredible claims, if not downright myths. That is not to say this bill \nis all bad, because it isn't. But neither is it true that it is all \ngood and can't be improved by a little time to offer amendments and \ndebate them. Instead of a reasonable approach, however, we have been \ntold, for example, that this bill is better than the status quo which \nsome have defined as de facto amnesty. I disagree. What we have now is \nlawlessness and disorder, not a de facto amnesty.\n  It has been suggested this bill is better than rounding up 12 million \nundocumented immigrants, so the only option is to confer upon them the \ngreatest gift America can give a human being, which is American \ncitizenship. The American people can see through that argument in a \nheartbeat. There are plainly other options available, somewhere in the \nmiddle between those two extremes.\n  Then we have been told unless we agree to what some have rightly \nidentified as indistinguishable from the 1986 amnesty, we can't get \nborder security or a secure means of identifying legal workers on the \njob. I ask: Why should security be made a hostage to those demands? \nEmployers have been told the only way they can get legal workers to \nfill in labor shortages is the present bill. That clearly is not the \ncase.\n  I believe we can do better than this bill. I sincerely want to fix \nthis problem in all of its manifestations. What I do not want to be a \nparty to is trying to fool the American people. I value the trust my \nconstituents have placed in me too highly to overpromise, which this \nbill does, when the American people have good cause and good reason to \nknow we cannot deliver as advertised.\n  The fallacious arguments I have referred to and the process by which \nthis bill has been produced, which further inflame the skepticism of \nthe American people, seem only to confirm for many Americans that the \nSenate is not serious about fixing our broken immigration system. If we \nare going to insult the intelligence of the American people with such \nspecious justifications for this bill, how can they trust us? Moreover, \nhow can they have any confidence that the various assurances on border \nsecurity, worksite enforcement, security checks, and implementation of \nthe provisions of this bill will actually work as advertised?\n  We all know our broken immigration system is a serious threat to \nnational security. Border security, after all, is about national \nsecurity. So the question we have to ask ourselves is: Does this bill \nmake us safer? The more we have debated the bill, the more I have \nbecome convinced this legislation is not only dysfunctional, but unless \ncorrected, some provisions of this bill present an actual danger to our \nNation. This bill puts such onerous burdens on our law enforcement \nofficials and ties the Government's hands in so much redtape that it \nwill make us less, not more, safe. Some of the individuals involved in \nthe recently foiled terrorist plots at JFK Airport and Fort Dix were in \nour country illegally. Some of those involved had even been granted \ncitizenship by our current flawed immigration system. Thankfully, these \nplots were uncovered before they could be carried out. But knowing that \nthere are likely terrorist cells already present in the United States, \nhow can we in good conscience grant same-day legal status to more than \n12 million foreign nationals?\n  Naturally, this bill does purport to require a background check. But \ninstead of providing a reasonable timeframe for these reviews, an \nimpossible burden is placed on our already overworked citizenship and \nimmigration services to provide these checks in 24 hours. It simply \ncannot be done. Under our current immigration system, this office \nalready does more of these screenings than it can handle. The \nGovernment Accountability Office reported last year this agency was \nstretched to the breaking point already. This has resulted in an \nunofficial 6-minute rule, the most amount of time that can be spent \nadjudicating any one application. Adding an average of 48,000 \napplications a day more will further backlog an already overtaxed \nsystem, meaning less in-depth reviews and more haphazardly granted \nvisas. Again, more cases and less time for review of these applications \ncan do nothing but increase the likelihood of mistakes.\n  An article in the June 17 edition of the Washington Post explained \nthat a large part of the backlog involved in our current system was due \nto FBI name checks. Delays in FBI name checks already force long \nwaiting times for citizenship applications. The Post reports that of \nabout 329,000 cases pending as of May, 64 percent were stalled for more \nthan 90 days, 32 percent for more than 1 year, and 17 percent for more \nthan 2 years. They added that the backlog appears to get worse because \nof a fee increase slated to take place in July which has prompted a 50-\npercent rise in new naturalization applications so far this year. If a \nnew immigration bill is enacted, millions of foreign nationals would \nalso apply for legalization.\n  This problem is even more apparent considering the difficulties the \nState Department and the Department of Homeland Security have had this \nsummer in implementing the new western hemisphere travel initiative. Of \ncourse, this legislation requires American citizens to have a passport \nfor travel to Canada or Mexico, where that requirement did not exist \nbefore. Although the Federal Government had 3 years to get ready for \nthis new stricter visa requirement and passport requirement, the \nFederal Government failed to adequately prepare, causing disruptions in \nthe lives of tens of thousands of American citizens. If the Federal \nGovernment can't get it right with 3 years' notice to process passport \napplications for American citizens, how will it deal with the increased \ncomplexities and burden of processing up to 12 million foreign \nnationals? I wonder what the Government's response will be to the even \nlarger backlog this bill will create? Will we simply give up on \nbackground checks altogether, when the citizenship and immigration \nservice realizes what an impossible burden has been placed upon it?\n  As we overload our already fragile system and background checks are \neither too cursory to be safe or too delayed to meet unrealistic \ndeadlines, we will be undoubtedly granting legal status to some \nindividuals who should not\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\nget it. The potential danger is actually worse than it might appear at \nfirst blush. Not only do we need to be concerned about terrorist cells \nand other criminals in our country, we should also be concerned about \nthe privileges these individuals will receive with same-day legal \nstatus.\n  Most notably, the ability to travel in and out of the United States \npresents a great threat to us and to others. Those already in our \ncountry with the knowledge and ability to train others could travel to \nforeign nations, teaching terrorist cells everything from combat \ntactics to explosives construction. At the same time, terrorists in our \nNation who do not possess the knowledge and training to participate in \nsuch attacks could use their new travel visas to visit training sites \nin other countries, bringing their newfound knowledge back home to \nAmerica.\n  For example, a May 28 article from the New York Times describes the \nproblems created by free travel in and out of nations surrounding Iraq. \nThat article says:\n\n       The Iraq war, which for years has drawn militants from \n     around the world, is beginning to export fighters and tactics \n     they have honed in the insurgency to neighboring countries \n     and beyond.\n\n  The Times has reported:\n\n       Some of the fighters appear to be leaving as part of the \n     waves of Iraqi refugees crossing borders. . . . But others \n     are dispatched from Iraq for specific missions.\n\n  Granting same-day legal status and the privileges that accompany it \nto poorly screened foreign nationals has the risk of making us less \nsafe and, indeed, potentially helping spread this threat not just to \nAmerica but to other places around the world.\n  The impossible goals of this bill do not stop there. The bill calls \nfor the Department of Homeland Security to define, procure, develop, \nand implement a worker verification system to check 200 million \nAmericans in less than 2 years. How can the American people have any \nfaith in the enforcement provisions of this bill when these provisions \ninclude unattainable goals and untenable standards?\n  For this reason, it is important we not pass any immigration \nlegislation that makes these mistakes and repeats so many from the 1986 \npredecessor. I continue to hope we can pass meaningful, safe \nimmigration reform. Everyone knows our current immigration system is \nbroken, and I wish to see it fixed. But this bill will not do it.\n  Finally, one of the biggest problems we have had with this \nlegislation centers around the way it came to the floor of the Senate. \nWritten behind closed doors, this bill did not even see the light of a \ncommittee room. Instead, it promptly proceeded to the floor of the \nSenate. The short-term result was predictable. Senators wanted to offer \namendments, many of them including important improvements which might \nhave been appropriately dealt with in the committee process.\n  The majority leader's frustration with the number of amendments being \noffered led to that bill being pulled after almost 2 weeks on the \nSenate floor. Now a new bill is back. Instead of learning from our \nmistakes, the bill has once again been secretly negotiated, and will \nonce again forgo the committee process.\n  What is worse, we have been told it will be presented to us with \nbipartisan amendments already chosen by a select few Senators, \nunrepresentative of the wide variety of strongly held views in the \nSenate.\n  There is a list of amendments which I believe ought to be included in \nthis bill, amendments that I think might find support among my \ncolleagues if given an opportunity to offer them--provisions such as \none that would prevent criminal aliens from delaying and even avoiding \ntheir deportation by filing frivolous applications for a Z visa, and \nthen appealing against those denied applications.\n  Another amendment I would offer, if given an opportunity, would \nprohibit criminal aliens, including gang members and absconders, from \ntying up our courts with frivolous appeals from the denial of a request \nfor a waiver of grounds for removal. The bottleneck sure to ensue \nwithout these two provisions will cause extensive delays that will only \nincrease the costs involved with this bill and allow abuse of the \nsystem.\n  A third amendment I would offer, if given an opportunity, would \nrequire judges to consider national security implications before \nissuing nationwide injunctions against immigration enforcement, an \nessential provision to protecting our border, something this bill \nclaims to do.\n  I wish to add an amendment preventing those who have committed \nterrorist acts or aided terrorists from asserting they are meeting the \n``good moral character'' requirement--something that seems so \ninherently obvious that I am shocked this bill, as currently written, \nwould allow it.\n  Last year, Mohammed El Shorbagi pleaded guilty to providing material \nsupport to the terrorist organization known as Hamas. His conviction, \nhowever, did not specifically bar him from seeking American citizenship \nbecause under the law aiding an organization that routinely fires \nrockets on innocent civilians, families, and neighborhoods, abducts and \nkidnaps individuals, and has most recently staged a violent coup of an \nestablished unity government does not in any way affect your ``good \nmoral character,'' as currently written. It is a dangerous shortcoming \nof our laws which will not be addressed because of the closed and \nsecretive manner in which this bill is being considered.\n  I wish also to limit the timeframe for an appeal to 2 years so that \ncourt proceedings do not drag on endlessly, wasting tax dollars, and \nallowing those who are not entitled to the benefits of our immigration \nsystem to remain here indefinitely under the cover of an appeal.\n  These are only five of the amendments which I wish to offer which I \nthink would make this bill better, if I had a chance to offer them and \nif Senators had a chance to vote on them. Others would make it harder \nfor gang members to qualify, force immigrants to file a change of \naddress notification with the Department of Homeland Security when they \nmove, and authorize the detention of dangerous aliens during their \ndeportation trial.\n  Unfortunately, under the process the majority leader will provide us, \nno opportunity for these measures to be considered will be allowed and, \nthus, they will not be in the final bill.\n  Rather, the world's greatest deliberative body will be presented with \na bill that has not been fully considered, will not be fully debated, \nand where there will not be an adequate opportunity to offer and vote \non amendments. Since when did the Senate have so little to say when \nshaping legislation which we will vote on? Since when did the majority \nleader get the power to force legislation on the rest of the Senate?\n  I cannot support this flawed bill or this broken secret process that \nhas produced it. I hope my colleagues will join me in insisting upon \nfree and open debates, which are the hallmark of the Senate, and which \nare the only possible path forward to providing a rational, commonsense \nanswer to the challenge of immigration reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n30 minutes as in morning business, with the time taken from Senator \nKennedy's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                         Healthy Americans Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, there will be a great deal \nof activity in the Senate this week, and I want to take a few minutes \nto talk about the fact that this is going to be a big week in American \nhealth care as well.\n  There will be considerable effort devoted to the State Children's \nHealth Insurance program. I see our friend Senator Hatch on the floor \nof the Senate. I commend Senator Hatch for his work on this program. \nThe effort on the State Children's Health Insurance Program, in \nparticular, has been a bipartisan one, involving Senator Baucus, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Hatch. I commend \ntheir efforts on this legislation. Senator Hatch and I have talked \nabout this in the context of health care reform many times. It is a \nmoral blot on our country that so many youngsters do not have quality, \naffordable health care, do not have good coverage\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\nlike the children of Members of Congress.\n  So I want it understood that I am in strong support of the bipartisan \nefforts on the State Children's Health Insurance program that are \nongoing in the Senate Finance Committee on which Senator Hatch and I \nserve. I particularly commend Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator \nRockefeller, and Senator Hatch for the leadership they have shown.\n  Also, this week there will be several other significant activities in \nhealth care. Tomorrow, the Senate Budget Committee will open hearings \non comprehensive proposals to fix American health care. They will start \nby looking at the bipartisan legislation I have worked on with Senator \nBennett of Utah. It is the first bipartisan proposal to overhaul \nAmerican health care in almost 15 years. That and other approaches will \nbe talked about in the Senate Budget Committee with the chair of our \ncommittee, Senator Conrad, and Senator Gregg, having a longstanding \ninterest on the question of health care reform, realizing you cannot \nget on top of big budgetary challenges in the United States if you do \nnot address health care.\n  Then, finally, at the end of the week, my guess is there are going to \nbe a lot of Americans flocking to the movie theaters to look at Mr. \nMichael Moore's movie. I will say, for purposes of the discussion this \nafternoon, since I am not in the movie business, I will spend my time \nthis afternoon talking about health care legislation that is bipartisan \nin the Senate. Since I have mentioned the question of SCHIP, and how \nimportant it is, and how important it is that it be addressed quickly, \nlet me turn now to the question of the Healthy Americans Act.\n  After 60 years of debate, going back to the days of Harry Truman, I \nbelieve the cure for America's ailing health care system is now within \nreach. My view is we are seeing encouraging signs pop up everywhere.\n  For example, the business community has done an about-face on the \nissue of health care reform. For example, in 1993--the last time \nCongress tackled this issue, during the Clinton administration--the \nbusiness community said: We cannot afford health care reform. Now the \nbusiness community is saying: We cannot afford the status quo. Previous \nadversaries, particularly business and labor, are now coming together \nto work for reform.\n  As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, from our discussions \nwhen I introduced my legislation, the bipartisan Healthy Americans Act, \nwe had Andy Stern, the president of the Service Employees International \nUnion, standing right next to Steve Burd, the president of Safeway \nCompany, and mid-size employers and small employers. So we are seeing \nthe business community that so often has been at odds with labor and \nothers coming together with them saying: We cannot afford the status \nquo.\n  Finally, it seems to me we have had a coming together of Democrats \nand Republicans on this issue. I am very pleased, under the leadership \nof my lead co-sponsor, Senator Bennett, many Republicans have said they \nwill go to a place they have had questions about in the past; that is, \ncovering everybody. You say those words, ``covering everybody,'' and, \nof course, to some people that implies you are going to have a \ngovernment-run plan, it is somehow going to be a socialistic kind of \nplan. Well, many conservatives, many Republicans have come to agree \nwith Senator Bennett and me that you cannot fix American health care \nunless you cover everybody because if you do not cover everybody, what \nyou have is people who are uninsured shifting their bills over to those \nwho are insured.\n  Families USA has done an analysis indicating, in their view, that \nthose who have insurance may pay in the vicinity of $1,000 worth of \ntheir premium to cover people who do not have insurance. So my view is, \nwith Republicans and Democrats coming together in an area saying, \n``Let's make sure everybody is covered,'' we do have positive signs for \nreform.\n  Now, of course, bumping up against these positive signs is the \npopular wisdom. The popular wisdom, of course, is: Oh, Government \ncannot possibly put something together. People say: Oh, Government \ncannot organize a two-car parade, let alone fix something that will be \na seventh of the American economy: American health care. People say \nthere are too many lobbyists--too many lobbyists--many more than \nlegislators. They are going to block it. They say, of course, touching \non the point I made earlier, that people who have coverage, they are \ngoing to say: Gosh, I would rather stay with the devil I know rather \nthan that other guy, that other devil. But I will tell my colleagues, I \nthink the public understands the system is broken, and if now the \nCongress comes forward with a step-by-step strategy to fix American \nhealth care, I think the public will be receptive.\n\n  So let me outline, for purposes of a brief discussion, what goes into \nthe diagnosis with respect to what is ailing American health care. I \nthink, for the most part, people understand what is ailing our health \ncare system, so I am going to make this diagnosis brief. First, for the \namount of money we are spending in this country annually--$2.3 \ntrillion--you could go out and hire a doctor for every seven families \nin the United States. So let's talk about what that means for folks in \nArkansas and what it means for folks in Utah. If you divide the number \nof people in this country--300 million--into $2.3 trillion, which is \nwhat we will be spending on health care this year, you could go out and \nhire a doctor for every seven families in the State of Arkansas, pay \nthe doctor $200,000 for the year and say, Doc, that is your job. You \nare going to take care of seven families. Whenever I am out and about \nspeaking to physician groups, they always come up to me and say: Ron, \nwhere do I go to get my seven families? Because I like that idea of \nbeing able to be a physician again, to actually be an advocate for \npatients. So we are spending enough money.\n  Now, despite these enormous sums and the fact that we have thousands \nof dedicated, caring, and talented health care professionals, the \ncollective value we get for our health care dollar in America is \nshockingly small. For example, we are 31st in the world in life \nexpectancy, having recently surged ahead of Albania but still lagging \nbehind Jordan. On infant mortality, we are beating out Belarus, but we \nare still lagging behind Cuba.\n  Part of our challenge is we don't have a lot of health care; we have \nmostly sick care. Medicare Part A and Part B show this better than \nanything else. In the State of Arkansas, under Part A of Medicare--or \nUtah or Oregon or anywhere else--Medicare will pay thousands of dollars \nfor senior citizens' bills. It goes right from Medicare to a hospital \nin Arkansas and Oregon. Medicare Part B, however, the outpatient part \nof Medicare in our States, pays hardly anything for prevention, hardly \nanything to keep people well, and keep them from landing in the \nhospital and racking up those huge expenses in terms of health care. We \nought to change that. We ought to change it, and I am going to talk a \nbit about how the Healthy Americans Act does it and does it with \nincentives.\n  In addition to this bias against wellness and against preventive \nhealth care, we have a system where the biggest expenditure, which is \nthe tax breaks for employer-based coverage, goes disproportionately to \nthe wealthiest of us and encourages inefficiency to boot. Under the Tax \nCode today, if you are a high-flying CEO, you write off on your taxes \nthe costs of getting a designer smile. But if you are a poor woman \nworking at the corner furniture store, you get virtually nothing. The \nbiggest reductions now in employer-based coverage--the biggest \nreductions, according to a new study by the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation--comes in the area of low-income workers.\n  So that is a bit about the diagnosis, and I already mentioned the \nfact that people who have insurance pay about $1,000 from their premium \nfor folks who are uninsured.\n  Now I wish to talk about what we are going to do about it. What is it \nwe are actually going to do about the big challenges with respect to \nhealth care? When I have gone home and had town meetings, we have \nalways had kind of a back and forth early on between folks who say they \nwant a government-run health care system of some sort and folks who \nwant a private sector-oriented system. The discussion goes back and \nforth, and I am sure my colleagues have had similar experiences when \nthey are home talking about health\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\ncare. But finally, after a little bit of back and forth, somebody in \nthe audience stands up and says: Ron, we want health care like you \npeople in Congress have. We want coverage like you people and your \nfamilies have. Then everybody starts cheering. Everybody is cheering \nfor that. Nobody knows exactly what it involves or what it constitutes, \nbut they figure if Members of Congress have it, that is what they want \nas well. So I very often, at that point, reach into my back pocket and \ntake out my wallet, take out my Blue Cross card and ask people if that \nis what they want. It is private insurance. It covers me. It covers the \nWyden family. People say, yes, that is what they want.\n  So I wrote a piece of legislation, the Healthy Americans Act, that \ngives folks across the country--in Oregon and Arkansas and Utah, across \nthe country--guaranteed coverage such as Members of Congress get, \ndelivered in a manner such as Members of Congress have, with choices \nand benefits such as Member of Congress have. Folks can get all the \ndetails about how this works at my Web site: Wyden.senate.gov.\n  Now, the Lewin Group--they are an independent, nonpartisan health \ncare consulting group; kind of the gold standard for health policy \nanalysis--says you can make that pledge, the pledge that I made for \ncoverage at least as good as Members of Congress get, for all Americans \nfor the $2.3 trillion that is spent annually, and, according to the \nLewin Group, you would reduce health care spending by almost $1.5 \ntrillion over the next decade.\n  Here is a bit of how the Healthy Americans Act works. Our country has \nabout 300 million people, as I have mentioned. I don't alter the basic \nstructure of care for Medicare, the military, and the small Government \nprograms. The reforms I make to the Medicare program keep the basic \nstructure of Medicare as is, but we do tackle the two biggest \nchallenges facing the program.\n\n  The first is we are seeing a huge increase--a huge increase--in \nchronic illness. These are folks with heart and stroke and diabetes, a \nvariety of problems that are chronic in nature. In fact, the estimate \nis about 5 percent of those on Medicare use up about 60 percent of the \nMedicare expenses. So we create efficiencies for how to better manage \nthe chronic care that this large group of people incur. I think it will \nhelp generate savings for the long term. As we do that, we attack the \nunderlying reason so many Americans need chronic care; that is, \nprevention has been given short shrift. So under our legislation, we \ncreate incentives for parents to enroll children and their family in \npreventive programs. They get lower premiums if they do. With respect \nto Medicare specifically, for the first time we authorize the \nGovernment to lower Medicare Part B premiums, the outpatient premiums, \nso that if seniors lower their blood pressure, lower their cholesterol, \nand engage in sensible, preventive medicine, they would experience \nlower premiums.\n  So we make improvements to Medicare, and Government programs clearly \ncan be refined. But I am of the view that in the area of Medicare and \nthe VA and some of the smaller Government health care programs, we \nbasically ought to focus on keeping the basic structure as it is and \nmaking improvements as I have outlined in the chronic care and \nprevention care within that basic structure. So if you do that, if you \nset aside Medicare and the VA, you are left with about 250 million \npeople. About 170 million of those folks get their coverage through \nemployer-based health care. About 48 million are uninsured. They are \noften without any coverage at all. They may have some very modest \ncoverage--charity care--and then we have folks in the individual market \nand Medicaid.\n  So let me describe what we do for folks in that area where there are \n250 million people, folks who aren't covered by Medicare or the VA. If \na citizen does have employer coverage, the employer is required by law \nto cash out the worker. We do it in a way so that with the very first \npaychecks, the first paychecks issued under the Healthy Americans Act, \nthe worker will win and the employer will win.\n  Let's say, hypothetically, in Arkansas or Oregon, you have a worker \nwho has a salary of $50,000, and the employer is purchasing $12,000 \nworth of health care benefits for them as well. Under the legislation, \nthe employer is required by law to give the worker $62,000 in \ncompensation--salary plus the value of their health care benefits. \nThen, we adjust the workers' tax bracket so they don't pay any \nadditional tax on the additional compensation. That is important \nbecause, for all practical purposes, Senator Bennett and I have \nlegislated the biggest pay raise in the country's history by putting \nthat extra cash in the workers' pockets. So when the worker sees it--we \nspent a lot of time talking about it--the worker says: That is pretty \ncool getting all this extra money. What is the catch? There has to be a \ncatch if I am getting all this extra compensation. There is a catch. \nThe worker, under the Healthy Americans Act, has to buy a basic health \ninsurance policy, including prevention, outpatient, inpatient, and \ncatastrophic--a basic policy. The first thing the worker is going to \nsay is: How in the world do I do that? How am I going to be able to buy \nmy own coverage? So we set up something called Health Help to make it \neasy for people, and people could do it online, to purchase their own \ncoverage. We fixed the private marketplace to make it easier. Private \ninsurance companies can't cherry-pick. They can't take just the healthy \npeople and send sick folks over to Government programs more fragile \nthan they are. There is community rating. People go into big pools so \nyou can spread the cost of the risk. There is guaranteed issue so you \ncan't be turned down. We also prevent people from being hammered \nbecause they have a preexisting illness.\n  So that is the way it works for folks who now have coverage, about \n170 million of them. In the case of the worker I described in Oregon \nand Arkansas, $50,000 in salary, $12,000 in health care, $62,000 in \ncompensation, if they can use that to go out, say, and buy a basic \nhealth insurance policy for $11,500 rather than the $12,000 they are \nnow getting for health care, they can be on their way to Oregon for a \ngreat fishing trip in Central Oregon, because that is exactly what we \nare trying to do, is to create marketplace incentives for folks to try \nto hold their costs down. If the employer doesn't offer the coverage, \nemployers make a contribution on the basis of their revenue per \nemployee.\n  We had three groups of employers we worked on with this: large \nemployers, medium-sized employers, and small employers, and when we \nlaunched the whole effort, there were representatives from each of \nthose three employer groups. So it is a bipartisan bill: Senator \nBennett, a Republican, and myself, a Democrat. It is bipartisan, and it \nhas the support of business and labor organizations.\n  Where does the money come from to pay for the Healthy Americans Act? \nWe can make substantial savings by redirecting the Tax Code away from \nthe system today which disproportionately favors the most affluent and \nrewards inefficiency. We steer it more to the middle class and the \nworking poor. There are substantial administrative savings. According \nto the Lewin Group, this consulting group for private insurance, we \nhave the administrative costs down to under 5 percent. That means we \nare going to systematically drive out a lot of what is being spent on \nmarketing and underwriting and various kinds of inefficiency, which is \nclearly unneeded. We make substantial savings in what is called the \ndisproportionate share of funding that now goes to the hospitals when \nthey have to pick up the bills for those who are uninsured. It makes so \nmuch more sense. Instead of a poor person who has no coverage going to \na hospital emergency room in Arkansas or Oregon or Utah, it makes so \nmuch more sense to use the scarce dollars so that person can afford a \nprivate insurance policy. It would be targeted at outpatient care and \ninpatient care and prevention rather than frittering away so much of \nour scarce resources for hospital emergency room services.\n  This legislation does that. The insurance companies compete not on \nthe basis of cherry-picking but on the basis of price, benefit, and \nquality. Finally, we make care for the poor much more efficient and \nhumane. Right now, if you are poor in America, you have to go out and \ntry to squeeze yourself into one of perhaps 30 boxes in order to be \nable to get care as someone who is low\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\nincome. I think that is degrading and inefficient. We can do better.\n  Under the Healthy Americans Act, we say care for those individuals is \nautomatic. They would get covered automatically. Once they are signed \nup, they are in forever. I know there are many who are saying that \nfixing health care is not possible in this Congress. I already \nmentioned the good work of Senator Rockefeller, Senator Hatch, Senator \nBaucus, and Senator Grassley on the children's health program. I will \nbe with them all the way. They have done very good work. The fact that \nso many kids don't have decent health care is morally wrong and \nCongress ought to address it. I am going to do everything I can to help \nthem.\n  I think this Congress ought to go farther. I don't think we got an \nelection certificate to sit around and wait for another Presidential \ncampaign to get going. Fortunately, under the leadership of Senators \nConrad and Gregg, the Senate Budget Committee will get going tomorrow, \nlooking at a variety of options to fix health care. We are going to \nstart with the Healthy Americans Act, but certainly a lot of colleagues \nhave good ideas, and many are bipartisan. Certainly, Senators Feingold \nand Graham have good ideas. The American people don't want us to wait \nfor 2 more years. They are not going to be tricked into comprehensive \nreform. The subject is too personal. They want to know what the \nbenefits are going to be, what their costs are going to be; but they \nare ready. They know the current system cannot be sustained given our \nrapidly aging population, the huge increase in chronic illness, the \ndisadvantages the employers face, and the tough global markets.\n  The American people know the current system cannot be sustained. They \nunderstand it is broken and we are going to show them there is a better \nway, a bipartisan way. The hearing that will begin tomorrow, and the \nbill Senator Bennett and I have, will be the first bipartisan proposal \nto overhaul American health care in 15 years. I don't think we ought to \nwait 2 more years. That is not what we got an election certificate to \ndo. Let's pass the SCHIP legislation. One of the key sponsors is on the \nfloor this afternoon. Let us move on to address a new direction in \nAmerican health care to finally make it possible for all of our \ncitizens to get under the tent for basic, affordable, quality health \ncoverage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Employee Free \nChoice Act. Before that, I compliment the Senator from Oregon for the \noutstanding leadership he provided on this issue. Every American \ndeserves access to affordable health insurance. This is the 21st \ncentury. He has worked in a bipartisan way to get important \nperspectives on the table, and I will add my voice to that discussion. \nI applaud his leadership on this issue. It is something we have to get \ndone. Time is passing us by and we have it in our capacity to do it. \nThe Senator from Oregon has provided important leadership.\n  Again, I rise to voice my opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act. \nIt is kind of a misnomer. There is not a lot of free choice in what has \nbeen labeled the Employee Free Choice Act.\n  It is an awesome privilege for those of us who serve in the Senate to \nhave this magnificent Capitol as a workplace. Its massive dome and \nperfect symmetry have been an inspiration to generations. Its most \nvital feature is something none of us have seen: its sturdy foundation, \nwhich lies beneath this building. Our democracy has a foundation as \nwell: It is the ability of our citizens to cast their votes freely, \nfairly, and secretly, without anyone looking over their shoulder.\n  Certainly, that is the expectation when we walk into the booth to \nvote on election day. All of us have our place in this Senate based on \nthe right of individuals to step forward and cast a secret ballot, \nwhich is one of the fundamental underpinnings of democracy. We pull the \ncurtain, mark our ballot in private, and rely on our own personal \nconscience and convictions, free from any outside pressures.\n  For more than 200 years, the secret ballot has been one of the most \nfundamental principles of American democracy. As the great \nrevolutionary figure Thomas Paine wrote:\n\n       The right to vote is the right upon which all other rights \n     depend.\n\n  That same principle has held true for American workers who have had \nthe right to a secret ballot when it comes to unionization for the last \n60 years.\n  I believe in a worker's right to union representation. I served for 8 \nyears as mayor of St. Paul and I worked closely with unions to ensure \nthat their right to organize was protected. But I also strongly believe \nin a worker's right to a secret ballot election. I will fight to \nprotect that right--a right that the vast majority of Americans and \nunion members support.\n  This fundamental belief in a worker's right to a secret ballot \nelection has long been upheld by the courts. Throughout the years, the \ncourts have spoken of the importance of secret ballot elections. The DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals said it best in a 1991 case that the ``freedom \nof choice is a matter at the very center of our national labor \nrelations policy, and a secret election is the preferred method of \ngauging choice.''\n  Although the secret ballot process has served workers and unions \nwell, the right to a secret ballot election is now under serious \nthreat.\n  Already passed by the House, the Employee Free Choice Act would take \naway a worker's right to a private vote for union representation. \nSimply put, the passage of this legislation would deny American workers \nthe choice to freely and privately choose whether to join a union by \nreplacing the secret ballot process with a card-check process. So we \nwould be telling our workers that instead of having the right to a \nfederally supervised election by secret ballot, that gets tossed aside \nand we now use a card-check process--somebody coming up and saying, \n``do you want to sign this?''\n\n  What is fascinating--and I have been involved in this business for 5 \nyears as a Senator, 8 years as a mayor, and in the attorney general \noffice for 19 years. I worked on a lot of issues--I hear a lot of \ndiscussion by my colleagues about some of the concerns impacting \nAmerican workers today, the challenges we face in dealing with \nglobalization and the pressures of working people. We should deal with \nthose, but this is not the answer. This is not the answer to the issues \nand concerns being raised. Taking away the right to a secret ballot is \nnot the answer.\n  Under the card-check process, there is no ballot, no voting booth, no \nballot box, and no privacy for the worker's choice. Rather than a \nballot, there is a union authorization card. Rather than the safe \nconfines of the voting booth, the worker is surrounded by union \nmembers, and employers, as he or she considers the union authorization \ncard. Rather than the privacy afforded by the secret ballot process, a \nworker's decision is publicly known.\n  The reality is that unions also fully appreciate the importance of \nsecret ballot elections. For instance, when it comes to union \ndecertification--in other words, when workers want to terminate union \nrepresentation--the unions believe in secret ballot elections, which \nthe AFL-CIO has characterized as ``the surest means for avoiding \ndecisions which are the result of group pressures and not individual \ndecision.''\n  I want to protect individual decisions. In the Senate, we should \nprotect the sanctity of individuals' decisions, and we should protect \nthe sanctity of federally supervised secret ballot elections. \nCertainly, if they are good enough for decertification, they should be \ngood enough for union organizing.\n  I come to this debate with a strong and successful record of working \nwith unions and fighting for American workers, including increasing the \nminimum wage and supporting collective bargaining rights for public \nsafety workers. Again, I was mayor of St. Paul for 8 years, and during \nthat time we settled every contract at the bargaining table. I am also \nproud of the support I have received over the years from the police \nunions, fire unions, building trade unions. That support is very \nimportant to me and I remain fully committed to the collective \nbargaining process.\n  The legislation pending before this body hurts workers, and it is on \nthat basis that I cannot support it.\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\n  As we soon celebrate the July 4 holiday, we should honor our Nation's \nfreedoms and liberties by ensuring that a worker's fundamental rights \nto a secret ballot election is protected. We should do so out of \nrespect for our Nation's founding principles, so workers can make \nimportant choices about their workplaces and livelihoods without fear \nof repercussions for expressing their honest opinions. That is the \nsimple fairness on which our whole system has rested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the proponents of this measure have tried \nto make the case that unions are good and that they deliver higher \nwages, benefits and overall prosperity for their members. Whether that \nis true or not is not the issue we are debating here today.\n  In fact, I am struck by the irony of the proponents' argument. If \nunions are so valuable to working Americans, unions should not have any \ndifficulty winning an NLRB-supervised representation election. What do \ngood unions have to fear from secret ballot elections?\n  Whether unions are good for workers is beside the point. This debate \nis about the method by which workers are allowed to choose a union.\n  If workers want to have a union in their workplace, they should be \nable to freely vote for one. But, workers cannot make this decision \nfreely with either the employer or the union looking over their \nshoulders.\n  Card check is a recipe for legalized harassment and intimidation. The \nSenate should not allow this measure to pass.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak against cloture on the so-called \nEmployee Free Choice Act, because it promotes neither freedom nor \nchoice for employees when it comes to union representation. Rather, the \ncard-check certification, the binding interest arbitration, and the \npenalty sanctions of the so-called Employee Free Choice Act would \ndeprive employees of their freedom and choice in union representation \nthat the National Labor Relations Act guarantees them and that the \nNational Labor Relations Board secures for them.\n\n  The supporters of the so-called Employee Free Choice Act claim that \nthe current system is broken and that the so-called Employee Free \nChoice Act will correct the deficiencies of the current system. \nHowever, they are misguided, because there is no free choice when an \nemployee is bound by signatures on union authorization cards instead of \nvotes in a secret ballot election made after an employee can learn \nabout the advantages and disadvantages of union representation.\n  There is no free choice when a Government-appointed arbitrator \ndecides the terms of a union contract that is binding for at least two \nyears and employees are denied the right to vote on whether to accept \nthe union contract. In other words, it's mandatory arbitration on both \nthe employees and the company.\n  Contrary to the claims of the supporters of H.R. 800, the National \nLabor Relations Act is effective in providing for and protecting the \nfree choice of employees in union representation. In fact, current \nstatistics from the National Labor Relations Board demonstrate that the \nsystem does work.\n  In a recently released study of statistics for 2006, the win rate of \nunions in secret ballot elections supervised by the National Labor \nRelations Board has increased for the tenth consecutive year. That is \ncorrect--unions have a rising in secret ballot elections over the span \nof the last 10 years.\n  For example, in 2006, the union win rate was 61.5 percent of all \nrepresentation elections, which was up from 61.4 percent in 2005. Since \n1996, unions have won more than 50 percent of all NLRB-supervised \nelections in each year. Thus, secret ballot elections supervised by the \nNational Labor Relations Board are effective and time-honored avenues \nfor employees to express their free choice on union representation.\n  More significantly, unions are winning well over 50 percent of these \nsecret ballot elections. Yet the supporters of this bill, H.R. 800, now \nwant to cast aside this effective system and give unions the ability to \nincrease membership and dues by a forced card check system and a \nguarantee of a Government-imposed initial union contract.\n  Additional proof that the National Labor Relations Board is \nconducting union representation elections in an efficient and timely \nmanner is found in reports from the Board itself. For 2006, the median \ntime between the filing of a union's election petition and the election \nwas just 39 days. In addition, 94.2 percent of all initial union \nrepresentation elections were held within 56 days from the time the \nunion filed its election petition.\n  In short, the system is not broken. Rather, the system works, and it \nworks in favor of unions in over 50 percent of these secret ballot \nelections. If there is a breakdown as unions claim, then it may be that \nit is with unions and their appeal and message to the working men and \nwomen of this country. The reason unions are fighting for passage of \nthe so-called Employee Free Choice Act is that they are fighting to \nmaintain their political relevance. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, unions' membership of the \nprivate sector workforce in this country is only 7.4 percent today. \nThis is down from 7.8 percent in 2005. It is a continuation of the \ndecline in union membership from 20.1 percent in 1983.\n  Thus, the so-called Employee Free Choice Act is not as important and \nimperative as organized labor has claimed because it does not protect \nthe free choice of employees in union representation. It has nothing to \ndo with leveling the playing field in a globally competitive market. \nRather, the so-called Employee Free Choice Act is a quintessential \npolitical power play. It is about changing the law by turning your back \non one of the hallmarks of a democratic society--a secret ballot \nelection--and by supplanting the collective bargaining process with a \nfederally mandated union contract. With these changes in the law, it \nwill be easier for unions to increase membership by forced card check \nand to increase their financial dues to sprinkle around so that unions \ncan maintain their political influence which is disproportionate to \ntheir shrinking membership.\n  I encourage my colleagues to stand up for working men and women by \nopposing this ill-advised legislation.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time that somebody stood up to defend \nthe hard-working career employees of the National Labor Relations \nBoard, NLRB, who are under attack from organized labor and who are \nbeing demeaned by this legislation, this so-called Employee Free Choice \nAct.\n  As I said, in 1978, during the labor law reform debate, the NLRB is \none of the finest and most efficient organizations in the Federal \nGovernment, and its lawyers serve the public interest by representing \nthe Nation's employees--not unions or employers but employees. They are \namong the best lawyers in Government or, for that matter, anywhere in \nthe private sector, anywhere in private practice law firms, and their \nrepresentation of employees is free of charge. Although I certainly do \nnot always agree with the NLRB or its decisions, I have consistently \ndefended the agency over the 31 years I have been in the Senate.\n  NLRB lawyers in Washington and throughout the country in regional and \nsubregional offices are among the most dedicated protectors of employee \nrights--apparently even more so than unions if one considers the \nunions' position on H.R. 800 denying secret ballot rights of employees \nand depriving employees of a vote on wages and terms and employment \nconditions resulting from a federally imposed union contract.\n  If H.R. 800 were to pass, NLRB lawyers would have to become, in \neffect, handwriting analysts, making sure employee signatures on union-\nsolicited authorization cards are not forged or fraudulent. The proud \nrecord of the agency and its lawyers in conducting secret ballot \nelections for union representation and in protecting the rights of \nemployees in the election process would be history. The voting booth, \nthe ballot box, the American flag, the NLRB agent standing guard to \nmake sure the election is conducted without intimidation or coercion by \nunions or employers--all that would be thrown out and replaced with one \nrole: simply counting union authorization cards submitted by union \norganizers.\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nWith that, of course, would potentially come the loss of career NLRB \njobs, since how many handwriting experts does the NLRB have or need? \nThey deserve better treatment from organized labor, as do the employees \nthe NLRB seeks to protect.\n  Lost also under H.R. 800 would be the significance for employees of \nwalking into the voting booth to cast a private vote for or against a \nunion. After all, under the card check system in H.R. 800, employees do \nnot get to vote against union representation even though they will be \nbound by principles of majority rule and exclusive representation.\n  Let's get that clear. If 50 percent of the employees plus one sign \ncards, the other 49.9 percent are disenfranchised. If they don't want a \nunion, that is tough; they are automatically unionized. That is not \nright. Under the card check system in H.R. 800, employees do not get to \nvote against union representation even though they will be bound by \nprinciples of majority rule and exclusive representation. Their vote, \nif one can call it that, is not signing a card, assuming they are even \nasked to sign a card, which is far different from having the \nopportunity of saying no.\n\n  Under the current NLRB secret ballot election process, all employees \ndesignated as an appropriate unit get to vote, even though some may not \nexercise that right. Under the card check system in H.R. 800, \napparently all a union organizer has to do is define a unit of \nemployees appropriate for collective bargaining--for example, a group \nof employees who share a community of interest--and then solicit \nauthorization cards from a majority of employees in that unit. Once the \norganizers reach signatures from 50 percent plus one, all they do is \nthen take the signed cards to the NLRB for certification, regardless of \nwhat the other 50 percent of the employees really feel about the \nprocess.\n  As under current law, of course, the NLRB may make a determination \nthat the unit is an appropriate unit for bargaining, although not \nnecessarily the appropriate unit. However, under the card check process \nof H.R. 800, the other 49 percent of the employees may not even know \nuntil after the fact that they were part of a petitioned-for-bargaining \nunit since they would never have been given an opportunity to vote or \neven asked to sign union authorization cards. At least under the \ncurrent system, they are notified that they are part of a petitioned-\nfor-bargaining unit and given the opportunity to vote for or against \nthe union in a secret ballot election.\n  There are many victims of H.R. 800--employees, employers, the NLRB \nand its career employees and, most importantly, sound national labor \npublic policy. The only winners under H.R. 800 would be the union \nleaders and those who slavishly do their bidding in exchange for \npolitical support.\n  Of course, I believe those who vote against cloture on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 800 will be the true political winners since we will \nhave joined the majority of Americans for protecting the rights of \nemployees through a secret ballot election and against fear, coercion, \nand intimidation by union organizers to have employees sign union \nauthorization cards. We will have stood by employees and not the union \nbosses. By defeating cloture on this radical legislation, we will have \nprevented the economic catastrophe of having federally appointed \narbitrators impose wages, benefits, and terms of employment.\n  Ultimately, the employees will be the winners by stopping this \nantiemployee legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the debate we are having in the Senate on \nthe Employee Free Choice Act is about workers' rights. It is about the \nplight of the American worker. It is about workers being able to \norganize. And my guess is that the Senator from Illinois, the Presiding \nOfficer, perhaps even the Senator from Utah, was in the Chamber of the \nHouse some years ago when a man from Poland came to speak to us. I want \nto recount that today because I want to recount how strongly our \ncountry felt then and how much we admired the man from Poland who spoke \nto a joint session of Congress and what it means symbolically for \nworkers to be able to organize.\n  It was interesting to watch from afar an organization called \nSolidarity in Poland, a group of workers organized under the banner of \nSolidarity. Well, one day, in a joint session of Congress, we heard \nfrom a foreign leader.\n  The joint session is full of pageantry. The House and the Senate are \ngathered together in the Chamber of the House, and the Doorkeeper \nannounces the Supreme Court, then announces the Cabinet Secretaries, \nthen the Senate Members, and then everyone is in the Chamber. And \nusually they announce the President of the United States as he comes to \ngive a State of the Union Address, or perhaps, on rare occasions, a \nspecial message. On even rarer occasions, they will announce a foreign \nleader.\n  On this day, the Doorkeeper of the House of Representatives announced \nLech Walesa from Poland, and this rather short, chubby man came \nforward, with a handlebar mustache. He came to the dais in the House of \nRepresentatives. The applause began and continued and continued and \ncontinued. This man, Lech Walesa from Poland, began speaking, and he \ngave an enormously powerful speech. Here is what he said.\n  He reminded us that it had been 10 years prior to that time, on a \nSaturday morning in a shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, that this man had \nbeen fired as an electrician in that shipyard. He was leading a strike \nof Polish workers in that shipyard against the Communist government.\n  He recounted that on that Saturday he was seized by the Communist \nsecret police and beaten, and he was beaten badly. He was taken over to \nthe side of the shipyard and was hoisted on top of and thrown over the \nbarbed-wire fence, and he lay on the ground face down, bleeding, \noutside of that shipyard wondering what to do next.\n  What should this man, this unemployed electrician who had now just \nbeen beaten by the Communist secret police and thrown over the barbed-\nwire fence at the shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, what should he do next? \nHe lay face down on the ground wondering.\n  The history books tell us what he did next. He pulled himself up off \nthe dirt, brushed himself off, and climbed back over the fence into the \nsame shipyard to continue leading the strike. And 10 years later, he \nwas announced at the back door of the House of Representatives as the \nPresident of the country of Poland. This man, Lech Walesa, was not an \nintellectual, not a soldier, not a businessman, and not a diplomat. He \nwas an unemployed electrician leading an organization called \nSolidarity, which is an organization about working people.\n  These workers risked everything in pursuit of one central idea--that \npeople ought to be free to choose their own destiny. And because of \nSolidarity and because of the work they did, they threw off the yoke of \ncommunism, the heavy boot of communism that existed in Poland, and \nPoland became free. Then it happened in Czechoslovakia, and then \nRomania, and East Germany. They lit the fuse that caused the explosion \nthat got rid of communism in Eastern Europe.\n  Here is what Lech Walesa said about what happened inside that \nshipyard and the years following. He said: You know, we didn't have any \nguns--the Communist government in Poland had all the guns. We didn't \nhave any bullets--the Communist government had all the bullets. We were \na bunch of workers armed with an idea that people ought to be free to \nchoose their own destiny.\n  And he said: My friends, ideas are more powerful than guns.\n  This country loved Solidarity. Ronald Reagan, the American people, \nthe Congress--we embraced these workers of Poland--Lech Walesa and the \ncourageous workers who followed him, workers organizing under a banner \ncalled Solidarity. The ability to form labor organizations, the \ndevelopment of what those organizations mean to people, was key to \ndefeating communism and to the cause of freedom. Think of what labor \nmeant to Eastern Europe. It was\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nthe spark. Yes, workers organizing represented the spark that defeated \ncommunism in Eastern Europe. These were ordinary people with \nextraordinary courage, uncommon valor.\n  When Lech Walesa spoke from the dais in the House of Representatives \n10 years after he was beaten in that shipyard, 10 years after laying \nface down in the dirt wondering what to do next, he showed up at the \ndoor of our legislative Chamber as the President of this country \nsaying: Ideas are more powerful than guns.\n  Now, fast-forward to today, a time when workers in this country all \ntoo often are left behind, especially workers who are working hourly \njobs. Workers who are going to work wondering whether they will have a \njob tomorrow because their employers are becoming bigger and stronger \nand more powerful. Employers that have decided that the bottom line is \nwhat is important and that they can actually increase their profits by \nmoving jobs overseas. So, they think, we will just tell our workers: \nYou know what. You are just like wrenches. We can use you and throw you \naway, and we will move the job to Sri Lanka, to Bangladesh, to India, \nor to China. So American workers are told: You don't matter much.\n  I have been on the Senate floor 100 times talking about all of these \ncompanies that have decided they want all the benefits America has to \noffer, but they don't want to hire Americans. They want to produce \ntheir products elsewhere, where they can pay pennies an hour. What has \nhappened in recent years to the American workers is downward pressure \non their income, fewer retirement benefits, fewer health care benefits, \nthe threat of seeing their jobs moved overseas. One might ask, if labor \norganizing is so effective, why is this occurring in this country? Why \ncan't workers get together to represent the countervailing power \nagainst big companies so workers get their fair share of the income?\n\n  The answer is the deck is stacked against them at this point. That is \nwhy there is legislation on the floor of the Senate today being \nconsidered to try to see if we can't give people the opportunities to \norganize effectively once again.\n  Do you know that in nearly one-half of the cases in this country, 2 \nyears after workers have already voted to form a union they still don't \nhave a contract because the employer refuses to bargain with the \nunion--2 years after the employees voted to form a union and they have \nnot yet been able to form a union. Let me say that again. In almost \none-half the cases where they have already decided to vote to form a \nunion, 2 years later workers do not have a contract. Why would that be \nthe case? Because there are a dozen ways for employers to fight it and \nprevent it. This legislation is legislation that says let's try to even \nup the score a little bit, provide some balance, provide some \nopportunity for workers to get together to organize.\n  The evidence is pretty overwhelming. The income of workers who have \nthe capability of organizing is significantly different. Cashiers at \ngrocery stores and other stores earn 46 percent more if they are union \nthan if they are nonunion. Union food preparation workers earn nearly \n50 percent more than nonunion workers. Union maids and housekeepers \nearn 31 percent more than their nonunion counterparts. Union workers \nare twice as likely to have employer-sponsored health benefits and \npensions at work. They are four times more likely to have a secure \ndefined benefit pension plan than nonunion workers. Those facts are \npretty clear--they are the benefits of workers being able to organize.\n  The legislation we have before us is legislation that says we think \nthe right of people to organize is very important.\n  I have talked at length on the floor about these issues as well. I \nspoke about James Filer many times. James Filer died, I said, of lead \npoisoning. He was shot 54 times, I guess that is lead poisoning. In \nLudlow, CO, shot 54 times. Do you know why James Filer was shot 54 \ntimes? Because he believed people who were sent down underground to dig \nfor coal, to mine for coal, ought to be able to have two things: No. 1, \nwork in a safe workplace and, No. 2, be paid a fair wage. Because James \nFiler spent his life working for that, believing that workers who go \nunderground ought to get a fair day's pay and ought to work in a safe \nmine, he was killed.\n  I could give you other names of those who have fought for workers' \nrights, risked their lives fighting for workers' rights. This country \nhas been better and moved forward as a result of workers being able to \norganize.\n  Yes, we need entrepreneurs, we need capitalists, we need investors, \nwe need incentives--we need all the things that come together in this \nsociety to succeed. But we need workers. Workers are not disposable. \nThe American worker is not disposable. Workers represent one of the \nsignificant building blocks of progress in this country.\n  In recent years, what has happened to us is we have decided American \nworkers should compete against a different standard. The standard is \nsomeone in China working for 30 cents an hour. If you can't compete \nagainst that, tough luck, you lose your job.\n  I will not go through all the stories. I could stand here for hours \ntelling stories, company after company, about that. But the fact is, \nAmerican workers have struggled. The struggle in this country has taken \nplace for a century, to lift our standards up: Safe workplace, child \nlabor laws, wage-and-hour laws, minimum wages, the right to organize. \nFor a century, we went through that process and we lifted America up \nand expanded the middle class dramatically. That has been the success \nof this great country.\n  Now we are seeing, brick by brick, that foundation being taken apart. \nThis legislation is one piece of the remedy. It says, if we care about \nand stand for and believe in the right of workers to organize, then \nthat right has to be a right we expect to be available to workers, \nrather than a right that is abrogated by employers who do not want to \nhave anything to do with workers who organize.\n  The stories are endless about the bad things that happen to workers \nwho try to organize. One in five active union supporters is illegally \nfired during union-organizing campaigns--20 percent are fired. In 78 \npercent of the elections, employers require supervisors to deliver \nanti-union messages to the workers whose jobs they pay and control. In \n51 percent of the elections, employers force workers to attend closed-\ndoor, anti-union meetings, and they threaten to close the workplace if \nemployees vote for union representation.\n  These are a few of the one-sided election rules that tilt the playing \nfield in favor of the management of the company. The worker hardly \nstands a chance. That is what is happening.\n  For all of the hyperbole that is trying to scare people about it, \nthis legislation is very simple, and it is very democratic. If the \nmajority of employees in a workplace sign up to decide they want to \norganize as a workplace, then this country ought to respect that. That \nis why we need legislation.\n  I started by talking about Lech Walesa and Solidarity. It is not only \nforeign workers who organize whom we should respect. We should respect \nthe right of workers in this country who organize as well.\n  I would like to hear someone on the floor of the Senate stand up--I \nhave not heard that yet--but stand up and say Circuit City is a \nwonderful example of where we ought to head in this country. Circuit \nCity announced one day, in a newspaper account, that they decided to \nget rid of some 3,400 of their workers. Their CEO apparently authorized \nthat announcement to be made. The CEO was making $10 million a year and \n3,400 workers were to get fired because they were making $11 an hour, \nand that was too much money to be paying American workers. So Circuit \nCity said--again with a CEO and other executives making millions of \ndollars a year--we will fire 3,400 people and rehire people at $8 an \nhour and save money.\n  I suppose you can save money that way. I am not sure that is a \nparticularly good message to American workers: Come work here, get some \nexperience here and by the time you get some experience, we think we \ncan find somebody who will work for less money than you. That's the \nmessage: we prefer to have inexperienced workers rather than \nexperienced workers, we think $11 an hour is too much for you and your \nfamily. What kind of a message is that? I didn't hear anybody talk \nabout that much. It was one big yawn around here with that sort of \nthing.\n  That kind of approach, that I think devalues the workforce in this \ncountry,\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\nis something I think we ought to care about. The underlying legislation \nwe are talking about is something we ought to care about as well \nbecause it stands up for American workers. It says, in this country, we \nlive free. If you want to organize, you have a right to organize and \nthe rules ought to be fair. The deck ought not be stacked against you. \nThat is why we have legislation being considered today and I am pleased \nto support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bond \nbe given the floor immediately after my remarks and I be granted up to \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to my friend from \nNorth Dakota. He is a friend and very fine man and good Senator, but I \nhave been a little bit amazed at some of the things he said. First, I \nhave only been here 31 years, but I was one of those who did a lot to \nhelp Lech Walesa. My dearest friend in the labor movement happened to \nbe the international vice president of the AFL-CIO, Irving Brown. \nIrving Brown headed our tripartite representation at the International \nLabor Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. He was probably the most \nrespected labor leader in the world. He took on the Soviets and their \nphony trade union organization that was trying to take over the French \ndocks and he beat them. He risked his life every day of his life for \nfree trade unionism, internationally.\n  When he died I was, as far as I could see, the only Republican \ninvited to his memorial service. He went into Paris at the end of the \nSecond World War--before the end of the Second World War--through the \nunderground, and stayed there and helped topple the Nazis and then \nstayed there and defeated the Communists who tried to take over the \nFrench docks. If they had been able to do that, they would have had a \nworldwide trade union that would have been anything but in the best \ninterests of the workers. He was the one who came up with the idea for \nthe National Endowment for Democracy, and I worked very hard to get \nthat enacted here and also was one of the first members of the board of \ndirectors of the National Endowment for Democracy.\n  I think he would have been horrified with what this bill does, taking \naway the right of workers to have a secret ballot election and \nreplacing it with the ability of 50 percent of the workers plus one, \nwho sign cards, mandating a union for every other employee. The fact of \nthe matter is, doing away with secret ballot elections is anything but \nDemocratic.\n  I have to say I am amazed they are trying to sell this to the \nAmerican public. I don't think they can. They can't sell it to the \nunion members out there, roughly 70 percent of whom are against doing \naway with secret ballot elections--and for good reason. Once they start \ndown that road, then you can have Government interference and a whole \nbunch of other interferences that will take away people's freedoms and \nrights.\n  This bill is a disgrace. Even worse is the mandatory arbitration this \nbill imposes on employers and employees for up to 2 years if they do \nnot agree within 90 days of collective bargaining, which usually always \ntakes longer, and 30 days of mediation. Then the Federal Government can \nstep in and determine the wages, terms, and conditions of employment.\n  That is a ridiculous approach. That is even more dangerous than the \ncard-check part of this. I can tell you this, as one who helped Lech \nWalesa, who met with him in Gdansk, who had dinner with him over in \nGdansk, and also with Father Jankowski, who was the Catholic priest who \nheld mass on the docks with guns trained upon his back, all I can say \nis I do not think their belief in free trade unionism consisted of \nhaving a card check system. A system that would bind 100 percent of \nemployees to a union when only 50 percent plus 1 decided to unionize \nthrough a coerced and nontransparent signing of a card.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to H.R. 800, the misleadingly named Employee Free Choice Act \nor card-check bill. As Americans, we cast secret ballots when we vote \nfor the President, Congress, Governors, mayors, and city council \nmembers. Yet this bill would take away that essential right within the \nworkplace.\n  It reminds me of the story from my home country, Audrain County, \nMissouri, often called the ``heart of little Dixie'' in Missouri, \nbecause it was settled by Democrats. The folklore has it that in the \n1864 election, when President Lincoln was running for reelection and \neverybody had to stand up on the courthouse steps and announce for whom \nthey were voting, one brave or foolhardy soul got up and said he wanted \nto cast a vote for Abraham Lincoln. To show you how kind and generous \nand hospitable the people of Audrain County were, they gave him a full \n24 hours to get out of town. While I cannot document that story with \nthe names of the specific individuals involved, that is an example of \nwhy a secret ballot is important.\n  A secret ballot allows people to exercise a free choice without fear \nof coercion from either side, either management or fellow workers who \nsupport management or fellow workers who support a union and union \norganizers.\n  Rather than enhancing and enabling secret ballots within the \nworkplace, this bill would eliminate that choice. Under the so-called \ncard-check bill, an employer would no longer carry the right to demand \na secret ballot election in order to certify a union as the employee's \nbargaining unit. The reauthorization of the National Labor Relations \nAct of 1947, the original benchmark for secret ballot union elections, \nwas enacted to safeguard the rights of workers and the companies they \nworked for, to promote collective bargaining, and to restrain certain \nprivate sector labor and management practices, which could pose a \nthreat to the general welfare of workers, to business, and to our \nNation's economy.\n  Now, as we all know, NLRA allows for an exception to the rule of a \nsecret ballot election. If an employer is willing to accept union \nauthorization cards that have been signed from a majority of the \nemployees represented, the organized union becomes the bargaining unit \nfor that specific group of workers.\n  Therefore, as you see under existing law, there are exceptions which \nallow for authorization cards to be accepted. But to remove completely \nthe ability of workers to have a confidential and private vote on \nwhether they choose to become a part of a union is utterly \nobjectionable and goes against all of the principles we hold so dear in \nthis democracy.\n  I feel that this ill-advised legislation will replace a federally \nsupervised secret ballot election process with a system that would open \nthe door for harassment, intimidation, coercion, forgery, and fraud. If \nenacted, this bill would permit union organizers to gain signatures \nfrom workers wherever they feel free to do so. Therefore, as a result, \na worker could see an organizer choose to show up at the place where he \nor she eats, at their residence, or at a family outing just to obtain a \nsignature for representation.\n  Might I say also my constituents, who are small businesses, who know \ntheir employees on a first-name basis, are violently opposed to this \nkind of working operation. The small businesses are the dynamic engine \nthat keeps this economy growing. They are creating the jobs, they are \nthe ones that grow. If they thought they could have a union imposed \nupon them by card check, without going through a secret ballot, it \nwould kill the ability of those small businesses to grow and hire more \nworkers.\n  In fiscal year 2005, the National Labor Relations Board conducted \n2,745 elections. It is interesting to note that 1,504 secret ballot \nelections were won by organized labor. Therefore, the total percentage \nof elections won by labor unions was 55 percent.\n  In 2004, organized unions won 51 percent out of 2,826 total elections \nconducted that year. During the Clinton administration in 1994, \norganized labor won only 44 percent of the total secret ballot \nelections.\n  According to a polling report conducted in January of this year, out \nof\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\nthe many individuals who were asked whether they would prefer an \nauthorization card over secret ballot, 89 percent of those polled \noverwhelmingly chose the secret ballot.\n  As you see from the numbers, employees who have a real free choice of \nconfidentially deciding whether to become part of the union have freely \nbeen able to employ their given right for union representation if they \nchoose. In the last few years, under the secret ballot election, a \nmajority of workers have decided to join a union. If a majority of \nprospective union employees does not wish to join, then they have a \nright, by secret ballot, to decline.\n  If labor unions are continuously increasing their election win margin \neach fiscal year, why prefer to use a system that threatens the \nprotective rights of the confidential vote for each employee? Why not \nleave the ultimate decision to the employees where support for the \nsecret ballot continues to remain strong?\n\n  The answer to that question may be in the fact that while secret \nballot elections recently produced a victory of 55 percent in 2005, it \ndoes not match the success of a 90-percent win rate that the card-check \nsystem produces.\n  Many small businesses back home in Missouri have come to me and \nexpressed concern with this bill, from machinists to mechanics to food \ndistributors, and many other small companies. They have all voiced \ntheir resistance, distrust, and strong opposition to this bill.\n  We must understand that over 93 percent of our Nation's businesses \nhave fewer than 100 employees. This bill would place a heavy burden on \nthe livelihood of these small businesses, since they are the least \nlikely to have experience in labor negotiations or have experienced \nlegal counsel to represent them. They have to work on a first-name \nbasis with their employees. They know what their challenges are. They \nknow who they are, and they are in the best position to be able to help \ntheir workers. But they don't want to have the threat of a nonsecret \nballot imposing a union on them.\n  Passage of the bill will mean that unions could unfairly target \nconsiderably smaller businesses, more than before, given that the \namount of resources necessary to organize a business would be \nsignificantly less. Prohibiting a secret ballot for the purposes of \nassisting organized labor with efforts to bolster membership is not the \nremedy needed to ensure every worker's right to a safe, confidential, \nunion election, where their God-given rights to a secret ballot, which \nwe hold dear in the United States, would be denied.\n  I urge my colleagues not to permit this bill to go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8337-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8337-S8351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank my able colleague from \nMissouri. He is one of our most valuable and able members in the \nSenate. I value his thoughts on that and share his thoughts, actually.\n  I want to move off of that and some of the comments that Senator \nDorgan had about working Americans and what they are facing today.\n  I remember addressing this point last year in the debate on \nimmigration. I think it was at night when not many people were on the \nfloor. Senator Kennedy was here. I raised the question of what was \nhappening to wages of working Americans as a result of large-scale \nimmigration, and quoted professors and experts who had demonstrated \nthat where those areas--where immigration reached its highest levels, \nwages had gone down for workers; they hadn't gone up.\n  Now we are told that businesses cannot get workers, and we are told \nwe are at full employment, but apparently something is awry if wages \nare not going up in many areas.\n  I want to mention to you what we have with regard to the immigration \nbill that is coming before us. We will have cloture vote on it in the \nmorning. This is what I want to say to my colleagues. The legislation \npromises that it will bring legality to the system. They say we have an \nillegal system and we have got a comprehensive plan to fix it.\n  What does our own Congressional Budget Office say? They just did an \nanalysis of it. The Congressional Budget Office looked at the \nlegislation that is proposed. They made an opinion about how much it \nwould cost the U.S. Treasury. It was about $30 billion over the next 10 \nyears; not for the cost of enforcement, just the cost of additional \nsocial and welfare benefits provided to those who are here illegally, \nwho will be made legal.\n  They made that analysis, and they also made one more analysis that is \nso stunning and so remarkable that I remain baffled that my colleagues \nhave not picked up on it. What the Congressional Budget Office, our own \nbudget office--a budget office that answers to the House, answers to \nthe Senate, answers to the majority leader, Harry Reid, answers to the \nSpeaker, Nancy Pelosi--the Congressional Budget Office concluded that \nnet illegal immigration, after the passage of this bill, would only be \nreduced 13 percent.\n  Now what kind of reform is that, I ask my colleagues? I submit to you \nthis is not a reform. A fix that is supposed to bring legality to a \nsystem that only reduces illegality by 13 percent. Last year we \narrested 1 million people entering our country illegally. These are \nhuge numbers. I would have thought we would want to see an 80 or 90 \npercent reduction of illegality at our border. This is a bill that by \nour own evaluation does not bode well.\n  There is another factor that many of my colleagues probably do not \nknow, have never understood. My staff has worked very hard to account \nfor the actual flow of legal immigration into the country. In the next \n20 years, this country, if this bill is passed, will see a doubling of \nthe legal permanent residents in America. That is the number of people \nwho are given a green card. That is the next step to citizenship. \nAnybody with legal permanent residence can move on to citizenship. It \nwill double the number of legal permanent residents, which is what we \ncall green card holders.\n  So we are not going to have any reduction in illegality, and we are \ngoing to have a major increase--a doubling of legal immigration. I am \nworried about that. We have been talking here about this debate about \ncard check and unions. What it is about is wages and fairness for \nAmerican workers, is it not?\n  Mr. Tonelson testified at one of our hearings before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. This was a hearing I requested and asked for. We \nwere able to get him, and he testified about areas in construction, in \nmeat packing, in restaurant work, where there was high level of \nimmigration from 2000 to 2005. Wages went down. You bring into this \ncountry more wheat, the price of wheat will go down. You bring into our \ncountry more cotton, the price will go down. Bring in more iron ore, \nthe price of iron ore will go down. You bring in more labor, the price \nof American labor will go down. That is a fact.\n\n  I support a legitimate guest worker program. I believe we do have \ncertain needs in certain industries and situations such as Hurricane \nKatrina where the need was so dramatic on the gulf coast. I know there \nare needs for some guest workers, temporary workers. I am prepared to \nhelp write legislation which would meet that need. I believe in \nimmigration into America in general. I am not asking that we slash the \namount of legal immigration into the country. But I doubt most \nAmericans, when they hear about the great group I affectionately call \nthe ``masters of the universe'' who met in secret and wrote this bill, \nhad any understanding that their promise of comprehensive reform of the \nillegal immigration system we have today--and that is a fair way to \ndescribe it--they had no idea this bill would only reduce illegal \nimmigration by 13 percent. I don't believe they had any idea it would \ndouble the numbers who were coming in legally.\n  That brings me to my point. The longer this legislation has been out \nfor review, the less the public has liked it. I can see why. If you \nremember, Senator Reid first called the bill up. He actually called up \nthe old bill that the House wouldn't even look at last year. He let it \nsit for about a week and then plopped down, on a Tuesday, an entirely \nnew bill, over 700 legislative pages, and wanted us to vote on it by \nFriday of that week. Why? That is what they attempted to do. We pushed \nback and said: No, this is a big issue;\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\nwe can't vote on Friday; we are not going to vote this week. We fought \nthat, and they backed off. We had a week's break and came back. We got \nback on the bill and proceeded with it and had some amendment votes and \nwere moving along, and then Senator Reid pulled the bill off the floor \non a Thursday night. So we thought maybe that was the end of it.\n  But after working on it, they decided to bring it back up. It is \ngoing to be brought back tomorrow. The bill is filed. Cloture was \nfiled. We now find ourselves prepared to vote tomorrow on whether to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed, go to this bill, and actually \ndiscuss it on the floor. We know there are probably 51 Senators who \nhave committed to vote for final passage of the bill. I think they have \nmade a mistake. Some probably didn't understand it fully. I am sure \nsome are uneasy about that commitment. But more than 50, I am \nconfident, are committed to voting for the legislation. Some really \nthink anything is better than the current system. Maybe this is better, \nthey say. They are prepared to vote for it. So by going to the bill, we \nare setting ourselves on a pathway that leads to final passage of \nlegislation I believe is not worthy of the U.S. Senate.\n  More than that, I urge my colleagues to think about this. We have \nbeen told--and if I am mistaken, I ask the majority leader to tell me I \nam wrong--that an unprecedented procedure will be utilized to eliminate \nas much time of debate as possible and to completely control the \namendment process to this legislation in a way that has never been done \nbefore in the history of the Senate. It has never been done this way. \nThe majority leader is going to fill the tree. He is going to file a \nsecond-degree amendment. That amendment will be divisible into a number \nof different amendments so he can say which amendments will be voted on \nand which will not, and other amendments will not be allowed to be \nvoted on. It is complete control of the process. They will say: We \nadopted some of your amendments, you complainers. We have some of your \namendments in that group.\n  This process has been prepared with the care and precision of the \nNormandy invasion. This has been prepared meticulously for weeks, how \nthey are going to move this bill through and how they are going to \ncontrol the amendments. The amendments that will be allowed, I am \nconfident, will be amendments they are confident they have the votes to \ndefeat or amendments they don't care if passed. But they will not allow \namendments to go to the core of this agreement by those masters of the \nuniverse who put it together, anything that would actually threaten \nthis legislation's agreement they put together.\n  Some have been told: Don't worry, Senator, vote for cloture tomorrow, \nand we will let your amendment be voted on. If your amendment is \nselected, it is likely that they have the votes to vote it down or the \ncrowd that put this bill together doesn't object if it passes. But \nanything that really goes at this mechanism, this special agreement \nthey have put together in secret without committee hearings of any \nkind, will not be allowed to be voted on. That is a big mistake.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I have been in \nthe Senate 10 years, most of which Republicans had the majority. This \nprocedure was never used against the Democrats when Republicans were in \nthe majority. This is the first time it has been used in the Senate. \nWhat if it is used against Senators in the future on both sides of the \naisle? The great free debate this Senate is so proud of would be \neroded.\n  So for two reasons I urge my colleagues tomorrow to vote against \ncloture. First, we need to have this bill pulled down. We need to go \nback and review what it is that has caused the American people to \nreject it so overwhelmingly. We need to find out why the Congressional \nBudget Office has concluded that it will reduce illegal immigration by \nonly 13 percent. My goodness. We need to ask ourselves, do we \nreally want to double on top of that the legal immigration into \nAmerica?\n\n  What are we afraid of? Why is there this obsession to move this \nflawed piece of legislation through, utilizing the unprecedented \nprocedural gambit to do so? I ask why?\n  Three weeks before we had the final vote and Senator Reid pulled it \ndown, after the debate continued a couple of weeks ago, a Rasmussen \npoll showed support for the bill in the high 20s. Then fell to 23 \npercent, and the last poll showed only 20 percent of Americans \nsupported this bill. Only 20 percent of the American people said we \nshould pass this bill. A decent respect for the opinions of the people \nwho elect us, I suggest--if nothing else, maybe for our own self-\ninterest--would call on us to say: What is it that people are worried \nabout? Why don't we pull this bill and see if we can't make a decent \npiece of legislation that we could be proud of and move it forward? \nWhat possible reason is there to be obsessed with just ramming it \nthrough this Senate? I am amazed. It takes my breath away. There is \nevery kind of reason to suggest that we should pull the bill down and \nwork on it.\n  I will conclude with these thoughts. Let's don't go forward tomorrow. \nLet Members of the Senate say to those who are promoting the \nlegislation--one former law officer called them mandarins; I jokingly \ncalled them the masters of the universe--this legislation will not \nwork. They are good people. They think they were doing good. But the \nproduct they produced won't work, and the American people don't like \nit. I say vote against cloture tomorrow because a vote for cloture is a \nvote ultimately to move this bill passage.\n  No. 2, I say vote against cloture tomorrow because unless the \nmajority leader declares otherwise, we will have to assume that what we \nhave been hearing is correct, and he will use an unprecedented \nprocedure--a procedure dubbed ``the clay pigeon''--to completely \ncontrol the amendment process and to bring this bill up for final vote \nwith amendments only he has approved in a minimal amount of time that \ncan be expended on such legislation. Any legislation this big deserves \ntime. Any legislation this big or with this many flaws deserves a lot \nof work.\n  I urge my colleagues, in light of these factors and others they may \npersonally care about--and there are many more problems--to reject \ncloture tomorrow. It would be a clear message to the leadership that is \ntrying to move this legislation that we are not going to have it. We \nwant better legislation, if you want us to pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, there is a widespread perception among \nthe people of our country that things are getting worse, not better. \nPolls seem to indicate that people feel that life for the middle class \nin the last 10 years is not as good as it used to be. By very strong \nnumbers, the people of our country believe the economy is getting \nworse, not better. We are the greatest country in the history of the \nworld, but there is something wrong when, if current economic trends \ncontinue, the young people in our country will have a lower standard of \nliving than their parents. We are moving in many respects in exactly \nthe wrong direction, and it is our job as Members of the Senate to turn \nthat around and to begin making government work for all people rather \nthan just the wealthy and the powerful who have so much power over what \ngoes on in this institution.\n  I rise in strong support of the Employer Free Choice Act. I commend \nSenator Kennedy for his leadership on this issue.\n  Year after year, millions of American workers have been working \nlonger hours for lower wages. In Vermont, it is not uncommon for people \nto work two jobs and on occasion work three jobs in order to cobble \ntogether an income in order to cobble together some health insurance.\n  Consider the facts: Since 2001, median household income has fallen by \nnearly $1,300; wages and salaries now make up their lowest share of the \neconomy in nearly six decades; the number of Americans who lack health \ninsurance has grown by 6.8 million since 2001, to over 46 million \nAmericans without any health insurance today; the number of Fortune \n1,000 companies that have frozen or terminated their pension plans has \nmore than tripled since 2001. Indeed, the middle class itself has \nshrunk. Over 5 million more Americans have slipped into poverty since \nthe\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\nyear 2000. So what we are seeing is the average American worker working \nlonger hours for lower wages.\n\n  Today there are millions of Americans who work who scarcely have any \nvacation time whatsoever. People are losing their health insurance, \nthey are losing their pensions, and they are sitting around looking at \nthe reality that if we do not turn this around, their kids will be even \nworse off than they are--all at the same time technology is exploding \nand worker productivity is increasing.\n  Meanwhile, while the middle class shrinks and poverty increases, \ncorporate profits today make up their largest share of the economy \nsince the 1960s. While the middle class is shrinking, millionaires and \nbillionaires in this country have never had it so good since the late \n1920s.\n  Today, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans own more wealth than the \nbottom 90 percent. The CEOs of our largest corporations now earn 400 \ntimes as much as the average worker. This is not just an economic \nissue, this is a moral issue. Is this what America is supposed to be \nabout, the wealthiest 1 percent owning more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent, and the gap between the rich and the poor growing wider every \nday, as the middle class continues to shrink. I do not believe that is \nwhat America is supposed to be.\n  At the same time, workers are seeing a decline in real wages, are \nbeing forced to pay more for their health insurance, and are seeing \ntheir pensions slashed. The CEOs of large corporations are making out \nlike bandits.\n  Just one simple example: Several years ago, the former CEO of \nExxonMobil, Lee Raymond, received a $400 million retirement package--\nwhile we are paying over $3 for a gallon of gas, and ExxonMobil, last \nyear, enjoyed the highest profits of any corporation in the history of \nthe world.\n  But it is not just CEOs such as Mr. Raymond. At a time when big banks \nare ripping off American consumers by charging outrageous interest \nrates and sky-high fees, Richard Fairbank, the CEO of Capital One \nFinancial, received over $300 million in total compensation over the \npast 5 years.\n  While consumers have been getting ripped off at the gas pump, Ray \nIrani, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum, raked in over $500 million in \ntotal compensation over the past 5 years. And on and on it goes, CEOs \nmaking out like bandits, workers paying $3 for a gallon of gas, losing \ntheir health insurance, losing their pensions, losing their homes.\n  The middle class is shrinking, poverty is increasing, and \nmillionaires and billionaires have never had it so good. It is our job \nto turn that around. There are a lot of reasons for the growing \ninequality in our economy, and economists may differ, but there is \nclearly agreement on some of the basic reasons the gap between the rich \nand the poor is growing wider and the middle class is shrinking.\n  The failure, up until very recently, to raise the minimum wage is an \nobvious example. Millions and millions and millions of workers today--\nbefore the new minimum wage goes into effect--are making $5.15 an hour. \nYes, the U.S. Congress has provided hundreds of billions of dollars in \ntax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent, but we could not raise the \nminimum wage until a few weeks ago. That is certainly one of the \nreasons poverty in America is increasing.\n  Another reason is that unfettered free trade, which forces American \nworkers to compete against desperate workers in China, Mexico, and \nVietnam, is also responsible for an increase in poverty and a lower \nstandard of living for millions of American workers. No, American \nworkers should not be forced to compete against desperate workers in \nChina who are making 30 cents an hour. That is not a level playing \nfield. That is wrong, and that is another reason the middle class in \nthis country is in decline.\n  But perhaps the most significant reason for the decline in the middle \nclass is the rights of workers to join together and bargain for better \nwages, better benefits, and better working conditions have been \nseverely undermined over the years.\n  Today, if an employee is engaged in a union organizing campaign, that \nemployee has a one in five chance of getting fired.\n  Today, half of all employers threaten to close or relocate their \nbusiness if workers choose to form a union.\n  Today, when workers become interested in forming unions, 92 percent \nof private sector employers force employees to attend closed-door \nmeetings to hear antiunion propaganda; 80 percent require supervisors \nto attend training sessions on attacking unions; 78 percent require \nsupervisors to deliver antiunion messages to workers they oversee; and \n75 percent hire outside consultants to run antiunion campaigns.\n  In 2005 alone, over 30,000 workers were discriminated against, losing \nwages or even their jobs, for exercising their constitutional right of \nfreedom of association--a right guaranteed under the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  Further, Human Rights Watch has said:\n\n       Freedom of association is a right under severe, often \n     buckling pressure when workers in the United States try to \n     exercise it.\n\n  The right to come together to form a union is a constitutional right. \nIt is under severe, unprecedented attack today.\n  Even when workers--who are faced with all of these enormous \nobstacles--win union elections, more than one-third of the victories do \nnot result in a first contract for workers.\n  Today, corporate executives are routinely negotiating obscenely high \ncompensation packages for themselves, but then they deny their own \nemployees their ability to come together to create better wages and \nworking conditions and better lives for themselves. That is wrong. This \nSenate has to stand up for those workers.\n  It is time to turn this around. It is time to stand up for the \nworking people of this country. That is what the Employee Free Choice \nAct is all about.\n  The House of Representatives did the right thing when it passed the \nEmployee Free Choice Act by a vote of 241 to 185 earlier this year. Now \nit is time for the Senate to act.\n  This legislation is very simple. The Employee Free Choice Act would \nsimply allow workers to join unions when a majority sign valid \nauthorization cards stating they want a union as their bargaining \nrepresentative. As Senator Kennedy has correctly pointed out, card \ncheck recognition was the law of the land in the United States from \n1941 to 1966. In other words, all this legislation does is give workers \nthe same rights they had 41 years ago.\n  More than half of the U.S. workforce--nearly 60 million workers--say \nthey would join a union right now if they had the opportunity. Yet only \n12 percent of the workforce has a union. This is much different from \nother industrialized countries around the world.\n\n  In Canada, where card check is the law of the land, twice as many \nworkers belong to unions than in the United States. In Britain, where \ncard check recognition is the law of the land, 60 percent of workers \nbelong to unions.\n  What has strong union participation meant for workers in other \ncountries? This is an important point to be made because it is terribly \nimportant we in the Senate see what is going on in the rest of the \nindustrialized world, see and note the benefits workers around the \nworld are receiving that our workers are not.\n  Just a few examples. In Finland, where two-thirds of workers belong \nto unions--guess what--unlike college graduates in the United States \nwho are graduating $20,000 in debt, Finland provides a free college \neducation, including law and medical schools, to all qualified \ncitizens. That is pretty good. They encourage young people to go to \ncollege and graduate school tuition free.\n  While the cost of childcare in the United States is skyrocketing--\nmillions of American families cannot afford quality childcare--in \nFinland, day care is free to all citizens.\n  Unlike the United States, where the 2-week vacation is becoming a \nthing of the past, in Finland, workers are guaranteed 30 days of paid \nvacation and 60 days of paid sick leave.\n  In Norway, where the union participation rate is about 60 percent, \nwomen receive 42 weeks of maternal leave at full pay--full pay--while \nU.S. workers only receive 12 weeks of unpaid maternal leave.\n  In Belgium, France, and Sweden over 90 percent of workers belong to \nunions. Workers in those countries all have\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nmuch stronger pensions, health care, childcare, and vacation benefits \nthan American workers.\n  In addition to the card check provision, the Employee Free Choice Act \nwould also stiffen penalties against employers who illegally fire or \ndiscriminate against workers for their union activity during an \norganizing or first contract drive.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this legislation will make it easier for \nworkers who win union elections to negotiate a first contract. We will \nend the situation where, when workers decide to form a union--they go \nto negotiate--the employer simply refuses to negotiate.\n  In order to strengthen America's middle class, we have to restore \nworkers' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits, and working \nconditions.\n  After all, union workers in this country earn 30 percent more, on \naverage, than nonunion workers who are performing the same jobs.\n  Madam President, 80 percent of union workers have employer-provided \nhealth insurance; only 49 percent of nonunion workers do.\n  Madam President, 68 percent of union workers have a guaranteed \npension through a defined benefit plan; only 14 percent of nonunion \nworkers do.\n  Madam President, 62 percent of union workers have short-term \ndisability benefits; only 35 percent of nonunion workers do.\n  Union workers have, on average, 15 days of paid vacation; while \nnonunion workers, on average, have fewer than 11 days of paid vacation.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this issue. We \nhave to do everything we can from a moral perspective to reverse the \ndecline of the middle class, to lower our poverty rates, to improve the \nstandard of living of American workers, and passing the Employee Free \nChoice Act is an important step in that direction.\n  Madam President, thank you very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we have had a very good \ndiscussion over the course of the afternoon and earlier. As I mentioned \nin my opening comments, a number of our colleagues spoke about this \nissue during the last week. So this is a matter of importance. It is a \nmatter of economic justice and economic fairness. It is an extremely \nimportant issue, I think, a defining issue in terms of what is \nhappening to the middle class in this country. Are they going to have \nvoices and votes that are going to be taken seriously? Are they going \nto be able to participate in a meaningful way in terms of our economy? \nThis involves their families and their future, their own personal \nfuture, their economic future, the future of their retirement, the \nfuture of their health care, and the future of their ability to be able \nto educate their children. So it is a very important matter.\n  I have been listening to the debate and the discussion. It is an \ninteresting fact that the bill itself is only three pages long. It is \nonly three pages long. But the difference it would make for working \nfamilies is enormously significant and incredibly important. So this \nlegislation, although it is written in some technical language, is \nunderstandable and should be. Basically, what it does is it gives the \nworker the kinds of expression and the rights in the workplace which \nincreasingly they have been denied.\n  I wish to go over very briefly exactly how this legislation works, \nbecause if you were someone back home listening to the discussion and \nthe debate, I think you would wonder what this legislation is all \nabout. I thought I would take a few moments to go through this. As I \nmentioned, a majority sign up in a workplace for employee free choice \nrequires the employer to recognize the union if a majority of the \nemployees sign valid authorization cards; if the employees want to have \nan election, then there can be an election. The idea that has been \nsuggested around here is that this eliminates the opportunity for free \nelections and that, of course, is not so. But what it is saying is that \nthe people who are going to be the most affected by it will be able to \nmake the decision as to whether it is going to be an open election or \nwhether it will be the card check-off.\n  Then we have the instructions by the NLRB to make clear and fair \nrules for how that signup is to protect the workers' rights.\n  Then, this says, the Employee Free Choice Act brings the employers to \nthe table within 10 days to start bargaining. The majority has \nindicated through the card check that they want to form a union and \nthis is a process spelled out in this legislation about getting the \nemployer to the table within 10 days and provides a reasonable \ntimetable for negotiations and creates an incentive for both parties to \nreach an agreement and provides for mediation and binding arbitration \nas a last resort.\n  This idea we have heard during the course of the afternoon that this \nis going to require Government imposing a judgment and decision on \ncompanies is, of course, completely fallacious.\n  This is the timeline. Although it may be somewhat difficult to see, \nit is not enormously complicated. The union is certified, requests to \nbargain, it takes 10 days, and the bargaining begins. It goes on for 90 \ndays. It can be extended. As long as there is a demonstration on both \nsides that they want to continue to move ahead, they will go ahead. If \nnot, either party may request they go to mediation.\n  What we have found out, and history demonstrates, that 86 percent of \nthe cases that go to mediation are actually settled. This is an \nextraordinary achievement and a record. So it gives full opportunity \nfor the 90 days, continued opportunities for the sides, if they think \nthey are making progress. If one or the other sides requests the \nmediation, they go to mediation. Then, only at the very end, if they \nare unable to get, through the mediation, if they are unable to resolve \ntheir questions in collective bargaining, then there is going to be 30 \ndays after that which will be for the arbitration.\n  Now, a point that has been missed during this debate and discussion \nis that on the issue of arbitration, it is not in the interest of the \nunion to put the employer out of business because they wouldn't have \njobs, and it isn't in the interest of the employer to be so arbitrary \nthat they will find they are not going to have a workforce. So there \nare forces that are out there to bring the situation together, and that \nis how it has worked in the past and is working.\n  The example that has been used, of course, is in our neighboring \ncountry of Canada, where it has met with great success. This is not \nenormously complicated, but the impact this will have in terms of \npermitting the 60-odd million individuals across this country who want \nto participate in a union to be a member of a union is dramatic.\n  I wish to reiterate for the membership what is happening in the real \nworld. I explained earlier the kinds of activities employers have had \nto discourage, effectively to demean the workers themselves and destroy \ntheir economic life by firing them, even after there is a successful \noutcome in favor of a union. I wish to show what the numbers are. This \nis in 2005, when over 30,000 workers received backpay after the \nNational Labor Relations Board found that employers had violated their \nrights--30,000 workers across the country. This isn't 5 or 6 workers, \nwhere it is happening in New England, or 4 or 5 workers down in Los \nAngeles or in another part of the country; this is 30,000 across the \ncountry. Thirty thousand across the country are receiving the backpay \nin one particular year. It demonstrates what is out there and the \ndifficulty. That means they have been fired or their rights have been \nviolated for being involved in union activity, to try to get an \nexpression in their workplace, and they get fired or their rights are \nviolated. What happens is they get fired or somehow their rights are \nviolated, and it can be 2, 3, 4, or 5 years, luckily, if they ever get \na reinstatement, so many of them become discouraged and completely drop \nout of the market.\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\n  Now let's see, after the National Labor Relations Board says they \nhave been harshly and illegally treated, what is the burden then on the \nemployer to pay them? Look at this. The average backpay of those 30,000 \nworkers, many of whom are out 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 years, is $2,660. That \nis the backpay. That is the average backpay for those 30,000 workers. \nTalk about a slap on the wrist. It is not even a slap on the wrist. \nThis is the cost of doing business. Compare this to the unauthorized \nreproduction of Smokey the Bear. The penalty is $10,000 and up to 6 \nmonths in prison. This is the unfairness to American workers when they \nhave been unfairly treated or fired, risking their family's future and \ntheir future, reinstated by the National Labor Relations Board and \nreceiving the average pay of $2,660. So you can understand very easily \nwhy these many unscrupulous--not all, and we have given examples of \ninformed and enlightened employers--but we can understand why many \nemployers say go ahead, give me those firms that you have a list of, \nand we will take these kinds of penalties any time, rather than going \nahead with the union. That is what is out there, in terms of its \nimpact, by failing to move ahead.\n  We illustrated earlier in the day when it wasn't this way--when we \nhad strong unions, speaking for working families, increase in \nproductivity, increase in wages, and the result was that America was \ngrowing together. America was growing together toward being the \nstrongest economy with the strongest national security in the world. \nThe opportunities for those families to continue their being a part of \nwhat I call the march for progress, being a part of an America that was \noffering better opportunities than these families had or that their \nparents had. That was the promise of America. That isn't where we are \ntoday. We have gone through that earlier in the afternoon.\n  Since there have been a number of references to the National Labor \nRelations Board, I wish to include a letter from an extraordinary \nformer Secretary of Labor. His name is Ray Marshall. He was an \nextraordinary Secretary of Labor under President Carter. He now \ncontinues to be a professor at the Johnson School of Public Affairs. He \nwrote, on March 21--and I will include his letter in the Record. I wish \nto mention briefly the relevant and very important part of his letter \npointing out numerous studies, including those by the Commission on the \nFuture of Worker-Management Relations, the Dunlop Commission. The \nDunlop Commission was led by John Dunlop, who taught at Harvard \nBusiness School, a Republican, a Secretary of Labor for a number of \nRepublican Presidents, and generally perceived to be one of the most \nthoughtful Secretaries of Labor we have had, in fact, over the last 50 \nyears, and there was a Dunlop Commission which he took great pride in, \nin reviewing labor-management relations. That is what Ray Marshall is \nreferring to.\n  He pointed out the Dunlop Commission documented the failure of \nAmerican labor law to adequately protect workers' rights, bargaining \nrights. The National Labor Relations Act's major weaknesses include: \nGiving employers too much power to frustrate workers' organizing \nefforts through unlawful means.\n  This is the Dunlop Commission, former Republican Secretary of Labor, \nincluded in a letter from Ray Marshall.\n  No. 1: Giving employers too much power to frustrate workers' \norganizing efforts, often through unlawful means.\n  No. 2: Weak penalty for illegal actions by company representatives.\n  We gave an example of both of those.\n  No. 3: Employers' refusal to bargain in good faith after workers vote \nto be represented by unions.\n  The letter goes on. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, The \n           University of Texas at Austin,\n                                       Austin, TX, March 21, 2007.\n     Hon. Ted Kennedy, Chair,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I regret very much that a scheduling \n     conflict precludes the opportunity to accept your invitation \n     to testify on the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), which I \n     strongly support.\n       There is abundant evidence that free and democratic \n     societies and broadly shared prosperity require strong and \n     democratic organizations to represent employees at work and \n     in the larger society. This is one reason all democratic \n     countries, including the United States, have declared the \n     right of workers to organize and bargain collectively to be \n     fundamental human rights.\n       Unfortunately, despite our support of this declaration, \n     U.S. labor law actually makes it very difficult for American \n     workers to bargain collectively, even though polls show that \n     nearly 60 million of them wish to do so. Indeed, unlike most \n     other advanced democracies, the United States requires wokers \n     to engage in unfair high-stakes contests with their employers \n     to gain bargaining rights. Numerous studies, including those \n     by the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management \n     Relations (the Dunlop Commission) have documented the failure \n     of American labor law to adequately protect workers' \n     bargaining rights. The National Labor Relations Act's (NLRA) \n     major weaknesses include: giving employers too much power to \n     frustrate workers' organizing efforts, often through unlawful \n     means; weak penalties for illegal actions by company \n     representatives; and employers' refusal to bargain in good \n     faith after workers vote to be represented by unions.\n       By strengthening the right of workers to select bargaining \n     representatives without going through lengthy and unfair \n     election processes, facilitating first contracts, and \n     creating stronger and more equitable penalties, the EFCA \n     would cause the NLRA to be much more balanced.\n       The EFCA is important to all Americans, not just to \n     workers. We are not likely to have either sound public \n     policies or fair and effective work practices if millions of \n     American workers' voices remain unheard. It is significant \n     that stagnant and declining real wages for most workers, \n     along with growing and unsustainable income inequalities, \n     have coincided with declining union strength.\n       Good luck with this important legislation. Please let me \n     know if I can help in any way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ray Marshall.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think these summarize the challenge and \nthe problem and what we are trying to do to address them.\n  There have been comments about who will benefit--that it is going to \nbe the union bosses who will coerce the people; the union \nrepresentatives have no power over workers; the employer can fire you. \nHe can hire you and fire you. He can decide whether you are going to \nhave any kind of health insurance, or vacation, or paid sick leave. \nThey are the ones who hold the whip, and we should not forget it. There \nis the claim that this is a payback for union leaders. It is the people \nwho care about the workers who support this.\n  That brings me to this point. We have a letter from 124 religious \nleaders. I will read quickly part of this excellent letter:\n\n       As religious leaders, we will continue to work to \n     disseminate within our communities of faith this message: \n     That the right of workers to freely organize in a democracy, \n     and families and communities are strengthened when workers \n     can bargain for fair wages, adequate benefits, and safe \n     working conditions.\n       We, as leaders of faith communities that represent the \n     entire spectrum of U.S. religious life, call upon the U.S. \n     Senate to bring the Employee Free Choice Act to the floor of \n     the Senate as soon as possible. We urge that the Senate vote \n     to pass this historic legislation as a public representation \n     that this bill offers the best remedy to the egregious \n     violations of workers' rights and best hope to restore to \n     workers a voice in the workplace free from fear and \n     harassment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAn Open Letter From Religious Leaders to the U.S. Senate To Support the \n                      Right of Workers To Organize\n\n       We, the undersigned religious leaders and representatives \n     of faith-based-organizations, are deeply concerned about the \n     pervasive violation of the rights of working people when they \n     attempt to exercise their basic freedom to form unions and \n     bargain collectively for a better life.\n       Over the past 30 years, workers' living standards have \n     declined in well-documented ways--stagnant or low pay, longer \n     hours spent at work, unaffordable or no health care benefits, \n     and increasing insecurity. Increasing income inequality is \n     the hallmark of our time.\n       U.S. labor law protects the legal right of workers to form \n     unions, yet employers regularly and effectively block that \n     right. Employer violations of workers' rights are routine and \n     illegal firings of union supporters in labor organizing \n     drives are at epidemic levels. In 2005 National Labor \n     Relations Board (NLRB) annual report 31,358 people--or one \n     worker every 17 minutes--received back pay because of illegal \n     employer discrimination for activities legally protected by \n     the National Labor Relations Act. But the perpetrating \n     corporations pay no effective price.\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\n       This routine and flagrant violation of workers' rights has \n     created a climate of fear and intimidation in the workplace. \n     The results are that too many workers do not try to exercise \n     their freedom for fear of losing their jobs. They quietly \n     suffer hazardous working conditions, falling wages, and \n     declining benefits.\n       America's faith traditions are nearly unanimous in support \n     of the right of workers to organize, and by using sacred text \n     and tradition, our faith communities have developed social \n     statements supporting the freedom of workers, too vulnerable \n     to systemic injustices in the workplace, to organize and \n     collectively bargain.\n       The Employee Free Choice Act is the first step to fixing \n     this badly broken system by strengthening penalties for \n     companies that break the law by coercing or intimidating \n     employees. It will also establish a third-party mediation \n     process when employers and employees cannot agree on a first \n     contract, and enable employees to form unions when a majority \n     expresses their decision to join the union by signing \n     authorization card. It makes real the principle that the free \n     choice about whether to form unions should belong to workers.\n       As religious leaders, we will continue to work to \n     disseminate within our communities of faith this message: \n     That the right of workers to freely organize their workplaces \n     is required in a democracy, and families and communities are \n     strengthened when workers can bargain for fair wages, \n     adequate benefits, and safe working conditions.\n       We, as leaders of faith communities that represent the \n     entire spectrum of U.S. religious life, call upon the U.S. \n     Senate to bring the Employee Free Choice Act to the floor of \n     the Senate as soon as possible. We urge that the Senate vote \n     to pass this historic legislation as a public representation \n     that this bill offers the best remedy to the egregious \n     violations of workers' rights and the best hope to restore to \n     workers a voice in the workplace free from fear and \n     harassment.\n           Sincerely, (Signed by 124 leaders)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That isn't just the Senator from Massachusetts, the \nSenator from Vermont, or others who have spoken in favor of this. This \nis an open letter from 124 religious leaders, representing all of the \ngreat faiths, who are urging us as a matter of social consciousness and \nmorality to give a voice and expression in the form of support for that \nlegislation.\n  I also include a letter from 16 Governors from around the country. In \npart, they say:\n\n       The freedom to form and join unions is a fundamental human \n     right protected by our constitutional freedom of association, \n     our Nation's labor laws, and international human rights laws \n     . . . it is a right for which millions of Americans have \n     struggled. The freedom to form unions is of special \n     importance to the civil and women's rights movements because \n     unions help ensure adequate wages, health care coverage, and \n     retirement security. It was the right to form a union that \n     Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was supporting during the Memphis \n     sanitation strike when he was assassinated in 1968. Unions \n     also helped to reduce the wage gap for women, people of \n     color, and can prevent arbitrary and discriminatory employer \n     behavior.\n\n  So 16 Governors are recommending that we move ahead with this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 21, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: As \n     governors, we ask for your support of the ``Employee Free \n     Choice Act,'' introduced by U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy and \n     U.S. Representative George Miller. This legislation provides \n     for recognition of a union when the majority of employees \n     voluntarily sign authorizations, offers mediation and binding \n     arbitration to resolve first contracts, and strengthens \n     penalties for violations during organizing and first contract \n     efforts.\n       The freedom to form and join unions is a fundamental human \n     right protected by our constitutional freedom of association, \n     our nation's labor laws, and international human rights laws, \n     including the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It \n     is a right for which millions of Americans have struggled. \n     The freedom to form unions is of special importance to the \n     civil and women's rights movements because unions help ensure \n     adequate wages, health care coverage and retirement security. \n     It was the right to form a union that Dr. Martin Luther King, \n     Jr. was supporting during the Memphis sanitation strike when \n     he was assassinated in 1968. Unions also help to reduce the \n     wage gap for women and people of color, and can prevent \n     arbitrary and discriminatory employer behavior.\n       The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 has long allowed \n     employers to recognize a union when the majority of workers \n     sign authorization cards, designating the union as their \n     bargaining agent. The right to form a union, however, has \n     been eroded over the last several years, resulting in \n     increasing employer harassment, discrimination, and sometimes \n     termination for workers taking initial steps toward forming a \n     union. Twenty-five percent of private-sector employers \n     illegally fire at least one worker for union activity during \n     organizing campaigns. Even where workers successfully form \n     unions, employers often refuse to bargain fairly with the \n     workers. Moreover, 92% of employers illegally force employees \n     to attend mandatory, closed-door meetings against the union. \n     The Employee Free Choice Act will protect workers from these \n     abuses, provide for first contract mediation and arbitration, \n     and establish meaningful penalties when employers violate \n     workers rights.\n       When workers try to form unions, all too often they are \n     harassed, intimidated, and even fired for their support of \n     the union. These attacks on workers' rights, for which there \n     are only weak--if any--remedies, occur all too frequently \n     among the most vulnerable workers of our society, including \n     women, the working poor or all races, and recent immigrants. \n     As a result, those workers who need unions the most are often \n     those who have the least chance of achieving the benefits of \n     unionization.\n       We strongly urge you to support the Employee Free Choice, \n     legislation that would begin to reinstate the right to form \n     unions that Congress protected for America's workers over 65 \n     years ago.\n           Sincerely,\n         Governor Bill Ritter, Jr., Colorado; Governor Chet \n           Culver, Iowa; Governor John Baldacci, Maine; Governor \n           Jennifer Granholm, Michigan; Governor Bill Richardson, \n           New Mexico; Governor Ted Strickland, Ohio; Governor \n           Edward G. Rendell, Pennsylvania; Governor Joe Manchin \n           III, West Virginia; Governor Rod Blagojevich, Illinois; \n           Governor Kathleen Sebelius, Kansas; Governor Martin \n           O'Malley, Maryland; Governor Jon Corzine, New Jersey; \n           Governor Eliot Spitzer, New York; Governor Ted \n           Kulongoski, Oregon; Governor Chris Gregoire, \n           Washington; Governor Jim Doyle, Wisconsin.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, we have a letter from the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights. Two hundred civil rights groups are endorsing this \nlegislation.\n  In part, their letter says this:\n\n       This bill will reform the current system for selecting a \n     union to give all working people the freedom to make their \n     own decision about whether to choose a union and bargain for \n     better wages and benefits. LCCR strongly believes that a \n     healthy labor movement invests America's diverse working \n     people with a powerful voice with which to challenge \n     workplace discrimination and demand equality.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter also be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                               on Civil Rights\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, largest, and most \n     diverse civil and human rights coalition, with nearly 200 \n     member organizations, we urge you to support the Employee \n     Free Choice Act (EFCA) (S.1041). [The bill will reform the \n     current system for selecting a union to give all working \n     people the freedom to make their own decision about whether \n     to choose a union and bargain for better wages and benefits. \n     LCCR strongly believes that a healthy labor movement invests \n     America's diverse working people with a powerful voice with \n     which to challenge workplace discrimination and demand \n     equality.]\n       Under the current system, where the National Labor \n     Relations Board (NLRB) conducts polling after a long and \n     bitter campaign period, employers are given ample opportunity \n     to intimidate and coerce employees to vote against unions. \n     Until workers can exercise a free choice, they will continue \n     to lose power in our country, living standards will continue \n     to suffer, and our middle class will continue to decline. \n     LCCR urges the Senate to vote yes on cloture for the EFCA, \n     and to promptly join the House in passing the bill.\n       The EFCA levels the playing field for employees by: (1) \n     certifying union representation when a majority of workers \n     sign cards designating the union as their bargaining \n     representative; (2) strengthening penalties against companies \n     that illegally punish employees for supporting a union; and \n     (3) bringing in a neutral third party to settle a contract \n     when a company and a newly certified union cannot agree on a \n     contract after three months.\n       A recent analysis of NLRB data reveals the necessity of \n     reform. One in five active union supporters is illegally \n     fired for union activity during NLRB election campaigns; \n     workers are fired for union activity in 25 percent of \n     campaigns; in 78 percent of NLRB campaigns, employers require \n     supervisors to deliver anti-union messages to the workers \n     whose jobs and pay they control; in 92 percent of NLRB \n     campaigns, employers force\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n     workers to attend closed door anti-union meetings; and in 51 \n     percent of NLRB campaigns, employers threaten to close the \n     workplace if employees vote for union representation.\n       LCCR and the civil rights community care deeply about this \n     bill. The labor movement has long been a forceful advocate \n     for equal opportunity and equal dignity in our nation. The \n     critical role played by labor in achieving passage of Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act is well-known. But unions also \n     facilitate enforcement of civil rights laws by policing the \n     workplace and using the grievance process to halt \n     discriminatory practices. Moreover, unions raise the wages \n     and benefits of women and people of color. Workers who belong \n     to unions earn 30 percent more than non-union workers, and \n     enjoy substantially better health care. These improvements \n     are even more pronounced for women and people of color.\n       Labor unions today are in crisis. Union membership in the \n     private sector continues its precipitous decline of the past \n     several years. Fierce, concerted resistance to unions by \n     employers and the weakening of existing labor protections \n     have made union organizing extraordinarily difficult. Surveys \n     demonstrate that American workers want unions. Yet the \n     campaigns of intimidation and coercion mounted by employers \n     during organizing drives and the lack of an adequate legal \n     remedy for such employer conduct have reduced existing \n     polling procedures to a farce. The EFCA presents an important \n     opportunity to guarantee workers a free, uncoerced choice in \n     choosing union representation.\n       The Senate should seize this opportunity and vote for the \n     EFCA. Should you require further information or have any \n     questions, please contact Paul Edenfield, Counsel and Policy \n     Analyst, at 202/263-2852, regarding this or any issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wade Henderson,\n       President & CEO.\n     Nancy Zirkin,\n       Deputy Director.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So there it is. The oustanding religious leaders, the \nGovernors, those who have been speaking out to protect and advance the \ncause of women and minorities in the workplace, all see this \nlegislation as being a major consequence to economic justice to \nworkers' rights in this country. That is why we are in such strong \nsupport of this legislation. We are hopeful we will get a strong vote \non tomorrow.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as a U.S. Senator, I am fighting for \njobs today and jobs tomorrow. Unions play a vital role in ensuring safe \nand fair working conditions. That is why I support the right to form \nand join unions and I will continue to fight to preserve the rights of \nworkers.\n  It is time to get behind the working people's agenda. That is why I \nam proud to stand with the labor movement. I wear the union label on my \nclothes, on my heart, and on the floor of the Senate. I am proud of \nunion members. You all work hard. You work three shifts: one at your \njobs to make a living, then with your family to make that living \nworthwhile, and a third with your union to make a difference.\n  I know the importance of unions, and that is why I am an original \ncosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act. With union membership at its \nlowest point in more than 60 years, this bill takes several steps to \nmake it easier to unionize without employer coercion. Workers \nunderstand the benefits of joining a union--53 percent say they could \njoin one today if they could. But the right to organize is deliberately \ndenied by many employers.\n  Unions raise wages, improve working conditions, and ensure fair \ntreatment on the job. In many jobs they make the difference between \nliving in poverty and making ends meet or the difference between just \ngetting by and making enough to make a better life for a family.\n  Workers face three obstacles when trying to unionize: unfair union \nelection rules, meaningless penalties, and employers' refusal to \nbargain with employees. This bill would level the playing field by \nletting workers choose how to form a union, establishing meaningful \npenalties, and guaranteeing both sides bargain in good faith.\n  Workers organize themselves by signing a document saying they want to \njoin a union. Once a majority of workers signup, they can ask their \nemployers to be recognized as a union and collectively bargain for a \ncontract. However, employers often refuse to recognize the union and \nrequire workers to go through an intimidating anti-union campaign that \nends in an unfair election.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act makes it easier to form a union by not \nallowing employers to veto employees' decisions about how to organize \nand force an unfair election. Workers could still request an election, \nbut it would be their choice--not the employers.\n  The other big problem for workers who want to unionize is that the \npenalties for companies that break the laws are too low. Employers who \nbreak union election rules only have to post a sign saying that they \nwon't do it again. Employers who fire a worker for being pro-union are \nonly required to pay wages they would have owed if they had followed \nthe law minus whatever the fired employee earned since his or her \nfiring. And because cases can be tied up in court for years, employers \nare able to fight dirty against unions and workers with near impunity.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act raises penalties for unfair labor \nviolations to $20,000, requires employers to pay workers who were \nunfairly fired three times backpay, and requires the NLRB to seek an \ninjunction when they have evidence that an employer has violated a \nunion election law.\n  Even when unions are able to overcome these slanted rules, employers \nstill undermine the will of their employees by refusing to negotiate in \ngood faith. Today, if a union and an employer can't agree on a contract \nwithin a year, the employer can call an election to disband the union \nand another unfair antiunion campaign begins. While not bargaining in \ngood faith is prohibited by law, the NLRB has set the standard of proof \ntoo high to ever be met except in the most blatant cases. This gives \nantiunion employers every reason to stall during negotiations, and that \nis why one-third of unions formed through elections don't get a \ncontract within a year.\n  This bill ensures fair negotiations by establishing reasonable time \ntables for negotiation and mediation. In the rare cases when that fails \nto produce an agreement, this would also require arbitration so that \nparties have incentives to compromise and find a middle ground that \nbenefits everyone.\n  Unfair rules, lax enforcement, and insincere negotiating has crippled \nunion organizing and threatened the middle-class lifestyle that was \nonce the economic pride of our country. The Employee Free Choice Act \ngives workers the rights they deserve, restores integrity to our \nNation's labor laws, and lays the foundation for working and middle \nclass Americans to once again share in our country's economic \nprosperity.\n  America's economy continues to grow but working class economic \nsecurity and opportunity have gone in the opposite direction. Wages are \nlower today than they were 30 years ago, employers no longer offer good \nbenefits, and workers don't make enough to save for retirement or send \ntheir kids to college. Despite working longer and being more \nproductive, American families find it harder to break into the middle \nclass and families in the middle class are finding it harder to stay \nthere. This bill is a step in the right direction for working \nAmericans. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I have the deepest respect for the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, and this is one Senator who makes no accusations \nthat this is payback. I proudly say the Senator from Massachusetts \nbelieved before that this is the right thing, he believes it today, and \nhe will believe it tomorrow; and no one could convince me he could \nchange his mind. It is refreshing in this institution to find somebody \nwho is so entrenched that the press, public opinion, or anything cannot \nmove him.\n  But acknowledging that about Senator Kennedy, I have to express my \nstrong disagreement from the standpoint that he says this is easy to \ndo. I hope it is not easy to do. I hope it is not easy in America, in a \ndemocracy, to do away with the private ballot. I believe it is \nsomething we cherish, something we protect, something we understand is \npart of the tenets of democracy.\n  I think it is important that we look back. We have heard a lot about \nwhere we are. But how did we get to the point that we have a system \nwhere if 30 percent of the employees sign a sheet to have an election--\n30 percent, not 50 percent--in fact, they get that right. It\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\nwas in 1947 when they changed the National Labor Relations Act. Why did \nthey change it? Because through the 1930s and 1940s, there was \nwidespread intimidation by the labor unions on workers and on \nemployers. Rather than to have that intimidation that mobilized one's \ncommitment to unionize a business, they rewrote the law and they \nprovided the right of a private ballot in this infant democracy--what \nwe did for elections we adopted for employees, a secret way for every \nemployee not to be bullied or intimidated as to how they wanted to be \nrepresented by their employer or by a union.\n  Employee Free Choice Act. That sounds easy, and I think that is why \nhe suggested it is. The reality is Americans will give up the private \nballot. But the Employee Free Choice Act violates that tenet of our \ndemocracy because it would prevent every worker's vote from counting. I \nwill say that again. It would prevent every worker's vote from \ncounting. We have had battles over the last 10 years in this country \nabout every vote counting. Not only would it prevent every vote from \nbeing counted, it would deny the right to vote to some employees, \nbecause now just with 50 percent plus one additional worker there would \nbe no need for a vote. He is right. You would enter into a 10-day \nprocess that would accelerate, in all likelihood, to mediation because \nyou have a union that shot for the stars and an employer that can only \npay X. The history of the country is that we split the difference and \nthe employer decides if they can even stay in business.\n  Under current law, the most frequent form of union organizing is a \nprivate ballot, with 30 percent of the employees signing their name on \na dotted line, which initiates an election process where employees will \ndecide by private ballot as to whether the union represents them. I \ncannot think of anything more fair than 30 percent initiating and 50 \nplus 1 making the final decision. In Winston-Salem in the past year and \na half, I had a good friend whose company was forced to have a ballot--\nor at least they pushed it as far as they could. You see, at the end of \nthe day, I am not sure they had 30 percent of the employees sign. But \nif you had seen what happened in that community, if you had seen the \nposters that were put on telephone poles about the owner of this \nbusiness, the fliers mailed to his neighbors--it had nothing to do with \nhis business or employees. It was a character assassination on the \nindividual who owned the business because the labor unions thought if \nthey could break his character, he would give in to a vote and they \nwould have a chance of organizing his business.\n  The great news out of that story is he didn't break; he fought them \nand he won. In fact, they didn't have 30 percent who signed. They \ndidn't have an election because the employees decided they didn't want \nto be represented by the union. I can tell you that in the town I live \nin, they make pretty good money. They may not make as much as they \nwould like to, but they make as much as the industry they represent can \nbear and that the town they live in can afford to pay.\n  When we talk about intimidation, I assure you that there is \nintimidation against the employer. It is happening every day in \ncommunities across this country. If there are any examples of what I \nsaw as to what would happen if we did away with the private ballot, I \nwould hate to see what would happen to employees in this country if \nunions had the ability to bully and intimidate them into agreeing to \nsign on because there was no longer the secrecy of a private ballot.\n  In the last 10 years, we have seen increased effort by unions to seek \nunion recognition outside of the secret ballot process already--the so-\ncalled use of card check. It has become a critical component of big \nlabor's organizing strategy. Card check circumvents workers' rights to \nprivate ballot to union certification elections. The legislation would \ninstead force workers into a union once union organizers have obtained \nthose 50 percent plus 1 signature.\n  This invites worker intimidation and character assassination by the \nunion. I believe all votes should be counted. Under card check, that \nwould not happen. Many individuals will be denied access to vote. Many \nvotes will go uncounted because no votes would take place.\n  Do you find it odd that in 2001, the authors of this bill demanded \nprivate ballots in Mexico? As recently as 2001, the cosponsors of card \ncheck legislation urged Mexico to guarantee secret ballots to their \nworkers voting in union-recognized campaigns. So they will propose \nprivate ballots in Mexico, but they won't support their continued \nexistence in the United States. Unions know private ballots prevent \ncoercion when it comes to making a choice about unions. Even the AFL-\nCIO has called the secret ballot the surest means for avoiding \ndecisions that are the result of group pressure and not individual \ndecisions. That statement was made in a legal brief regarding union \ndecertification elections.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act is, quite frankly, antiworker \nlegislation. Unions should not be enhancing their power by weakening \nworkers' rights. I cannot think of a more important right than the \nright to vote, the right to a secret ballot, the right to make sure \nthat your vote is cast, that it is counted, and that it counts. The \nauthors of this bill suggest that we throw that away.\n  I will end with this story. We all had the opportunity--``all'' \nmeaning the entire world--to see the first free elections in Iraq in a \nnumber of decades. We saw people with purple fingers acknowledging the \nfact that they had risked their lives to travel to a polling place to \ncast a private ballot for a slate of candidates to elect their \nrepresentatives.\n  In my office today is a ballot from one of those polling places in \nIraq. It is framed next to a flag that a pilot, who patrolled over that \npolling site protecting those Iraqi people, brought back and was told \nby the Iraqis: Give this to a Member of the U.S. Senate who represents \nyou and tell them how much it means to us.\n  If this is, in fact, how we see democracies emerge and the importance \nof an individual's right to vote, to elect their representatives, to \ndecide their future, and yet we, the strongest democracy in the world, \nthrow out private ballots, disregard this important piece of democracy \nbecause it is easy, if we neglect history and we forget what happened \nin 1930 and 1940 and why we changed it in 1947, and we fall prey to \nwhat seems easy, then what example do we set for the rest of the world? \nHow hard will people fight in the future for democracy and freedom? \nWill people be willing to risk their lives when they see the ability to \nweigh in on who represents them? I seriously doubt it.\n  I think the worst example we can send to the world is that there is a \npiece of American democracy where private ballots are no longer needed, \nwhere we just disregard that part of the rights of the American people.\n  I am hopeful that tomorrow we will vote not to proceed, that this \nlegislation will not be considered, and we can assure the American \npeople we have protected their rights with the private ballots and not \naccept what is easy, and that is to throw it away.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to also voice my opposition \nto the Employee Free Choice Act. It is a House bill which has been sent \nover to the Senate, H.R. 800. It is commonly referred to as the card \ncheck legislation. I am not concerned about the rights or about unions. \nI am not particularly concerned how the members of a union or how \nemployees decide they want to organize. I am not concerned about \ncorporations or businesses or how those businesses may decide they want \nto organize themselves. But what I am concerned about is the \nindividual, and I am concerned about whether this is the best way to \nmove forward in a democratic process where the individual is so very \nimportant. If we talk about a democratic process, we simply talk about \nfree elections, which assures us the privacy of the ballot box.\n  My home State of Colorado continues to maintain a low unemployment \nrate, far below the national average. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, only 3.5 percent of Coloradans are currently unemployed. \nThis is significant when compared to the national average of 4.5 \npercent. This is something about which Colorado should be proud to\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\nboast. This is the type of information businesses review when they mull \nover starting up or expanding in the great State of Colorado. This low \nunemployment rate is the result of Colorado's strong economy and highly \nproductive workforce.\n  So when we consider the so-called and wildly misnamed Employee Free \nChoice Act, I know it threatens to turn the clock back on progress we \nhave made. In fact, this is an issue which Colorado has already \nrejected. This year, our newly elected Democratic Governor vetoed an \nattempt to enact a similar measure into State law. That vetoed bill \nwould have repealed the Colorado law requiring that once a company's \nemployees approve a union, they have a second secret ballot vote on how \ndues will be assessed with a 75-percent supermajority required for \napproval.\n  Governor Ritter's vote put a stop to the rushed efforts by Democrats \nin the State legislature who tried to ram the bill through, not unlike \nthose here today. Governor Ritter's efforts protected the 92 percent of \nColorado workers who are not members of unions.\n  Union leaders responded to Governor Ritter's actions with threats to \nmove the Democratic convention from Denver if they don't get their way. \nIf unions are able to make such threats on State governments and State \nlegislatures and State Governors, I question what keeps them from \nintimidating workers who choose not to join their labor organizations.\n  Similar rushed efforts are being made at the Federal level, hiding \nunder the deceptive name of the Employee Free Choice Act. It is \nadvertised as an effort to restore economic opportunity for working \nfamilies. In fact, this legislation threatens the fundamental right of \nworkers to hold democratic elections in the workplace. Private ballot \nelections would be replaced with publicly signed card check elections. \nThis would invite coercion from both employers and union activists.\n  Secret ballots guarantee the confidentiality of an employee's wishes \nwithout fear of exploitation, ostracism, or retribution. Common sense \ntells us that if corporate intimidation was a problem, private \nelections would do more to protect the true wishes of the employee.\n  History recognizes this democratic system as suitable for electing \nAmerica's leaders, including every Member of Congress who serves today. \nWorkers deserve the same rights at work as they do when they cast their \nballot on election day. Only private ballot elections ensure democracy \nin the workplace. Ask yourself: Do publicly signed cards reliably \nreveal a worker's true intentions? Workers should be able to express \ntheir true desire about joining a union without pressure or fear of \nreprisal. Just as undue employer pressure is unacceptable on an \nemployee, so is union pressure.\n  We speak of big business, but most union elections over the past \nseveral years involve employers with less than 30 eligible employees. \nCompare that to the massive organization labor has built to advance its \nagenda.\n  What we are really talking about is big labor versus small business. \nSecret ballot elections, in my view, must be preserved, not eliminated. \nSo I am asking my colleagues to join me and others in opposing the \nEmployee Free Choice Act because, in my view, it is not about unions. \nIt is not about corporations or big business. This is about the \ndemocratic process. It is about free elections and the privacy of the \nballot box.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes \nabout a couple of bills that are going to be offered this week. There \nare two bills that probably make a good point about where we are as a \nSenate, and particularly I think where my Democratic colleagues are. We \nhave one bill that takes away almost a sacred right of American \nworkers, and then we have a second bill that will be offered tomorrow \nthat gives new rights and benefits to non-Americans who came to this \ncountry illegally.\n  The first bill has been given lots of names today. I think it is S. \n1041. Some call it card check. I call it the ``Worker Intimidation \nAct.'' One of the most central parts of our whole free society, whether \nyou are talking about local school board elections, elections to \nCongress, or where workers decide whether to become part of a union, \nhas always been the secret ballot. The very fact that this Congress is \nconsidering eliminating that secret ballot should give all of us pause \nas to where we are as a country.\n  The very thought that we would call this in some way worker \nprotection is amazing, and that we are saying this bill will somehow \nhelp unemployment in this country, when we know it would not. Unions \nhave been declining for years in the private sector because, in an age \nof lean manufacturing, continuous quality improvement, and just-in-time \ninventories, it is becoming increasingly impossible to have a third-\nparty decisionmaker involved in that whole process.\n  I spent years consulting for continuous quality improvement, and it \nis hard enough, with your customers and workers and your company, to \nfigure out how to make that dynamic work profitably. But when a third \nparty is involved with collective bargaining in decisions about how \nyour operations work it is almost impossible to make a company \ncompetitive in this global economy.\n  We have seen in our own country the companies and industries we are \nproudest of--our auto industries, and we have seen it in the airlines \nwhere, basically, unionization and the union contracts have brought \nthese companies either to bankruptcy or close to it.\n  There is a reason that unions are not prospering in the private \nsector. The only place they are prospering is in government. As the \ngovernment grows, it doesn't have any competition. The inefficiencies \nare very well known, the incompetencies. Third-party decisionmaking \ndoes nothing but make us more and more inefficient and inept as a \ngovernment, which we see in everything from Katrina to almost \neverything we do.\n  As we look at this other bill that we are going to bring up, where we \nadd 128,000 new border agents who will be unionized and part of \ncollective bargaining, we will continue to see dysfunction at the \nborder. We are not helping workers when we take away their right to \nvote as to whether to become a union. We have heard a lot of \nexplanations of what this bill does, but it is really a desperate \nattempt to try to salvage unionization and union bosses in this \ncountry. It is just not right to tell a worker they can be intimidated \nto join a union, and that is basically what it comes down to.\n  So I am here to encourage all my colleagues to vote this bill down \ntomorrow. I am very surprised the majority leader is even willing to \nbring it up.\n  That brings me to the second bill where, on one hand, we are willing \nto take rights away from American workers--and I think America is \nincreasingly concerned as it sees our laws and justice system seeming \nto work against them. It seems to work for the criminals rather than \nthe victims. It tends to take rights away from Americans and give them \naway and send our money overseas. I hear that from everyone I talk to. \nBut one of the most emotionally charged issues of our day is this \nimmigration bill, which many call the amnesty bill, that will also be \nbrought up.\n  We all know there are millions of people all over the world who have \nbeen waiting years to come to this country and work legally, to be a \npart of this country and to share our values. At the same time, we also \nknow for many years, millions and millions of folks have snuck in \nillegally and continue to be here to this day, and the bill we are \ntalking about this week is going to reward those who came here \nillegally while basically putting at a disadvantage those who have been \ntrying to work the system legally for years.\n  All of us in Congress have tried to help people for many years, \nwhether it is to get their passports or green cards, to try to get \ntheir citizenship, or to help people who want to get visas to come here \nbecause industry needs them to come, and it is difficult working within \nthis legal system. We make it so\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\nhard for people to come here legally, and we have made it easy for them \nto come here illegally.\n  We have talked about--during the debate today and we will a little \nmore tomorrow--how back in 1986 we saw we had a problem with 2 or 3 \nmillion illegals who were here, and we passed a bill that was going to \nsecure our borders and get a verifiable worker ID system, and we were \ngoing to grant amnesty to those who were here but then no more. We were \njust going to do it that once. But what we did was send a signal all \nover the world that if you can get here illegally, we are eventually \ngoing to make you legal. And so here we are again, except this time \nwith 12 to 20 million illegals who have come to this country, breaking \nour laws as their first act of coming across our border.\n  This bill--and I know there are a lot of good intentions behind it--\nis holding hostage the reforms we need to secure our borders, to \ndevelop a workable immigration system. We are holding that part \nhostage, which we really need, to this whole idea of amnesty. They are \ntelling those of us who want to make a system that works to get in the \nguest workers our farmers and hotel operators need, to get in the \nskilled workers in our high-tech industries, that in order to do that \nand to develop an enforcement system to make that work, we have to give \n12 million people who came here illegally permanent residency and a \npathway to citizenship.\n  I don't buy that grand bargain, and I don't think America has either. \nIn fact, I know America hasn't. Our offices have had thousands of calls \nfrom all over the country from people who are desperate and wondering \nwhy we are not willing to enforce our laws. And what would make them \nthink we are going to enforce this new law if we have not even shown an \ninclination to enforce the laws that have already been passed--not just \nin 1986 but last year we passed a stronger border enforcement bill than \nis in this current amnesty bill. Yet we have done very little to \nmove ahead with it. We are holding it hostage to this brandnew amnesty \nprogram.\n\n  It is not fair to Americans because the American worker will have to \npay for this in their taxes. We know these illegals who are here are \ngoing to continue to use government services: health care, and \nemergency rooms, free education for children, day care, free lunch \nprograms, housing programs, and eventually Social Security and \nMedicare. We don't even know how we are going to keep these promises to \nour own citizens. Yet we are being asked to give permanent legal \nresidency and a path to citizenship to those who came here illegally.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to bring up two bills. One is to take away a \nright of American workers to a secret ballot when it comes to whether \nthey are unionized. The second is to give new benefits and rights to \nmillions of people who disobeyed our laws, who came to this country \nillegally, and who jumped in front of those trying to obey our laws. \nBoth bills should be voted down.\n  I encourage my colleagues to respond to the American people on this \none, to show them we can listen, that we are not as callous as we \nappear. Their concerns go far beyond just this immigration bill or this \nsecret ballot bill. They believe they are being sold out. They think \nthey are being betrayed. They think we are just moving from whim to \nwhim in the Senate, and we are refusing to go by the rule of law and \nenforce the laws we have actually passed in Congress. They are \nconcerned at a level and alienated at a level I have never seen.\n  At a time when the trust and favorable ratings of Congress and the \nPresident are at historical lows, we have chosen to stick down the \nthroats of the American people legislation they do not trust and they \ndo not want.\n  I appeal to the President, I appeal to the leaders on the Democratic \nside and the Republican side to take this a step at a time and allow us \nto earn the trust of the American people, to show them that we will \nenforce our laws and secure our borders, to show them we will follow \nthrough on a worker ID program that is verifiable so we will know who \nis legal and who is not. And if we develop a legal immigration system \nthat works, then the decisions about what to do with the illegals who \nare here will become easy because we will have a workable system we can \nwork with.\n  To vote for the bill, the motion to proceed tomorrow on this \nimmigration bill, is a vote to pass it. Every Senator here knows, \nregardless of how this bill ends up, that there are 51 Senators who \nwill vote for it. So moving this bill along tomorrow by voting for this \ncloture motion to proceed is voting to pass this bill.\n  I have heard some say: I am going to vote for the motion to proceed, \nbut I will vote against the bill. America will see through it because \nthey are looking at this one. We did the same thing last week on the \nEnergy bill, where some folks said: Well, I am going to vote for the \ncloture motion, but I am going to vote against the bill, when they knew \nif they helped pass cloture they were passing the bill. The same is \nhappening with this immigration bill. There are some who think the \nAmerican people will not notice they pushed this bill all the way to \nfinal vote. Even if they vote against the final bill, they voted to \npass it.\n  Tomorrow will reveal who wants to listen, who is going to listen to \nthe American people, by voting against this cloture motion to proceed. \nThis bill has come up and been voted down three times already in the \nlast month. It is unprecedented in Congress after a failure of that \nmagnitude to bring a bill back in a couple of weeks and try to stuff it \ndown the American people's throats again.\n  This is the wrong bill. It is a flawed bill. It is the wrong time to \nask the American people to trust Congress when we have not proven to be \ntrustworthy in the past. We need to take this a step at a time, and we \nneed to stop this cloture motion tomorrow. I encourage my colleagues to \nlisten to the American people, to vote against the elimination of a \nsecret ballot for unions, and to vote against the amnesty bill that \nwill follow it tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts about \nimmigration and the situation in which we currently find ourselves and \noffer a bit perspective, I think fairly, on where we are.\n  We are the world's most free nation and are having one of the \nstrongest periods of economic growth--maybe our strongest ever. \nBillions of people all over the world, however, are in poverty and live \nin countries that are corrupt and backward. One expert has said that \nall would live a better life if they came to the United States. I think \nthat is a true fact.\n  We are indeed a nation of immigrants, and that heritage has caused us \nto continue one of the most generous legal immigration systems of any \nnation in the world. I submit, however, that immigration policy is an \nissue of national sovereignty, as Canada, Mexico, Spain, Japan, \nEngland--all nations understand and respect. This is an acknowledged \nfact. I chaired the Mexican-American Senate Interparliamentary Group \nfor 2 years. We talked about those things. Everybody understands \nsetting immigration policy is your nation's prerogative.\n  It is amazing to me that our majority leader--in this case, our \nDemocratic leader--will use the power of first recognition to call up \nan immigration bill again, just two weeks after the American people \nhave basically rejected it. In fact, the polling numbers show that \nsupport for the Senate bill is dropping further and further. He then \nwill use, I understand, an unprecedented, never-before-used procedure \nthat would block amendments. This is the so-called clay pigeon \nprocedure others have described. He will file a first degree amendment, \nand then file a second degree to it to fill the tree, so no other \nsecond-degree or unapproved amendments will be allowed votes. He will \ndivide his own second degree into 20 or so amendments and then work \nevery procedural trick in the book to ensure that the underlying bill \nand its 20 hand picked amendments move the\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\nlegislation through this Senate as fast as possible. The mandarins who \nare managing this piece of legislation want it out of here. They don't \nwant any more calls from their constituents. They don't want any more \ntalk show people explaining some of the things that are in it. They \nwant it off their plate. Good policy? Well, they say, that is for \nanother day. We just want the bill out of here.\n  Well, the opposition to this bill is gaining momentum. Thoughtful \nSenators who wanted to vote for something are analyzing the fine print \nof the bill and realizing that the ``vision'' bill supporters describe \nis not supported by the text. Senators are announcing that they will be \nvoting no. Senators who participated in the debates and wanted to vote \nfor something and hoped to be able to vote for this bill after \nexamining it in more detail are indicating that they are going to vote \nagainst it.\n  It is quite clear that the same special interest forces who produced \nthe 1986 bill are the ones who worked behind the scenes to produce this \none. It was produced in secret meetings of politicians without any \npublic hearings. It did not go through a single committee markup. But \nyou can be sure the activist open border immigration forces, and the \nbusiness interests, were having their voices heard in these meetings. \nDoes anybody doubt that? What about the American public? Were they in \nthe room? Were their opinions sought after? What about experts in law \nenforcement, were their opinions sought after? I suggest not.\n  The mandarins, in their faux wisdom, treated this as a political \nproblem that could be solved by compromise. We have to pass something, \nthey said. That was the mantra. So in the end it seems that passing \nsomething means passing anything, regardless of whether, in the end, it \nwill work to end illegality or establish good policies that will serve \nour long-term national interest.\n  This Senator will never support a bill that will fail as \nspectacularly as the 1986 legislation failed. I have to tell my \ncolleagues, my best judgment, and we looked at this hard, is that this \none will fail. Even the Congressional Budget Office, our investigative \nanalysis arm, in its June 4--just a few weeks ago--cost estimate, says \nthat illegality after the passage of this bill would be reduced a mere \n13 percent. Mr. President, 8.7 million illegal aliens would be expected \nover the 20-year period instead of 10 million under current law. That \nis what their estimate is.\n  So our masters--and I say that affectionately; I call them masters of \nthe universe. These are good friends and good Senators. They have tried \nto do something. They got it in their head that if they just all met \nand they just put out the realpolitik and they worked out the political \ndeals and split the babies and all this, they could do a bill that \nserved America's interests. I watched with interest. I thought some of \nthe things they said they wanted to accomplish were good improvements \nover last year's bill. But I have to tell you, I don't believe it \nworked. I don't believe they got there.\n  They don't want to pay attention to those of us who question what \nthey have done, you see. They believe they are wonderful and bright and \nthoughtful and love America and are compassionate. The rest of us, they \nsay you see, we are nativists. They say we just oppose immigration--\ndespite the fact that we don't oppose immigration. They say we don't \nlike immigrants. They say we don't have courage. How many times have I \nheard that? You have to have courage to vote for this turkey, I guess. \nThat is supposed to be something that would be good. But sometimes I \nthink hanging in here and opposing the machinery of this process takes \na little gumption on the part of those of us who oppose it.\n  They say we do not believe in immigration or we lack compassion. I \nwant to reject those charges flatout. They are false. I believe in \nimmigration. I believe in a guest worker program. But I want a guest \nworker program that will work, will not be an avenue of expanded \nillegality, as the CBO said this one will.\n  In fact, because of the guest worker program, the Congressional \nBudget Office has said visa overstays, those people who come in legally \nbut do not go home when they are supposed to, will increase under this \nbill, not decrease.\n  I thought we were supposed to be fixing illegality not enhancing \nillegality. So I wish to say to my colleagues, first, it is \nindisputable that the passage of this bill will not create a lawful \nsystem of immigration. This bill does not live up to their promises. \nOur good friends the masters came out of their secret meeting, and they \nannounced they had fixed immigration; they announced that they had a \ncomprehensive plan that is going to fix immigration, and that we are \nfinally going to end this illegality.\n  But their own Congressional Budget Office that responds to them, that \nresponds to the Democratic leaders, Senator Reid or Speaker Pelosi, it \nis pretty much a nonpartisan group, but they are under the control of \nthe Congress. This group under the control of the Congress says it will \nnot work, says visa overstays will increase and the net impact on \nillegal immigration only be to reduce illegal immigration by 13 \npercent.\n  Now, I consider that one event so significant, so earth shaking, that \nI cannot see how the Majority Leader could still take up this \nlegislation and jam it down the throat of this Senate through an \nunprecedented procedure to pass it, especially when the American people \ndo not like it either.\n  So it will not create a lawful system. We can be sure of that. We \nfelt that when we analyzed it. My chief counsel, Cindy Hayden, and \nothers looked at it, we found loophole after loophole. I made a speech \nof about 20 loopholes that were in the legislation. There were many \nmore than the specific 20 I talked about. But we knew it was not going \nto be an effective law enforcement bill. It was not going to secure the \nborder. So what does the CBO say? They agreed with our analysis.\n  Secondly, what else is fundamentally in here? The legislation fails \nto move to a merit-based system and, in fact, triples low-skilled and \nchain migration over the next 8 years. The promise was made that the \nbill would move us to a system more like Canada has, which makes so \nmuch sense; a system that Canada is very proud of. They believe it \nserves the Canadian interest.\n  They still have the same number of refugees and humanitarian \nimmigrants that they always did, but they have--with regard to the rest \nof their immigration policy--reached a point where 60 percent of the \npeople who enter into Canada have to come through a point system. If \nyou are admitted and come in, you can bring your wife and children, but \nto do that, you basically have to first demonstrate that you can \ncontribute to Canada.\n  One of the things they gave you points for, in an objective \nevaluation, is education. We know that if an immigrant has had any \ncollege courses, they do much better economically. They ask if you \nspeak English or French. You get extra points if you do that.\n  You even get extra points if you are younger. You get extra points if \nyou have skills Canada needs. They even give you points if you move to \nareas of Canada that are underpopulated and have a particular job \nshortage.\n  That is the way the deal works. They promised we would have that in \nthis legislation. That was part of the announcement. But when you read \nthe fine print, you see that was eroded away in the political \ncompromise. The bill's merit based system will not have any substantial \neffect until 8 years after this date. So I don't know what will happen \nin 8 years. You never know. But we would like to see this kind of thing \nin the bill.\n  I congratulate the people who produced it, that they began to discuss \nit because last year it was not even discussed. I talked about it on \nthe floor repeatedly. I asked how we could debate comprehensive \nimmigration reform and nobody even ask what they are doing in Canada. \nSo they put the Canadian system in here. But it is so weak that it is a \ngreat disappointment.\n  Well, I indicated that illegal immigration would only drop 13 \npercent. What about the proposal for legal immigration on the \nlegislation? Well, it is going to go up 100 percent. Legal immigration \nwill double in the next 20 years.\n  Now we have looked at the numbers. I think this is indisputable. We \nwill have twice as many people getting legal permanent residence over \nthe\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\nnext 20 years as we would under current law. I am not sure when the \naverage citizen listened to our colleagues and they announced on that \nbig day, the grand bargain, that we were talking about a proposal that \nwould hardly limit legal immigration at all and would double legal \nimmigration, I don't think that is what they had in mind when \ncomprehensive reform was discussed.\n  What about cost? The Congressional Budget Office dealt with that \nissue. They have to score legislation. Well, what does the cost factor \nsay? Under the CBO analysis, the cost to the taxpayers of the United \nStates--now I wanted to make this clear, this is not for border \nenforcement, Border Patrol acts, barriers or anything such as that--\nthis is costs that will be incurred by the recipients of amnesty, who \nwill be given amnesty under this bill, because all of a sudden they \nwill be entitled to welfare, Medicare, and other types of tax credits \nand other types of benefits.\n  They concluded this legislation will add to the taxpayers of America \nan additional $25 billion in cost over the next 10 years. They have \nadmitted, without any hesitation, those costs will greatly increase in \nthe outyears, because the way this thing is staggered, people's \nbenefits do not come immediately. But as the years go by, they are \nentitled to more welfare and social benefits.\n  So they have admitted we are going to have an increase significantly \nin the future because, in fact, the persons who are here illegally, for \nthe most part, have little education. Approximately half, maybe even \nmore, do not have a high school diploma at all, and their skill levels \nare low.\n  We have statics and scientific data on that. I am not disparaging \nanyone. I respect anyone who works hard and wants to come to America \nand work hard. I respect that. But I can say with certainty these are \nbasically low-wage workers that are going to be legalized.\n  My fifth point is, that the way the bill is written, it will reduce \nthe wages of working Americans. We bring in more cotton in this \ncountry, the price of cotton goes down. You bring in more iron ore, the \nprice of iron ore goes down. If you reduce the amount of oil coming \ninto the country, the price of oil goes up. You bring in more laborers, \nthe price of labor goes down.\n  I would submit that if one of the charges I have made out of these \nfive is true, this legislation should be pulled from the floor; it \nshould not become law. But I am going to take a few moments now to \ndemonstrate, I believe with hard evidence, all of these charges are \ntrue. The legislation, in effect, will not end the unlawfulness of our \ncurrent system and will shift the balance against American workers and \ncreate another amnesty that will encourage even more illegals in the \nfuture.\n  The effect will be to continue the erosion of confidence by the \nAmerican people in Congress, and in the Government overall, which is at \nan all time low, virtually. I am not sure since I have been in the \nSenate, we have such a large number of people who believe this country \nis on the wrong track.\n  I have to believe, and experts have told me, that their distrust and \ndissatisfaction over immigration is a big part of the way, the cause of \nthis cynicism. Let me take some points here, one by one.\n\n  Will this grand bargain we are presented with create an honest, \nlegal, fair system for the future? The answer is no. That was our \nconclusion after we studied the bill. But let's look at what others \nmight say. I mentioned the CBO study. They said specifically that the \nbill would limit the amount of illegal flow across our border by 25 \npercent but would increase illegal visa overstays significantly.\n  The net result was only a 13-percent reduction in illegals, from 10 \nmillion illegals projected to come into our country under current law \nover the next 10 years, to 8.7 illegals coming in over the next 10 \nyears. That is a 13-percent reduction only. That is not good enough. We \nshould be at the 80, 90 percent of increased lawfulness. Aren't we \ntrying to create a system of law?\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years, 12 years as U.S. attorney. \nThis is not acceptable. People come to America because they believe we \nare a Nation of laws; their rights will be protected. I happened to be \nat a birthday party reception for a friend of mine. A lady from England \nthere came up to me and she said: I hope you stand up for this. She had \na distinct British accent. She said: I thought you ought to play right \nby the law and people shouldn't come in illegally. I tried to do the \nright thing.\n  Well, what about others? What do they say? What experts are out there \nwho know something about immigration? What do they think of this bill? \nWhat about Border Patrol officers, people who carry out their daily \nresponsibilities to enforce the border, who have lived with this \nillegality for so long? They are real experts. I assure you they were \nnot in the meeting with the masters of the universe when they crafted \nthis legislation.\n  They know what is happening. A group of them, a prominent group of \nretired Border Patrol officers held a press conference at the National \nPress Club on June 4. Their purpose was to express their opinion about \nthe legislation. I have to tell you, their opinions are not a pretty \nsight. I am going to quote from them and show you what they said; not \nwhat this Senator said but what they said.\n  Hugh Brien, the former Chief of the Border Patrol from 1986 to 1989, \nafter the 1986 failed bill became law--He was appointed by former \nPresident George H.W. Bush. He is himself an immigrant to America. He \ncame here as a young man. This is what he had to say about the bill. It \nis, he said:\n\n       A complete betrayal of the Nation.\n\n  Is that harsh? It was his job. That is what he said about it. He went \non to say:\n\n       It is a slap in the face.\n\n  To the millions who came here legally, such as the lady I met today, \nsuch as a lady from India who was written up in the Montgomery \nAdvertiser, I believe, yesterday, who talked about having to hire a \nlawyer and filing all of the paperwork and taking several years, but \nshe was proud to be here legally, and she did not appreciate people \ncoming illegally, or such as the lady I met at a funeral not long ago \nwho had come into this country after a number of years who said: I hope \nyou make the law enforced for everybody equally; I did it right.\n  Now don't tell me that when you ignore law there are no consequences. \nIn a real sense, as my experience as a prosecutor says, when you don't \nenforce the law, you make chumps of the guys who do it right, and when \nyou provide benefits to those who cheat, it is not a good thing for a \nNation who respects its legal system.\n  What else did Mr. Hugh Brien, former head of the Border Patrol say? \nHe said:\n\n       It is a sell-out.\n\n  He went on to note that in 1986, when this same debate was occurring \nand he was about to take office as the head of the immigration system, \nand these are the words he used--it is not funny, he said: Our masters, \nour mandarins, promised us their bill would work. These are tough \nwords, but these are people who are entitled to express them. They are \nnot my words.\n\n  Powerful politicians who are unaware of the reality of what it takes \nto actually create a legal enforcement system without experience in \nthese matters have arrogantly cut a political deal and they have cut \none, unfortunately, that doesn't work. I guess that is not too far from \nthe definition of a mandarin.\n  Mr. Hugh Brien added these final important words:\n\n       Based on my experience, it's a disaster.\n\n  He has the experience to say so. He was charged with enforcing the \n1986 immigration law which proved to be a disaster and he did, as chief \nof the Border Patrol from 1986 to 1989.\n  What about the national chairman of the Association of Former Border \nPatrol Agents, Kent Lundgren. This is what he had to say. He had some \nharsh words, too. With regard to the promise that the system will do \n24-hour background checks, he said, after studying the bill, there are \n``no meaningful criminal or terrorist checks'' in the bill. That is a \nbad thing. We have been told this bill will make us safer. He says \nthere are no meaningful criminal or terrorist checks in the bill. He \nknows how the system works and how this 24-hour check will occur. He is \nscoring the screening procedure set forth in the bill saying ``the \nscreening will not happen, period.'' He added:\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\n``There's no way records can be done in 24 hours.''\n  As to the promise that this bill will work, he concluded--these are \nnot my words; he is presently the associational head of the former \nBorder Patrol Officers, the national president: ``Congress is lying \nabout it.''\n  On a separate issue, the provision that allows gang members, even \nmembers of the very violent international MS-13 gang, to become lawful \npermanent residents if they check a box to renounce their gang \nmembership, he said, ``What planet are they from,'' talking about us. \nWhy would our colleagues write a bill that allowed for this?\n  These are real views, harsh views of a man who led the border patrol \nassociation and had a press conference a few weeks ago to express deep \nconcern.\n  Another one at the press conference was Jim Dorsey, a former Border \nPatrol agent, who served 30 years. He served as inspector general with \nthe Department of Justice. He was promoted up from the Border Patrol, \nwhich is a part of the Department of Justice, to the Department of \nJustice, and was given responsibility to investigate serious \nallegations of corruption. That is quite a responsible position to be \nchosen for that as investigator. He had these things to say: ``The 24-\nhour check is a recipe for disaster.''\n  As to the overall legislation, Mr. Dorsey said at the National Press \nClub: ``I call it the al-Qaida dream bill.''\n  Roger Brandemuehl, chief of the Border Patrol from 1980 to 1986 under \nPresident Reagan--this is another chief of the Border Patrol for 6 \nyears under President Reagan--he said: ``We have fallen into a \nquagmire.'' He added: ``The so-called comprehensive reform is neither \ncomprehensive nor reform. It's flawed.''\n  What about the current Border Patrol Association, the Border Patrol \nunion? It is not just the retired patrol officers who oppose the bill; \nthe current ones do as well. In May, the National Border Patrol \nCouncil, affiliated with the AFL-CIO, sent out a press release titled \n``Senate Immigration Reform Compromise is a Raw Deal for America.'' \nThese are the people who are out doing it every day. The press release \nstated:\n\n       Every person who has ever risked their life securing our \n     boarders is extremely disheartened to see some of our elected \n     representatives once again waving the white flag on issues of \n     illegal immigration and border security. Rewarding criminal \n     behavior has never induced anyone to abide by the law, and \n     there's no reason to believe that the outcome will be any \n     different in this case.\n\n  I spent the better part of my professional career as a prosecutor. If \nyou make it clear that you are not going to enforce laws, people assume \nthe laws won't be enforced. In fact, when law enforcement officers \ndon't enforce the law, they de facto wipe out legislative actions and \neviscerate policy. You have to enforce the laws.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Passage of time has proven the 1986 amnesty to be a mistake \n     of colossal proportions. Instead of wiping the slate clean, \n     it spurred a dramatic increase in illegal immigration.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       Rather than the meaningless triggers of the additional \n     personnel and barriers outlined in the compromise, Americans \n     must insist that border security be measured in absolute \n     terms.\n\n  That is a strong, crystal-clear condemnation of this act by the \nofficers whose lives are on the line this very moment on our border \ntrying to enforce our laws. Are we going to listen to them? Or are we \ngoing to listen to our mandarins, our masters meeting in secret, who \nplopped a bill down here, 700 pages long, that they say will make the \nsystem work? I wish it would. I even had hopes this spring, and I said \nso publicly. I was hoping they might make real progress. But I am \nafraid we haven't. Talk to the experts. Talk to CBO.\n  This is a another very significant, but discrete issue that I believe \nwe should think about, and it is a weakness I had not fully \ncomprehended until I read a piece in the Washington Times by Michael \nCutler on June 21. He also participated in a press conference, a \ndifferent one than the Border Patrol one, at the National Press Club on \nJune 19. The event focused on the grave threat to national security the \nimmigration bill represents. Mr. Cutler authored an op-ed in \nthe Washington Times last Friday entitled ``Immigration Bill Is a No \nGo'' that focused on security issues raised by the bill. People are \ngoing to be invited to come in who are here illegally, give their name \nand so forth, and within 24 hours they will be receiving a legal status \nin the country, a probationary visa. It will soon be converted into \nthis Z visa that people will have, but immediately within 24 hours, \nthey will be provided that, unless something shows up of a serious \nnature in their background. But as these experts have told us, it is \nnot possible to do a very effective check in 24 hours, as you can \nimagine. Even though you can do a computer run, it still has great \nweaknesses in it. So he focuses on this whole issue and says this:\n\n       If a person lies about his or her identity and has never \n     been fingerprinted anywhere in our country, what will enable \n     the bureaucrats at the USCIS--\n\nthat is the agency that will be handing out the immigration benefits--\n\n     to know the person's true identity? If the adjudicators \n     simply run a fictitious identity through a computerized \n     database, they will simply find the name has no connection to \n     any criminal or terrorist watch lists.\n\n  I am quoting him now.\n\n       What is the true value? Remember, we are talking about a \n     false name.\n\n  Let me continue quoting:\n\n       There is absolutely no way this program would have even a \n     shred of integrity and the identity documents that would be \n     given these millions of illegal aliens would enable every one \n     of them to receive a driver's license, Social Security card, \n     and other such official identity documents in a false name.\n       Undoubtedly, terrorists would be among those applying to \n     participate in this ill-conceived program. They would then be \n     able to open bank accounts and obtain credit cards in that \n     same false name. Finally, these cards would enable these \n     aliens to board airliners and trains even if their true names \n     appear on all of the various terrorist watch lists and ``no \n     fly'' lists. That is why I have come to refer to this \n     legislation as the ``Terrorist Assistance and Facilitation \n     Act of 2007.''\n\n  There has been a lot of talk in this Senate about Mexico's consulates \nthroughout the United States issuing matricula cards and that these \nmatricula cards are given based on documents that nobody knows for sure \nhow good they are. Therefore, the cards they have are not really \nguaranteed to be a valid identity, but they are being utilized around \nthe country as legitimate identification. What Mr. Cutler says is the \nidentification documents we will be giving out under this bill will not \nbe any better than matricula cards. It is going to prove nothing more \nthan what the person said to get the card. He may come here, be one of \nthose people who planned to hijack our airplanes and crash them on 9/\n11. Several of them were apprehended by state and local police. But, \nunder this act, unless we had their fingerprints on record--and I am \nsure none of those fingerprints were on record--they would be given an \nofficial ID from the United States government, giving them complete \nfreedom to go anywhere in the country.\n  That is why he calls it ``the Terrorist Assistance and Facilitation \nAct of 2007.'' That is a very serious professional criticism of a core \npart of this legislation.\n  How about this? Mr. Kris Kobach, a former Department of Justice \nattorney under Attorney General Ashcroft and a specialist on terrorism \nand immigration, agrees with Mr. Cutler. He posted an article on the \nHeritage Foundation Web site titled ``The Senate Immigration Bill, a \nNational Security Nightmare.'' The article states:\n\n       The bill will make it easier for alien terrorists to \n     operate in the United States by allowing them to create \n     fraudulent identities with ease.\n\n  Wow, is that a charge? Should we be hell bent to go forward tomorrow \nand move on to a bill that the American people reject and that could be \ncalled a terrorist dream bill that would actually allow and make it \neasier for terrorists to obtain fraudulent identity in this country?\n  Mr. Kobach, a fine lawyer, now professor, goes on to write:\n\n       Supporters of the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform \n     bill have revived it under the guise of national security. \n     However, the new public relations campaign is a farce. The \n     bill offers alien terrorists a new pathway to obtain legal \n     status which will make it easier for them to carry out deadly \n     attacks against American citizens.  The top priority in this \n     bill is extending amnesty as quickly and easily as \n     possible to as many illegal aliens as possible. The cost \n     of doing so is to jeopardize national security.\n\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\n\n  That is a statement from a former Assistant Attorney General of the \nUnited States of America charged with these kinds of issues, now a \nprofessor.\n  Well, we know this: We know the sheriffs along the border have \nabsolutely been in an uproar over our failure to back them up in their \nefforts to create a lawful border. Is anybody listening to them? The \ntruth is, the Senate bill is not going to stop illegal immigration or \neven substantially reduce it. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the new Senate bill will only reduce net annual illegal \nimmigration by 13 percent. There will be additional visa overstays: \n550,000 by 2017 and up to 1 million 10 years later, according to the \nCBO.\n  Now, I mentioned that it promised, at the beginning, a move to a more \nmerit-based point system for evaluating those applying for citizenship \ninstead of the much-criticized chain migration policy we now have. The \nCanadians have adopted such a policy, after a very careful study over a \nperiod of years, and they are very happy with it. I talked to the head \nof the Canadian immigration system--Monte Goldburg--about it. He said \nthey are very happy with it. They would like to take it even further \ntoward a merit-based system than the current law by which they now \nadmit 60 percent of the immigrants in their country based on a \ncompetitive skills-based system.\n  But, unfortunately, the bill fails to meet this goal. For the next 8 \nyears--almost a decade--instead of moving to a merit-based system and \nending the chain-based system, chain migration will increase. After \nthat, merit admissions will reach just more than one-third of all \nimmigrants entering our country. So we will continue this system that, \nin effect, favors lack of education and low-skill workers, and denies \nentry to those who have higher skills, education, speak English, and \nhave college degrees.\n  How does that chain migration work? You see, if you are here, you got \namnesty last time, or if you came here legally, you are then allowed to \nbring your wife and children. I think we should always have that. So I \nam not opposing wives and children. But under current law, you are \nallowed to also immigrate your parents, and your brothers and your \nsisters. You can bring a brother, and the brother can bring his wife \nand their children; and your sister, likewise. These would come based \non their family connection only and not based on any skills they might \noffer to our country. So I am worried about that. I do not think we \nhave accomplished a large enough move in the direction the drafters \nindicated they would. I thank them for at least dealing with the issue \nthis year, which was not dealt with last year.\n  This is very important--very, very important. I will just say, you \nsee, it is a zero-sum game. We cannot admit everybody who would like to \nbe an American citizen. That is a fundamental principle. That is a \nfundamental principle. In the year 2000, 11 million people applied for \nthe 50,000 lottery slots. There are 50,000 slots in America where they \ndraw your name out of a hat. You send your name in, they put it in \nthere, and they draw the names. Mr. President, 11 million applied. That \ngives an indication of how many people would like to come to America.\n  So if you have an overall cap on how many people can come legally and \nyou are allowing parents and brothers and sisters--without any \nreference to whether they have any skills or not--then you are denying \nslots to people. Let's say two people apply from Honduras. One was \nvaledictorian of his high school class. He wants to come to America and \nlearn English. He has 2 years of college and technical training. That \nperson applies. Another one is a brother of somebody who is in the \nUnited States. That brother maybe does not have a high school diploma, \nmaybe is basically illiterate even in the language of which he was \nraised. Who is going to get in? The brother gets in and denies, \ntherefore, a slot, an entry right to somebody who has a better chance, \nstatistically speaking, of flourishing in the great American \nexperience.\n  So I do not think it is a harsh thing for America to say: If you \nleave your community and you come to America and we agree to allow you \nto be an American citizen, what obligation do we, then, have to you to \nsay you get to bring your parents and your brothers and sisters, \nwhether or not they will provide and be able to be successful in \nAmerica?\n  I just do not get it. I think the country has a right to say: Let's \nhave people compete for those slots, and the best persons--the ones who \nare likely to prosper the most and be most successful--ought to be the \nones who get the benefits.\n  My fine staff people, Cindy Hayden and Jenny Lee, have examined the \ndetails of this legislation. They have consulted others and concluded \nthat over the next 20 years the law will provide twice as many persons \nwith legal permanent status in our country as we would under current \nlaw. I do not believe the American people understand this. I do not \nbelieve they think that is what reform is about.\n  Of course, as I noted, illegal immigration is not going to go down \nbut 13 percent. So I would pose this question to my colleagues: How can \nyou call this a ``grand bargain''? It is more like a Faustian one, to \nme. Just like in 1986, there is a grant of amnesty to virtually \neveryone here--no illegal alien left behind, and a lack of enforcement.\n  In fact, this amnesty will be another incentive for illegals to \nbelieve they will be given amnesty in the future once again. Indeed, no \none has promised to not give amnesty again. I thought a most \ninteresting speech--I happened to catch it--was by Chuck Grassley, the \nSenator from Iowa, who was here in 1986. He said he is not supporting \nthis bill. He said: I was here in 1986, and everybody said this is a \none-time amnesty. It will not happen again. We are going to fix this \nsystem. Trust us.\n\n  Of course, we did not fix the system, and they gave 3 million people \namnesty then. Now we are looking at 12 million. But the key thing in \nSenator Grassley's speech that I thought went to the core of what we \nare about and why we ought to have a pause here is, he said: Nobody has \ncome on this floor and said we won't give amnesty again in the future. \nHe said: You will not hear them say it. Why? Because we moved into a \npattern of ignoring the law and not enforcing it.\n  What about costs? You have heard the talk: If given amnesty, our \nillegal population will pay taxes. They are hard working. This will \nhelp America. It will help increase our population. The Medicare and \nSocial Security systems are in long-term jeopardy. These new workers \nwill help us save Medicare and Social Security.\n  You have heard those arguments. I have to tell you, I wish that were \ntrue. I even myself thought it might be several years ago. But the fact \nis, nothing could be further from the truth. Out of 12 million people \nwho would be given amnesty--I call it amnesty. Different people have \ndifferent words. It is not a loaded question to me. I have said \nrepeatedly that persons who are here unlawfully now, who came here \nwrongly, who have been here a number of years, who have worked hard, \nwho have obeyed the law, have children, perhaps, deep roots in our \nsociety--I do not think we can ask all those people to leave. I am not \nasking for that to be a part of my proposal to fix immigration. But \nwhen you give people an absolute status, I guess I think amnesty is a \nfair word for it.\n  My personal view is we should never, ever, after 1986, give people \nwho come to our country illegally all the benefits we give to people \nwho come to our country legally. That is my view of it. We will make a \nmistake if we do it again this time. But some sort of lawful process \nwhere people can stay and be legal and not have these burdens--for \nthose who have earned it and done well--I am willing to accept it. But \nof the 12 million who are here, half do not have a high school diploma. \nMost have lower skills. They overwhelmingly are lower income workers. \nThey will immediately be treated like green card holders--legal \npermanent residents--and be entitled to all the benefits that low-\nincome American workers get, which are paid for by the U.S. taxpayers. \nAs low-income workers, they will pay little, if any, income taxes--we \nknow that--while gaining the child tax credit for their children, food \nstamps, subsidized housing, education, and health care at our emergency \nrooms.\n  So in one part of the analyses, the Congressional Budget Office adds \nup all\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\nthese numbers, and they conclude that the cost over the next 10 years \nto the taxpayers of this country--not including enforcement, fences, \nborder patrol, all that stuff; just the cost from legalizing those who \nare here illegally--will be over $30 billion.\n  Now, with my amendment I offered to delay the earned-income tax \ncredit payments to illegal immigrants who are here, and to delay it \nuntil at least they became a legal permanent resident, we would reduce \nthat to maybe $25 billion. That passed by a narrow margin, which I was \npleased to have passed, but all the rest of the benefits are there, so \nwe are looking at perhaps a $25 billion net drain on the U.S. Treasury, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. They admit it will be \nmuch greater in the future.\n  In the outyears, the costs will increase because the way the bill is \nwritten, certain benefits are not made available initially to those who \nare given legal status, but their benefits will increase in the years \nto come. How much will those increases be? When asked if it would be a \nsubstantial increase in the future, the Congressional Budget Office--\nwhich did not score beyond the 10 years--said certainly, absolutely, it \nwould be a substantial increase.\n  One institution has looked at this figure: the Heritage Foundation. \nThe Heritage Foundation's senior fellow, Robert Rector, has spent \nmonths on this very issue. He used the best available statistics in \ncalculating the costs to the American Government--State, Federal, and \nlocal treasuries--of amnesty. It is a picture that I think, as \nresponsible legislators, as representatives of our own constituents, we \nhave to think about, we have to acknowledge. The number he came up with \nis so large that many people have just tried to dismiss it without any \nthought. But Robert Rector is one of the foremost experts in this \ncountry on welfare and social programs. He was the architect of the \nwelfare reform President Clinton vetoed two or three times and finally \nsigned and took credit for for the rest of his tenure. How wonderful it \nwas. It did work exceedingly well. Mr. Rector's analysis cannot be \nlightly dismissed. He concludes that the cost to Federal, State, and \nlocal governments from just retirement of the 12 million to their death \nwould be $2.6 trillion.\n\n  It is clear any short-term benefit--whatever the exact number is out \nthere, whatever the exact number is--any short-term benefit provided to \nAmerican businesses who would enjoy these low-skilled workers would be \nmore than offset by the lifetime costs of tax credits, welfare, food \nstamps, Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare that will be picked up \nby the American public--the taxpayers.\n  Mr. Rector said: ``This is a fiscal disaster.''\n  Finally, I believe this legislation, because it will not reduce \nillegal immigration and will double--only a 13-percent reduction--and \nwill double legal immigration, will put even more stress than we \ncurrently have on working middle-class Americans. It will have a \ntendency to pull down wages of American workers. That is their asset: \ntheir labor. But workers are more than a mere asset; they are human \nbeings. They are created with inalienable rights, according to our \nDeclaration, and they are citizens who are the ultimate shareholders of \nAmerica. Citizenship carries responsibilities for them and for us. We \npay taxes. We serve in the military to the point of giving our lives \nfor our country.\n  I have talked to a lot of mamas and fathers in the last several years \nwho have had their sons--middle-class Americans who are serving our \ncountry in Iraq and Afghanistan who have lost their lives in service to \nour country.\n  We have an obligation to obey the law. We accept court rulings even \nif they are silly and absurd. That is what we do. We grumble, but we \nfollow what the court says. We obey laws passed by this Congress, \nwhether we like them or not, whether they make sense or not. That is \nthe responsibility of citizenship in this Nation we have inherited.\n  Those of us now in Congress I submit have an obligation to those \ndutiful citizens who serve every day doing the right thing. We owe them \nsomething. One thing we owe them is consistent and fair application and \nenforcement of the law. Another is to make sure those who do the right \nthing are rewarded or allowed to prosper and those who do not are \ndisadvantaged. This is the definition of a morally ordered society. We \nare a community of people, voluntarily bound together in many ways. It \nis the uniqueness of America. It is our strength. But do not ever doubt \nthat that moral order, that proper balance, can be eroded if we are \nirresponsible in this body. It can even be lost.\n  Labor is more than barrels of oil, tons of iron ore, bales of cotton, \nor kilowatts of electricity. Our workers are our citizens, created \nbeings of infinite worth. They have every right to expect, to demand, \nthat their elected representatives protect their interests, their \ncountry's legitimate national interests, not just what might be seen as \nan immediate benefit to that abstraction we might refer to as ``the \neconomy.''\n  So I believe in immigration. I support immigration. I do not want to \nend it. I support an effective temporary worker program. But let's tell \nthe truth about immigration and wages in this country. The elites are \ndoing very well in this boom period, corporations are making record \nprofits, but what about our citizens of this Republic who are less \nskilled? What have their wages done?\n  We have had a series of witnesses, including Dr. Chiswick from the \nUniversity of Illinois. We had Professor Borjas of the Kennedy School \nat Harvard. We had Alan Tonnel at a Senate hearing. We had a hearing \nand all of them testified and all of them agreed that large numbers of \nimmigrants are, in fact, reducing wages of American citizens.\n  I left this Senate Chamber Friday after talking about this issue, and \nI mentioned wages. I went out, and right on the corner there was a \ngentleman with a homemade cardboard sign. He had white hair and gray in \nhis beard.\n  I said: Well, what brings you here?\n  He said: Well, I wanted to come up and have my say about this \nimmigration bill. He told me he was a master carpenter and that he was \nfrom Melbourne, FL, and that in the 1990s he made $75,000 a year. He \nsaid he can hardly stay in business today because of the large flow of \nimmigrant workers that has pulled down his ability to have the kind of \nincome he would like.\n  Now, some may think that is too much money for a carpenter. I don't, \nnot if he works hard and not if he is good. Don't think there are not \nmillions of Americans who have given their lives to developing a skill \nand a craft and that, in the blink of an eye, can be made less valuable \nby an unwise, ineffective, inappropriate immigration policy.\n  So there is a lot we need to think about as we debate this bill. I am \nabsolutely convinced it will not do what it promises, and what it will \ndo may be adverse to our country. I am very worried about it. There is \nno reason whatsoever in the face of overwhelming public opposition that \nwe should be bringing it up, and there is no reason whatsoever that the \nmajority leader should be utilizing this clay pigeon procedure which, \napparently, he will execute tomorrow, that will allow us to vote only \non the amendments he chooses and to craft this procedure for handling \nthis bill to minimize to the nth degree the amount of time we have \navailable to debate it. I think that is a mistake. I object to that and \nurge my colleagues to vote tomorrow not to proceed to the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, before making my closing procedural \nremarks and turning the floor over to the Senator from Indiana, I would \nlike to use morning business for a brief moment to respond to the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Our views on the immigration issue are much different. I happen to \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\nthe current immigration system is a disaster. It is unfair to the \npeople of America to allow 800,000 or more undocumented people to come \ninto our country each year, three-fourths of whom will remain in our \ncountry, as they have over the last 20 years.\n  Today there are about 12 million undocumented people. We have to stop \nthe flow of undocumented across the border. The underlying immigration \nbill focuses on enforcement. The version that will be before us this \nweek for the very first time invests $4 billion in enforcement. Those \nwho argue we need to have stronger borders instead of broken borders, \nthose who argue we should have enforcement in the workplace, should \nsupport this bill. It creates the laws and the tools to do that.\n  I might also add I don't believe the procedural arguments are valid. \nFirst, let me say this bill has been on the floor pending, available \nfor scrutiny for weeks--4 weeks, 5 weeks, at least. Anyone who argues \nthey haven't had a chance to look at this bill, it isn't for lack of \nopportunity, as everyone should for a bill of this consequence.\n  The second argument that somehow this process we are about to embark \nupon is so unusual as to be unfair, what the Senator failed to note is \nthat the amendments which will be considered this week are an agreed-\nupon list of amendments on a bipartisan basis. Democratic leaders, \nRepublican leaders came together and are offering over 20 amendments \nwhich will be debated on and considered this week. There are amendments \noffered by Senators who are going to oppose this bill no matter what it \nsays and amendments offered by those who support it.\n  There will be ample opportunity for more debate on a bill that has \nalready been debated for weeks--a bill which has been subjected to \nalmost 40 amendments. I think most people understand the gravity of \nthis bill, the importance of this bill, and the complexity of this \nbill. It is the effort of the majority leader, Harry Reid, to finally \nbring this matter to closure and a vote.\n  There are some, who for a variety of different reasons, oppose this \nbill who have said: We will do everything within our power to stop this \nmatter from coming to a vote. That is their right as Senators in this \nChamber. It is the right of those who want to bring it to a vote to use \nthe rules for their purposes. That is the nature of this body. That is \nwhat the Senate is all about. So I think it will be a fair process.\n  At the end of the week, we will have considered this bill in its \nentirety and subjected it to amendment and debate. That is what the \nSenate should be about, and that is what this bill is concerned with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8352-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SUPREME COURT RULING\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 6 years ago I took to this floor to \nexpress the view that any campaign finance law must be written within \nthe boundaries of the first amendment. It states:\n\n       Congress shall make no law, respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the \n     right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition \n     the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  This very amendment adorns the facade of the yet-to-open Newseum a \nfew blocks from here on Pennsylvania Avenue--a building constructed, \nboth philosophically and physically, upon the cornerstone of our first \namendment rights.\n  Today the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the U.S. Congress went too \nfar 5 years ago in legislating restrictions on First Amendment rights. \nIn its ruling this morning in Wisconsin Right to Life vs. FEC, the \nCourt righted that wrong.\n  It took an important first step toward restoring the rights of \norganizations to petition the government and members of Congress.\n  The court rejected an intent-and-effect test for advertisements and \ninstead went with a susceptible of no other reasonable interpretation \nthan an appeal to vote for or against a candidate.\n  However, and most importantly, in a debatable case the tie is \nresolved in favor of protecting speech.\n  As the Chief Justice noted in his decision for the majority:\n\n       Where the First Amendment is implicated, the tie goes to \n     the speaker, not the censor:\n\n  It is fitting that this opinion should come down as we approach the \nFourth of July recess, when we return home to celebrate those freedoms \nfor which our forefathers fought and died.\n  What better tribute to their efforts than the affirmation of our \nright--not just ability--but right of freedom to speech and the right \nto petition the government for a redress of grievances.\n  This afternoon, we will witness our new colleague from Wyoming be \nsworn, reminding us of the oath we all took upon election to this body \nto, ``Preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates of America.''\n  Chief Justice Roberts summed up this case and, in fact, the entire \ncampaign finance debate so well that I would like to close with his \nwords. He wrote:\n\n       These cases are about political speech. The importance of \n     the cases to speech and debate on public policy issues is \n     reflected in the number of diverse organizations that have \n     joined in supporting Wisconsin Right to Life before this \n     Court: the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Rifle \n     Association, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of \n     Industrial Organizations, the Chamber of Commerce of the \n     United States of America, Focus on the Family, the Coalition \n     of Public Charities, the Cato Institute, and many others.\n\n  In his closing paragraph, the Chief Justice reminded us what lies at \nthe heart of this issue. After quoting the language of the first \namendment, he wrote:\n\n       The Framers' actual words put these cases in proper \n     perspective. Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has \n     rejected an absolutist interpretation of those words, but \n     when it comes to drawing difficult lines in the area of pure \n     political speech--between what is protected and what the \n     Government can ban--it is worth recalling the language we are \n     applying: when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as \n     the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such \n     a ban--the issue we do have to decide-we give the benefit of \n     the doubt to speech, not censorship. The First Amendment's \n     command that ``Congress shall make no law .  .  . abridging \n     the freedom of speech'' demands at least that.\n\n  It is a good day for the first amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8352-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8352-S8353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S.

He always got to the nub of \nthe problem and never failed to tell it just as he saw it. On many \noccasions, I sensed he had a great frustration with the system, but he \nstayed in there and was an encouragement to many.\n  When he got sick, Janet and I put him on our prayer list. I also \nlooked at some health care alternatives for him in Cleveland, but he \nfelt he had great care at the Bethesda Naval Hospital. The last time I \nsaw him, he looked like the old Craig, full of vim and vigor. We were \nshocked when we heard of his passing. It is said that it is not the \nnumber of years one lives that counts but what one does with those \nyears that matters. We will all miss Craig but know that he is in \nheaven with our father eternally happy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8353-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8353-S8354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       POSITIVE ENERGY DIRECTION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week this body passed energy \nlegislation that finally sets the U.S. energy policy in a new, positive \ndirection. In 2005, I opposed the Energy bill because it did not \nestablish a sound and fiscally responsible energy policy. The Renewable \nFuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 will help \nwean the United States of oil dependence, encourage the development of \nrenewable energy, and promote energy efficiency, and I was pleased to \nsupport it.\n  The bill includes many important provisions. A renewable fuel \nstandard of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022 will help spur \nthe development of advanced fuels such as cellulosic ethanol, which \nholds a lot of promise for my home State of Wisconsin. The bill also \nincludes anti-price gouging language, based on Senator Cantwell's bill \nthat I cosponsored, to protect consumers from price gouging by sellers \nand distributors of oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillates during \nnatural disasters and abnormal market disruptions.\n  The bill also includes a proposal of mine that supports local \nrenewable energy--an issue I am committed to advancing and hear a lot \nabout during the listening sessions I annually hold in every county of \nWisconsin. My amendment, cosponsored by Senators Sanders and Menendez, \nguarantees that a new energy and environmental block grant program \nwould provide resources to cities and counties nationwide to reduce \nfossil fuel emissions, reduce energy use, and improve energy efficiency \nwhile ensuring these improvements do not harm the environment and \nretain the benefits of activities within the local community, such as \nencouraging local or cooperative ownership of bioenergy efforts.\n  Our Nation's addiction to oil poses a significant threat to our \neconomy, our security, and our environment. The Federal Government \nshould allow and encourage State and local governments to improve their \nenergy policies while creating opportunities for rural Americans to \nproduce and benefit from renewable energy. My amendment is based on my \nlarger effort to increase opportunities for rural America outlined in \nmy Rural Opportunities Act. Introduced in February 2007, the Rural \nOpportunities Act helps sustain and strengthen rural economies for the \nfuture and create more opportunities in rural communities. A crucial \ncomponent of the bill is ensuring that the potential benefits from \ndomestic renewable energy are gained in an environmentally responsible \nmanner that benefits local communities.\n  During debate on this important bill, I also supported several \nefforts to improve it. I was pleased to cosponsor several successful \namendments including one offered by the senior Senator from Wisconsin, \nMr. Kohl, to make oil-producing and exporting cartels illegal, and make \ncolluding oil-producing nations liable in U.S. court for violations of \nantitrust law. I also cosponsored the amendment from the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Salazar, that states the sense of Congress that America's \nagricultural, forestry, and working lands should provide 25 percent of \nthe total energy consumed in the United States from renewable sources \nby the year 2025 while continuing to produce safe, abundant, and \naffordable food, feed, and fiber.\n  I supported an amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana, Mr. \nBayh, that sets aggressive targets for reducing oil consumption by \n10,000 billion barrels a day by 2030. The language is simple--it sets \nour goal, and we have to figure out how to get there. We are a country \nof innovators. Whether it is wind, solar, biodiesel, or a technology we \nstill have not dreamed of yet, we can--and we must--break our addiction \nto oil. This bold, aggressive amendment can help ensure that we meet \nour goal of real energy independence and security.\n  Any plan to move away from our dependence on oil needs to address \nfuel efficiency standards for our vehicles. In the last few years, I \nhave joined a majority of my Senate colleagues in supporting \nlegislation requiring the administration to increase fuel efficiency, \nbut we have so far been unsuccessful in getting this requirement \nenacted. I supported a proposal from several of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Pryor and Levin, that was crafted to increase fuel \nefficiency standards substantially without jeopardizing the jobs of \nmany hard-working Wisconsinites. It is unfortunate this amendment was \nnever offered. I will be following the House and Senate conference \nclosely to ensure that the final bill strikes the right balance on this \nissue.\n  I am also disappointed that the Senate was unable to muster the \nnecessary votes to overcome Republican objections to a tax package \nreported by the Finance Committee that would boost energy efficiency \nand renewable energy programs. The cost of these new or extended tax \nincentives was fully offset. It is also unfortunate that the Senate \ncould not once again pass a renewable portfolio standard to ensure that \nall States' utilities are producing a minimum percentage of renewable \nenergy. My home State of Wisconsin is one of about 20 States that \ncurrently have such a standard, but a Federal standard would help level \nthe playing field.\n  It is encouraging, however, that the Senate soundly rejected \nproposals to mandate the use of and direct Federal money to develop \ncoal-to-liquid facilities. Private investors have not been willing to \ninvest in this technology in the United States because of significant \ncapital costs and risks, not to mention the unproven technology to \ncapture and store greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Energy security is an important issue for America and one which my \nWisconsin constituents take very seriously. I am pleased this bill \nrejects the efforts of some of my colleagues to insist on drilling for \noil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge would sacrifice one of America's \ngreatest natural treasures for a supply of oil that would not \nsignificantly enhance our energy security. The supply of oil in the \nArctic Refuge may not last more than a year, would not be available for \nmany years to come, and would decrease gas prices by only a penny when \nthe Refuge is at its highest\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\nrate of production. Drilling in the Arctic Refuge does nothing to \naddress the immediate need of the Federal Government to respond to \nfluctuations in gas prices and help expand refining capacity. Those who \noffer the Refuge as the solution to our need for energy independence \nare pointing us in the wrong direction.\n  This year's Energy bill finally moves past this misguided debate and \nother fiscally and environmentally irresponsible proposals. The United \nStates is at an important juncture. By supporting the Energy bill, I am \nsupporting a new direction for our Nation's energy policy: one that \nencourages renewable energy, conservation of the resources we have, and \nAmerican innovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8354-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GREAT LAKES SHORT SEA SHIPPING ACT\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I speak in support of the Great Lakes \nShort Sea Shipping Act of 2007. This legislation will exempt from the \nharbor maintenance tax certain commercial cargo loaded or unloaded at \nU.S. ports in the Great Lakes Saint Lawrence System.\n  In recent years, transportation planners have been struggling to \nidentify ways to move people and goods more efficiently. Congested \nhighways, particularly at the Detroit, Michigan/Windsor, Ontario border \ncrossing, the busiest border crossing in North America, acts as a huge \nconstraint to economic growth.\n  The purpose of the Harbor Maintenance Tax, HMT, is to generate \nrevenue from port users for port maintenance conducted by the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers. The Corps maintains Federal shipping channels by \nconducting periodic dredging, which is necessary to remove sand and \nsilt that occur naturally in shipping channels. HMT receipts are placed \nin the harbor maintenance trust fund, which serves as a source of \nrevenue for the Corps' dredging budget. The HMT is assessed on cargo \ntransported between U.S. ports and cargo imported to U.S. ports from \nother countries. Exports are not assessed a tax. More specifically, the \ntax is not paid by the vessel owner, nor the port, but by the owner of \nthe cargo in each ship. The bill would provide a narrow exemption to \nthe HMT for the movement of nonbulk only commercial cargo by water in \nthe Great Lakes region, which includes the movement of freight and \npeople between the U.S. ports on the Great Lakes and between Canadian \nand U.S. ports on the Great Lakes.\n  This very narrow exemption would remove the current disincentive to \nmoving freight by water and allow the region's transportation planners \nto develop new shipping services to not only relieve highway \ncongestion, but to improve air quality as well. Moreover, the \nlegislation could open up new shipping services to be offered on the \nGreat Lakes, thus creating jobs in the maritime sector. One of the \nother benefits is that this exemption will offer options for trucks \nthat may choose to use the bridges, tunnels, or now ferry service. \nBecause the Detroit/Windsor border crossing is the busiest border \ncrossing in North America, any alternative mode of transportation that \nallows for commerce to flow more smoothly, quickly, and efficiently is \nbeneficial not only to the Great Lakes region, but to the country. \nAlso, in this time of us working to be more responsible and have a \ncleaner environment for our children, allowing trucks off of the \ncongested highways and onto ferries where they can cut off engines and \nnot idle, will reduce air emissions, improve air quality, and cut down \non gasoline usage.\n  Moreover, since trucks currently use roads rather than ferries to \nmove around the Great Lakes region, the Federal Government does not HMT \non their cargo. Under this proposed legislative exemption, if a truck \nboarded a ferry, the Federal Government would still not collect a tax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8354-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Staff Sergeant Roy P. Lewsader, Jr.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude, I honor the life of a brave soldier from Clinton. Roy P. \nLewsader, Jr., 36 years old, was killed on June 16 while deployed in \nTarin Kowt, Afghanistan, when a rocket-propelled grenade detonated near \nhis vehicle. With a promising future ahead of him, Roy risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Roy was killed while serving his country in Operation Enduring \nFreedom, his second tour of duty in the ongoing war against terrorism. \nHe was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, stationed in \nFort Riley, KS.\n  Today, I join Roy's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Roy, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Roy was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Roy will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Roy's sacrifice, I am \nreminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of \nthe fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Roy's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Roy P. Lewsader, Jr. in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Roy's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Roy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8354-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8354-S8355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT E. STURM\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, at the end of this week Robert E. Sturm \nwill retire following a long and distinguished career of exemplary \nservice to the U.S. Senate, most recently as chief clerk of the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. We could not have had \na more capable, conscientious and dedicated chief clerk for these many \nyears. More important, though, we will miss Bob's friendly helpfulness \nto each member of our committee, to all of the staff who work on and \nwith our committee and to the many members of the public who follow the \nwork of our committee.\n  Bob Sturm began his service to the Senate 33 years ago in 1974, \nshortly after graduating from college, as a mail room clerk for Senator \nBirch Bayh of Bob's home State of Indiana. He served as mailroom clerk \nand mailroom manager for Senators Dick Clark of Iowa, Donald Stewart of \nAlabama, and Russell B. Long of Louisiana. For 2 years he was an office \nsystems consultant for the Senate Computer Center where he assisted 14 \nSenate offices and helped lay the groundwork for today's Senate-wide \ncomputer network.\n  Bob served as Senator Patrick Leahy's office manager before he became \nthe financial clerk and systems administrator for the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry in 1987, when Senator Leahy became \nchairman. Bob was promoted to chief clerk for the committee under \nChairman Dick Lugar in 1995 and has held the position under several \nsucceeding chairmen. Of course, I was pleased have Bob continue as \nchief clerk when I became chairman in 2001. He then continued in that \nposition when Senator Cochran and Senator Chambliss chaired the \ncommittee and when I once again became chairman earlier this year. It \nis a tremendous testament to\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\nBob's abilities, professionalism and dedication that he has served as \nchief clerk for such a number of chairmen of both parties.\n  For all of these years, we could always count on Bob to take care of \nall types and any number of details to make sure our committee \nfunctioned smoothly. He took responsibility for everything from \nstocking supplies, to covering the front office, to troubleshooting the \ncomputer system, to handling the whole range of committee finances, \nrules and legislative documents and reports. Bob starts the day early \nand on many occasions, without hesitation, has stayed late into the \nnight, or even overnight, to do what needed to be done. Thanks to this \nhigh level of dedication, we could always be sure that the paperwork \nand other details were in order for hearings and committee meetings. \nAlso, of special note, Bob very successfully oversaw the recent \nrenovation of our beautiful committee hearing room in the Russell \nBuilding.\n  Former Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine once said, ``Public \nservice must be more than doing a job efficiently and honestly. It must \nbe a complete dedication to the people and to the Nation.'' Those words \nperfectly capture the extraordinary dedication of Bob Sturm.\n  We all congratulate Bob on the milestone of his retirement from the \nSenate. I also thank him for all of his great work and express my \ngratitude for his friendship and invaluable help to all of us over the \nyears. I am but one of many who wish Bob all the best, with many years \nof health and happiness, as he begins this new phase in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8355-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        NATIONAL GRASSLANDS WEEK\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while many may not know, last \nweek was National Grasslands Week. I would like to join Secretary \nJohannes and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to celebrate and \nrecognize the legacy represented by the establishment and maintenance \nof our national grasslands and to honor all of the individuals that \nhave worked so diligently over the years to preserve New Mexico's \nprecious grassland ecosystem.\n  In my home State of New Mexico we enjoy the luxury of hosting two \nofficially designated national grassland areas. Those are the Kiowa and \nthe Rita Blanca National Grasslands. These grassland reserves, located \nnear the towns of Clayton and Roy, in the northeastern part of the \nState, are chartered under the Cibola National Forest System. They are \nboth ongoing ecosystem restoration projects that were implemented \nfollowing the Dust Bowl in the 1930s.\n  While the Kiowa and Rita Blanca National Grasslands started as a \nmeans to preserve the environment and wildlife, they are rich in \ncultural significance as well. The lands were once inhabited by a \nnumber of Native-American tribes, including the Comanche, Kiowa, and \nKiowa-Apaches. They were nomadic tribes whose culture depended heavily \non hunting Buffalo and gathering food from the areas vast array of \nnative plants. The area also plays a significant part in the history of \nthe Wild West as the Homestead Act of 1862 brought thousands of \nsettlers out West, many of which settle in the grasslands of eastern \nNew Mexico. They contain over 100 individual grazing permits, which \nincorporate the use of a wide variety of grazing management techniques, \na large range of pinon-juniper management programs, which includes \nprescribed burning and mechanical treatment along with a personal use \nfuel wood program, and many active partnerships with State and local \ngovernments, and other entities such as Quail Unlimited and New Mexico \nState University's Clayton Livestock Research Center.\n  The National Grasslands of northeastern New Mexico provide thousands \nof acres of wildlife habitat, livestock forage and even serve as \ncenters for recreation and clean energy initiatives. The Kiowa and Rita \nBlanca National Grasslands also attract many visitors who get to see \nfirsthand the biological wealth, culture, and heritage the grasslands \npreserve and maintain. Visitors can participate in a wide range of \nactivities like camping, picnicking, fishing, and wildlife viewing and \nget a taste of our western heritage.\n  The New Mexico's Grasslands provide a place of peace, quiet, and \nbeautiful sunsets. Next time you are in my home State, I invite and \nencourage you to visit these great places in northeast New Mexico. I \ncommend USDA, which has managed public grasslands to meet the needs of \nthe American people for over seven decades, and salute the staff of the \nCibola National Forest and the people of New Mexico who work so hard to \nhelp administer these grasslands in a way to maintain and preserve \nsustainable use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8355-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING COACH TERRY HOEPPNER\n\n Mr. Bayh. Mr. President, today Senator Lugar and I, with heavy \nhearts, honor the life of a great Hoosier from Woodburn, IN, Terry \nHoeppner. Coach Hoeppner died last week after battling brain cancer for \nseveral years.\n  He graduated from Franklin College in 1969. After graduation, he \nbegan his career as a coach, spending time coaching high school \nfootball in Indiana, South Carolina, and Alabama until he was hired by \nhis alma mater's football program in 1980.\n  He was the defensive coordinator for 6 years at Franklin College \nuntil he was hired by Miami University in Oxford, OH. He spent 13 years \nas an assistant coach until 1999, when he was promoted to head football \ncoach, a position he held for 6 years.\n  Coach Hoeppner came to Indiana University in 2004 as the new head \nfootball coach and brought with him a new energy to Bloomington. At his \nfirst press conference, he stated that, ``Our goals are simple--100 \npercent graduation rate, and the Rose Bowl. We will shoot for \nperfection, and we can settle for excellence.''\n  In March, doctors were forced to hold Coach Hoeppner out of spring \npractices, and on June 19, 2007, he finally succumbed to the disease. \nHe is survived by his wife, Jane; his children, Drew, Amy, and Allison; \nand his grandchildren, Tucker, Spencer, Tate, and Quinn.\n  Coach Hoeppner was held in high esteem by both colleagues and former \nplayers. Pat Fitzgerald, Northwestern University football coach said, \n``He was one of the great role models in our coaching profession.''\n  Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, who played for \nHoeppner at Miami said, ``He has been a second father, a teacher and a \nfriend. He believed in me and I owe everything to him for where I am in \nlife. I hold the deepest love and respect for him, his wife Jane, and \ntheir family. He has been a role model for so many young men. I aspire \nto be as honorable and touch as many lives as Coach Hep. I will miss \nhim more than words can describe.''\n  It is our sad duty to add the name of Terry Hoeppner in the official \nrecord of the Senate for the role he played in the lives of so many \nyoung athletes.

Mr. President, with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude I honor the life of a dedicated police officer from Indiana. \nFrank Denzinger, 32 years old, died on June 18, 2007, from a gunshot \nwound he suffered in the line of duty as a Floyd County sheriff's \ndeputy. Frank risked his life, every day, to serve and protect Hoosiers \nin order to make Indiana a better place.\n  Frank was a good man and was well loved by the Floyd County \ncommunity. He was best known for his devotion to his family as a loyal \nfather, husband, son, and brother. He was a loving husband to Tara, who \nsaid their 2-year-old daughter, Avery, was his ``pride and joy.'' He is \nalso survived by his parents Frank W. and Patricia, as well as his \nsisters, Sara Rowe and Amy Cook.\n  Frank was a graduate of Floyd Central High School, and also graduated \nwith honors from Vincennes University and Eastern Kentucky University. \nHe was a 4-year veteran of the Floyd County Sheriff's Department. The \nformer Floyd County Sheriff who hired him, Randy Hubbard, described him \nas being an ``excellent, high-quality'' deputy, who was always willing \nto lend a\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nhand to families, ``helping them work out problems, little things.''\n  Frank's last action was one of incredible heroism. After being shot \nin the back, he pushed a woman out of the line of fire and into safety. \nThis final act of bravery not only encompassed his dedication to his \njob and duty to protect, but also illustrated his extraordinary \ncharacter. His friend and fellow deputy, Jeff Firkins, said, ``He was a \nhero to the end. He took every care to make sure everybody else was \nsafe. He was a great person and he had a heart of gold.''\n  Today, I join Frank's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in \nthe example he set, bravely serving to make America a safer place. It \nis his heroism and strength of character that people will remember when \nthey think of Frank, a memory that will burn brightly during these \ncontinuing days of conflict and grief.\n  When I think about Frank's profound commitment to protect and the \npain that accompanies the unjust loss of this outstanding officer, I \nhope that some comfort can be brought to all the loved ones Frank left \nbehind through the words of Peter 3:14, ``but even if you should suffer \nfor what is right, you are blessed.'' Both Frank's final heroic act, as \nwell as his everyday lifestyle, epitomized doing what is right. May God \nbe with all of you who mourn this tragic loss, as I know He is with \nFrank.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Frank C.

A bill to reduce the sentencing disparity between powder and \ncrack cocaine violations, and to provide increased emphasis on \naggravating factors relating to the seriousness of the offense and the \nculpability of the offender; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1685, the \nFairness in Drug Sentencing Act of 2007. I am joined in this effort by \nmy colleagues, Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, and Specter. This \nbipartisan, balanced effort will adjust the existing statutory ratio \nfor cocaine sentencing to craft a more rational and effective \nsentencing policy. I must underscore that this bill continues to offer \nsignificant penalties for drug dealers and ensures that those who \ncontinue to peddle dangerous substances in our communities will endure \nharsh consequences for their destructive choices; at the same time, \nthough, S. 1685 rectifies a longstanding disparity in cocaine \nsentencing that should have been fixed two decades ago.\n  Some background might be appropriate for my colleagues at this point. \nIn 1986, Congress enacted the anti-drug abuse law to address the \ngrowing problem of drug use in our country. This legislation created \nthe basic framework of statutory mandatory minimum penalties which are \ncurrently applicable to Federal drug trafficking offenses.\n  The law differentiated between powder and crack cocaine by \nestablishing significantly higher penalties for crack cocaine offenses. \nIt is likely this was done based on assumptions that crack cocaine was \nconsidered more dangerous and had increased levels of violence \nassociated with its usage. Based on these assumptions, the law provided \nfor quantity-based penalties which differed dramatically between the \ntwo forms of cocaine. Under that law, the current law, it takes 100 \ntimes more powder cocaine than crack cocaine to trigger the same 5- and \n10-year mandatory minimum sentences. This penalty structure is referred \nto as the ``100 to 1 drug ratio.''\n  Over the last decade, public officials, lawmakers, interest groups, \ncriminal justice practitioners, and judges have all criticized and \nquestioned the fairness and practicality of the Federal sentencing \npolicy for cocaine offenses created by the 1986 law. This 100-to-1 \nratio is widely viewed as an unjustifiable disparity. Crack and powder \ncocaine are pharmacologically the same drug, and although the level of \nviolence associated with crack is higher, it does not warrant such an \nextreme sentencing disparity.\n  It should also be noted that during the negotiations in 1986 that \nproduced the 100-to-1 ratio law, a bill was introduced at the request \nof President Reagan which represented the Reagan administration's views \non drug policy. This bill was described as the ``culmination'' of \nPresident Reagan's efforts in his commitment to fight drug abuse. The \nReagan legislation utilized the same quantity of crack cocaine \nnecessary to trigger a 5-year mandatory minimum as what is called for \nin the legislation we are introducing today, reducing the sentencing \ndisparity to a 20-to-1 ratio.\n  While many individuals can disagree on what the appropriate ratio \nshould be, I am completely comfortable recommending the same amount \npreviously requested by President Reagan. I supported his proposed 20-\nto-1 ratio in 1986, and I support this same ratio today.\n  Many organizations share our concern, and the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission has advocated that Congress reduce the sentencing disparity \non four different occasions between 1995 and 2007. The Commission has \nconducted a voluminous amount of research on this topic. This research \nhas led to many conclusions by the Commission, including that the \ncurrent penalties exaggerate the relative harmfulness of crack, sweep \ntoo broadly and apply most often to lower level offenders, and fail to \nprovide adequate proportionality.\n  The Fairness in Drug Sentencing Act continues to recognize that crack \nand powder cocaine are not coequal in their destructive effects. On the \ncontrary, the five-fold reduction in the crack-powder ratio corrects \nthe unjustifiable disparity, while appropriately reflecting the greater \nharm to our citizens and communities posed by crack cocaine.\n  This legislation also seeks to emphasize the defendant's role in the \ncrime and will require the U.S. Sentencing Commission to examine \nsentencing enhancements for all Federal drug violations, including \nmethamphetamine. The Commission's examination should include \nappropriate sentencing enhancements for offenders who brandished a \nweapon, sold to minors or pregnant women, sold drugs near schools, were \ninvolved in the importation of the illegal drugs into our country, or \nhave previous felony drug trafficking convictions.\n  Finding ways to reduce drug crime is not and should not be a partisan \nissue. All individuals involved in this process have tried to design a \nblueprint to curb the spread of drug trafficking and abuse. An easy, \nstraightforward blueprint has unfortunately proven to be elusive. Since \nthe 1970s, Congress has been working to improve Federal sentencing \npolicy and has routinely made necessary changes to make our sentencing \nstructure more just and effective. The bill we introduce today seeks to \nremedy mistakes of the past and will provide a rational and just \nsentencing schedule while continuing to reflect the fundamental and \nbefitting goals of the criminal justice system.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch in \nsupport of this important legislation to reduce the difference in \nsentencing between crack and powder cocaine. It is important to \nameliorate harsh drug laws that have discriminatory consequences.\n  The Sentencing Reform Act was enacted over 20 years ago to reduce \nunwarranted disparities and assure proportionality in punishment. \nInstead, the severity of crack-cocaine sentencing has had a harsh \nimpact on low-income and African-American communities and has \nundermined public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice \nsystem. Unfair sentencing feeds the perception that the criminal \njustice system unjustly targets the poor and minority communities.\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\n  The crack powder laws were intended to punish those at the highest \nlevels of the illegal drug trade, such as traffickers and kingpins. But \nthe low amount needed to trigger the harsh sentences is not associated \nwith high-level drug dealing. As the Sentencing Commission reported in \n2005, only 15 percent of Federal cocaine traffickers were high-level \ndealers. The overwhelming majority of defendants were low-level \nparticipants, such as street dealers, lookouts, or couriers. Harsh \nsentencing in such cases has only a limited impact on the drug trade \nbecause they involve low level offenders who are not at the top of the \ndrug chain. The mass incarceration resulting from these sentences has \ndone nothing to decrease drug use. Recent data indicate that such use \nhas actually increased over time.\n  When these laws were enacted, there was widespread belief in the \nextraordinary dangers of crack cocaine. It was viewed as highly \naddictive and likely to cause violent behavior. We know much more about \ncrack cocaine now than we did 20 years ago. The rationale that crack is \nmore dangerous or more addictive than powder is not supported by \nresearch. In fact, research has demonstrated that the effects of crack \ncocaine are much like the effects of powder cocaine.\n  Medical experts have determined that the pharmacological effects of \ncrack were overstated. They found that crack use doesn't incite violent \nbehavior. As with other drugs, the violence is related to the \ndistribution of the drug.\n  Changes in the drug market have also called the 100-to-1 ratio into \nquestion. Demand for crack cocaine by new users has decreased \nsignificantly, and the violence associated with crack cocaine has \ndeclined. How can Congress continue to support a policy it knows is \nflawed? Changes are long overdue and will be an important step in \nreducing the disparity that plagues drug sentencing policies.\n  Under the current sentencing laws, the statutory ratio for powder and \ncrack cocaine is 100 to 1. One gram of crack cocaine triggers the same \npenalty as 100 grams of powder cocaine. Possession of 5 grams of crack \ntriggers a 5-year mandatory minimum penalty. It is the only drug with a \nmandatory prison sentence for a first-time possession offense. This \ndisparity results from an early attempt by the Commission to \nincorporate congressionally mandated minimum penalties into the \nguidelines, even though such harsh mandatory minimums are completely \ninconsistent with the structure and goals of the Sentencing Reform Act.\n  Judges, experts, and practitioners in the Federal criminal justice \nsystem have long opposed mandatory minimums on the ground that they \nundermine the goals of the Sentencing Reform Act by creating \nunwarranted disparities, subjecting defendants with different levels of \nculpability to the same punishment, and adding another unnecessary \nlayer of complexity to the sentencing process.\n  In its 2002 report, as well as an updated report to Congress in May, \nthe commission has repeatedly recognized that the 100-to-1 ratio \nexaggerates the relative harm of crack cocaine and creates unwarranted \ndisparities that are correlated with race and class. With a new sense \nof urgency, the Commission continues to call on Congress to eliminate \nthe 100-to-1 ratio.\n  Senator Hatch's legislation takes two important steps toward this \ngoal. It reduces the ratio from 100-to-1 to 20-to-1, and it eliminates \nthe mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years for first-time possession. \nUnder the new sentencing scheme proposed by this legislation, the \namount of crack cocaine triggering a mandatory minimum sentence would \nbe raised from 5 grams to 25 grams, an amount that targets the more \nserious traffickers. This change will make cocaine laws more consistent \nwith the penalty structure for other types of drugs that require much \ngreater amounts to trigger a mandatory minimum. For heroin and \nmarijuana, it is 100 grams. Even for methamphetamine, the triggering \namount is 10 grams. Congress must take action to support the \nrecommendations of the Sentencing Commission.\n  Changing the ratio will also provide important benefits to the \ncriminal justice system as a whole. The Sentencing Commission estimates \nthat the 20-to-1 ratio could save over 3,000 prison beds in the Federal \nsystem over a 5-year period, with millions of dollars in savings each \nyear. Resources for prosecution could also be redirected toward more \nserious drug offenders, whose prosecution may actually make a \ndifference in drug trafficking. Adjusting the ratio will also help to \nrestore public confidence and fairness in the criminal justice system. \nCurrently, 5,000 people are convicted under the Federal crack cocaine \nlaws every year. The Sentencing Commission recently proposed amended \nguidelines for crack cocaine by reducing sentencing ranges, a change \nthat will affect 78 percent of Federal defendants. The commission's \nproposed amendment to the guideline will result in an average sentence \nreduction of 16 months.\n  Drug abuse and addiction are increasingly being recognized as public \nhealth issues, not just as crime problems. More resources must be \ndirected at breaking the cycle of drug addiction, which often leads to \ninvolvement in crimes. More resources must also be directed toward drug \ncourts, which provide nonviolent drug offenders with treatment, not \npunishment. We are currently working to reauthorize SAMSHA to improve \nsubstance abuse treatment, since punishment and incarceration only \naddress one part of the overall drug problem.\n  The commission recognizes, however, that its efforts are only a \npartial step to eliminate unwarranted disparities in the Federal crack \npowder laws. It has strongly urged Congress to address the problems \nwith the 100-to-1 ratio. It is important for us to move forward on this \nissue without any effort to raise penalties for powder cocaine. Current \nlaw provides for 5-year and 10-year mandatory minimum sentences for \noffenses involving, respectively, 500 and 5000 grams of powder cocaine. \nThere is no evidence that existing powder-cocaine penalties are too \nlow.\n  Our goal is to return to the original intent of these laws and direct \nour limited resources to arresting and prosecuting high level drug \ntraffickers. Our harshest punishments should be reserved for those who \ntruly deserve them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Casey):\n  S. 1687. A bill to provide for global pathogen surveillance and \nresponse; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, many have called the 20th Century ``the \nAmerican century.'' The 21st Century will be one, too, provided that we \nunderstand and act on a new reality: that global interactions make each \ncountry, even the U.S., more dependent upon others. Nowhere is this \nmore striking than in our battle against emerging infectious diseases \nand bioterrorism. Whether we like it or not, the very security of our \nNation depends upon the capability of nations in remote regions to \ncontain epidemics before they spread.\n  Today, I am introducing the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2007. \nI am very pleased to have as original cosponsors Senator Hagel, who is \nan esteemed colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator \nKennedy, who chairs the HELP Committee. Each of these gentlemen also \ncosponsored earlier versions of this bill. Also cosponsoring this bill \nis one of my fine new colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Casey.\n  Our action today is timely, as there is still time to prevent \nbioterrorist attacks on the U.S. It is urgent, because the disease \nsurveillance capabilities in foreign countries that this act will \npromote are vitally needed to protect our country against not only \nbioterrorism, but also natural diseases such as avian influenza, which \nthreatens to become the greatest pandemic since at least 1918. And it \nis long overdue, as this bill was first passed by the Senate in 2001 \nand was again passed in 2005. All of us hope that the third time will \nbe the charm.\n  The purpose of this bill is to bolster the ability of developing \ncountries to detect, identify and report disease outbreaks, with \nparticular attention to outbreaks that could be the result of terrorist \nactivity. My concern, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, is that today, the many deficiencies in the capability of\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\ndeveloping nations to track and contain disease epidemics are the \nequivalent of cracks in a levee. Right now, when the epidemiological \n``big one'' hits, whether it is a natural outbreak or a terrorist \nattack, the world simply won't be able to respond in time.\n  The odds of a major bioterrorism event are very low, but they are \nhardly zero. In 2001, the American news media, the U.S. Postal Service \nand this United States Senate learned first-hand what it is like to \nreceive deadly pathogens in the mail. To this day, we do not know \nwhether the murderous anthrax letters were just a criminal act or \nactually a bioterrorist attack. But we surely know that neither our \nmilitary power nor our economic wealth or geographical distance affords \nus immunity from the risk that a deranged person or group will visit \nbiological destruction upon us.\n  The odds of a major outbreak of a new, but natural, disease are much \nhigher, and the possible consequences, while variable, are truly \nfrightening. At the high end, an avian flu pandemic similar to the \nSpanish flu of 1918 could kill many millions of people and threaten \nsocial cohesion everywhere, including in the U.S. Viruses and other \npathogens respect no borders. Increased contact between humans and \nanimals, coupled with vastly increased travel of goods and people, has \nmade it possible for a new and distant outbreak to become a sudden \nthreat to every continent.\n  The SARS epidemic was a good example of this. Now the world watches \nnervously as avian flu spreads westward from Asia, occasionally \nstriking poultry flocks in Europe and Africa. We wonder when it will \nreach the Western Hemisphere and whether, or when, it will mutate into \na disease that is readily transmitted between humans, who lack any \nimmunity to it.\n  Last month, a man with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or \nXDRTB, flew across one ocean, twice, and drove across several national \nborders, reminding us how readily a disease can be spread in the modern \nworld. We dodged a bullet this time; XDRTB is especially difficult to \ntreat, but does not spread as readily as influenza or some other \ndiseases. Authorities knew who the disease vector was, moreover, and \nthey knew what he had. The risk with avian flu or a bioterrorism attack \nis heightened by the likelihood that the disease will spread before \nanybody even knows it's here.\n  As if that were not enough, recent advances in biotechnology that \nopen the door to new cures for diseases could also lead to the \ndevelopment of new diseases, or new strains of old ones, with much \ngreater virulence than in the past or with the ability to resist our \ncurrent vaccines or medicines. Such man-made diseases have already been \ndeveloped by accident, and there is a clear risk of their being \ndeveloped on purpose.\n  The U.S., and this Senate, have acted to address the twin threats of \nbioterrorism and new pathogens. We enacted the Public Health Security \nand Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, introduced by \nSenators Frist and Kennedy, to buttress the ability of U.S. public \nhealth institutions to deal with a bioterrorism emergency. In 2004 we \nenacted the Project BioShield Act to spur the development of new \nvaccines and medicines.\n\n  The Centers for Disease Control has a program to put electronic \nsurveillance systems in 8 American cities as the cornerstone of an \neventual national network. Delaware is developing the first State-wide, \nelectronic reporting system for infectious diseases, which will serve \nas a prototype for other States. And the Department of Health and Human \nServices funded a 3-year, $5.4 million program, early warning \ninfectious disease surveillance, to assist the Government of Mexico to \nimprove its disease surveillance capabilities near the U.S. border. \nOther funds were provided to U.S. States on the Mexican border.\n  But these efforts, as vital as they are, address the threats of \ndisease and bioterrorism only when they are inside our house or on our \ndoorstep. We must lift our eyes and look farther, to the places around \nthe world where diseases and terrorism so often breed. We must battle \nbioterrorism not just at home, but also in those countries where lax \ngovernance and the lack of public health resources could permit both \nstrange groups and stranger diseases to get a foothold and to get out \nof hand. We must not treat the threat of a massive biological pandemic \nthe way we treated the threat of a category 5 hurricane striking New \nOrleans. If we do not prepare to combat realistic, once-in-a-century \nthreats, then we will be left again to pick up the pieces after \nenduring massive physical and social harm.\n  There are precedents in current programs, moreover, for promoting \ndisease surveillance as a means to lessen the risk of bioterrorism. For \nexample, our programs to find useful careers for former Soviet \nbiological weapons scientists, under the leadership of the State \nDepartment's Office of Cooperative Threat Reduction, currently fund the \ndisease surveillance activities of anti-plague institutes in six states \nof the former Soviet Union, which had a major pathogen surveillance \nprogram ever since tsarist days. The Department of Defense also has \nprograms with former Soviet scientists, as well as overseas \nlaboratories that work with doctors in developing countries.\n  We need to build on those programs. We must create a world-wide \ndisease surveillance capability that matches that of the old anti-\nplague institutes. We must help the rest of the world gain the \ncapability to detect, contain, and report on disease outbreaks in a \ntimely manner, and especially to spot outbreaks that may be the result \nof biological terrorism.\n  Part of the answer to the threat of new natural diseases is to \nstockpile vaccines and medicines, and the means to deliver them \nquickly. But rapid detection and identification of an outbreak is \nequally necessary, wherever it occurs. Only disease surveillance can \ngive us the lead time to manufacture vaccines and enable the world \ncommunity to help control a disease outbreak where it initially occurs.\n  In 2005, two sets of researchers reported in the journals Nature and \nScience that, based on computer simulations, if an outbreak of human-\nto-human-transmitted avian flu occurred in a rural part of Southeast \nAsia, it might be possible to stem that dangerous epidemic by using \nanti-viral drugs to treat the tens of thousands of people who might \nhave been exposed in the initial outbreak. One key requirement, \nhowever, was that the outbreak would have to be discovered, identified \nand reported very quickly; in one study, the assumption was that \ncountermeasures were instituted when only 30 people had observable \nsymptoms. That is a tall order for any country's disease surveillance \nsystem, let alone a poorly equipped one.\n  The National Intelligence Council, NIC, reported in January 2000 that \ndeveloping nations in Africa and Asia have only rudimentary systems, at \nbest, for disease surveillance. They lack sufficient trained personnel \nand laboratory equipment, and especially the modern communications \nequipment that is needed for speedy analysis and reporting of disease \noutbreaks. The NIC estimated that it would take at least a decade to \ncreate an effective world-wide disease surveillance system.\n  According to an August 2001 report by the General Accounting Office, \nWorld Health Organization officials said that more than 60 percent of \nlaboratory equipment in developing countries was either outdated or \nnonfunctioning, and that the vast majority of national personnel were \nnot familiar with quality assurance principles for handling and \nanalyzing biological samples. Deficiencies in training and equipment \nmeant that many public health units in Africa and Asia were simply \nunable to perform accurate and timely disease surveillance.\n  The poor sanitary conditions, poverty, close contact between people \nand animals, and weak medical infrastructure make developing countries \nideal breeding grounds for epidemics.\n  So it is vital to give these countries the capability to track \nepidemics and to feed that information into international surveillance \nnetworks. Disease surveillance is a systematic approach that requires \ntrained public health personnel, proper diagnostic equipment to \nidentify viruses and pathogens, and prompt transmission of data from \nthe doctor or clinic level all the way to national governments and the \nWorld Health Organization, Who.\n  The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act will offer such help to those \ncountries that agree to give the United\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\nStates or the World Health Organization prompt access to disease \noutbreaks, so that we can help determine their origin. Recipients of \nthis training will also be able to learn to spot diseases that might be \nused in a bioterrorist attack.\n  In drafting this bill, we worked closely with the Department of \nDefense and others, which have all supported the underlying goals of \nthe bill. We also accepted several suggestions for improving the bill \nfrom the State Department and, in 2005, from the HELP Committee, all of \nwhich contributed to making this a better bill.\n  This bill targets U.S. assistance to developing nations in the \nfollowing areas: Training of public health personnel in epidemiology; \naquisition of laboratory and diagnostic equipment; Acquisition of \ncommunications technology to quickly transmit data on disease patterns \nand pathogen diagnoses to national public health authorities and to \ninternational institutions like the WHO; expansion of overseas CDC and \nDepartment of Defense laboratories engaged in infectious disease \nresearch and disease surveillance, which expansion could take the form \nof additional laboratories, enlargement of existing facilities, \nincreases in the number of personnel, and/or expanding the scope of \ntheir activities; and expanded assistance to WHO and regional disease \nsurveillance efforts, including expansion of U.S.-administered foreign \nepidemiology training programs.\n  Two years ago the Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, expressed \nher strong backing for this legislation:\n\n       We believe that the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act will \n     indeed help strengthen developing countries' abilities to \n     identify and track pathogens that could be indicators of \n     dangerous disease outbreaks--either naturally-occurring or \n     deliberately-released. Improved disease surveillance and \n     communication among nations are critical defenses against \n     both bioterrorism and natural outbreaks. We look forward to \n     working with you in support of the Global Pathogen \n     Surveillance Act.\n\n  Secretary Rice went on to make clear that she shares the sense of \nurgency that Senators Hagel, Kennedy, Casey and I feel on this subject:\n\n       One of the true ``nightmare'' scenarios--of a bioterrorist \n     attack or a naturally-occurring disease--involves a \n     contagious biological agent moving swiftly through a crowded \n     urban area of a densely populated developing nation. Thus, we \n     believe that it is critical to increase efforts to strengthen \n     the public health and scientific infrastructure necessary to \n     identify and quickly respond to infectious disease \n     outbreaks--and that the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act will \n     provide valuable support in these efforts.\n\n  The WHO also shares our concern. During the SARS epidemic, Dr. \nMichael Heymann, who was the highest-ranking American in the WHO, \nstated: ``it is clear that the best defense against the spread of \nemerging infections such as SARS is strong national public health, \nnational disease detection and response capacities that can identify \nnew diseases and contain them before they spread internationally.'' He \nwent on to highlight the important role that disease surveillance plays \nin combating both natural and terrorist outbreaks:\n\n       Global partnerships to combat global microbial threats make \n     good sense as a defense strategy that brings immediate \n     benefits in terms of strengthened pubic health and \n     surveillance systems. The resulting infectious disease \n     intelligence brings dual benefits in terms of protecting \n     populations against both naturally occurring and potentially \n     deliberately caused outbreaks. As SARS has so vividly \n     demonstrated, the need is urgent and of critical importance \n     to the health of economies as well as populations.\n       Support to developing countries such as proposed in the \n     Global Pathogen Surveillance Act . . . will help strengthen \n     capacity of public health professionals and epidemiologists, \n     laboratory and other disease detection systems, and outbreak \n     response mechanisms for naturally occurring infectious \n     diseases such as SARS. This in turn will strengthen WHO and \n     the world's safety net for outbreak detection and response, \n     of which the United States is a major partner. And finally, \n     strengthening this global safety net to detect and contain \n     naturally occurring infectious diseases will strengthen the \n     world's capacity to detect and respond to infectious diseases \n     that may be deliberately caused.\n\n  The purpose of the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act is precisely to \nbuild these partnerships. And today, with the global war on terrorism \nan ever-present concern and with the threat of avian flu on the \nhorizon, we have no time to waste. I urge my Senate colleagues to once \nagain pass this bill and, with new leadership in the other body and \nwith the support of Secretary Rice, I look forward to its speedy \nenactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1689. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income amounts received on account of claims based on \ncertain unlawful discrimination and to allow income averaging for \nbackpay and frontpay awards received on account of such claims, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Civil Rights Tax \nRelief Act of 2007, which I joined Senator Bingaman in introducing \ntoday.\n  The primary purpose of this bill is to continue our efforts to remedy \nan unintended consequence of the Small Business Job Protection Act of \n1996, which made damage awards that are not based on ``physical \ninjuries or physical sickness'' part of a plaintiff's taxable income. \nBecause most acts of employment discrimination and civil rights \nviolations do not cause physical injuries, this provision means that \nplaintiffs who succeed in proving that they have suffered employment \ndiscrimination or other intentional violations of their civil rights \nare taxed on the compensation they receive.\n  Until a few years ago, this problem was compounded by the fact that \nattorneys' fees awarded in successful civil rights actions were treated \nas the plaintiff's taxable income, despite the fact that these fees \nwere paid over to the plaintiff's attorney, who was also taxed on the \nmoney. Back in the 108th Congress, I joined with Senator Bingaman in \noffering legislation to correct this inequity, and I am glad to say \nthat this double taxation of attorneys' fees was eliminated as part of \nthe JOBS Act we passed in 2004.\n  But more remains to be done. Plaintiffs who are successful in \nemployment discrimination or civil rights cases often receive a lump-\nsum award meant to compensate them for years of employment. \nUnfortunately, these awards are then taxed at the highest marginal tax \nrates, as if the award reflected the plaintiff's normal annual salary. \nAs if that were not bad enough, successful plaintiffs can also find \nthemselves subject to alternative minimum tax.\n  Let me explain how our bill eliminates this unfair taxation. First, \nthe bill excludes from gross income amounts awarded other than for \npunitive damages and compensation attributable to services that were to \nbe performed, known as ``backpay,'' or that would have been performed \nbut for a claimed violation of law by the employer, known as \n``frontpay.'' Second, award amounts for frontpay or backpay would be \nincluded in income, but would be eligible for income averaging \naccording to the time period covered by the award. This correction \nwould allow individuals to pay taxes at the same marginal rates that \nwould have applied to them had they not suffered discrimination. Our \nbill also ensures that these awards do not trigger the AMT.\n  The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act would encourage the fair settlement \nof costly and protracted litigation of employment discrimination \nclaims. Our legislation would allow both plaintiffs and defendants to \nsettle claims based on the damages suffered, not on the excessive taxes \nthat are now levied.\n  This bill is a ``win-win'' for civil rights plaintiffs and defendant \nbusinesses. I invite my colleagues to join in support of this \ncommonsense legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1690. A bill to establish a 4-year pilot program to provide \ninformation and educational materials to small business concerns \nregarding health insurance options, including coverage options within \nthe small group market; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have long believed that it is \nmy responsibility and the duty of this chamber to help small \nbusinesses, as they are the driver of this Nation's economy, \nresponsible for generating approximately 75 percent of net new jobs \neach year.\n  Today, I rise with Senators Kerry and Bennett to introduce \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\nthat would address the crisis that faces small businesses when it comes \nto purchasing quality, affordable health insurance. This is not a new \ncrisis. Over 46 million Americans are currently uninsured. We have now \nexperienced double digit percentage increases in health insurance \npremiums in 4 of the past 6 years. Small businesses face difficult \nchoices in seeking to provide affordable health insurance to their \nemployees. The time to act is now.\n  Study after study tells us that the smallest businesses are the ones \nleast likely to offer insurance and most in need of assistance. \nAccording to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, of the working \nuninsured, who make up 83 percent of our Nation's uninsured population, \n60.6 percent either work for a small business with fewer than 100 \nemployees or are self-employed. Furthermore, many of the small \nbusinesses whom we meet with tell us how they feel like the cost and \ncomplexity of the health care system has moved health insurance far \nbeyond their reach.\n  That is why today we introduce the Small Business Health Insurance \nOptions Act of 2007. This bipartisan measure would establish a pilot, \ncompetitive matching-grant program for Small Business Development \nCenters, SBDCs, to provide educational resources and materials to small \nbusinesses designed to increase awareness regarding health insurance \noptions available in their areas. Recent research conducted by the \nHealthcare Leadership Council has found that following a brief \neducation and counseling session, small businesses are up to 33 percent \nmore likely to offer health insurance to their employees.\n  Our bill capitalizes on the well-established national SBDC framework. \nSBDCs are one of the greatest business assistance and entrepreneurial \ndevelopment resources provided to small businesses that are seeking to \nstart, grow, and flourish. Currently, there are over 1,100 service \nlocations in every State and territory delivering management and \ntechnical counseling to prospective and existing small business owners.\n  Our legislation would require the Small Business Administration to \nprovide up to 20 matching grants to qualified SBDCs across the country. \nNo more than two SBDCs, one per State, would be chosen from each of the \nSBA's 10 regions. The grants shall be more than $150,000, but less than \n$300,000, and shall be consistent with the matching requirement under \ncurrent law. In creating the materials for their grant programs, \nparticipating SBDCs should evaluate and incorporate relevant portions \nof existing health insurance options, including materials created by \nthe Healthcare Leadership Council, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and \nthe National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n  Enacting this legislation is an important step in the right direction \ntowards assisting small businesses as they work to strengthen \nthemselves, remain competitive against larger businesses that are able \nto offer affordable health insurance, and in turn bolster the entire \neconomy.\n  We encourage our colleagues to join us in supporting this bill, and \nto continue to work to address the issues facing the small business \ncommunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Health \n     Insurance Options Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to grant a Federal charter to Korean War Veterans \nAssociation, Incorporated; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today, on the 57th anniversary of \nthe start of the Korean war, to introduce legislation to help honor \nAmerican veterans who served our Nation during that war by granting a \nFederal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association, KWVA, a \nnonprofit fraternal veterans' organization. A companion measure is \nbeing introduced in the House by the distinguished majority leader, \nSteny Hoyer, and Representative Sam Johnson, who have led this effort \nin previous Congresses along with my predecessor, Senator Paul \nSarbanes.\n  The Korean war is sometimes referred to as the ``Forgotten War,'' \nbecause it has been overshadowed by World War II and the Vietnam war, \nand its importance has often been overlooked in American history. But \nfor the nearly 1.2 million American veterans of the Korean war still \nalive today, the war is anything but forgotten. During the 3-year \ncourse of the war, some 5.7 million Americans were called to serve, \nunder some of the most adverse and trying circumstances ever faced in \nwartime, for the cause of freedom. Alongside Korean and United Nations \nallies, our forces fought with extraordinary courage and valor. By the \ntime the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in July 1953, more than \n36,000 Americans had died, 103,284 had been wounded, 7,140 were \ncaptured, and 664 were missing.\n  Granting a Federal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association \nwould give our Nation an opportunity to honor veterans who served in \nthat war, as well as those who have served subsequently in defense of \nthe Republic of Korea. The KWVA is the only fraternal veterans' \norganization in the United States devoted exclusively to Korean war \nveterans and the only U.S. member of the International Federation of \nKorean War Veterans Associations.\n  Incorporated in 1985, the 20,000-member charitable association is \nalso one of the few veterans' service organizations in America that has \nnot been recognized with a Federal charter. These veterans are a source \nof strength and pride for our country. While we cannot repay the debt \nwe owe them for the sacrifices they made, we can and should acknowledge \nand commemorate their service and help the association to expand its \nmission and further its charitable and benevolent causes.\n  This recognition for the KWVA is long overdue, and I am hopeful that \nthis year, Congress will act swiftly to approve this measure. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       Whereas increased recognition and awareness of \n     neuropsychological testing for childhood cancer survivors can \n     have a significant impact on the education and ultimately the \n     quality of life and productivity of people with childhood \n     cancer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States Government should--\n       (1) support neuropsychological research and testing of \n     childhood cancer survivors and their families;\n       (2) work with health care providers, educators, and \n     childhood cancer advocacy and education organizations to \n     encourage neuropsychological testing;\n       (3) recognize and reaffirm the commitment of the United \n     States to fighting childhood cancer by promoting awareness \n     about the causes, risks, prevention, and treatment of \n     childhood cancer;\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\n       (4) promote new education programs about, research of, and \n     expanded medical treatment for childhood cancer survivors;\n       (5) support research and expanded public-private \n     partnerships to improve post-cancer life for childhood cancer \n     survivors; and\n       (6) encourage the early diagnosis and access to high-\n     quality care for childhood cancer patients and survivors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8365-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1871.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer observations on the \ncontinuing involvement of the United States in Iraq. In my judgment, \nour course in Iraq has lost contact with our vital national security \ninterests in the Middle East and beyond. Our continuing absorption with \nmilitary activities in Iraq is limiting our diplomatic assertiveness \nthere and elsewhere in the world. The prospects that the current \n``surge'' strategy will succeed in the way originally envisioned by the \nPresident are very limited within the short period framed by our own \ndomestic political debate. And the strident, polarized nature of that \ndebate increases the risk that our involvement in Iraq will end in a \npoorly planned withdrawal that undercuts our vital interests in the \nMiddle East. Unless we recalibrate our strategy in Iraq to fit our \ndomestic political conditions and the broader needs of United States \nnational security, we risk foreign policy failures that could greatly \ndiminish our influence in the region and the world.\n  The current debate on Iraq in Washington has not been conducive to a \nthoughtful revision of our Iraq policy. Our debate is being driven by \npartisan political calculations and understandable fatigue with bad \nnews--including deaths and injuries to Americans. We have been debating \nand voting on whether to fund American troops in Iraq and whether to \nplace conditions on such funding. We have contemplated in great detail \nwhether Iraqi success in achieving certain benchmarks should determine \nwhether funding is approved or whether a withdrawal should commence. I \nwould observe that none of this debate addresses our vital interests \nany more than they are addressed by an unquestioned devotion to an ill-\ndefined strategy of ``staying the course'' in Iraq.\n  I speak to my fellow Senators, when I say that the President is not \nthe only American leader who will have to make adjustments to his or \nher thinking. Each of us should take a step back from the sloganeering \nrhetoric and political opportunism that has sometimes characterized \nthis debate. The task of securing U.S. interests in the Middle East \nwill be extremely difficult if Iraq policy is formulated on a partisan \nbasis, with the protagonists on both sides ignoring the complexities at \nthe core of our situation.\n  Commentators frequently suggest that the United States has no good \noptions in Iraq. That may be true from a certain perspective. But I \nbelieve that we do have viable options that could strengthen our \nposition in the Middle East, and reduce the prospect of terrorism, \nregional war, and other calamities. But seizing these opportunities \nwill require the President to downsize the United States military's \nrole in Iraq and place much more emphasis on diplomatic and economic \noptions. It will also require Members of Congress to be receptive to \novertures by the President to construct a new policy outside the binary \nchoice of surge versus withdrawal. We don't owe the President our \nunquestioning agreement, but we do owe him and the American people our \nconstructive engagement.\n  In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the current \npath outweigh the potential benefits that might be achieved. Persisting \nindefinitely with the surge strategy will delay policy adjustments that \nhave a better chance of protecting our vital interests over the long \nterm.\n  I do not come to this conclusion lightly, particularly given that \nGeneral Petraeus will deliver a formal report in September on his \nefforts to improve security. The interim information we have received \nfrom General Petraeus and other officials has been helpful and \nappreciated. I do not doubt the assessments of military commanders that \nthere has been some progress in security. More security improvements in \nthe coming months may be achieved. We should attempt to preserve \ninitiatives that have shown promise; such as engaging Sunni groups that \nare disaffected with the extreme tactics and agenda of al-Qaida in \nIraq. But three factors--the political fragmentation in Iraq, the \ngrowing stress on our military, and the constraints of our own domestic \npolitical process--are converging to make it almost impossible for the \nUnited States to engineer a stable, multi-sectarian government in Iraq \nin a reasonable time frame.\n  First, it is very doubtful that the leaders of Iraqi factions are \ncapable of implementing a political settlement in the short run. I see \nno convincing evidence that Iraqis will make the compromises necessary \nto solidify a functioning government and society, even if we reduce \nviolence to a point that allows for some political and economic \nnormalcy.\n  In recent months, we have seen votes in the Iraqi parliament calling \nfor a withdrawal of American forces and condemning security walls in \nBaghdad that were a reasonable response to neighborhood violence. The \nIraqi parliament struggles even to achieve a quorum, because many \nprominent leaders decline to attend. We have seen overt feuds between \nmembers of the Iraqi Government, including Prime Minister Maliki and \nVice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who did not speak to each other for \nthe entire month of April. The Shia-led government is going out of its \nway to bottle up money budgeted for Sunni provinces. Without strident \nintervention by our embassy, food rations are not being delivered to \nSunni towns. Iraqi leaders have resisted de-Baathification reform, the \nconclusion of an oil law, and effective measures to prevent oil \nsmuggling and other corrupt practices.\n  Iraqi Foreign Minister Zebari has told me that various aspects of an \noil law and revenue distribution could be passed by September. But he \nemphasized that Iraqis are attempting to make policy in a difficult \nenvironment by broad consensus--not by majority vote. He believes other \npolicy advancements will take considerable time, but that consensus is \nthe safest and most appropriate approach in a fledgling democracy.\n  This may be true, but Americans want results in months. Meanwhile, \nvarious Iraqi factions are willing to wait years to achieve vital \nobjectives. Even if the results of military operations improve in the \ncoming months, there is little reason to assume that this will diminish \nSunni ambitions to reclaim political preeminence or Shia plans to \ndominate Iraq after decades of Saddam's harsh rule. Few Iraqi leaders \nare willing to make sacrifices or expose themselves to risks on behalf \nof the type of unified Iraq that the Bush administration had \nenvisioned. In contrast, there are many Iraqi leaders who are deeply \ninvested in a sectarian or\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\ntribal agenda. More often than not, these agendas involve not just the \nprotection of fellow Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds, but the expansion of \nterritorial dominance and economic privileges.\n\n  Even if United States negotiators found a way to forge a political \nsettlement among selected representatives of the major sectarian \nfactions, these leaders have not shown the ability to control their \nmembers at the local level. After an intense year-and-a-half of \nbloodletting, many subfactions are thoroughly invested in the violence. \nWe have the worst of both worlds in Iraq--factional leaders who don't \nbelieve in our pluralist vision for their country and smaller \nsubfactions who are pursuing violence on their own regardless of any \naccommodations by more moderate fellow sectarians. As David Brooks \nrecently observed in the New York Times, the fragmentation in Iraq has \nbecome so prevalent that Iraq may not even be able to carry out a \ntraditional civil war among cohesive factions.\n  Few Iraqis have demonstrated that they want to be Iraqis. We may \nbemoan this, but it is not a surprising phenomenon. The behavior of \nmost Iraqis is governed by calculations related to their history, their \npersonal safety, their basic economic existence, and their tribal or \nsectarian loyalties. These are primal forces that have constrained the \nvision of most ordinary Iraqis to the limits of their neighborhoods and \nvillages.\n  In this context, the possibility that the United States can set \nmeaningful benchmarks that would provide an indication of impending \nsuccess or failure is remote. Perhaps some benchmarks or agreements \nwill be initially achieved, but most can be undermined or reversed by a \ncontrary edict of the Iraqi Government, a decision by a faction to \nignore agreements, or the next terrorist attack or wave of sectarian \nkillings. American manpower cannot keep the lid on indefinitely. The \nanticipation that our training operations could produce an effective \nIraqi army loyal to a cohesive central government is still just a \nhopeful plan for the future.\n  I suspect that for some Americans, benchmarks are a means of \njustifying a withdrawal by demonstrating that Iraq is irredeemable. For \nothers, benchmarks represent an attempt to validate our military \npresence by showing progress against a low fixed standard. But in \nneither case are benchmark tests addressing our broader national \nsecurity interests.\n  Equally unproven is the theory voiced by some supporters of a \nwithdrawal that removing American troops from Iraq would stimulate a \ngrand compromise between Iraqi factions. Some Iraqi leaders may react \nthis way. But most assume that we will soon begin to withdraw troops, \nand they are preparing to carry on or accelerate the fight in the \nabsence of American forces. Iraqi militias have shown an ability to \nadapt to conditions on the ground, expanding or contracting their \noperations as security imperatives warrant.\n  American strategy must adjust to the reality that sectarian \nfactionalism will not abate anytime soon and probably cannot be \ncontrolled from the top.\n  The second factor working against our ability to engineer a stable \ngovernment in Iraq is the fatigue of our military. The window during \nwhich we can continue to employ American troops in Iraqi neighborhoods \nwithout damaging our military strength or our ability to respond to \nother national security priorities is closing. Some observers may argue \nthat we cannot put a price on securing Iraq and that our military \nreadiness is not threatened. But this is a naive assessment of our \nnational security resources.\n\n  American Armed Forces are incredibly resilient, but Iraq is taking a \ntoll on recruitment and readiness. In April, the Defense Department \nannounced it would lengthen tours of duty for soldiers serving in Iraq \nand Afghanistan from 12 to 15 months. Many soldiers are now on their \nway to a third combat tour.\n  Last month, for the 27th consecutive year, in a ceremony witnessed by \ntens of thousands of Hoosiers, I swore in new military recruits on Pit \nRoad at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Over the course of the \nweekend, I visited with the recruits, with the recruiters, and with \nmilitary officials. I heard personal stories of the 70-hour work weeks \nput in by recruiters to meet recruiting goals. I was impressed with \neach of the 66 young men and women I swore in. They are joining a \nmilitary at war, and each of them is showing tremendous courage and \ncommitment to our country.\n  The swearing-in ceremony was preceded by a briefing from Army \nofficials here in Washington who assured me that we are fielding the \nbest equipped, best trained, and most capable force we have ever had. \nYet, they also reported that the Army has exhausted its bench. Instead \nof resting and training for 3 to 12 months, brigades coming out of the \nfield must now be ready almost immediately for redeployment.\n  Basic recruiting targets are being met, but statistics point to \nsignificant declines in the percentage of recruits who have high school \ndiplomas and who score above average on the Army's aptitude test. \nMeanwhile, the Army has dramatically increased the use of waivers for \nrecruits who have committed felonies, and it has relaxed weight and age \nstandards.\n  The Army is asking for $2 billion more this year for recruitment \nincentives, advertising, and related activities. It needs $13 to $14 \nbillion a year to reset the force to acceptable readiness ratings, and \nthey will need that amount for up to 3 years after the end of the \ncurrent operations. The Army needs $52 billion more this year to fill \nequipment shortages and modernize. These figures do not include the \nbillions of dollars required to implement the planned 65,000 soldier \nincrease in the size of the active force.\n  Filling expanding ranks will be increasingly difficult given trends \nin attitudes toward military service. This has been measured by the \nJoint Advertising Market Research and Studies Program, which produced a \n``Propensity Update'' last September after extensive research. The \nstudy found that only 1 in 10 youths has a propensity to serve--the \nlowest percentage in the history of such surveys. Sixty-one percent of \nyouth respondents report that they will ``definitely not serve.'' This \nrepresents a 7 percent increase in less than a year. These numbers are \ndirectly attributable to policies in Iraq. When combined with the \nArmy's estimate that only 3 of 10 youths today meet basic physical, \nbehavioral, and academic requirements for military service, the \nconsequences of continuing to stretch the military are dire.\n  The United States military remains the strongest fighting force in \nthe world, but we have to be mindful that it is not indestructible. \nBefore the next conflict, we have much to do to repair this invaluable \ninstrument. This repair cannot begin until we move to a more \nsustainable Iraq policy.\n  The third factor inhibiting our ability to establish a stable, \nmultisectarian government in Iraq is the timetable imposed by our own \ndomestic political process. The President and some of his advisors may \nbe tempted to pursue the surge strategy to the end of his \nadministration, but such a course contains extreme risks for United \nStates national security. It would require the President to fight a \npolitical rear-guard holding action for more than a year and a half \nagainst congressional attempts to limit, modify, or end military \noperations in Iraq. The resulting contentiousness would make \ncooperation on national security issues nearly impossible. It would \ngreatly increase the chances for a poorly planned withdrawal from Iraq \nor possibly the broader Middle East region that could damage U.S. \ninterests for decades.\n\n  The President and his team must come to grips with the shortened \npolitical timeline in this country for military operations in Iraq. \nSome will argue that political timelines should always be subordinated \nto military necessity, but that is unrealistic in a democracy. Many \npolitical observers contend that voter `` dissatisfaction in 2006 with \nadministration policies in Iraq was the major factor in producing new \nDemocratic Party majorities in both Houses of Congress. Domestic \npolitics routinely intrude on diplomatic and military decisions. The \nkey is to manage these intrusions so that we avoid actions that are not \nin our national interest.\n  We do not know whether the next President will be a Democrat or a \nRepublican. But it is certain that domestic pressure for withdrawal \nwill continue to be intense. A course change\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\nshould happen now, while there is still some possibility of \nconstructing a sustainable bipartisan strategy in Iraq. If the \nPresident waits until Presidential election campaign is in full swing, \nthe intensity of confrontation on Iraq is likely to limit United States \noptions.\n  I am not implying that debate on Iraq is bad. I am suggesting what \nmost Senate observers understand intuitively: Little nuance or \nbipartisanship will be possible if the Iraq debate plays out during a \ncontentious national election that will determine control of the White \nHouse and Congress.\n  In short, our political time line will not support a rational course \nadjustment in Iraq, unless such an adjustment is initiated very soon.\n  In January, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard from former \nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger, who recalled a half century of U.S. \ninvolvement in the Middle East. He argued that this history was not \naccidental. We have been heavily involved in the region because we have \nenduring vital interests at stake. We may make tactical decisions about \nthe deployment or withdrawal of forces in Iraq, but we must plan for a \nstrong strategic position in the region for years to come.\n  This is not just a maxim from diplomatic textbooks. The vitality of \nthe U.S. economy and the economies of much of the world depend on the \noil that comes from the Persian Gulf. The safety of the United States \ndepends on how we react to nuclear proliferation in the region and how \nwe combat terrorist cells and ideologies that reside there.\n  The risk for decision-makers is that after a long struggle in Iraq, \naccompanied by a contentious political process at home, we begin to see \nIraq as a set piece--as an end in itself, distinct from the broader \ninterests that we meant to protect. We risk becoming fixated on \nartificial notions of achieving victory or avoiding defeat, when these \nill-defined concepts have little relevance to our operations in Iraq. \nWhat is important is not the precise configuration of the Iraqi \nGovernment or the achievement of specific benchmarks, but rather how \nIraq impacts our geostrategic situation in the Middle East and beyond. \nThe President's troop surge is an early episode in a much broader \nMiddle East realignment that began with our invasion of Iraq and may \nnot end for years. Nations throughout the Middle East are scrambling to \nfind their footing as regional power balances shift in unpredictable \nways.\n  Although the Bush administration has scaled back its definition of \nsuccess in Iraq, we are continuing to pour our treasure and manpower \ninto the narrow and uncertain pursuit of creating a stable, \ndemocratic, pluralist society in Iraq. This pursuit has been the focal \npoint of the administration's Middle East policy. Unfortunately, this \nobjective is not one on which our future in the region can rest, \nespecially when far more important goals related to Middle East \nsecurity are languishing. I am not suggesting that what happens in Iraq \nis not important, but the Bush administration must avoid becoming so \nquixotic in its attempt to achieve its optimum forecasts for Iraq that \nit misses other opportunities to protect our vital interests in the \nMiddle East.\n\n  To determine our future course, we should separate our emotions and \nfrustrations about Iraq from a sober assessment of our fundamental \nnational security goals. In my judgment, we should be concerned with \nfour primary objectives:\n  First, we have an interest in preventing Iraq or any piece of its \nterritory from being used as a safe haven or training ground for \nterrorists or as a repository or assembly point for weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Second, we have an interest in preventing the disorder and sectarian \nviolence in Iraq from upsetting wider regional stability. The \nconsequences of turmoil that draws neighboring states into a regional \nwar could be grave. Such turmoil could topple friendly governments, \nexpand destabilizing refugee flows, close the Persian Gulf to shipping \ntraffic, or destroy key oil production or transportation facilities, \nthus diminishing the flow of oil from the region with disastrous \nresults for the world economy.\n  Third, we have an interest in preventing Iranian domination of the \nregion. The fall of Saddam Hussein's Sunni government opened up \nopportunities for Iran to seek much greater influence in Iraq and in \nthe broader Middle East. An aggressive Iran would pose serious \nchallenges for Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and other Arab governments. \nIran is pressing a broad agenda in the Middle East with uncertain \nconsequences for weapons proliferation, terrorism, the security of \nIsrael, and other U.S. interests. Any course we adopt should consider \nhow it would impact the regional influence of Iran.\n  Fourth, we have an interest in limiting the loss of U.S. credibility \nin the region and throughout the world as a result of our Iraq mission. \nSome loss of confidence in the United States has already occurred, but \nour subsequent actions in Iraq may determine how we are viewed for a \ngeneration.\n  In my judgment, the current surge strategy is not an effective means \nof protecting these interests. Its prospects for success are too \ndependent on the actions of others who do not share our agenda. It \nrelies on military power to achieve goals that it cannot achieve. It \ndistances allies that we will need for any regional diplomatic effort. \nIts failure, without a careful transition to a back-up policy would \nintensify our loss of credibility. It uses tremendous amounts of \nresources that cannot be employed in other ways to secure our \nobjectives. And it lacks domestic support that is necessary to sustain \na policy of this type.\n  A total withdrawal from Iraq also fails to meet our security \ninterests. Such a withdrawal would compound the risks of a wider \nregional conflict stimulated by Sunni-Shia tensions. It would also be a \nsevere blow to U.S. credibility that would make nations in the region \nfar less likely to cooperate with us on shared interests. It would \nincrease the potential for armed conflict between Turkey and Kurdish \nforces in Iraq. It would expose Iraqis who have worked with us to \nretribution, increase the chances of destabilizing refugee flows, and \nundercut many economic and development projects currently underway in \nIraq. It would also be a signal that the United States was abandoning \nefforts to prevent Iraqi territory from being used as a terrorist base.\n  Moreover, advocates of an immediate withdrawal have tended to \nunderestimate the requirements and complexities of such an operation. \nGen. Barry McCaffrey testified at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing on January 18, 2007, that an immediate withdrawal aimed at \ngetting out of Iraq as fast as possible would take 6 months. A \ncarefully planned withdrawal that sought to preserve as much American \nequipment as possible, protect Iraqis who have worked with us, continue \nanti-terrorist operations during the withdrawal period, and minimize \nnegative regional consequences would take months longer.\n\n  Our security interests call for a downsizing and re-deployment of \nU.S. military forces to more sustainable positions in Iraq or the \nMiddle East. Numerous locations for temporary or permanent military \nbases have been suggested, including Kuwait or other nearby states, the \nKurdish territories, or defensible locations in Iraq outside of urban \nareas. All of these options come with problems and limitations. But \nsome level of American military presence in Iraq would improve the odds \nthat we could respond to terrorist threats, protect oil flows, and help \ndeter a regional war. It would also reassure friendly governments that \nthe United States is committed to Middle East security. A re-deployment \nwould allow us to continue training Iraqi troops and delivering \neconomic assistance, but it would end the U.S. attempt to interpose \nourselves between Iraqi sectarian factions.\n  Six months ago, the Iraq Study Group endorsed a gradual downsizing of \nAmerican forces in Iraq and the evolution of their mission to a support \nrole for the Iraqi army. I do not necessarily agree with every \nrecommendation of the Iraq Study Group, and its analysis requires some \nupdating given the passage of time. But the report provides a useful \nstarting point for the development of a ``Plan B'' and a template for \nbipartisan cooperation on our Iraq strategy.\n  We should understand that if the re-deployment of a downsized force \nis to be safe and effective, our military planners and diplomats must \nhave as much\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\ntime as possible to develop and implement the details. We will need the \ncooperation of the Iraqi Government and key states in the region, which \nwill not come automatically. The logistics of a shift in policy toward \na residual force will test military planners, who have been consumed \nwith the surge. In 2003, we witnessed the costs that came with \ninsufficient planning for the aftermath of the Iraq invasion. It is \nabsolutely essential that we not repeat the same mistake. The longer we \ndelay the planning for a re-deployment, the less likely it is to be \nsuccessful.\n  The United States has violated some basic national security precepts \nduring our military engagement in Iraq. We have overestimated what the \nmilitary can achieve, we have set goals that are unrealistic, and we \nhave inadequately factored in the broader regional consequences of our \nactions. Perhaps most critically, our focus on Iraq has diverted us \nfrom opportunities to change the world in directions that strengthen \nour national security.\n  Our struggles in Iraq have placed U.S. foreign policy on a defensive \nfooting and drawn resources from other national security endeavors, \nincluding Afghanistan. With few exceptions, our diplomatic initiatives \nare encumbered by negative global and regional attitudes toward our \ncombat presence in Iraq.\n  In this era, the United States cannot afford to be on a defensive \nfooting indefinitely. It is essential that as we attempt to reposition \nourselves from our current military posture in Iraq, we launch a \nmultifaceted diplomatic offensive that pushes adversarial states and \nterrorist groups to adjust to us. The best counter to perceptions that \nwe have lost credibility in Iraq would be a sustained and ambitious set \nof initiatives that repairs alliances and demonstrates our staying \npower in the Middle East.\n  The Iraq Study Group report recommended such a diplomatic offensive, \nstating ``all key issues in the Middle East--the Arab-Israeli conflict, \nIraq, Iran, the need for political and economic reforms, and extremism \nand terrorism--are inextricably linked.'' The report stressed that \ndiplomacy aimed at solving key regional issues would ``help marginalize \nextremists and terrorists, promote U.S. values and interests, and \nimprove America's global image.''\n\n  A diplomatic offensive is likely to be easier in the context of a \ntactical draw down of U.S. troops in Iraq. A drawdown would increase \nthe chances of stimulating greater economic and diplomatic assistance \nfor Iraq from multilateral organizations and European allies, who have \nsought to limit their association with an unpopular war.\n  A first step is working with like-minded nations to establish a \nconsistent diplomatic forum related to Iraq that is open to all parties \nin the Middle East. The purpose of the forum would be to improve \ntransparency of national interests so that neighboring states and other \nactors avoid miscalculations. I believe it would be in the self-\ninterest of every nation in the region to attend such meetings, as well \nas the United States, EU representatives, or other interested parties. \nSuch a forum could facilitate more regular contact with Syria and Iran \nwith less drama and rhetoric that has accompanied some meetings. The \nexistence of a predictable and regular forum in the region would be \nespecially important for dealing with refugee problems, regulating \nborders, exploring development initiatives, and preventing conflict \nbetween the Kurds and Turks. Just as the Six-Party talks have improved \ncommunications in northeast Asia beyond the issue of North Korea's \nnuclear program, stabilizing Iraq could be the occasion for a \ndiplomatic forum that contributes to other Middle East priorities.\n  Eventually, part of the massive U.S. embassy under construction in \nBaghdad might be a suitable location for the forum. It is likely that \nthe embassy compound will exceed the evolving needs of the United \nStates. If this is true, we should carefully consider how best to use \nthis asset, which might be suitable for diplomatic, educational, or \ngovernmental activities in Iraq.\n  We should be mindful that the United States does not lack diplomatic \nassets. Most regional governments are extremely wary of U.S. \nabandonment of the Middle East. Moderate states are concerned by Iran's \naggressiveness and by the possibility of sectarian conflict beyond \nIraq's borders. They recognize that the United States is an \nindispensable counterweight to Iran and a source of stability. The \nUnited States should continue to organize regional players--Saudi \nArabia, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, the Gulf States, and others--behind a \nprogram of containing Iran's disruptive agenda in the region.\n  Such a re-alignment has relevance for stabilizing Iraq and bringing \nsecurity to other areas of conflict, including Lebanon and the \nPalestinian territories. The United States should make clear to our \nArab friends that they have a role in promoting reconciliation within \nIraq, preventing oil price spikes, splitting Syria from Iran, and \ndemonstrating a more united front against terrorism.\n  A diplomatic offensive centered on Iraq and surrounding countries \nwould help lift American interests in the Middle East. But credibility \nand sustainability of our actions depend on addressing the two \nelephants in the room of U.S. Middle East policy--the Arab-Israeli \nconflict and U.S. dependence on Persian Gulf oil. These are the two \nproblems that our adversaries, especially Iran, least want us to \naddress. They are the conditions that most constrain our freedom of \naction and perpetuate vulnerabilities. The implementation of an \neffective program to remedy these conditions could be as valuable to \nour long-term security as the achievement of a stable, pro-Western \ngovernment in Iraq.\n  The Arab-Israeli conflict will not be easily solved. Recent combat \nbetween the Hamas and Fatah Palestinian factions that led to Hamas's \nmilitary preeminence in the Gaza Strip complicates efforts to put the \npeace process back on track. But even if a settlement is not an \nimmediate possibility, we have to demonstrate clearly that the United \nStates is committed to helping facilitate a negotiated outcome. \nProgress in the Arab-Israeli conflict would not end the sectarian \nconflict in Iraq, but it could restore credibility lost by the United \nStates in the region. It also would undercut terrorist propaganda, slow \nIranian influence, and open new possibilities related to Syria.\n\n  Clearly, the United States does not have the influence to solve the \nArab-Israeli conflict unilaterally. In contrast, our dependence on \nPersian Gulf oil is largely within our capacity to fix. Do not \nunderestimate the impact on Iran and other nations of a concerted U.S. \ncampaign to reduce our oil consumption. A credible well-publicized \ncampaign to definitively change the oil import equation would \nreverberate throughout the Middle East. It would be the equivalent of \nopening a new front in Middle Eastern policy that does not depend on \nthe good will of any other country.\n  Many options exist for rapid progress in reducing our Persian Gulf \noil dependence, but I would emphasize two. First, President Bush or his \nsuccessor could establish the national goal of making competitively \npriced biofuels available to every motorist in America. Such an \naccomplishment would transform our transportation sector and cut our \noil import bill. It would require multiple elements, including ensuring \nthat virtually every new car sold in America is a flexible fuel vehicle \ncapable of running on an 85 percent ethanol fuel known as E-85; that at \nleast a quarter of American filling stations have E-85 pumps; and that \nethanol production from various sources is expanded to as much as 100 \nbillion gallons a year within the next 15 to 20 years. Such a campaign \ncould achieve the replacement of 6.5 million barrels of oil per day by \nvolume--the rough equivalent of one-third of the oil used in America \nand one-half of our current oil imports. None of these goals are easy, \nbut they are achievable if presidential advocacy and the weight of the \nFederal Government are devoted to their realization. Brazil already has \nachieved the large-scale deployment of ethanol as a national \ntransportation fuel, and its success is a source of public pride in \nthat country.\n  Second, the President could commit to a radical increase in the miles \nper gallon of America's auto fleet. The Federal Government has numerous \ntools to make this happen, from direct Federal support for research, to \nGovernment fleet purchasing, to market regulations and incentives.\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\n  Incredibly, cars in America today get less mileage per gallon than \nthey did 20 years ago. Meanwhile, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and fully \nelectric cars are at or nearly at commercialization, yet there is not \nenough incentive for consumers to buy them or producers to make them on \nthe mass scale necessary. For fiscal year 2008, the administration \nrequested just $176 million for new vehicle technology research--an \namount that was less than what was requested 5 years ago.\n  Given that other developed nations have made great strides in \nimproving fuel economy, this is fertile ground for rapid improvement. \nIn fact, achievements on this front largely would be a matter of \ngenerating and sustaining political will that has, thus far, been \ndisappointing.\n  The issue before us is whether we will refocus our policy in Iraq on \nrealistic assessments of what can be achieved, and on a sober review of \nour vital interests in the Middle East. Given the requirements of \nmilitary planners, the stress of our combat forces, and our own \ndomestic political timeline, we are running out of time to implement a \nthoughtful plan B that attempts to protect our substantial interests in \nthe region, while downsizing our military presence in Iraq.\n  We need to recast the geo-strategic reference points of our Iraq \npolicy. We need to be preparing for how we will array U.S. forces in \nthe region to target terrorist enclaves, deter adventurism by Iran, \nprovide a buffer against regional sectarian conflict, and generally \nreassure friendly governments that the United States is committed to \nMiddle East security. Simultaneously, we must be aggressive and \ncreative in pursuing a regional dialogue that is not limited to our \nfriends. We cannot allow fatigue and frustration with our Iraq policy \nto lead to the abandonment of the tools and relationships we need to \ndefend our vital interests in the Middle East.\n  If we are to seize opportunities to preserve these interests, the \nadministration and Congress must suspend what has become almost knee-\njerk political combat over Iraq. Those who offer constructive criticism \nof the surge strategy are not defeatists, any more than those who warn \nagainst a precipitous withdrawal are militarists. We need to move Iraq \npolicy beyond the politics of the moment and reestablish a broad \nconsensus on the role of the United States in the Middle East. If we do \nthat, the United States has the diplomatic influence and economic and \nmilitary power to strengthen mutually beneficial policies that could \nenhance security and prosperity throughout the region. I pray that the \nPresident and the Congress will move swiftly and surely to achieve that \ngoal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8375-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8375-S8376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to say a word about the \nremarks just made by my colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar. It has \nbeen my honor to serve with Senator Lugar now for 11 years. I count him \nas a friend, as a valued colleague, as a neighbor in the Midwest.\n  I believe the speech which he has just made on the floor of the \nSenate is in the finest tradition of the Senate, like its author. \nSenator Lugar's speech was thoughtful, thorough, and honest. It was a \nchallenge to all of us on both sides of the aisle, Democrat and \nRepublican alike: To step back from the debate on Iraq, take an \ninventory of where we are, make an honest appraisal, and move forward.\n  I think it is a challenge to all Senators. I am sorry it was \ndelivered at the time of night when few of our colleagues were here, \nbut if we are fortunate some followed it on C-SPAN as Senator Lugar \npresented it.\n  I made notes during the course of the speech. I am sure I have missed \nsome valuable and important things that Senator Lugar said, but I will \njust tell you that I do not disagree with his conclusion. I believe, as \nhe does, that the factionalism in Iraq has reached catastrophic \nproportions, that it is doubtful they will be able to patch together in \nthe near term the goverment which we had hoped for.\n  I agree with Senator Lugar completely about the fatigue of our \nmilitary. We have the greatest military in the world, the best and \nbravest, not only in Indianapolis but in Springfield, IL, and all \nacross the Nation. We are so proud of these men and women and what they \nfight for and the representation of our great Nation.\n  I think Senator Lugar hit the nail on the head when he said the \nstrongest fighting force in the world is not indestructible. We are \npushing them to the absolute limit, and that is a reality.\n  His third point about the timetable of our debate is a valuable one. \nSome wonder if there are members of the administration who are waiting \nfor the clock to run out, the day to come when they leave Washington to \nturn this issue over to another. That would be a serious mistake, \nbecause in the meantime we know that American lives will be lost and \nopportunities may be squandered.\n  That point was made very effectively by Senator Lugar this evening. I \nmade some notes of things he said that I believe summarize our \nsituation so effectively. He said that a course change should happen \nnow. He called for a sustainable, bipartisan strategy in dealing with \nIraq. He called for a rational course adjustment that must be initiated \nvery soon. He said that far more important than just Iraq are our \nMiddle Eastern goals that are languishing because of our current \nstrategy.\n  I could not agree with him more on the four points he set out as our \nMiddle Eastern objectives to keep Iraq from becoming a terrorist haven, \nto stop Iraq from spreading instability into the region, to prevent \nIranian dominance of the region, and to limit the loss of U.S. \ncredibility in the region as a result of this war.\n  I think he is correct in his analysis. He said that the current surge \nstrategy is not effective. He believes, as I do, at this moment in time \ntotal withdrawal is not consistent with our regional goals. I want to \nbring American troops home as quickly as possible, as many as possible.\n  We have said from the beginning on the Democratic side that there are \ncertain responsibilities we must still accept in that region: To stop \nthe spread of al-Qaida terrorism, to make certain the Iraqis, as best \nwe can, are prepared to fight this battle, and to protect our own \nforces during the withdrawal.\n  He called for downsizing to more sustainable positions, to put our \ntroops in a position where they can respond if necessary. He called for \nattempts to end imposing our forces between sectarian warring factions. \nThat, I believe, is our highest priority. To think that our men and \nwomen in uniform are now caught in the crossfire of a civil war with \nits origins 14 centuries ago in a sectarian battle is just \nunacceptable.\n  He said the longer we delay plans for redeployment, the less likely \nit will be successful. I could not agree with him more. He called for a \ntactical drawdown of U.S. troops to make diplomatic efforts more likely \nto succeed.\n  I agree with Senator Lugar when he said we are running out of time; \nwe have to move the Iraqi policy between the politics of the moment. He \nsaid the administration and Congress must suspend knee-jerk political \ncombat over Iraq.\n  Forty years ago as a law school student, I came and sat in that \ngallery in a chair and watched as Senator Robert Kennedy came to the \nfloor to give a speech on Vietnam. He walked through those doors with \nhis brother, Senator Ted Kennedy. Their families were in the gallery. \nHe stood on this floor, again, in the evening hours after most Senators \nhad gone home. He spoke about bringing the war in Vietnam to a close. \nIt was an important speech in the history of our Nation and certainly \nin the history of the Senate, and I think it made a difference. I \nbelieve the speech that was given tonight by my colleague from Indiana, \nRepublican Senator Richard Lugar, is that kind of speech. I think it is \nthe starting point for a meaningful debate, a debate which looks at the \nMiddle East in a new context and in a realistic context, and realizes \nthat it is time to change direction in our course in Iraq.\n  I salute my colleague. I hope every Member of the Senate tomorrow \nwill ask for a copy of the speech from the Congressional Record, read \nit carefully, and then come to this floor when we return after the \nFourth of July break and begin our debate over the Defense \nauthorization bill, and realize\n\n[[Page S8376]]\n\nthat during the course of that debate we can reach across the aisle on \na bipartisan basis and make a difference.\n  I thank Senator Lugar for his contribution to this most important \nissue which challenges us today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/25/senate-section/article/S8376-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
