Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         2-Year Budget Process\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the congressional budget process, which \nwe will begin again soon, is clearly broken. Since fiscal year 1980, \nonly three times has Congress enacted all its appropriations bills by \nthe start of the next fiscal year, which is October 1. During that same \ntime, 138 continuing resolutions have been needed to keep the \nGovernment running. In other words, if Congress does not appropriate \nmoney, it cannot be spent by the executive branch. It cannot be spent \nby the Government, period. So when we do not pass an appropriations \nbill to fund the Department of Defense or the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, they cannot operate. They shut down. As a result, we \ncome through with continuing resolutions to allow funding to continue \nat the previous year's level while we debate and argue over the \nappropriate appropriations for that next fiscal year.\n  Repeatedly, we have been late. On average, there have been 4.8 \ncontinuing resolutions each fiscal year. On average, we have been \nalmost 3 months late passing the appropriations bills, putting us well \ninto the next fiscal year. For fiscal year 1996, 10 years ago, the \nfinal appropriations bill was signed almost 7 months late.\n  Over the past 13 budget cycles, Congress has passed 10 omnibus \nspending bills. These omnibus bills occur when, instead of passing each \nof the 12 appropriations bills separately, as we are set up and plan to \ndo, they cannot pass them individually. Because they are so far behind, \nall the bills are cobbled together in an omnibus bill and moved at one \ntime, which creates so much momentum that it is difficult to stop a \nbill such as that. It is certainly almost impossible to read and know \nwhat is in it. On average, these spending packages have combined 7.6 \nregular appropriations bills. So the average omnibus bill is 7.6 of the \n12 appropriations bills piled all together in 1 bill and passed, \nbasically rammed through the Senate and the House.\n  Last year, Congress enacted a $555 billion, 1,600-page omnibus \npackage that combined 11 of the 12 required appropriations bills in 1. \nIt was passed in late December, not long before Christmas, when people \nwere anxious to go home. I am sure that is part of the plan. It all \nmoved forward. Mr. President, 1,600 pages--it is unlikely many Members \nof this Senate read it. Basically, what they would do is send out their \nstaff to determine if something they especially cared about was in it, \nand if what they wanted was in it, they would vote for the bill. That \nis the way things have gone around here. It is not a good policy. The \npackage we passed last December was the largest omnibus bill since \n1988, when we enacted a $598 billion package that included all 13 \nbills.\n  Finally, this broken budget process has resulted in almost $1.7 \ntrillion in deficit spending over the past 13 budget cycles.\n  There is no single cure, I will certainly admit, for all of what ails \nCongress and the way Congress spends the people's money. However, a \nbiennial, 2-year budget, 2-year appropriations would be, I am convinced \nand have been for quite a number of years, a tremendous step in the \nright direction. It is a good-government reform. I wish to talk about \nbiennial budgeting a bit.\n  Biennial budgeting has been supported by the last four Presidents. It \nis a very simple concept. Under current budget law, Congress must pass \nthe twelve 1-year appropriations bills each year to fund the Federal \nGovernment. With biennial budgeting, twelve 2-year appropriations bills \nwould be enacted instead of 1-year bills. A change from a 1-year to 2-\nyear budget cycle would have many great benefits.\n  I emphasize, this is not a partisan matter. This is a matter that I \nbelieve will strengthen the Congress and help us increase some of those \nvery poor ratings we have with the American people.\n  A change from a 1-year to 2-year budget would deal with this problem \nthat is a reality for us: that under the current system, the budget \nprocess, the appropriations process is never-ending. We should have \ncompleted this process last year before October 1, the start of the new \nfiscal year, the appropriations funding for the next fiscal year. We \ndid not get that done until late December. Now we are going to be \nstarting soon trying another series of 12 appropriations bills to try \nto pass them before October 1.\n  Last year, it took 325 days from the release of the President's \nbudget until the appropriations process was completed on December 26. \nNow, only 40 days later, the process has begun again with the \nsubmission of the President's new budget on February 5.\n  By limiting budget decisions to every other year, Congress would have \nconsiderably more time to spend passing critical legislation. Whether \nit be immigration reform, which we need to do, tax cuts, or legislation \naddressing our Nation's housing problems, Congress could focus more on \nimportant legislative matters rather than just always every year backed \nup, jammed up with appropriations debates, arguing over pork and \nearmarks, among others.\n  Some will argue that 2-year budgeting would increase the need for \nenacting supplemental spending. They say we will have more supplemental \nemergency spending. As such, we will not save a lot of time, and it \nstill will not be a healthy process.\n  I ask this: How much more supplemental emergency spending can \nCongress do?\n  Over the last 10 budget cycles, even though we are passing regular \nappropriations bills every single year, Congress has enacted at least \n25 supplemental emergency appropriations packages. These packages have \napproved almost $884 billion in additional emergency spending. That is \na shocking number.\n  But I will add this. When someone does bring up an emergency spending \nbill--and there may be a number of times that it is quite legitimate--\nand asks that it be brought up and spent above the budget--and that is \nwhat emergency spending does; we approve a budget, we should stay \nwithin the budget--we pass an emergency bill and it busts the budget. \nIt goes above the budget. We say it is emergency spending that is so \nimportant that we don't adhere to the budget and we are going to spend \nthe money anyway. Of course, all of that goes straight to the debt, \nsince we are already in deficit. Any additional spending over our \nbudget is even more monies that go to our debt. But it takes 60 votes, \nat least. A person is able to come to the floor and object and create a \ndiscussion and demand a supermajority of 60 votes to have emergency \nspending. I think that in itself should deter some frivolous use of \nemergency spending, I really do.\n  I think we would be better off, even though I am sure we will have \nemergency spending packages with a 2-year budget, because we certainly \nhave had them even with a 1-year budget cycle. I do think the taxpayers \nwon't be defenseless when those emergency bills come up.\n  Another big thing. All of us in the Congress, and I think all of us \nin the Senate, know in our hearts, know in\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\nthe deepest part of our being, that we are not doing a good job of \noversight over this massive Government we are supposed to be managing. \nWe don't do a good job of oversight. One reason we don't do oversight \nin an effective way is because we have to pass the funding bills. We \nare always arguing over how much should be spent on this or that \nprogram, how much should be spent on this or that pet project, and we \nspend our time doing that and not going out and looking at agencies and \ndepartments with a fresh view.\n  The Office of Management and Budget has made a long list of agencies \nthat are poorly performing, that they question the legitimacy of. If we \nwould focus on that effectively, I think we could do a much better job.\n  Also, I would suggest that with a 2-year budget, Federal agencies \ncould focus more on their core missions. The Department of Defense, for \nexample, spends untold hours preparing their budget every year, and it \ncreates a lot of uncertainty because they are never sure whether this \nor that program will be continued. It causes quite a bit of stress and \nuncertainty. Agencies are spending thousands of hours on their annual \nbudget process.\n  Constituent groups and organizations could save a lot of money. They \ncome up every year. We see them. They are some of the best people we \nknow, and those people come up every year. They wouldn't have to come \nup but every 2 years with biennial budgeting. Save some money for those \nagencies and departments that are worried about their budgets and maybe \neven save our constituents a little money on air travel.\n  Finally, a 2-year budget would create a more stable system of \ngovernment because Congress has proven it cannot complete its budget \nprocess each year. It can't do it. Funding delays would surely occur \nless often and less frequently with a 2-year budget, and the Federal \nagencies could function more effectively.\n  Process often does drive policy. The current budget process, the \ncurrent appropriations process, we know, is not working. It is an \nembarrassment to us. It embarrasses us every year, not just because the \nDemocrats failed last year in their first year in the majority, but \nbecause Republicans failed too, consistently, to pass budgets in an \neffective way. It is a bipartisan problem. We need to look no further \nthan the $400 billion deficit projected for this year, or our Nation's \n$9 trillion debt to know we are not being effective in managing the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  By itself, a 2-year budget will not end the profligate spending of \nCongress, that is for sure. But a 2-year budget cycle would be a huge \nimprovement. I have no doubt about it. Twenty-one States currently \noperate with a 2-year budget cycle. I think it is time for Congress to \ndo the same.\n  When I was working on this the last several years, when the \nRepublicans had a majority in the Senate, I felt as though there might \nbe a slight advantage to the majority party because the majority party \nhas an agenda. They have items they feel obligated to effectively \npromote. But they are not able to do it oftentimes because all the time \non the floor of the Senate is spent on trying to pass appropriations \nbills. So whether it helps the majority or the minority party, I am not \nsure, but it will help the taxpayers. It is good government reform.\n  It is not a partisan thing we are talking about. We are talking about \na historic change in the way we do business that will help every agency \nand department of government because they will have at least 2 years of \na solid budget from which to work. They will only have to put together \ntheir proposals every 2 years instead of every year. Congress will be \nable to deal with it one time, and then during the off year, we would \nbe able to examine how we are spending money and make new proposals and \nnew ideas for improving the health care system of America, the savings \nsystem of America, and the defense of America.\n  I thank the Chair, and I note my colleague Senator Alexander from \nTennessee is here. I know he strongly shares this view. We have both \nworked with and met with Senator Pete Domenici, long-time former \nchairman of the Budget Committee and a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee in the Senate, who has championed this battle. Frankly, I \nthink it would be a nice tribute to Senator Domenici if, when he \ncompletes his tenure, distinguished as it has been in the Senate, we \nwere to pass a 2-year budget.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Alexander has not indicated to me \nthe purpose of his presence on the floor, but we are most anxious to \nget started on the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. That was \nscheduled for 9:30 this morning. I wish to begin an opening statement \nat some point, and I know Senator Murkowski would, and we want to do a \nmanagers' package.\n  Senator Coburn is here, because I asked if he would be here at 9:30, \nand he has a number of amendments. I appreciate very much his work and \nhis efforts on Indian health care. I am hoping we can work with Senator \nCoburn this morning to deal with some of his amendments. I know he has \nfiled a number of them, and he and I have had many discussions about \nit. I appreciate his attendance. He has just walked into the Chamber.\n  Our interest is in getting a lot of work done this morning and this \nafternoon in order to try to see if we can finish this bill. This will \nbe the third day that the Indian Health Care Improvement bill has been \non the floor, so I wish to begin on that. I know Senator Alexander has \nappeared, though I don't know for what purpose, and perhaps I would be \nhappy to yield to him if he would tell us if he is wanting to do \nsomething else on the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I hope to take 5 minutes on the 2-year \nbudget and how I hope, and many of us hope, that it will be something \nthe Democrats and Republicans can agree on to change the way Washington \nworks.\n  I will be glad to defer that, knowing the importance of moving ahead \non Indian affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the statement is 5 minutes, I would not object to \nthat, but I do want, at the end of that 5 minutes, to begin the bill. \nAgain, Senator Coburn has arrived, and we have a lot of work to do. But \nI know Senator Alexander has worked on budget issues for a long while, \nso I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander be recognized for 5 \nminutes, and after that I will make some comments, Senator Murkowski \nthen will make some comments, and we will begin a discussion with \nSenator Coburn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate the courtesy of \nthe Senator from North Dakota. He himself is an expert on \nappropriations and budget matters, both at the Federal level and at the \nState level. It would be my hope that as this subject I am about to \ntalk about moves ahead, it would be something that would interest him \nas well.\n\n\n                         2-Year Appropriations\n\n  I can make my point quickly and simply. We have heard a lot this year \nthat the people of this country would like a change in the way we do \nbusiness in Washington, DC. One way to do that is change how we go \nabout our business. That means I would prefer, and I believe almost all \nof us would prefer, and I know the people would prefer, that we focus \non big issues and we come up with good principled ideas. And then we \ndebate those principles, and then we reach across the aisle, because it \ntakes 60 votes to get anything done here to come to a result.\n  We did that on the economic stimulus, we did that on energy, we did \nthat on terrorism, and it didn't mean we didn't have debates. We had \nbig debates. That is why we are here. But we came to a result and the \nresult had to be bipartisan. I am not so interested in the \nbipartisanship as I am interested in the result. I heard Rick Warren \nspeak the other day, and he said he wasn't so interested in interfaith \ndialog as he was interested in good works.\n  I think that is what the people want to see from us. My suggestion \nfor good works and for results is that we adopt a 2-year appropriations \nbudget process, as described by the Senator from Alabama and as \nadvocated by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. This is not \na Republican idea, this is\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\nnot a Democrat idea, this is a good idea. It has the support of Senator \nFeingold from the other side, and it has the support of the independent \nSenator, Senator Lieberman, so I would hope it has strong support all \nacross the aisle here.\n  Let me give an example or two of why it would make a difference. When \nwe debate the higher education bill in a few weeks, I am going to ask \npermission to bring on the floor several boxes containing all the rules \nand regulations that 6,000 higher education institutions in this \ncountry must wade through in order to accept students who receive a \nFederal grant or a loan. The stack of boxes is about that high--that \nmany rules and regulations. But this new higher education bill that we \nwill likely pass doubles the number of rules and regulations. Maybe \nsome of them are needed, but what we haven't had time to do is go \nthrough that stack of boxes as tall as I am to see if we can cut the \nregulations in half. We don't have time to do that.\n  If we spent every other year drawing up a budget and our \nappropriations bills, and then, in the odd year, going back through \nrules, laws, and regulations already on the books, I think we would \nhave a strong force for fewer rules, fewer regulations, and fewer laws. \nAnd also more effective, if not less, spending.\n  A second example. The State of Missouri has told the Department of \nTransportation that with the Federal money we already give the State of \nMissouri, they can repair every broken bridge they have in 5 years. \nThey can do this as long as we let them do it first under their rules \nand regulations, without waiting for our appropriations process. In \nother words, if we let them build the bridges and then we buy the \nbridges to reimburse them, according to specifications, we don't have \nto spend any more money to fix all the broken bridges in Missouri.\n  What that should indicate to us is the gross inefficiency of our \nappropriations and budget processes when it comes to building roads, \nwhen it comes to making contracts, when it comes to waging war. Our \nprocess wastes billions of dollars a year. No wonder the people of this \ncountry are upset with us.\n  Final action on appropriations measures has occurred, on average, 86 \ndays after the start of the fiscal year. And our fiscal year starts \nwhen? On October 1. I mean, who else begins their year on October 1? \nThat is not the Chinese calendar, it is not most Americans' calendar, \nbut it is our fiscal calendar. So everybody has to adjust their \nbusiness to a strange year, and then we never meet it.\n  My hope is that this year we can honor Senator Domenici and \nourselves. We can add a Democratic name right up there with his, as \nprominently, and we can say to the country: We are going to change the \nway Washington does business. We are going to do it in a bipartisan \nway. We are going to adopt a 2-year budget for spending. We are going \nto spend every other year revising and repealing laws and make the \nGovernment run efficiently. And we are going to get our appropriations \nand budgeting done on time. We can save the taxpayers dollars so that \nStates, cities, companies, and countries that deal with the United \nStates of America can do so in a timely and efficient way.\n  I thank the President, and I thank again the Senator from North \nDakota and the Senator from Alaska for allowing me this time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are going to turn now to the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act, and I am going to be very brief, and I \nknow my colleague will as well because we will have a chance later to \nspeak at greater length.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act has been the subject of \nreauthorization for many years, and the Congress has not been able to \ndo it. The fact is we have very serious problems with respect to Indian \nhealth care. The Indian Health Service is a very important Federal \nagency. We have some people who work in that area who do important work \nand are good and dedicated people, but the fact is the system isn't \nworking very well. We have American Indians--the first Americans, by \nthe way--who are supposed to get health care as a result of treaties \nand trust responsibilities who are not getting the health care they \ndeserve.\n  I will again, later today, describe the horrors of Indian health care \nthat does not work. People are dying, people are routinely being denied \nthe health care that every one of us would expect for ourselves and our \nfamily. We are trying to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct after 8 years. Eight years ago, it was supposed to have been \nreauthorized. Eight years later, we are still on the floor of the \nSenate, struggling.\n  So my hope is, perhaps we will now succeed. Senator Murkowski and the \nIndian Affairs Committee have worked on a piece of legislation that is \nnot giant reform, it is not a huge step forward, but it is a step \nforward in the right direction.\n  Some of my colleagues--I believe my colleague, Senator Coburn--will \nsay we need much larger reform. I do not disagree with that. I am going \nto be supporting much broader reform in Indian health care. But if you \ncannot get a modest step in the right direction, how on Earth can you \nget big, bold reform?\n  This is the first step in a two-step process to fix what is wrong. I \nthink this Indian Health Care Improvement Act will give us substantial \nopportunity to improve the health care in the lives of American \nIndians.\n  Let me make the point that is important. We owe this health care \nthrough treaties, through a trust responsibility. We have made \ncommitments. We owe this health care to American Indians through \npromises the Federal Government has made.\n  Regrettably, it has not been adequately delivered. So I am going to \ntalk a little bit later. I know my colleague, Senator Coburn, is on the \nSenate floor, and he has amendments. I am going to give him an \nopportunity to speak. I am as well, but I will have an opportunity \nlater this morning to describe in much greater detail why there is an \nurgency and why this system must be improved. We cannot wait any \nlonger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee for his leadership on this very importation \nreauthorization bill. As he has indicated, this work is a long time in \ncoming, and it is a collaborative effort not only of those on the \ncommittee, those of us who represent so many in Indian country across \nthe Nation, but truly for so many who have put so much work into this \nreauthorization, this very important health care reform.\n  We do have amendments we have received and are looking forward to \nhaving discussion on them. As Chairman Dorgan has noted, Senator Coburn \nwill have an opportunity to offer some of those this morning. But in \nthe spirit of focusing on what we have in front of us today, I think it \nis important that we keep in mind we have an obligation to advance a \nhealth care system that has been left behind the times in terms of any \nupdates, whether it is in the area of behavioral health or telemedicine \nor substance abuse or what we are doing with diabetes treatment or how \nwe are moving forward with construction of facilities. We recognize \nthat we have a ways to go in updating the system. This is important and \nis necessary.\n  Recognizing the limitations on Senator Coburn's time at this point, I \nyield to the Senator so he can offer his amendments. We will continue \nour conversation later in the morning.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the chairman \nand ranking member, Senator Murkowski, for their work on this effort.\n\n\n        Amendments Nos. 4024 through 4037 to Amendment No. 3899\n\n  Oklahoma is the No. 1 State in the country as far as tribal members. \nIndian health care is an issue on which we are struggling, and there \nare all sorts of components for it. I am going to ask unanimous consent \nnow to bring up my amendments numbered 4024 through 4037 as if brought \nup individually and ask that each be set aside so they will be \nconsidered pending. I ask unanimous consent that be carried out at this \ntime.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have no objection to that. The Senator and I have \ntalked about this. He wants to get all of his amendments pending. But \nhe will be\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\nasking for discussion and votes on a number of them.\n  Mr. COBURN. Far less than what I bring up.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Let me start by saying, improving the health care of \nIndians in this country is a widely supported goal. Senator Dorgan's \nheart is in the right place on this issue. He knows the problems we \nhave, and he spent countless hours trying to get to this point with \nthis bill. I do not want to be seen--I have told him, and I committed \nto him my goal is not to block his progress on this bill.\n  However, I believe this legislation as drafted does not fix the \nunderlying problems. He and I have had several conversations about \nthat. It does not fix rationing that is going on today. It does not fix \nwaiting lines that are going on today. It does not fix the inferior \nquality that is being applied to a lot of Native Americans and Alaskans \nin this country. It does not fix any of those problems. In fact, it \nauthorizes more services without making sure the money is there to \nfollow it. The average Native American in this country has $2,100 per \nyear spent on them.\n  Now, let's put that in perspective. The average veteran we take care \nof has $4,300. The average individual per person, per capita, \nexpenditure in our country is $7,000. Yet we are going to pass a bill \nthat does not fix anything. It does not fix the real problems about \naddressing the No. 1 problem which is, we are not sending enough \ndollars to meet the treaty obligations that we have with Native \nAmericans. So really what this bill is, it is called the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act, but it improves our position with tribes because \nwe have done something, but it does not improve health care. It is not \ngoing to improve health care. It is going to increase the availability \nof services without the money, without the control, without the \nquality, without eliminating the waiting lines.\n  As a matter of fact, it is going to add to the waiting lines as I \nread this bill, as somebody who is somewhat experienced in medicine. \nThose who say a failure to reauthorize the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act is a violation of our trust obligations are correct. \nHowever, I believe simply reauthorizing this system with minor \nmodifications is an even greater violation of that commitment. It is a \ngreater violation. Dozens of tribal leaders are not expressing \nenthusiasm for the current structure.\n  Chuck Grim, an Oklahoman, head of this service, knows what is broken. \nI have had lots of conversations with him. We know what is broken, we \nknow how to fix it, but we have to be bold in how we go about fixing \nit. We are not bold in this. We are not changing it. We are not doing \nthe structural changes that have to happen for us to live up to the \ncommitment that we have made to Native Americans.\n  The myriad of problems facing Indian health care in Indian country \nare many of the same issues that are facing health care delivery \nthroughout rural America. They are compounded, however, in this system \nby a system that refuses to recognize its own role in holding back \nhealth care delivery for Native Americans.\n  In designing health care reforms, markets work when they are allowed \nto. They lower the price of all goods and services, and they attract \nmuch needed outside investment. Many tribes in Oklahoma are at the \nforefront of new and innovative health care delivery systems. They are \npoised to become a model for delivery throughout the system.\n  Congress must ensure, however, that their efforts are not discouraged \nor stopped altogether by the current system. Furthermore, there is no \ngood reason that forward-thinking tribal governments should not be \nprevented from developing market-driven health care centers of \nexcellence that will attract researchers, physicians, and patients for \ncutting edge lifesaving treatments. We do not do that in this bill.\n  Furthermore, this legislation fails to focus on empowering individual \ntribal members. Individual patients tend to receive better care and \nmore effective care when they are empowered to make their own health \ncare decisions. Congress should explore ways to accomplish this \nobjective and give tribal citizens a reason to invest in their own \nhealth. Long lines, bureaucratic headaches, and rationed substandard \ncare completely disallow this sort of investment. That is what we have.\n  Our Chairman has been on the Senate floor multiple times showing how \nwe are rationing care, how we have lines, how we do not give quality \ncare, how we take contract health care--it runs out in 4 or 5 months. \nAnd so what happens? People who need care do not get it, and we have \nnot fixed that in this bill. Yet we are calling this health care \nimprovement.\n  The health care status of tribal members ranks below the general \npopulation. The Federal Government has been providing health care to \ntribal members for 175 years. The first time was to give them a \nsmallpox vaccine in 1807. That is when we started Indian health care. \nAnd what we are doing today in comparison to what our treaty \nobligations are--in comparison, it is the same thing we are doing to \nthe veterans when we tell the veterans: We are going to give you health \ncare and do not give it. It is the same thing we tell schools: We are \ngoing to have an IDEA program and then not fund it. It is morally \nbankrupt legislation that does not meet the commitments that we say we \nhave.\n  The Snyder Act of 1921 provided a broad and permanent authorization \nfor Federal Indian programs, including--and this is an important \nthing--the conservation of health; in other words, the prevention of \ndisease, which Chuck Grim was just starting to get into, but we do not \nhave the funding to do it the way we need to do it. We know the \nmanifestation of diabetes and addiction and hypertension and heart \ndisease among our tribal members is higher than any other group in our \ncountry. Yet the conservation of health has not been exploited, the \nparadigm shift that has to happen in Native American care to where we \ngo to prevention instead of treatment of disease. It is not in here. We \nare not doing it.\n  Last year, we spent $3.18 billion doing this. If we just funded it at \nthe level we fund per capita veterans care, we should be funding $6.5 \nbillion in Native American health care. That is just on a per capita \nbasis, let alone any structural changes on how we might make \npreventative care, quality care, timely care, and compassionate care a \npart of Native American care. But we are not doing that. Indians in \ncomparison with the general population are 6.5 times more likely to die \nfrom alcoholism. That is a disease we need to be preventing. That is a \nhealth care problem. They are six times more likely to die from \ntuberculosis, a preventable disease; three times more likely to die \nfrom diabetes, a controllable and now preventable disease, it is a \npreventable disease; 2.5 times more likely to die from an accident.\n  Now, how can we look those statistics in the face and say we have met \nour treaty obligations? We have failed. We have absolutely failed. Only \n71 percent of Native Americans receive prenatal care. That means one \nout of four Native American moms who get pregnant do not have any \nprenatal care. We ought to be ashamed. We have failed. We have failed.\n  Eighteen percent of Native Americans who are pregnant smoke. That is \ntwice the rate of others. Where is our prevention? Where is our \neducation? Where is the priority on what we can do something about?\n  American Indians suffer from a great death rate from chronic liver \ndisease and cirrhosis. It is 22.7 per 100,000. That is twice what it is \nfor Whites and three times what it is for African Americans in this \ncountry. We know what causes it. We do not put the dollars there. We \nhave not put in a streamlined prevention program.\n  My words are harsh. They are not intended for either the chairman or \nthe ranking member. I passionately care that we meet our commitments, \nand so I do not want you to take the words I say as directed toward you \nbecause I know you care as well.\n  Where we have a difference is in the ``now.'' What do we do now \nrather than what do we do later? I think we should be doing it all now. \nI think we should radically change how we approach our obligations in \nNative American health care in this country.\n  Rationing plagues Indian Health Services. It is rationed care. That \nis\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\nwhy it is not good care. That is why it is not consistent care. That is \nwhy it is not preventative care, because we don't have the resources. \nWe haven't applied the resources to the need. Senator Dorgan has had \nnumerous hearings. He has spoken on the floor about this rationing \ncrisis. But if we don't radically change the system, if we don't change \nincentives in the system, improving the old will just bring more \nfailure.\n  The job vacancy rate for dentists is 32 percent. They don't have 80 \npercent of the nurses they need. They don't have 85 percent of the \noptometrists, and they only have 86 percent of the doctors, based on \nthe present system. I am proposing a better system with better care \nbased on prevention, a paradigm that says it is a whole lot cheaper to \nprevent your illness than it is to treat it once you get it. It is \ncommon to hear in Indian Country--and I have heard the chairman say \nit--``don't get sick after June. Contract money is gone. If you get \nsick after June, nothing will happen. You will not get the referral to \nthe center to take care of you because we don't have the money.\n  A quote from Dr. Charles Grim, who has been a stellar leader for the \nIHS:\n\n       We're only able to provide a certain level of dental \n     services in certain populations. We're only able to refer a \n     certain level or number or types of referrals with our \n     contract health service budget into the private sector. . . . \n     But I guess one generalized statement would be that we have a \n     defined population and a defined budget. . . . But it has led \n     to rationing in some parts of our health care system.\n\n  Here is the former head of IHS admitting we are rationing the care. \nWhen we ration care, we don't match up need with resources. We say: \nHere are all the resources there are regardless of what the need is. We \ndon't get on the leading edge on prevention. We don't get on the \nleading edge on treatment because we are scrambling to keep the doors \nopen. How can we have a coherent, fair health care system when we are \nrationing because the demand is so far greater than we are willing to \nsupply the resources?\n  According to a GAO report in 2005, health care services are not \nalways available to Native Americans. There are wait times and \ninsufficient care. GAO visited 13 IHS-funded facilities in 2005 and \nfound waiting times at four range from 3 to 6 months to get in to see \nanybody. Six months? That is worse than England. What happens when you \ncan't get in? The disease gets worse. The complications are worse. The \nquality of the your health gets worse. Also, the cost to meet the need \nexplodes. So what we have done is raised the cost of care. But more \nimportantly, we have failed on our commitment to provide health to \nNative Americans.\n  Three IHS facilities had 90-mile one-way visits to get into a clinic, \nmany without transportation available to them. Three of these, the \naverage was 90 miles to get to a clinic. Even if they have the \nresources and there is no access because there is a distance to travel, \nwe are going to see the same problem. Nobody is going to go until they \nabsolutely have to. So we lose the benefit of prevention.\n  Most of the facilities in this GAO report did not have the staff or \nequipment to offer services onsite so they resorted to contract care. \nThe contract care budget, of course, is small. So what happens? We \nration contract care at 12 of the 13 facilities. This idea of rationing \nisn't a political statement; it is a reality. We are not doing what we \nare committed by treaty to do. Now we are going to bring a bill to the \nfloor that doesn't meet that commitment. We are still not going to meet \nthe commitment. We will improve it, but we need to overhaul it. We need \na top-down, complete change in how we approach our commitment to Native \nAmericans as far as health care. If we did that, we could offer a whole \nlot more care for a whole lot less money.\n  We have a bureaucracy that is stumbling all over itself. We are \nspending money. I will get to the point on the number of bureaucratic \npositions in IHS that don't deliver any care. Gaps in services result \nin diagnoses and treatment delays which, of course, make the health of \nthe patient worse and raise the cost. IHS reports that their facilities \nare required to pay for all priority one services but admit that many \nof their facilities' available funds are expended before the end of the \nfiscal year and the payment isn't made.\n  I experienced that in my own hometown. People come to Hastings \nHospital to deliver a baby. Our hospital hasn't been paid on contract \ncare for years. So those in the rest of the community are going to pay \nfor it. The problem is, there is no continuity in care. Prenatal care \nwas provided. Now all of a sudden you don't have a record and you have \nsomebody you have to take care of, let alone that the private hospital \nthat is there isn't going to get paid for the service. Somebody is \ngoing to pay for the service, but contract health care isn't. So the \nfact is, one in four Native Americans in Alaska aren't getting prenatal \ncare. And we know the risk. The average cost for a premature baby is \n$250,000, let alone the consequence of the problems those kids have. \nWhy in the world would we ever allow that to happen? It is akin to \npouring money down the drain because we have not addressed prenatal \nneeds of Native Americans.\n  Twenty-one percent of those who do get care have less than three \nprenatal visits on average. That is one in four has less than three \nprenatal visits. That is like not having prenatal care. Yet we count \nthat as if they had prenatal care. What do we think the consequences \nwill be? The antenatal, postnatal, and perinatal consequences to the \nNative American population are higher. The birth complications are \nhigher because we are not doing the prenatal care.\n  The average recommended prenatal visits by the American College of \nObstetrics and Gynecology is 14. We average six with Native Americans. \nYou can't call that care.\n  Under an overburdened system such as this, drastically expanded \nservices to four broad new areas--and this is the problem I have with \nthis bill--will only drain the resources available to the basic core \nmedical services. We are going to expand where we can offer new \nservices. Many of these people are already eligible under Medicaid or \nMedicaid anyway, but we are going to expand it. What is going to happen \nis, the tribal government is going to offer the service, and they are \ngoing to take the money off the top. They are going to put that into \nthe rest of the tribal funds. So we are actually going to take money \nout of dollars for health care for tribal members by expanding care and \nnot making sure there are adequate funds.\n  Making new promises, when we don't keep current ones, doesn't help \nthe Native American population. Let's keep the promises we have already \nmade before we expand services and not throw money at it. It sounds \ngood. The tribes like to hear what we are going to do. We are going to \nadd these four services, but we are not funding the services we are \nsupplying now. Why would we add services knowing that? If we do it, we \nare going to do it on the cheap. But it feels good because they think \nwe are doing something, when, in fact, we are not fixing the problems. \nIt is kind of like taking a loan out on a brandnew car when you can't \nbuy food. It is the same thing. That is what we are doing with these \nadditional services.\n\n  The majority of the bill is more of the same. I have expressed to the \nchairman that I think we need to radically overhaul the care of Native \nAmericans. I will have a lot more to say. I do have some complications \nwith other commitments in terms of markup. My staff e-mailed me a \nmoment ago that you have made some substantive changes in the managers' \namendment on some of the Medicaid and the tribal issues related to \nurban Indians. I will get with you and try to discuss that because it \nmay affect some of my amendments. I wasn't aware of that until this \nmorning.\n  I will have an amendment I will talk about now. I don't know that I \nwill when I actually bring it back up. One way to meet our commitment \nto Native Americans is to give them options. According to CBO, the \namendment I will be offering costs no money. It is a zero cost. But \nwhat it allows Native Americans is an insurance policy that says you \ncan apply this and go to any Indian Health Service you want to or \nanywhere else in the country you want to, but you get to choose. The \nsame dollars get spent, but the services will be far superior.\n  There are two results. One, when we do that, it makes the Indian \nHealth Service have to get more competitive. No. 2, and most \nprofoundly, when we do that, we finally live up to our commitment that \nis embodied in every treaty\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\nwe have with Native Americans. Here is the real care. It is not \nrationed. It is not limited to contract funds. You don't have to get in \nline to wait in line. You don't have to get an appointment to get an \nappointment. You don't have to travel 90 miles, if you don't want to. \nYou don't have to have your care rationed. And at no cost increase to \nthe Indian Health Service, we can give Native Americans their own \nhealth insurance policy which gives them freedom, dignity, and choice.\n  I know that will be controversial. It is not controversial with any \nIndian I have talked to. It is controversial with tribal leaders \nbecause it takes the dominance of tribal leaders away and gives freedom \nto members of the tribes to whom we have made a commitment for health \ncare.\n  So as we offer that amendment and look at it, I know there will be \nobjections, but it does--most importantly, with the same dollars--allow \nus to fulfill a commitment we are not fulfilling today. It allows a \npregnant Native American to have 14 visits, allows her to have the same \ncare anybody else would have. It allows us to get better outcomes. It \nallows us to get a patient into an endocrinologist, where they will \nmanage their diabetes so they will not have complications. Kidney \nfailure is twice as high in this population as anybody else. Why? \nBecause diabetes is not managed. How many of you have gone into a \ndialysis center and watched people sit there for 8 hours a day, chained \nto a machine to keep them alive, because we didn't keep our commitment \nby having the dollars there to prevent the complications of diabetes?\n  This gives an equal ranking to a Native American as a Member of \nCongress. You can have preventative care for your diabetes so you don't \nend up on dialysis or with an amputation or losing your vision. It \noffers them hope. It offers honor and integrity because we finally keep \nour commitments.\n  I wanted to talk about a couple other things and then I will close \nand come back. I appreciate the chairman giving me this time. As \nCongress discusses Indian health care over the next several days, \nAmerica as a country should take note of what a single-payer system \nmeans in terms of the quality of care we can expect. America should not \ngo the route of a single-payer system. That is what we are seeing. That \nis what we have in IHS. It is a single-payer system. The promise sounds \nalluring, but the reality is inevitably negative. It is negative in \nterms of prevention. It is negative in terms of care. It is negative in \nterms of complications. It is negative in terms of innovation. It is \nnegative in terms of the paradigm of prevention.\n\n  Second, fixing the system for our Native Americans demands more than \nadding more new programs and services. We need a fundamental overhaul \nof the system. The Members of federally recognized tribes whom we have \na trust obligation to provide health care for deserve better than is in \nthis bill. Actually, I believe Chairman Dorgan believes that too. He \nbelieves this is a stepped process. They deserve a choice. They deserve \nthe security to know they can get health care when they need it. They \ndeserve quality. They deserve the health care outcomes the rest of this \ncountry enjoys that they presently do not have.\n  Throughout this debate on this bill, you will hear the same \nstatistics on rationing, wait lines from both the Democrats and \nRepublicans. We see it. We know it is there. Some will argue it is a \nsolution that just involves passing this bill that has new programs. \nEvery time we pass an Indian Health Care Improvement Act bill, we cite \nthe same terrible statistics. We pass the bill because we need to do \nsomething. But each time we pass the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct, Indian health care does not improve.\n  What does that mean? We pass an Indian Health Care Improvement Act, \nbut Indian health care does not improve. Indian health care never \nimproves because we never fix the inefficiency that plagues the IHS. We \njust reauthorize and add new regulations, new obligations to the same \ndinosaur.\n  Now, the statistics I was referring to earlier: The Indian Health \nService has 14,392 employees, including 2,192 commissioned officers; \nthe latter COs include 8 Assistant Attorneys General, 439 director \ngrade individuals, 601 senior grade individuals. The salaries for the \nCOs total $135 million. The salaries for all other IHS employees is \nestimated at $655 million. The IHS spent $33.7 million on travel last \nyear. On travel? Think about what $33 million could do in terms of \nprevention for the complications of diabetes for American Indians and \nNative Alaskans.\n  The other significant thing is, IHS carried, in 2005--I do not have \nthe number for 2006 or 2007 yet--their obligated balance at the end of \nthe year was $162 million. Just efficiency in how we spend the money \ncould improve health care in Indian Country.\n  I say to the Senator, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your efforts. I know \nyou are truly committed to trying to make a difference. I believe we \nneed to be bold. I believe we have an obligation to do better. I \nbelieve this is short of the mark. So I am going to be voting against \nthis bill. I am going to be offering amendments to try to make it \nbetter. I say to the Senator, I know in the long run you and I have a \nlot of commonality in how we go about trying to solve this problem.\n  I do not think Indian Country can wait for us to come back. I do not \nthink the lady who gets on a dialysis machine today for the first time \nthinks we can wait. I do not think the lady who pops into the delivery \nroom who has not had any prenatal care thinks we can wait. I do not \nthink the person who ends up with coronary artery disease at 40 years \nof age, because their diabetes and their cholesterol and their \nhypertension have not been managed, thinks we can wait.\n  The body will probably think we can wait. But I think we have a moral \nobligation to meet our commitments, and that means radical change. When \nyou have a cancer, you do not treat it lightly. You go in, you cut it \nout, you treat it, you follow it, and you aggressively change things so \nyou make an impact in the quality of that person's life.\n  I think we have to do better. I appreciate the efforts of the \nchairman and ranking member. My hope is we will live up to our \nobligations.\n  With that, I yield back the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma cannot possibly \nwin a debate we are not having. I have given his speech 17 times on the \nfloor of the Senate. There is no disagreement between us. I am going to \ngive him a chance to be bold, however, as we go down the road on \nappropriations because that is what he started talking about: the need \nfor the resources, the need for the money. We have to reform this \nsystem. I agree with that. Then we have to fund it. The fact is, we are \ngoing to have amendments that add sufficient money. You talk about the \nfact that we are spending twice as much per person on Federal prisoners \nfor health care as we are to meet our responsibility for American \nIndians--twice as much for those we have incarcerated because we have a \nresponsibility for their health care.\n  Now, we need additional money in this system, and we need an overhaul \nof the system itself. The Senator will find no controversy with me with \nrespect to giving American Indians a card to show up at a health \nfacility and get the health care they need. He knows, and I know, there \nare many American Indians who live far out on a reservation, 90 miles \naway from the nearest hospital, and they do not have competition in the \nhealth delivery system. They have one place to go when they are sick \nthat morning or their child is sick that afternoon.\n  So we are going to have a chance to be bold. This is an authorization \nbill, not an appropriations bill. When appropriations come up, we will \nhave a chance to be bold. I hope the Senator will join me on that.\n  Let me make a couple comments about this issue.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, will the chairman yield for a couple \nmoments?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple comments, and then \nI have to go to a markup.\n\n  You will find me an ally on appropriations if we have the courage to \nmake priority choices on where we fund money. You know that. That has \nbeen my history. But we do not have extra money, so that means we have \nto take it from something else. My goal will be that we take from the \nwaste we\n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\nall know is there and we put it to the commitments.\n  So I look forward to that debate. I think you are right. I think we \nneed to up the ante, and we need to add the money. But there is plenty \nof money for us to go get, and I hope the chairman will help me go get \nit so we can put it there.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I certainly will do that.\n  It is interesting, we are spending $16 billion a month, $4 billion a \nweek to replenish the accounts for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nother issues. There are plenty of places for us to decide it is time to \nfix things here at home.\n  But I wish to talk about a couple of issues. First of all, there are \nwaiting lines. There is rationing. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nabsolutely correct. Dr. Grim, by the way, came to the Committee in \nsupport always of the President's request, saying that was enough \nbecause he had a responsibility and a requirement to support the \nPresident's budget. But get him off the dais at the hearing and ask him \nthe question, and he would admit there is rationing. About 40 percent \nof the health care that is needed by American Indians is not available. \nThat is health care rationing. That would be scandalous if it were \nhappening in other parts of the country. It ought to be front page \nheadlines, but you will not hear and you will not read many stories \nabout it, regrettably.\n  But the fact is, we have a circumstance that brings tears to my eyes. \nI disagree with the Senator from Oklahoma that this is not a worthy \nbill. This is a step forward in the right direction. It is not the \nreform we need, but this is a two-step process. If you cannot get this \nkind of thing done for 10 years, how on Earth are you going to decide \nto do something much bolder?\n  Now, we just faced a budget that came up last week that says not only \ndo we not have enough money for Indian health care, let's cut it. The \nPresident says, let's cut what we do have, at a time when we have 40 \npercent rationing. So we are fighting a battle just to keep the money \nwe have. We need much more if we are going to do what we promised we \nwere going to do.\n  But let me show the Senator a photograph, if I might. Let me show him \na photograph of Ta'shon Rain Littlelight because he says the system \ndoes not work. I showed the photograph before because her family has \ngiven me permission. This beautiful young 5-year-old girl is dead. She \nis dead, in my judgment, because of a system that does not work.\n  They took her again and again and again and again to the clinic. It \nwas on the Crow Reservation in Montana, where I held a hearing and her \ngrandmother stood up with this photograph. She told about little \nTa'shon Rain Littlelight. You can see she loved to dance.\n  Ta'shon Rain Littlelight got sick, and they took her to the health \nclinic. They treated her for depression. Again and again, they treated \nher for depression. Even her grandparents said: Well, the way her \nfingers look, with the swelling of the fingertips, and so on, there \nmust be something else wrong.\n  Well, one day, of course, they had to fly her to Billings, MT, and \nthen immediately fly her to Denver, CO, where they discovered she had \nterminal cancer and about 3 months to live.\n  She asked if she could go see Cinderella's Castle, so Make-A-Wish \ngave her the opportunity, with her mother, to go to Orlando, FL, to see \nCinderella's Castle. This little girl with terminal cancer, the night \nbefore she was to see Cinderella's Castle, in the motel room in \nOrlando, FL, told her mother, ``I am so sorry. I am going to try to be \nbetter, Mommy. I won't be sick anymore.'' And she died in her mother's \narms that night. This little 5-year-old died because the system did not \nwork.\n  I have shown a picture of Avis Littlewind. She was 14 years of age, \nlying in a fetal position in a bed for 90 days and then finally took \nher own life because there was no mental health treatment available on \nthat reservation--no mental health treatment available to try to help \nthat little girl who felt hopeless and helpless.\n  This is a photograph, by the way, of Avis Littlewind on the Spirit \nLake Nation Reservation. Avis was 14, and she took her life. Her sister \ntook her life. Avis took her life.\n  This is a photograph of Ardel Hale Baker. Ardel Hale Baker was having \na heart attack, diagnosed as having a heart attack on an Indian \nreservation. They wanted to send her to a hospital an hour and a half \naway. She did not want to go in the ambulance because she knew if it \ndid not get paid somehow, she would have to pay it, and she did not \nhave any money. They put her in an ambulance anyway and took her to the \nhospital. As Ardel Hale Baker was being taken off the gurney in the \nemergency room in the hospital, to be put on a hospital gurney, here is \nwhat was taped to her thigh--a piece of paper taped to the thigh of \nthis Indian woman; and it was to the hospital from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services--it was saying, by the way, ``If you admit \nthis woman, understand there is no money in contract health care to pay \nfor her,'' warning the hospital: ``Admit this woman and it is very \nlikely you will not be paid.'' This woman is having a heart attack, and \nshows up with a piece of paper taped to her leg, saying: ``There is no \nmoney for you to be paid, if you admit this woman to your hospital,'' \nor the woman who goes to the Indian Health Service with a knee that is \nso painful she cannot walk. It is bone on bone; an unbelievable problem \nwith her knee that you or I or our family would get fixed by having a \nnew knee joint put in. She goes to the Indian Health Service, and the \nIndian Health Service doctor says: ``Wrap it in cabbage leaves for 4 \ndays.'' That is Indian health care. That is unbelievable, just \nunbelievable to me.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma says, well, he does not support this bill \nbecause it is not bold. I have been on the floor of the Senate. I have \noffered amendments to add $1 billion to Indian health care, and it gets \ndefeated. I have seen the budget that came last week from this \nadministration that says they want less money for Indian health care.\n  Let me put up something Chief Joseph said years and years ago. We \ntook all this Indian land, took all those millions and millions of \nacres--hundreds of millions of acres--from the Indians, but we said to \nthem: Trust us. We will make you a promise. We will sign treaties. We \nwill tell you that we will provide for your health care. We believe we \nhave a trust responsibility. You can trust us.\n  Well, regrettably, that responsibility has not been met. Those \npromises have not been kept. Here is Chief Joseph. He said:\n\n       Good words don't last long unless they amount to something. \n     Words don't pay for my dead people. . . .Good words cannot \n     give me back my children. Good words will not give my people \n     good health and stop them from dying.\n\n  I care a lot about this issue. In my State, we have four Indian \nreservations. I have spent a lot of time with them. The fact is, we \nhave people living in the shadows. We have people living in abject, \ndesperate poverty.\n  I sat with a young girl once at a table with her grandfather. This \nwas a young girl who was put in a foster home at age 3. The woman who \nput her in a foster home was working 150 cases--150 cases. She did not \nhave time to go check out the home, so she put a 3-year-old girl in a \nfoster home. And on a Saturday night, in a drunken party brawl, a young \n3-year-old girl got her arm broken, her nose broken, and her hair \npulled out by the roots. That young girl will live forever with those \nscars.\n  One hundred and fifty cases a social worker is dealing with? There is \nsuch unbelievable difficulty because the resources do not exist. We \nhave people living in Third World conditions.\n  We had a tribal leader, a chairman of a tribe, say: ``My two \ndaughters live in used trailer houses that we moved from Michigan to \nthe reservation in South Dakota. They don't have indoor plumbing. They \nhave an outdoor rest room, outdoor toilet. One of them has a wood stove \nin the living room of the trailer house vented out through the \nwindow.'' I have seen all of these things. I have experienced all of \nthis. My colleague has seen the same in Alaska. We have people living \nin Third World conditions in this country. There is a full-scale, bona \nfide crisis in health care, housing, and education. This bill deals \nwith the question of health care. We have a special responsibility, \nunlike other responsibilities, because this country has\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\npromised. We have signed treaties. The Supreme Court says we have a \ntrust responsibility. We have not kept our promise, and we have not met \nour responsibility. I am just flat tired of it.\n  My colleague says: Let's be bold. Nobody wants to be bolder than I \nwant to be, but we haven't been able to get a bill through here in 10 \nyears, for God's sake. If you can't pass a bill in a decade, how on \nEarth are you going to be bold? Let's at least take a step in the right \ndirection. I am going to follow that with step 2 on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, and that is bold, dramatic reform, because this system is \nnot nearly as good as it can be.\n  He talks about: Why would you add new services? Well, services \ndealing with diabetes, with cancer screening, with mental health--let's \nadd those services because they are needed, and then let's decide, when \nthe appropriations bill comes around, to add the funding. My colleague \nknows this is an authorization bill, not a funding bill. We will have a \nchance to be bold. Let's see who is going to be bold. Let's add the \nfunding to keep our promises, for a change.\n  My colleague talked a lot about Dr. Grim. I like Dr. Grim. He \nretired--resigned, I should say--from the Indian Health Service. Dr. \nGrim came every year, supporting the President's budget. He knew it was \nnot adequate. We know we are rationing health care. The fact is, we all \nknow it. We need to stop it. Are we rationing health care with \nincarcerated prisoners in Federal prisons? No, we are not, because we \nhave a responsibility for them. We arrest them, we convict them, we \nsend them to prison, and then it is our responsibility to provide for \ntheir health care in Federal prisons, and we do it. We spend twice as \nmuch per person for them as we do for American Indians. Yet we have the \nsame responsibility for American Indians because we made the promise, \nsigned the treaties, and told them we would provide for these needs. \nWhat gives us the right to continue to break our promises? We have done \nit for decades and decades over almost 200 years. What gives us the \nright to continue to do that in the face of little children who are \ndying and in the face of elders who can't get health care? What gives \nus that right?\n  I say to my colleague, if you want to be bold, we are going to have a \nchance to be bold together, because this country ought to stare truth \nin the face and look at what is happening on Indian reservations.\n  The other night, I was on an Indian reservation, having a listening \nsession with Indians. There were two sisters sitting in the front row. \nOne sister stood up to speak, and the other sister sobbed \nuncontrollably--cried and sobbed. It was an unbelievable story about \nthe sister who desperately needed health care and couldn't get it and \ncouldn't find it. She finally had her heart surgery, and of course it \nwas charged back to her, because there was no contract health care. It \nhas completely ruined her credit rating because she doesn't have \nanything to pay for it, and the Indian Health Service did not serve her \nneeds. She was also treated for depression. She had a heart valve \nproblem that needed surgery, and she was treated for depression. When \nshe finally found a way to get the surgery, it could not be paid for by \nIndian contract health because they were out of funds. ``Don't get sick \nafter June.'' We had one reservation tell us, don't get sick after \nJanuary, because they didn't have the money. This poor woman sat there \nin the chair sobbing as her sister recounted the details of her \ndesperate attempt to deal with a health care problem that was very \nacute.\n  So, yes, I am a little bit emotional about these issues. When we have \npeople say, well, let's do much more, I say: Absolutely. Let's do much \nmore than we are now doing. Let's do that in appropriations. That is an \nawfully good start.\n  This is an authorization bill which does a lot more than the current \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act. It does a lot more in areas we know \nare in urgent need.\n  We have teen suicide clusters on Indian reservations. In the northern \nGreat Plains, there is a 10 times greater rate of suicide among \nteenagers--not double, triple, or quadruple, but 10 times the rate of \nsuicide. I went and sat and talked with kids on that reservation, the \none where we had a cluster recently. It was just me with some high \nschool kids, talking about what is going on, what is their life like. \nIt is unbelievable.\n  We need to address these things. That is what we try to do in this \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act. It is not perfect, but it is \ncertainly a step in the right direction.\n  I have other things to say, and my colleague may wish to weigh in, as \nwell. My hope will be at the end of the day today that we will be able \nto get the amendments up and get them voted on. Some of the amendments \nmy colleague described, I likely will support, because I think we can \nimprove this piece of legislation. I think at the end of the day, all \nof us will hope we will have done something we are proud of, to say to \nthose who don't now have adequate health care or whom we promised \nhealth care that we have made a step forward in trying to meet those \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me make just a few comments in response \nto the Senator from North Dakota.\n  First of all, I commend him for his work on this bill, as well as the \nSenator from Alaska, who has worked very hard to get this bill in a \nposition where it could be brought to the floor and considered by this \nbody--in particular, in helping to work out some very contentious \nissues that have bedeviled people on both sides of the aisle for quite \na long time. In the best spirit of working to get legislation \naccomplished in a bipartisan way, staffs from the committee itself and \nthe two Senators I mentioned and my staff and others rolled up their \nsleeves, sat down, and have worked out very satisfactory resolutions to \nthree big problems that previously existed. As far as I know now, those \nissues are totally resolved, language is ready to be substituted into \nthe bill, and it represents a real achievement to try to move this bill \nforward. I appreciate their cooperation, and I commend the others who \nhave worked on it as well.\n  I must say also that I am looking forward to working with the Senator \nfrom North Dakota when he comes to the State of Arizona to address \nanother issue dealing with Indian Country; that is, the deplorable \nstate of law enforcement, of facilities to deal with people who are \napprehended on Indian reservations, and the staff to deal with those. \nCrime is a huge problem, as is health care, on our Indian reservations \nthroughout the country. It is neglected. It needs more attention. I \napplaud the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from North Dakota for \ntheir attention to this as well, and I look forward to working with \nthem.\n  Finally, I would note just on a personal basis that a very good thing \nhappened to me because of the Indian Health Service, even though there \nare a lot of improvements which need to be made in that. Were it not \nfor the Indian Health Service, I probably wouldn't be married to my \nwife right now. One might say: How on Earth did that happen? But it \nhappened because her father was a pharmacist with the Indian Health \nService, and I had the good fortune of being assigned to Tucson, AZ, to \nwork on what was then called the Papago Indian Reservation, now the \nTohono O'odham. As a result, his daughter--now my wife--attended the \nUniversity of Arizona, where we met, and the rest is history, as they \nsay. So I have had some knowledge and information about this for a long \ntime.\n  I wish to make the point that there are--and I know the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and the Senator from Alaska agree with this--thousands of \ndedicated personnel who are serving our Indian community throughout all \nof our States under great difficulty. The working conditions are not \ngood, but the professionals are very professional. They are very good. \nThey are dedicated and really work hard on behalf of our Native \nAmerican citizens. It is as much to give them the resources they need \nas well as to help those whom they serve to get this legislation \nadopted and move the process forward.\n  So I compliment those who have been working on this important \nlegislation and hope that in the remainder of this day--and I will make \nthis point to my colleagues--that if you have amendments you think \nwould improve this\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\nlegislation, please bring them to the floor so that we can complete \nwork on this legislation, so that we can take the amendments up and we \ncan dispose of them. Based upon the work we have done in the past, I \nthink it is quite possible that a lot of good suggestions can be \nconsidered by staff and eventually Members and perhaps adopted without \nthe need to take up the full Senate's time. But, in any event, bring \nyour amendments down here so we can move this legislation forward as \nsoon as possible to do so.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Arizona. He \nhas been working very hard with us to try to move this bill along. I \nwould say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle as well: If you \nhave amendments, please bring them. The majority leader has indicated \nwe are going to finish this bill this week, and that will be a \nsignificant step forward. I thank the Senator from Alaska and the \nSenator from Arizona for their work to help us move this bill. He is \ncorrect that we had four or five very controversial issues that \nprovoked some opposition. We worked through those, negotiated, and I \nthink all of them are now resolved.\n  I think when the Senator from Alaska has completed any statement she \nis going to make, we do have the managers' amendment that amends the \nsubstitute we had offered, and that has been negotiated and agreed to \non both sides. So when Senator Murkowski has completed her statement, \nwe will ask that it be completed as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Smith, is on his way to the floor, so when he arrives, I \nwill yield such time to him as he needs. I know he wants to speak to an \namendment.\n  I wish to take just a couple of minutes this morning to respond to \nsome of the comments made by the Senator from Oklahoma. Clearly, he is \nvery passionate about Indian health care and making sure that we do \nright by our treaty obligations and that we do right by all American \nIndians and Alaska Natives when it comes to their health care needs. He \ncited some of the obvious. Unfortunately, the statistics are real. In \nfact, the statistics may be even more devastating than he has indicated \nbecause we know that a lot of times our statistics aren't as reliable \nas we may want, and, in fact, they are worse than what we have seen.\n  When he spoke to prenatal care, when he spoke to the incidence of \ndiabetes and substance abuse and suicides, we know they are horrific \nstatistics. We recognize we must do more. I, too, applaud him for bold \naction, for reform in a system that has been unwieldy and bureaucratic \nand stovepiped in so many areas.\n  Senator Barrasso yesterday brought forward an amendment that asks for \na GAO study to look to the efficiency. There are some other amendments \nthat have been introduced that also task us with evaluating to make \nsure we are doing right by the programs that are put in place, how the \nfunding is directed to them, and are we doing what we need to be doing. \nI think it is fair to say that we recognize it is not sufficient, it is \nnot enough. We do need to be doing more, and certainly, as the chairman \nof the Indian Affairs Committee has mentioned, we have to put our money \nwhere our mouth is. We have to put our money toward those programs. We \nhave to make sure we put the resources there to make the difference.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma spoke about the rationed care. It is not \nrationed care because we just don't want to give it; it is rationed \ncare because of the lack of resources, and that is very real and \nsomething that must be dealt with, and it must be dealt with in a very \nstrong way.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma really spoke as well to the issue of \nprevention, and it was his opinion in his comments that this Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act doesn't go far enough, that we need to be \ndoing more in the area of prevention. He speaks to a part of me that I \nfeel very strongly about. When we talk about health care in this \ncountry, whether it is in Indian Country or in the United States as a \nwhole, it has been referred to as not a system of health care, it is a \nsystem of sick care. We take care of you after you are sick. It is no \ndifferent within the Indian health system. That does have to change. We \nmust focus on the prevention. We know this. We are seeing this. We are \nworking here in the Congress to change those policies to help put \ngreater focus on prevention because we know for a fact that we can \nreduce costs if we focus on prevention.\n  Now, the Senator from Oklahoma has indicated that there isn't enough \nhere in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act in the area of \nprevention. I want to mention some of the initiatives that are included \nin the legislation that will make a difference, that will reduce health \ncare costs, and that will provide for greater access. It is in the area \nof prevention.\n  Diabetes--we have all listened to the stats. They are absolutely \nunacceptable. We have to be doing more when it comes to diabetes \nprevention. We must be doing more to keep the elderly woman whom he was \ndiscussing off of the dialysis machine. We have to have the focus \nthere. So included within the legislation is a focus on diabetes \nprevention.\n  We also look to the issue of domestic violence and sexual assault. \nAgain, in these areas, our statistics with our American Indians and our \nAlaska Natives are absolutely unacceptable. Are we doing enough in the \narea? No, we need to do more.\n\n  It has been mentioned we have not reauthorized the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act in some 10 years. Think about what has happened in this \ncountry in terms of health care and how we provide health care, how we \nfocus on prevention in the last 10 years, the technologies that are \nmade available to us, and also the areas of focus. Behavioral health is \nsomething about which in my State of Alaska we have been forced to be \ninnovative. We do not have the psychologists and the psychiatrists who \nare available in all of our little communities. We have been forced to \nutilize a telehealth system, and we are absolutely making some \nremarkable progress. But through this Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct and what we are allowing for, we can allow for expanded \nopportunities to help, such as in the area of behavioral health.\n  I have a whole list of other programs that are also included--\nprograms to control blood pressure, immunizations, youth suicide \nprevention, injury prevention, sudden infant death syndrome training, \ntobacco cessation programs. These are all programs that go right to the \nheart of prevention. These are initiatives that will help us reduce our \ncosts, that will help us keep people from becoming ill in the first \nplace, keep people from losing a limb due to diabetes, keep young \npeople from having to live a life afflicted with FAS or FASD.\n  There are initiatives contained within this legislation that need to \nbe authorized, need to be updated and included to allow American \nIndians and Alaska Natives the same opportunity for preventive care \nthat we find wherever we go in the country in a community hospital or \nin the clinic down the street. We have to make sure these programs are \nincluded.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Smith has arrived. In recognition of his \ntime limitations today, I yield to him so he can speak to an amendment \nhe is proposing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kohl). The Chair recognizes Senator Smith.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3897 to Amendment No. 3899\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up for \nconsideration amendment No. 3897.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself, Ms. \n     Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Crapo, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3897 to amendment No. 3899.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify a provision relating to development of innovative \n                              approaches)\n\n       Strike subsection (f) of section 301 of the Indian Health \n     Care Improvement Act (as\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\n     amended by section 101) and insert the following:\n       ``(f) Development of Innovative Approaches.--The Secretary \n     shall consult and cooperate with Indian Tribes and Tribal \n     Organizations, and confer with Urban Indian Organizations, in \n     developing innovative approaches to address all or part of \n     the total unmet need for construction of health facilities, \n     that may include--\n       ``(1) the establishment of an area distribution fund in \n     which a portion of health facility construction funding could \n     be devoted to all Service Areas;\n       ``(2) approaches provided for in other provisions of this \n     title; and\n       ``(3) other approaches, as the Secretary determines to be \n     appropriate.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of \nreauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. I begin by \nthanking Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member Murkowski for their \nleadership and for building on the momentum from the last Congress to \nreauthorize this very important and overdue reauthorization of this \nact.\n  Like most of my colleagues, I feel that passing this legislation is \ncritical and it is about time. Since passage of the act in 1976, this \nlegislation has provided the framework for carrying out responsibility \nto provide Native Americans with adequate health care. As we know, the \nact has not been updated in 16 years despite the growing needs among \nNative Americans. We cannot allow the health of this population to \nremain in jeopardy any longer.\n  Today, funding levels meet only 60 percent of the demand for services \neach year which requires the Indian Health Services tribal health \nfacilities and urban Indian health care providers to ration care, \nresulting in tragic denials of needed services.\n  Speaking of the urban Indian health programs, reauthorization of the \nact will facilitate the modernization of the systems, such as \nprevention and behavioral health programs, for approximately 1.8 \nmillion Native Americans. I sincerely hope we can pass this legislation \nand send it to the President for his signature.\n  Although this bill makes vast and necessary improvements upon \nexisting law, it is not perfect. Currently, the vast majority of \nFederal funding for construction and modernization of tribal health \ncare facilities goes to tribes in less than 10 States. Unfortunately, \nthis bill maintains that inequity among tribes by favoring construction \nin those few States.\n  I offered today an amendment with Senator Cantwell that will correct \nthis problem and instill equity among all of the Native American \ntribes.\n  This concern is particularly relevant in my home State of Oregon \nwhich is 1 of over 40 States that have never--I repeat, never--received \nfunding to build an Indian Health Service hospital.\n  Since the beginning of last year, I have worked with my colleagues to \nfind a compromise to resolve this issue in a way that is not \ndetrimental to any region of the country. I believe my amendment is \njust that: a good-faith compromise that will provide equity to the \nhealth facility system. It does so by providing the Indian Health \nService the authority to use an area distribution fund which would \nallocate a portion of health facility construction funds to all 12 \nIndian Health Service areas to improve, expand, or replace existing \nhealth care facilities.\n  This area distribution fund is not the idea of a single Senator or a \nsingle region of the country. It is the product of years of work and \ncompromise by the Indian Health Service and tribes and after Congress \nrecognized the need to create a more equitable facilities construction \nsystem.\n  The current system has been locked into place since 1991, and it will \nbe over 20 or 30 years before funding will go to new projects. I do not \nsee how that is fair and equitable if we have an obligation to all.\n  Sadly, this has resulted in wide disparities in the level of health \nservices provided to tribal communities across the country. I believe \nthis amendment represents a rational middle ground on this issue.\n  I also want to highlight that this compromise language is supported \nby regions of the country with nearly 400 of the 561 federally \nrecognized tribes that reside in 23 States. Those folks are out if this \ndoes not pass.\n  I also want to add that it is not my intention to rob one IHS area to \npay another. I believe that an area distribution fund works best when \nand if funding for IHS is expanded. We simply have to enlarge this pie \nso we are not disadvantaging any tribes in the Southwest of our \ncountry, but we must not abandon, as we have been, the tribes all over \nthe rest of the country. That is why I asked my colleagues to join me \nin sending a letter to the administration seeking a 15 percent increase \nin IHS funding for fiscal year 2009. I hope we are successful in this \neffort. But regardless, we must take steps through this bill to \nestablish a fairer system--just a fairer system--to distribute Federal \nfunding.\n  If we are sincere about the title of the legislation at hand--of \nbetter meeting our statutory, our treaty, and our moral obligations to \nimprove the health care of all Native Americans--then my amendment \nshould be adopted.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that all \nNative American Indians receive the health care they need, they \ndeserve, and what we have promised.\n  I close with a quote from Morning Dove, the literary name of \nChristine Quintasket, a Sa-lish tribal woman from the Pacific \nNorthwest, now recognized as the first Native American woman to publish \na novel. She wrote:\n\n       Everything on the earth has a purpose, every disease an \n     herb to cure it, and every person a mission . . . this is the \n     Indian theory of existence.\n\n  There are, indeed, cures and treatment for the maladies that \ndisproportionately affect Native Americans--diabetes, alcoholism, \nsuicides that result from mental disorders, and so many others. The \npurpose and the mission of this bill is to connect those cures with \nthose who need it most, those who have sought it longest, and through \nthe dismal chapters of our Nation's history have a unique claim to \nthose cures and treatments.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Mikulski-\nColeman-Klobuchar amendment to place a moratorium on CMS's December 4 \nrule on Medicaid case management services. Last night, Senator \nMikulski--and I joined with her--and Senator Klobuchar offered this \ncase management legislation as an amendment to the Indian health bill \nbeing debated on the floor.\n  I begin by saying I fully understand the fiscal challenges our \nentitlement programs face, and I look forward to the day when we can \nput politics aside and have an honest and productive discussion about \nhow to preserve these programs for future generations. I think we can \nall agree that the goal of that conversation is to find a delicate \nbalance between fiscal responsibility and making sure our Nation's most \nvulnerable populations still have access to the health care services \nthey so desperately need. Unfortunately, when it comes to the case \nmanagement rule, while I support CMS's intent to cut out wasteful \nspending, it is clear to me that it fails to achieve this delicate \nbalance.\n  I cannot think of a better way to describe case management than to \nsay it is the glue that holds together our Nation's Medicaid system. In \nmy home State of Minnesota, I have consistently heard from social \nworkers, county supervisors, health care providers, and others about \nhow devastating this new regulation will be for at-risk individuals and \nfamilies.\n  Suffice it to say, when I travel throughout Minnesota and I meet with \ncounty commissioners, one of the first things they say to me is \ntargeted case management and they raise the deep concern that the \nproposed CMS rules will have on their ability to service needy \nindividuals in my State. I suspect if my colleagues across the country \ntalk with a county commissioner, this is what they are going to hear.\n  I hear that without comprehensive case management services, millions \nof Americans with mental illness will not be able to access the \ntreatment medications they need to survive; that people living with \ndisabilities will find\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\nthemselves forced to remain in institutions instead of enjoying the \ndignity of independent community-based living; that our most vulnerable \nchildren, those in foster care, will be left alone to navigate a \ncomplex and often overwhelming Medicaid system.\n  That is why I introduced the legislation this amendment is based on, \nand that is why this legislation is not only cosponsored by 19 of our \nSenate colleagues but also has the support of several advocacy groups \nthroughout the country, including the Child Welfare League, Muscular \nSclerosis Society, National Alliance on Mental Illness, National \nCouncil for Community Behavioral Health, and many others.\n  All these groups recognize the devastating effect this regulation \nwill have on those most in need of important case management services.\n  Let me take a moment to highlight some of the fundamental problems \nwith this rule. This new regulation requires that case management \nservices must be delivered by a single case manager, which sounds \nreasonable enough. However, we are talking about populations that can \nhave up to four or five or six chronic conditions. If this rule is \nfinalized, it would require that a single case manager provide quality \ncase management services to a person who may be suffering with HIV, \nmental illness, and diabetes all at the same time. Should we not have a \nhealth system that allows a team of specialized case managers to work \ntogether to address each of these complex issues?\n  Isn't the kind of care, integrated care a key element of making sure \nour health care system is keeping people healthy, not just treating \nthem when they get sick?\n  Another concern I have consistently heard is the new limitations on \nmoving people from an institutional setting to a less restrictive \ncommunity-based setting. Let me remind you that moving people to \ncommunity-based settings was a key recommendation of the President's \nown New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Yet under this new rule, \ncase managers would have significantly less time to prepare people to \nmove from an institution to a community. Let me also point out that the \nadministration has made ``home and community-based waivers'' a key \nelement of its Medicaid reform efforts. I could not be more supportive \nof this initiative. We should, whenever possible, make every effort to \nallow people to live with dignity and independence in the setting of \ntheir choice. Unfortunately, this new rule will stand in the way of \nthese efforts and force many people to remain institutionalized.\n  Finally, this new rule eviscerates case management for some of our \nNation's most vulnerable children, those living in the foster care \nsystem. By not allowing child welfare workers to provide case \nmanagement services, many children will be left to fend for themselves \nwhen seeking medical services. As I said before, I am all for fiscal \nresponsibility, but I cannot support reforms that will have such a \ndestructive impact on America's foster care system. These children \nalready have enough obstacles to face. Let's not make their lives more \nchallenging by taking away these critical case management services.\n  I should note that this amendment is fully paid for. Actually, the \n``paid for'' is a key step forward in preserving our entitlement \nprograms. My investigation, as ranking member of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, revealed that thousands of Medicare \nproviders who are supposed to be serving our Nation's elderly and \ndisabled are, instead, cheating American taxpayers in order to line \ntheir own pockets. As a solution, a provision in this amendment will \nsave American taxpayers close to $160 million over the next 5 years by \nensuring that CMS participates in the Federal Payment Levy Program so \nthat Medicare payments to these tax cheats can be levied. The \nadministration supports this proposal, going so far as to include it in \nthe 2009 budget.\n  This amendment is simple. We recognize that we need to provide more \ndirection in case management services, but all we are asking CMS to do \nis take another year and work with Congress and the relevant \nstakeholders to develop a reasonable rule that clarifies the scope of \nthe case management program but still provides the critical services \nour most vulnerable populations rely on.\n  My father was a carpenter by trade. He told me always that we should \nmeasure twice and cut once. In this case management program, what we \nhave is individuals working as a system to deliver, in the most \neffective way possible, services to the neediest. It makes sense. I \nunderstand their concerns. CMS in my State--and I suspect in Wisconsin, \nthe State of the Presiding Officer--our folks do this well. CMS found \nout that, in fact, we are doing it well. We are doing what the program \nis supposed to do, with very little waste. If there is waste in other \nareas of the country, let us have a conversation about it but don't \nhurt the neediest and penalize the States that are doing a good job in \nproviding coordinated services to those at risk and those in need.\n  As I said before, this is an issue that each and every time I travel \nand visit with my county commissioners, those involved in the \nunheralded work of simply dealing with those in need--they don't get a \nlot of credit being county commissioners, but they are all worried and \nconcerned. They tell me: Senator, we are doing it right and we are \nabout to be penalized.\n  We should be better than that. Let's step back and take a breath and \nput a hold on the implementation of this rule, and let's figure out a \nway to do it right. Let's measure twice and only cut once.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I filed a number of technical improvements \nto this bill, which I wish to work on with the chairman to see if we \ncan resolve these without a vote. These are very small wording \namendments, in some cases, that I would like the chairman and his staff \nto look at before I call them up, because I think it is very unlikely \nwe will need votes on these particular amendments.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4067 to Amendment No. 3894\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto the Bingaman amendment No. 3894 and I send a second-degree amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  The clerk will report the second-degree amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4067 to amendment No. 3894.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To rescind funds appropriated by the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2008, for the City of Berkeley, California, and any \nentities located in such city, and to provide that such funds shall be \n transferred to the Operation and Maintenance, Marine Corps account of \n       the Department of Defense for the purposes of recruiting)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RECISSION AND TRANSFER OF FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Recission of Certain Earmarks.--All of the amounts \n     appropriated by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-161) and the accompanying report for \n     congressional directed spending items for the City of \n     Berkeley, California, or entities located in such city are \n     hereby rescinded.\n       (b) Transfer of Funds to Operation and Maintenance, Marine \n     Corps.--The amounts rescinded under subsection (a) shall be \n     transferred to the ``Operation and Maintenance, Marine \n     Corps'' account of the Department of Defense for fiscal year \n     2008 to be used for recruiting purposes.\n       (c) Congressional Directed Spending Item Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``congressional directed spending item'' \n     has the meaning given such term in paragraph 5(a) of rule \n     XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment and the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to obtaining the yeas and \nnays on both amendments in one request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I object. I have not had a chance to visit \nwith my colleague. I wish to do so first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we will talk about it and get the vote \nlater on. I want to say a few words about this amendment.\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\n  My amendment is identical to the Semper Fi Act, which I introduced \nalong with Senators Allard, Bond, Burr, Chambliss, Coburn, Cornyn, \nInhofe, Martinez, McConnell, Vitter, and probably a number of other \nMembers. Since the bill that is pending now will probably be the last \nvote before the recess, I think it is important that we vote on this \nSemper Fi amendment. Last week, when I introduced the bill, the \nmajority leader did not recess so that we could not get this on the \ncalendar. This is an important bill, which I will explain in a minute. \nWe also tried to move it by unanimous consent through the hotline \nprocess, and all of the Republicans approved the bill, but apparently \nsomeone on the majority side is holding it. That is why it is important \nthat this amendment be part of the bill we are considering today.\n  The Semper Fi Act would rescind all earmarks, or specially designated \nspending projects, contained in the fiscal year 2008 Consolidated \nOmnibus Appropriations Act for the city of Berkeley and entities \nlocated therein, and redirects those funds to the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  For those who have not been paying attention, the Berkeley City \nCouncil recently voted to ask the U.S. Marine Corps to vacate their \nrecruiting office in town, and that if they chose to stay they did so \nas ``uninvited and unwelcome intruders.''\n  During debate of the resolution, one council member called the \nMarines ``the President's own gangsters'' and ``trained killers.'' \nAnother said the Marines had given the country ``horrible karma'' and \nsaid they had a history of ``death and destruction.'' In a document \ndrafted to support the resolution against the Marines, the council \nstated: ``Military recruiters are sales people known to lie to and \nseduce minors and young adults into contracting themselves into \nmilitary service with false promises regarding jobs, job training, \neducation and other benefits.''\n  After voting to insult the men and women who fight and bleed for \ntheir freedom, the city council cast another ridiculous vote in favor \nof giving the radical protest group Code Pink a parking space directly \nin front of the Marine Corps recruiting station. They also voted to \ngive Code Pink a sound permit for protests in front of the Marine Corps \nbuilding. The city council stated in the resolution that they \n``encourage all people to avoid cooperation with the Marine Corps \nrecruiting station'' and to ``applaud'' Code Pink for working to \n``impede, passively or actively'' the work of the Marines Corps in \nBerkeley.\n  Frankly, I just returned from a visit to Iraq, saw our marines on the \nground and what they were doing. It is inconceivable to me that any \ngoverning body in this country would say such things to our marines.\n  Code Pink is a fringe organization that distinguishes itself by \nattacking American policy, while defending dictator Hugo Chavez. The \ngroup is so disrespectful that they have no problems demonstrating in \nfront of wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Center with signs \nreading ``Maimed for a lie.''\n  The council's resolution sparked an escalation of anti-Marine \nprotests. Code Pink organizer Zanne Joy points to the city council as \njustification for the escalation. She said that ``anything legal is \njustified if it succeeds in persuading the Marine Corps to move its \nrecruiting station out of Berkeley.'' According to the San Francisco \nChronicle, Code Pink protesters have been heard shouting at young men \nwho are trying to enter the recruiting station, ``You guys are just \ncannon fodder!'' and ``They want to train you to kill babies!''\n  It is sad to see a city like Berkeley moving so far left. The city in \nwhich the legendary World War II Pacific Theater Commander, Fleet \nAdmiral Chester W. Nimitz, established the Naval ROTC in the fall of \n1926 is now sadly a shell of its former self, thanks to its elected \nleadership.\n  This is disappointing, but in a republican form of government, it \nmust be up to local voters to change their leadership.\n  However, this particular case became the business of all Americans \nwhen they insulted our troops and their constitutional mission to \ndefend our country; while coming to the Federal Government asking for \nspecial taxpayer-funded handouts. Over $2 million was secretly tucked \naway for Berkeley earmarks in the 2008 Omnibus appropriations bill, \nprojects that were never voted on or debated.\n  I do not believe a city that has turned its back on our country's \nfinest deserves $2 million worth of pork barrel projects. So my \namendment revokes these earmarks.\n  Included in the $2 million worth of pork are some particularly \nwasteful projects.\n  One earmark provides gourmet organic lunches to schools in the \nBerkeley School District. While our Marines are making due with MREs of \nSloppy Joe and chili with beans, Berkeley students will get Federal tax \ndollars to design meals that promote ``environmental harmony.'' Chez \nPanisse's menu features ``Comte cheese souffle with mache salad'', \n``Meyer lemon eclairs with huckleberry coulis''; and ``Chicory salad \nwith creamy anchovy vinaigrette and olive toast''. That is \nunacceptable.\n  Are we to understand that the city that has been home to many of the \ncountry's most rich and famous cannot afford to pay for its own \ndesigner school lunches?\n  Another $975,000 earmark is for the Matsui Center for Politics and \nPublic Service at U.C. Berkeley, which may include cataloging the \npapers of the late Congressman Robert Matsui. Is it really necessary to \ntax the paychecks of Marines so we can earmark nearly $1 million for a \nschool that is already sitting on a $3.5 billion endowment?\n  Let me be clear, my amendment does not cut off all Federal funds to \nthe city of Berkeley, though I am sure most Americans would feel that \nis justified. It merely rescinds wasteful earmarks. Berkeley is free to \ncompete with other towns and cities across America for merit-based \nFederal grants.\n  Actions have consequences. When the Berkeley City Council decided to \ninsult the Marines in a time of war, it was a $2 million decision. \nEspecially in a time of war, we cannot just allow cities to play \ninsulting games at our troops' expense while continuing to shower them \nwith congressional favors.\n  On Tuesday, the city council met to revisit its ridiculous actions. \nHundreds of military supporters and antiwar protesters gathered at \nBerkeley City Hall. Berkeley police reported four arrests before the \nmeeting began, all misdemeanors. Police said there were minor scuffles \nbetween the antiwar and promilitary camps. An American flag was set \naflame outside the city council chambers, damaging a pair of bicycles. \nWhen the council meeting finally started, more than 100 speakers took \nturns at the podium.\n\n  In a sense, what happened in Berkeley was a quintessential American \nexperience, a spirited exchange and protest followed by debate and \ndemocratic action. And while I find some of the views and behavior of \nmany of the protestors repugnant, the exchange itself is a solemn \nreminder of those who have sacrificed so much to preserve our freedom, \nespecially our freedom of speech.\n  Let me be clear. I do not question the sincerity of anyone on either \nside of the issue. I think there is genuine concern among many in this \ncountry about the war. But while we can respect the legitimate worries \nabout the war and can respect the sincerity of even the most radical \nprotestors, we must recognize that words have meaning and actions have \nconsequences. Some of the hateful words that have come out of Berkeley, \nCA, have had real consequences on our troops, their families, and our \nrecruiting.\n  One of those who spoke at the city council meeting was Debbie Lee of \nArizona, whose son Marc was the first Navy SEAL to die in the Iraq war. \nShe demanded an apology from the council, and she said: My son gave up \nhis life for you. Lee told the council, as she clutched his framed \npicture, ``I'm appalled at what you did,'' referring to the council's \nvote on Marine recruiters.\n  Debbie Parrish, another military mom whose son Victor is currently \nserving in Iraq, said to the Berkeley City Council:\n\n       It is despicable what you said about our military. It is \n     very, very sad. Shame on you.\n\n  After all the testimony from the military supporters and families, \nthe Berkeley City Council could only muster the votes to not send a \nletter insulting the U.S. Marines by calling\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nthem ``uninvited and unwelcomed intruders.'' Let's be clear. They did \nnot apologize for the letter. They just didn't mail it. Of course, the \nsending of a letter at this point is inconsequential given that the \ntext of the letter has been running on national television for a week. \nThe city council also modified one of its past resolutions to \n``recognize the recruiters' right to locate in our city and the right \nof others to protest or support their presence.''\n  But the resolution also stated that the city council opposes ``the \nrecruitment of our young people into this war.''\n  The resolution proposing a formal apology to the Marines failed. The \ncity council also voted to let four additional items passed at last \nweek's meeting stand. One resolution encouraged all people to avoid \ncooperation with the Marine Corps recruiting station. A second one \nrequested that the city attorney investigate if the Marines are in \nviolation of Berkeley's policy against discrimination based on sexual \norientation.\n  In addition, two resolutions giving the radical antiwar group Code \nPink a weekly parking space and a weekly sound permit to protest the \nMarine recruiting station were upheld by the council's decision.\n  It was my hope that the city would apologize and revoke its previous \nresolutions and move on. The council chose not to do that. We have no \nchoice but to acknowledge the reality of what they have done and to \ndefend our military recruiters who are doing the job we asked them to \ndo. If we don't take action, we will be sending a message to other \ntowns or cities that they can use their power to try to influence U.S. \nforeign policy, thwarting our recruitment efforts.\n  This issue is not about free speech. It is about a city that has \nshown total disdain for our Armed Forces and used its official \ngovernment powers to harass our military as they try to keep our \ncountry safe. And this amendment is not about forcing the city to \nchange its mind. It is about whether we are going to shower the city \nwith favors, with special goodies that do not meet national needs. I \nthink the American people have spoken loudly and clearly that they do \nnot believe that should be the case.\n  There is a video with clips of the city council meeting on YouTube. \nIt has been viewed by over 200,000 people. It is the 70th most viewed \nvideo this week and the 11th most viewed video in news and politics, \nwith 767 people posting comments overwhelmingly in support of the \nlegislation. People are paying attention.\n  I am amazed at the response received regarding my public outrage over \nthe city of Berkeley's behavior. My office has received thousands of \ncalls and letters from military supporters all over the country. On \nWednesday afternoon, I received a call from Sgt James Strowe of the \nU.S. Marine Corps. Sergeant Strowe is currently fighting to protect our \nfreedom in Kuwait. Sergeant Strowe understands what the Marine \nrecruiters in Berkeley are going through quite well because he served \nas a recruiter himself for 7 years. And he just told me his folks \nserving with him wanted to thank those of us who were standing up for \nthem while they were fighting for our country.\n  After talking with the sergeant, I decided it would be a good idea to \ncall the marines at the Berkeley recruiting station to ask how they \nwere holding up amidst all the controversy. I talked to GSgt Rick \nO'Frente, who seemed to be taking the events in stride. He even said a \nnumber of citizens from Berkeley had come into the recruitment office, \nbrought them food, and some had apologized for the actions of the \ncouncil.\n  I guess I have said enough about all of what we are hearing. I have \npages and pages of comments from people who are asking us to stand up \nfor our marines while they are fighting for us, and we will be asking \nagain for votes as part of the deliberations on this package.\n  Mr. President, now that I think the chairman has had a chance to \nunderstand in more detail what this bill is about, I will once again \nask for the yeas and nays on my amendment and the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to obtaining the yeas and \nnays on both amendments at the same time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object. I have not had a chance to visit with the \nSenator, and I will be glad to do so at some point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4023\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to speak on amendment No. 4023, a \nvery important amendment that affects over 200,000 people in my State. \nI am not calling up the amendment right this moment, pending some other \nparliamentary action, but I do wish to speak on the amendment.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment sponsored by Senator Klobuchar, who \nhas taken a very impressive lead, as well as Senator Coleman. This \nbipartisan amendment is to stand up for constituents all over the \nUnited States of America who are severely disabled and who are about to \nlose their case managers.\n  Thousands and thousands and thousands of people--severely handicapped \nor disabled, both children and adults--are about to lose either their \nsocial workers or their nurses because of a new, harsh, punitive rule \nput out by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare. The amendment does \nthe same thing as Senate Bill 2578 that is sponsored by the Senators \nfrom Minnesota and myself and 17 others and would simply do this: It \nwould stop the CMS from implementing the new rule by delaying its \nimplementation until April 2009, when we have a new President and a new \nattitude.\n  Now, let me give the background. In December, CMS proposed this rule \nthat would cut Medicaid funding to something called ``targeted case \nmanagement'' services. The rule will go into effect March 3. That is \nwhy we are offering it on this very important bill of Indian health, \nand we thank the managers of the bill for their courtesy.\n  We hear all these government words, but I am going to talk today not \nonly as the Senator from Maryland standing up for my constituents, but \nalso as a professionally trained social worker. What is this? Well, a \nMedicaid case manager is either a social worker or a nurse who helps \nadults and children with very complicated problems. Children in foster \ncare and children with disabilities get the medical and social services \nthey need to be able to have a quality of life to be independent. But \nwhat does that mean in real terms? Well, let me give you an example.\n  I have a constituent in Baltimore, a 2-year-old, who was diagnosed \nwith a genetic disorder that leads to significant feeding problems. \nThis disease causes very severe problems and without help in early \nlife. So what does the case manager do? If the case is a very \ncomplicated medical situation, often the case manager is a nurse. If it \nrequires lots of complicated social intervention, it will be a social \nworker. First of all, the case manager gets in there and does a family \nassessment and works with the doctors, such as Johns Hopkins or the \nUniversity of Maryland, so we know what medical plan is in order for \nthis little child to have the ability to thrive. Then the case manager \nworks with the family, who is in acute distress, to make sure they know \nsomeone is on their side and helps them comply with the treatment plan.\n  Now, what might that be? Well, in the genetic disorder case, it will \nbe very specialized nutrition services. That is a lot of coordination \nto get the right people there to help that family. It will be also \nspeech and language and occupational therapy, so a lot of compliance to \nmake sure that child will be able to get what they need. Then, very \nimportant, psychosocial help because when a child has this type of \ndisorder, there are other very severe psychosocial problems that \nemerge. Then the case manager is working with the family to get the \nchild in the appropriate very specialized daycare. You can imagine the \nkind of supervision this is. This is tough, hands-on, gritty work.\n  Let's also take a look at when there is a child born with cerebral \npalsy. Again, you have a biomedical plan and the need to get the right \neducation for the child and also assistance for the family on how to do \nit, then a lot of nitty-gritty work. In this case, the\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\nchild would be evaluated, say, at the fantastic Kennedy-Krieger \nInstitute, where some of the best neurosurgeons and neuroscientists \nwill be working with them. But the case manager helps get the family a \nwheelchair, a ramp for the home, special education services, and \ncounseling for the parents because this is going to be a significant \nresponsibility for a long time.\n  Without case management, the whole thing falls apart. If you don't \nget the right services for the family in the home and the educational \nprograms, you will not have the follow through on the biomedical plan \nthat helps them remain independent or able to grow up.\n  Now, CMS says they do not want to pay for that. They say they have \nthe authority from the Deficit Reduction Act and they can just slash \nthese services from Medicaid funding. Well, in my State, this affects \n200,000 people. It means that over 1,400 social workers and nurses who \nhave devoted their life to helping these families will be impacted, and \nit means a Governor will have to pick up the bill. In my State, these \nservices cost $150 million, with 50 percent paid by the feds and the \nother 50 percent paid by the State.\n  CMS wants to eliminate the 50 percent, which means Maryland will lose \n$75 million. I know Senator Klobuchar will tell us equally horrific \nstories. Senator Coleman has spoken about this. We object to CMS. We \nobject to this rule. We want to delay the rule until sensible heads \nprevail.\n  We have 20 Senators who have cosponsored the bill that is the same as \nthis Amendment. They have names such as Cardin, Corker, Domenici, \nBingaman, Alexander, Voinovich, Brown, Snowe, Wyden, Sanders, Kennedy--\nthe list goes on. Thirty States would be so affected they have taken it \nupon themselves to write directly to CSM.\n  I must say to the distinguished chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, this also affects his State of North Dakota. It affects \nseverely handicapped Native American children.\n  This is not about who is your favorite bean counter at OMB or how can \nwe control runaway Medicaid costs; it is how do we in this country make \nsure our constituents and our people get the services they need to be \nable to have an independent life. I believe we can give help to those \nwho are practicing self-help. For those families who are out there \nstruggling to make sure a loved one with a handicap, a child, or an \nadult is able to remain independent, they need a government on their \nside.\n  So my amendment will delay the implementation. It is not my \namendment, it is our amendment. It is a bipartisan amendment. I say to \nmy colleagues from the other side of the aisle, let's be those \ncompassionate conservatives whom you once talked about. Join with us. \nLet's do this.\n  At the appropriate time, I will call up this amendment officially, \nand I will ask for a vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of \namendment No. 4023. This is the amendment my friend, Senator Mikulski, \njust spoke about. It is a bipartisan amendment. Cosponsors are myself, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Coleman, and many other Senators from across \nthis country.\n  This amendment would stop the administration from making drastic \nchanges to its targeted case management system that would hurt those in \nour country who are most in need of assistance.\n  Targeted case management benefits children in foster care, kids and \nadults battling mental illness, and seniors and disabled people \nreceiving institutional care. It exists to help those individuals to \nnavigate the complicated web of available services, to help these men, \nwomen, and children overcome bureaucratic barriers in order to achieve \nindependence. These services include transporting people with \ndisabilities to and from doctor's appointments as well as managing \npharmacy services for individuals with severe mental illness. These \nessential services are now threatened by a proposed rule change from \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n  For 8 years, I served as the chief prosecutor and top lawyer for \nMinnesota's largest county, serving Minneapolis and 45 suburban \ncommunities, with a population of over 1 million people. In that role, \nI worked closely with our county child protection and adult protection \nagencies, with our hospital, which was the biggest emergency hospital \nin the State of Minnesota. So I saw firsthand what would happen if we \ndid not prevent people from getting in trouble, what would happen when \nthey would end up at the emergency room or when they would end up in \nthe jail because they were not getting the necessary mental health care \nthey needed. I know firsthand the vulnerability of these individuals, \nyoung and old, and the responsibility of Government to help them \nachieve as much independence, well-being, and dignity as possible.\n  When Congress passed the Deficit Reduction Act in 2005, it clarified \nexactly what services are eligible for payment under the Targeted Case \nManagement Program. Senator Mikulski went through those important \nservices.\n  Unfortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has \nsince come up with a rule that goes miles and miles beyond what \nCongress intended. That rule is scheduled to be implemented next month. \nThis impending rule will have a devastating fiscal impact on States and \nlocal communities. It will endanger the well-being of vulnerable people \nwho benefit the most from these crucial services.\n  Our States received over $2 billion in funding for targeted case \nmanagement in 2005. If this rule is put into effect, that funding will \nbe slashed in 2008.\n  I want to use one example; it is from a county in my State, Dakota \nCounty. Now, this is not exactly a sort of wild-eyed county; it tends \nto be a more conservative county in our State. But, like any other \ncounty in our State, they have needs for case management services for \npeople who are mentally ill, seniors, young kids who need help. This \ncounty has made a practice of developing a cost-effective, community-\nbased system of services that relies heavily on case management. Why \ndid they do it? Well, they did it to save money.\n\n  Medicaid funding has been key to developing service alternatives in \nhomes and in less expensive settings than in institutional settings. \nThis is the kind of innovative, cost-effective approach we want to \nencourage from Government. Instead, with this sudden rule change, they \nare being punished. Even worse, the vulnerable individuals they serve \nare being punished.\n  I always believed this was a country where we wrapped our arms around \nthe people who need the help. That is what America is about. That is \nwhat patriotism is about. But with this rule slash-and-burn of all \nthese services, they are not wrapping their arms around these people, \nthey are rejecting them for Dakota County, this suburban county in \nMinnesota.\n  For States such as California, Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, New \nYork, and North Dakota, pulling the plug on targeted case management \nwill disrupt the lives of those served by these cost-effective efforts. \nFurthermore, in the end, it will just increase the total costs borne by \nState, local and Federal governments, which means all of us as \ntaxpayers also pay more. It simply defies common sense.\n  Our amendment will postpone the Center for Medicaid and Medicare \nServices' rulemaking by 1 year. We need a year to examine exactly how \nbadly this will hurt our States and local governments, especially the \nchildren, the disabled, and the seniors who need these services most.\n  I occupy the Senate seat once held by Hubert Humphrey. Some of my \ncolleagues had the great privilege of serving in the Senate with him. \nHubert Humphrey was someone who, of course, was never at a loss for \nwords. Many of those words were memorable.\n  There is one statement in particular that I believe is very \nappropriate for this topic. Senator Humphrey once said this:\n\n       The moral test of Government is how that Government treats \n     those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who \n     are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are \n     in the shadow of life, the needy, the sick, and the disabled.\n\n  I submit that this hasty, ill-considered action to cut essential \nservices for the most vulnerable people fails that moral test of \ngovernment. I believe we can and we must do better. That is why\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\nI strongly support our bipartisan amendment, an amendment focused on \nsaving money in the long term by keeping people in settings that \nactually save taxpayers money, by not slashing funds to the most \nvulnerable in our society. That is why we support this amendment, and \nwe ask our colleagues to vote with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree DeMint amendment to the \nSenator's amendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3894 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if it is in order, I will withdraw my \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I now call up amendment 4023.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] for herself, Mr. \n     Coleman, and Ms. Klobuchar, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4023 to amendment No. 3899.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask for a vote at an appropriate time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if there were ever a time and a piece of \nlegislation where we should try to help the people whom this \nlegislation is directed to help, it is this--Native Americans Indians. \nBut that is not the case. For reasons I do not comprehend, we are not \nable to legislate on this most vital piece of legislation to an \nunderclass in America that we created--Native Americans.\n  There is--I knew it--a stall going on in regard to this legislation. \nI understood the direction of the minority on FISA legislation. They \nwanted to stall it at the last minute so that the House would have no \ntime to work on it. They accomplished that. But why on this? Why now, \nwhen we can legislate to try to help a group of people who badly need \nhelp? And the place they need help more than any other place is their \nability to be taken care of when they are sick and injured.\n  Look what has happened in the State of Nevada. We used to have \nhospitals for Native Americans in Nevada. They are gone. They have been \ntaken away over the years. The health care for Native Americans in \nNevada is extremely limited. They are not served well.\n  We have an obligation--an obligation as a country--to help these \npeople. This is our opportunity, after years, to legislate in that \nregard, and we are not going to do it. I am saddened to hear about \nthis. I am saddened that the Republican minority is even filibustering \nIndians. What is this place coming to? Why are they doing this? There \nis no reason we cannot legislate here, offer amendments dealing with \nNative Americans. But that is where we are. I am very disappointed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Indian \nhealth care package being put together by Senator Dorgan. As Senator \nReid indicated, these are a group of people who have been the most \nneglected in our country, and it is imperative we move rapidly to \naddress longstanding concerns.\n  I have an amendment pending to provide $800 million in emergency \nfunding for the LIHEAP program. The reason I am offering this amendment \nis simple and obvious. At a time when home heating fuel is \nskyrocketing, millions of senior citizens on fixed incomes, millions of \nlow-income families with kids, and persons with disabilities are \ndesperately trying to keep their homes\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\nwarm this winter. Without this additional source of immediate funding, \nthere is a major risk that old people and lower income people all over \nAmerica will go cold. In the richest country on the face of the Earth, \nwe have a moral responsibility not to allow that.\n  Over the past week, as everybody knows, in many parts of America, \ntemperatures have been going well below zero. In my State of Vermont, \nin Lincoln, VT, was 21 below zero. In Nome, AK, the high temperature \nwas 15 below; Grand Forks, ND, 12 below zero; Eureka, SD, 3 below zero. \nOn and on all across the country, temperatures are getting cold. The \ncost of home heating oil is outrageously high. LIHEAP funding is being \ndepleted. People are unable to afford to keep their homes warm. That, \nin a nutshell, is what we are discussing.\n  The amendment I am offering has been endorsed by many organizations \nand many Members of the Senate. Some of the endorsees include the \nNational Governors Association, the AARP, the National Conference of \nState Legislatures, many others. Let me briefly excerpt from a letter I \nreceived from the National Governors Association in support of the \namendment:\n\n       Additional funding distributed equitably under this \n     amendment will support critically needed heating and cooling \n     assistance to millions of our most vulnerable, including the \n     elderly, disabled, and families that often have to choose \n     between paying their heating or cooling bills and food, \n     medicine and other essential needs.\n\n  That is from the National Governors Association. The AARP also has \ncome out in support of the amendment, indicating that some of the most \nsignificant victims of what happens when it becomes cold are senior \ncitizens who suffer from hypothermia. They are very much in support of \nthis amendment, and we thank them for their support.\n  This bipartisan amendment is also cosponsored by many of my \ncolleagues, including: Senators Clinton, Obama, Snowe, Collins, Leahy, \nSununu, Kennedy, Gordon Smith, Coleman, Kerry, Stabenow, Schumer, \nLautenberg, Lincoln, Klobuchar, Murray, Cantwell, Menendez, Durbin, and \nWhitehouse. I thank them.\n  Yesterday, Senator Gregg offered a second-degree amendment to my \namendment. In my view, his amendment is a poison pill which, if passed, \nwould either kill or slow down all our efforts to increase emergency \nfunding for LIHEAP. The Gregg amendment would pay for the $800 million \nincrease in LIHEAP by cutting overall discretionary nondefense spending \nby about .2 of 1 percent. I am opposed to the Gregg amendment for a \nnumber of reasons. First, it is an extremely irresponsible way to do \nbudgeting. There are some agencies that need to be cut a lot more than \n.2 of 1 percent. And there are, in fact, programs and agencies that \nneed significantly more funding. An across-the-board cut, regardless of \nthe needs of a program or agency, is irresponsible.\n  Secondly, Senator Gregg excludes from his cuts the department that \nreceives over half the discretionary funding, and that is the \nDepartment of Defense. If Senator Gregg thinks all of the $500 billion-\nplus that goes to the Department of Defense is well spent and well \naccounted for, he is mistaken. You cannot exclude the largest recipient \nof discretionary funding from examination.\n  In the real world, what would be the impact of the Gregg amendment if \nit were to pass? I know that .2 of 1 percent may not seem like a lot of \nmoney at first blush, but let's take a look at what this cut would \nmean. It would mean a $54 million cut for veterans medical care, and \noverall veterans funding would be reduced by $86 million. I don't think \nany Member of the Senate supports that. While we are trying to fight \nand come up with an understanding of various cancers, Alzheimer's \ndisease, Parkinson's disease, the National Institutes of Health would \nbe cut by over $58 million by the Gregg amendment. The Gregg amendment \nwould cut special education by $22 million. People are paying higher \nand higher property taxes because this Congress, for many years, has \nnot kept the promise it made by adequately funding special education. \nThe Gregg amendment would cut funding for special ed by some $22 \nmillion. Head Start would be cut by $14 million. We are grossly \nunderfunding Head Start right now. We have a major early education \ncrisis from one end of America to the other. This would only make that \nproblem worse. The Gregg amendment would cut community health centers \nby over $4 million at a time when 47 million Americans have no health \ninsurance, creating a process by which even fewer Americans can access \nprimary health care. Homeland security would receive a cut of $70 \nmillion. Education would be cut by over $100 million.\n  I certainly share Senator Gregg's concerns about the national debt. I \nlook forward to working with him and other members of the Budget \nCommittee to discuss how we should reduce our $9.2 trillion national \ndebt, which increased by $3 trillion under President Bush. It is a real \nissue, one we have to get a handle on. But maybe we will discuss in the \nBudget Committee the absurdity of trying to eliminate the estate tax \nwhich would add $1 trillion to our national debt over 20 years by \ngiving tax breaks exclusively to the wealthiest .3 of 1 percent.\n  We are debating whether we should help senior citizens who are going \ncold this winter. But there are many, including the President, who say: \nNo problem, a trillion dollars in tax relief for the wealthiest .3 of 1 \npercent.\n  We should be discussing why we are providing other tax breaks to some \nof the wealthiest people in this country. Perhaps we can discuss the \nappropriateness of spending $12 billion a month on the war in Iraq, \nwith most of that sum being budgeted as emergency spending. It is not \nan emergency. We know what is going on. Yet we are not prepared to pay \nfor the war. We are leaving that cost to our kids and grandchildren. \nThat is emergency spending. We can pass that $12 billion a month. Yet \nthere are those who balk at spending $800 million on a real emergency, \nand that is keeping senior citizens and families all over America warm \nthis winter.\n  Providing a mere $800 million for LIHEAP would primarily benefit \nsenior citizens, families with children, and people with disabilities \nearning between $10 and $15,000 a year. At a time when gasoline and \nhome heating oil prices in the State of Vermont and throughout the \ncountry are well above $3 a gallon, we should not be forcing seniors \nand others to make a choice about whether they are going to buy the \nmedicine or food they need--hunger is increasing--or keep warm this \nwinter.\n  There is no great secret that the American people are increasingly \ndisenchanted with what is going on in Washington, whether in the White \nHouse or in Congress. They wonder what planet we are living on. They \nare struggling, millions, every single day to keep their heads above \nwater to pay for the food they need, to fill up their gas tanks in \norder to go to work, to keep warm in the winter. They wonder why we are \nnot responding to their needs. We have people here talking about more \ntax breaks for billionaires, when workers are losing their jobs.\n  Passing the Sanders amendment certainly is not going to solve all \nthose problems.\n  But maybe at a time when people are going cold and others know that \npeople are going cold, maybe--maybe--it will make the American people \nunderstand some of us are aware of the reality of American life as it \nexists in cities and towns all across this country, that maybe we know \nwhat is going on, and we are prepared to respond in a proper way.\n  Madam President, having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now resume the Gregg amendment No. 4022 and that it be modified \nto be a first-degree amendments and that the Senate then debate \nconcurrently amendments No. 3900 and No. 4022, as modified, with 40 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to each amendment, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled between Senator Sanders and \nSenator Gregg or their designees; that each amendment be subject to a \n60-affirmative vote threshold, and that if the amendment does not \nachieve that threshold, it be withdrawn; that if either amendment \nachieves 60 affirmative votes, then the amendment be agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the vote in relation \nto the Gregg amendment No. 4022, as modified, occur first in the \nsequence and\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\nthat there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to each vote; \nprovided further that no intervening amendment be in order to either \namendment; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Gregg amendment, to be followed by a \nvote in relation to the Sanders amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill object--I am certainly a supporter of LIHEAP, but I object at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I am kind of new to the Senate, but I \nwould ask my friend from Alaska or my friend from New Hampshire: Why? \nWhy the objection? If we are sympathetic to LIHEAP----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To the Senator from Vermont, it is not in \norder to propound questions to other Senators who do not have the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wonder why it would be that when we \nface a dire crisis all across this country, we cannot move forward \nvigorously in providing relief to seniors and low-income people who \nneed this help. I would love to have a response to that, Madam \nPresident.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, is the Senator yielding the floor?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I yield to my friend from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, obviously, I have an amendment which is \ncaught up in this effort. I would hope we could vote on it. I think it \nis the right approach that we fund LIHEAP but that we also pay for that \nfunding so we do not pass the bill for LIHEAP on to our children, so we \ndo not put ourselves in a position where we are paying today's energy \nbills with our children's dollars 10 years from now, plus interest.\n  But I understand, having heard the majority leader come to the floor \nearlier and say he did not want this bill filibustered or slowed down, \nthat this is sort of part of an exercise by the leaders of this bill on \nthis bill--because this is the Indian health bill--to try to, I guess, \nclear the table so amendments which are not directly relevant to Indian \nhealth do not end up slowing down this bill.\n  I do not think this decision can be laid at the feet of either party. \nIt appears it is a joint decision by the leadership of the committee of \njurisdiction on Indian health. That is why this proposal, which Senator \nSanders has laid out, which I am perfectly amenable to--and I would \nactually support the unanimous consent request that he propounded. It \nhas been objected to.\n  I understand an amendment from our side dealing with the fact that \nthe city of Berkeley has said the Marines there are unwelcome and has \noffered protesters a free parking site in front of the Marine \nrecruiting headquarters, with a megaphone to yell at the marines--men \nand woman who have served us in war in Iraq--that proposal, which would \nhave basically laid out the objection of the Senate to that despicable \nact by the city council in Berkeley relative to the treatment of our \nmarines, is also not going to probably be offered because there is an \nattempt to move this bill forward.\n  I guess I appreciate the fact that the Indian health bill is a good--\nI don't know if it is a good bill; I don't know enough about it, but it \nappears to be supported by both sides here, and they want to move it \nforward. It is unfortunate the LIHEAP issue, which I think should be \naddressed in the context I am proposing, which is that it be paid for, \nwill not be able to be addressed at this time. But I understand the \nsituation, and I understand why it has happened. But I do not think it \ncan be laid at the feet of either party.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, reclaiming my time, to the best of my \nknowledge, I heard the objection coming from the Republican side, not \nthe Democratic side.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if I may seek the floor, I think it is \npretty obvious what is happening. I want the Record to show that prior \nto the objection being made--it is not my fight--but as a practical \nmatter, the majority leader came to the floor and castigated the fact \nthat the bill was being slowed down by amendments, one of which would \nbe the LIHEAP amendment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, reclaiming my time, it is absolutely \nnot my intention, as I indicated to Senator Dorgan, to slow this down. \nThis is important legislation we want to pass. I would limit my time to \n20 minutes, to 10 minutes. I think most people here know what the issue \nis. I would like an up-or-down vote, and let's move on to Indian \nhealth.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if the Senator is going to allow the bill \nto be open to LIHEAP, then I presume it should be open to all \nextraneous amendments. I suspect the amendment of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina relative to the city of Berkeley is an extraneous \namendment but one that is worth debating and should be discussed.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes, I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont yields to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, if I could further explain, first of all, I \nappreciate that the Senator from Vermont has offered an amendment that \nis very important to his State. It is not germane to the Indian health \nbill. I also understand how both Senators from New Hampshire are \nsupportive of the LIHEAP approach. Whether it is paid for or not paid \nfor is another question. But the point is, that amendment is not \ngermane to the Indian health bill, and if there is a vote on the LIHEAP \namendment, the amendment of the Senator from Vermont, there will be \nrequests, I know, from this side of the aisle and perhaps other \nrequests to consider other nongermane amendments to the bill.\n\n  I think what the majority leader was saying is something that I \nsubscribe to on this side, which is that the Indian health bill is an \nimportant bill to get done. If we begin consideration of a lot of \nextraneous or nongermane amendments to the Indian health bill, it may \nwell jeopardize our ability to conclude work on the Indian health bill. \nThat is the only reason for the objection, and I hope the Senator can \nappreciate that.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reclaiming my time, Madam President, I would ask my \nfriend from Arizona--and I understand that. We want to move to the \nIndian health bill. There is a real solution to that in the real world \nif we are serious; that is, limiting the amount of time and reaching a \nunanimous consent agreement about a few amendments that might be \noffered so we can vote on them and move on to Indian health.\n  Would the Senator from Arizona be prepared to do that?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would be happy to respond to the Senator \nfrom Vermont but in this way: There are people on my side of the aisle \nwho have already attempted to propound nongermane amendments that they \nwould like to have a time agreement on as well. I suspect that before \nwe begin to get into that kind of a negotiation, the leaders will want \nto consider what that is going to be doing to the time schedule for the \nbill, and the managers of bill are going to want to do the same because \nwe would like to try to conclude the bill as soon as we can; and that \nwill open up a process that could delay matters.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reclaiming my time, Madam President, I think, again, we \nwant to move and pass, I hope, the Indian health bill. But I think if \nwe are honest--obviously, if people want to bring up 30 amendments, \nthat would kill the Indian health bill, but if that is not the desire, \nif there are very few amendments and leadership can agree on a time \nlimit on them, we can move forward on some serious amendments, have \nvotes, and pass--at least vote on--the Indian health bill.\n  Again, I ask my friend from Arizona if that is something he would \nentertain. It does mean that not everybody can offer every amendment \nthey want. There would have to be a limitation and a time limitation.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will respond again to the Senator from \nVermont: There are nongermane amendments--at least one of which has \nalready been brought up--that I doubt the leaders and certainly the \nmanagers of the bill would like to see embroiled\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\ninto the Indian health care debate. Once the process begins, it is hard \nto control it. So it is not as simple as asking, would I be agreeable \nto a time agreement on perhaps the amendment of the Senator from \nVermont and the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina--because \nthat would undoubtedly get brought into this. But there may be others \nas well.\n  So it is not a question we can answer when one cannot see where the \nend of it might be. I think that is the concern we have with beginning \nthis kind of process. But I suggest that the Senator from Vermont \ncontinue to consult with his leader, with the managers of the bill, and \nsee if we can move the process forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is more than a little frustrating. We \nhave been here for 3 hours this morning. We have amendments on this \nbill dealing with Indian health care. We have nongermane amendments \nthat have been offered: Medicare, LIHEAP, earmarks for Berkeley, \nabortion.\n  This is a very serious issue. We have people dying in this country \nwith respect to this health care question about American Indians. I \nspoke earlier this morning that the U.S. Government has a \nresponsibility for health care for Indians. If you ask the question: \nWhy? Because we signed up for it. We signed the treaties. We said: We \npromise, and we have a trust responsibility for it.\n  So we spend twice as much money to provide health care to Federal \nprisoners as we do for American Indians. We are not meeting the needs. \nWe have people dying. So it takes 10 years to get a bill to the floor \nof the Senate--10 years to get a bill to the floor--to try to improve \nhealth care for Indians, and we get here, and we have unending \nappetites for amendments that have nothing to do with Indian health.\n  Look, I support low-income energy assistance. I support that. I \nsupport a lot of these issues. Many of them have nothing to do with \nIndian health. We are just trying to get a bill passed here.\n  Let me describe something I heard about a month ago to describe the \nurgency. I was at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota. \nIt straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The husband of \nHarriet Archambault came to a meeting I had--a listening session on \nIndian health care--and he described his wife Harriet and her battle to \ntry to deal with this health care dilemma. They lived nearly 20 miles \nfrom a clinic in South Dakota. It was an Indian health care clinic. She \nwould get up in the morning and drive 18 miles to the clinic because \nthat clinic can take only 10 people in the morning and 10 people in the \nafternoon. So five times, she got up in the morning to drive to that \nclinic. All five times she got there, there were 10 people ahead of \nher.\n\n  Her medicine ran out on October 25, 2007, her husband said. Five \ntimes for the next month, she got up and drove to that clinic. She \ncould not stay there, because she was also a day care provider for her \ngrandchildren. So this woman went, tried to sign up, but there were 10 \npeople ahead of her--that is all they would take--and she had to go \nhome.\n  Five times she did that in a month. A month later, she died. Her \nmedicine ran out October 25. She died November 25. She had called her \nsister about 3 weeks before, and she said: ``What do I have to do here \nto get the medicine I need? Die?'' Well, she did die because she could \nnot get service in this Indian health system.\n  The fact is, people are dying. All we are asking is that we maybe \nhave somebody come over and offer an amendment on Indian health care \nand start a debate on these amendments. If we have people who have \nthese amendments, come over and offer them. We have some that are \nfiled. Let's have some votes and try to get through this piece of \nlegislation.\n  This is the third day we are on the floor of the Senate with this \nbill. I said earlier, it has taken 10 years to get here. Every single \nyear we have worked on this. Senator McCain, who was chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, worked on it with me--Senator Murkowski. We \nwork on it and never get it to the floor. We finally get it to the \nfloor of the Senate, and this is like a root canal, except a root canal \nhurts less, because at least you are accomplishing something.\n  Here we come to the floor of the Senate, and we cannot get amendments \nup. We cannot get amendments voted on. So my hope would be we can find \na way to move through this legislation.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I thank my friend from North Dakota.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3900 Withdrawn\n\n  Madam President, I ask for the regular order with respect to the \nSanders amendment No. 3900.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota yield for \nthat purpose?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I yield for that purpose. I believe I \nunderstand what the Senator from Vermont is doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, given the objection, I withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me say to the Senator from Vermont, \nI understand his passion. He knows I have a lot of passion about this \nbill, and I have expressed it this morning. I understand his passion \nabout LIHEAP. Somebody from Vermont does not have to tell somebody from \nNorth Dakota about cold weather. I know about cold weather and my \nconstituents do. LIHEAP is unbelievably important, and we need to find \na way to get the money out for LIHEAP. I understand that. I am very \nsorry he was unable to get the yeas and nays and so on. But he also \nunderstands you have to try to offer amendments where you can to \nauthorization bills. I understand that. He is a supporter of this bill, \nthe underlying Indian health care bill we need to get done. It is also \nthe case, I am sure, that the Senator from Alaska knows a little about \ncold weather. I have been to Alaska. So my hope is that working \ntogether in this Chamber we will fund the LIHEAP program, because it is \nvery important. That also can be life or death for people, so my hope \nis we can get that done.\n\n  But having said all of that, again let me say we have a managers' \npackage that perfects--after having negotiated now for several weeks on \nabout five or six very controversial issues, we have negotiated in a \nway that we have reached a compromise on all of them, satisfactory to \nall of the parties. We now have that in a managers' package which we \nintend to offer next. It has not yet cleared. It has been a couple of \nhours since we have been able to clear that. My hope is that in the \nnext 30 minutes or so we can clear that so at least we can get the \nmanagers' package done.\n  I believe Senator Coburn will be here. He has some amendments filed. \nI hope he will be here to call up amendments which I believe he will do \nreasonably soon, and I think Senator Tester wishes to speak on the bill \ngenerally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3906 to Amendment No. 3899\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up amendment No. 3906. This is the \namendment of Senator Martinez of Florida. I ask that it be made the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Martinez, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3906.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n (Purpose: To amend titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide increased civil and criminal penalties for acts involving fraud \nand abuse under the Medicare program and to increase the amount of the \n    surety bond required for suppliers of durable medical equipment)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Madam President, we understand that Senator Martinez \nwill come to the floor to speak to this amendment that relates to civil \nand criminal penalties for Medicare fraud, but I did want to get that \nrolling.\n  I understand Senator Tester has some comments he wishes to make at \nthis time regarding the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank the ranking member of the \ncommittee.\n  Today I rise in strong support of the Indian health care program. The \nreason this bill is on the floor right now is due to the hard work of \nour chairman and ranking member which has been exhibited here in the \nlast few minutes. They know how important this bill is. I express my \nappreciation to Senator Dorgan and Senator Murkowski for all of their \nhard work.\n  Since arriving in Washington a little more than a year ago, I have \nbeen meeting with leaders throughout Indian country, and one aspect is \nclear: The challenges that face Indian country are large. I tell tribal \nleaders that despite all of the good intentions, there is no way \nCongress can solve all of their problems this year.\n  As I began my tenure on the Indian Affairs Committee, I asked my \nfriends in Indian country to share with me their top priorities. I have \nmet with representatives and leaders from each of the seven \nreservations in Montana multiple times, and every time they point out \nto me that the most important issue is health care or the lack of it.\n  Why is it such a priority? Let's consider a few examples.\n  Now 5 years old, a small girl from the Crow tribe was diagnosed with \na rare form of cancer in her eye. The condition required that her right \neye be surgically removed. When doctors originally removed it in \nOctober of 2001, they fitted her with a prosthetic eye with the \nunderstanding that every few years, she would need a new prosthesis as \nshe grew. Because doctors had already taken her eye, and because the \nwrong size prosthetic eye wouldn't immediately threaten her life when \nshe needed a new eye, her case failed to meet medical priority criteria \nfor contract Indian Health Services, which is life or limb. Her family \nwas left with two options: She goes without the new prosthesis, leading \nto permanent disfigurement or raise $3,000, which is not an easy task \nfor a struggling family on Montana's economically depressed \nreservations.\n  Here is another example of the critical needs of the Indian health \ncare system. A 35-year-old Montana woman was diagnosed with a heart \ncondition that led to dramatic heart failure. Her heart lost its \nability to pump blood adequately and she could hardly move without \nbecoming short of breath. She needed a new heart. She was referred to \nthe Mayo Clinic where she received special cardiology care and was put \non a list for a heart transplant. Thanks to close monitoring and the \nuse of many medications and a permanent pacemaker, her condition \nstabilized and her ability to function improved a bit. However, due to \nlack of funding in the Indian Health Service, her ongoing visits with \nthe cardiologist, not to mention the heart transplant, were no longer \ncovered. Without this followup, her prospects for survival are grim.\n  I could go on and on. There are thousands of examples of how the \nIndian health care system has failed.\n  After I asked tribal folks about their priorities, I asked what we \ncan do in the Senate to improve Indian health care. The response is \nunanimous and overwhelming. They tell me to start with the \nreauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and do it \nnow.\n  This reauthorization is long overdue. The last comprehensive \nauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act was 16 years \nago, in 1992. The disparity in the quality of health care provided to \nNative Americans is real, and it is disturbing. The Indian Health \nService, or IHS, reports that members of the 560 federally recognized \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native tribes and their descendants are \neligible for IHS services. This agency, within the Department of Health \nand Human Services, is supposed to provide comprehensive health care \nfor approximately 1.8 million of the Nation's estimated 3.3 million \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. Its annual appropriation is $3 \nbillion--$3 billion. Keep that number in mind as we consider the facts:\n  Approximately 55 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives \nliving in the United States rely on IHS to provide access to health \nservices in 49 hospitals and nearly 600 other facilities. American \nIndians and Alaska Natives die at higher rates from a myriad of things \nmore than regular Americans do: tuberculosis, 600 percent higher; \ndiabetes, nearly 200 percent higher; and the list goes on and on and \non.\n  American Indians and Alaska Natives born today have a life expectancy \nthat is lower than all other races in the\n\n[[Page S1015]]\n\nUnited States. This lower life expectancy is due, in part, to the \ndisproportionate disease burden that exists in Indian country.\n  It is suggested that the IHS-appropriated funding provides 55 percent \nof the necessary Federal funding to assure mainstream personal health \ncare services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Let me repeat \nthat: IHS provides only 55 percent of the funding necessary to meet the \nhealth care needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in that IHS \nsystem. So now you can see why passing this bill is so critically \nimportant to improving health care in Indian country.\n\n  This legislation will help the Indian Health Service facilities \nbecome up to date. It will create programs to address behavioral and \nmental health issues that have been severely neglected. It will begin \nto address the disturbing disparities between the health status of \nAmerican Indians and the general U.S. population. This legislation \nauthorizes appropriations necessary to increase the availability of \nhealth care, develop new approaches to health care delivery, improve \nthe flexibility of the Indian health care service, and promote the \nsovereignty of American Indian tribes.\n  Now we must start funding Indian health care at levels authorized in \nthis bill. Don't think that failing to adequately fund Indian health \ncare is a budget savings. Without proper funding of this program, the \ncost will shift to our emergency rooms and our already overburdened \nhospitals. Make no mistake about it, we will all pay for the health \ncare of our citizens, but we will pay a premium if we choose not to do \nthe right thing today and fully fund this program.\n  There is another reason why we need to pass this bill. The Federal \nGovernment has a trust responsibility to Native American Indians, a \nlegally binding trust responsibility. As many in this body know, this \nbill has made it to the Senate floor in previous years and failed. The \nmanagers of this bill this year have addressed a few remaining concerns \nand we have another chance to pass it today. The bill before us is not \nperfect, but it represents a good compromise bill. At the end of the \nday, this legislation represents an historic opportunity to make an \nincredible difference in the lives of Americans who need it most.\n  This problem will not go away without our action. The longer we wait, \nthe worse the problem becomes. The longer we wait, the more expensive \nthe problem becomes. By passing this important bill, we take a critical \nstep toward improving Indian health care and thus fulfilling our trust \nresponsibility to American Indians.\n  I hope this bill passes and passes quickly today. I hope it doesn't \nget bogged down in amendments that are important but have no connection \nto Indian health care. I ask my comrades here in the Senate to vote yes \nfor this critical legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3906, As Modified\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to send to \nthe desk a modification to Martinez amendment No. 3906.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I come to the floor to express grave \nconcern at reports that I hear out of the House of Representatives that \nthey intend to adjourn and basically go on vacation for the next week \nor so without taking action on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct reauthorization. That, of course, is the legislation we passed out \nof the Senate that provides the eyes and the ears for the intelligence \ncommunity in the United States to detect and to deter future terrorist \nattacks against the United States.\n  To me, it is unthinkable that the House of Representatives would \nadjourn and be so irresponsible as to leave this unfinished business \nundone and to leave America unprotected against future terrorist \nattacks. I know there is an argument that existing surveillance could \nbe continued for up to a year. But what we are talking about is new \ncontacts, new information that the intelligence community gets that \nwould be impeded, impaired, and blocked by the failure of the House of \nRepresentatives to act on this critical piece of legislation that will \nexpire on February 15 unless they act today or tomorrow. So it is the \nheight of irresponsibility. I find myself questioning whether it could \npossibly be true that would happen.\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\n  Also, one important part of the Senate legislation was to provide \nprotection for the telecommunications carriers that may have cooperated \nwith the U.S. Government shortly after September 11, 2001, in providing \nthe means to listen in to al-Qaida and other foreign terrorists who \nwere plotting and planning attacks against the United States and its \ncitizens.\n  I think it is a terrible message from the House of Representatives, \nif they are not going to act in a way that provides protection for \nthose citizens, whether they be individual citizens or corporate \ncitizens, who are asked by their country to come to the aid of the \nAmerican people and provide the means to protect them from terrorist \nattacks. What kind of message does that send, that we are going to \nbasically leave them out twisting slowly in the wind and being left to \nthe litigation--some 40 different lawsuits that have been filed against \nthe telecommunications industry that may have cooperated with the \nFederal Government in protecting the American people. This is on a \nrequest at the highest levels, from the Commander in Chief, and upon a \ncertification by the chief law enforcement officer of the United \nStates, the Attorney General.\n  What they were being asked to do was entirely appropriate and within \nthe bounds of the law. But then, when the litigation ensues, to \nbasically leave them hanging out to dry would be wrong. The Senate \nwisely addressed that issue. But if the House adjourns without passing \nthe Senate version of the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, which includes protection for the telecommunications \nindustry that may have participated in this lawful exercise of our \npowers to protect our country, it would again be the height of \nirresponsibility and send the message that next time a citizen, whether \nit is a corporate or individual citizen, is asked to come to the aid of \ntheir country, you better think twice and consult your lawyers because \nyou are going to get sued and the Congress is not going to take \nappropriate measures to make sure those who helped protect the safety \nand security of the American public are protected.\n  Finally, I don't have the information in front of me right now, but \nthere are substantial news reports that indicate that a group of trial \nlawyers who stand to make considerable amounts of money in terms of \nlegal fees off this litigation are substantial contributors to Members \nof Congress. I hope the evidence does not develop that there are \ndecisions being made in the House of Representatives on the basis of \nthe interests of special interest groups such as trial lawyers who \nstand to gain financially from continuing this litigation that should \nbe brought to an end here and now.\n  I am here primarily to voice my grave concern that while the Senate \nhas acted responsibly--I know not everybody is happy with the outcome--\nto address this issue, if the House of Representatives leaves town and \nleaves this matter undone, the security of the American people is in \nperil, and it would be a tragedy indeed if something were to happen as \na result of our intelligence community being blind or deaf to the \ndangers that do work both within our shores and beyond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me say, I don't think anybody in the \nCongress, the Senate, or the House wishes our intelligence community to \nbe blind or deaf. Obviously, we have a process in this country with the \nFISA Court that allows emergency actions. The opportunity to be able to \nengage in surveillance and the appropriate surveillance to make sure we \nare listening to terrorists and all of those things are available.\n  There is a debate about how wide should the drift net be, that the \nadministration might want to gather almost every communication \neverywhere in the world and data mine to find out who is saying what. \nThat is an important conversation because it deals with the basic \nrights in our Constitution. I think there is no one in this Chamber or \nin the other who believes we want our intelligence community to be \nblind or deaf and to not have the opportunity to do the kind of \nsurveillance necessary to protect our country. That is very important \nto state.\n  Madam President, we are not in morning business, although we are \ndoing some morning business. We are on the piece of legislation that we \nreported out of the Indian Affairs Committee, dealing with Indian \nhealth care improvement. I have always been enormously proud to serve \nin this body. I am privileged and proud to serve. I have occasionally \ntold friends that the Senate is 100 bad habits--that includes myself, \nof course. We are not doing anything at the moment, I understand, \nbecause one Senator is downtown someplace, giving speeches, and the \ninstruction is that nothing is to be done while that Senator is gone. \nGood for that Senator, but I don't think this place ought to come to a \nstop because somebody decides they are going to be gone for 2 or 3 \nhours, so they want others to object to everything on their behalf. \nThat is, in my judgment, discourteous, and my hope is that the Senate \ncould do a little business today on something that is urgent. That is \nnot too much to ask for the Senate to perhaps consider legislation that \nis before it. We are now on the third day of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act, a very urgent and serious matter. This is the third \nday. We have been here for over 3 hours today, and we have had \namendments on all kinds of issues, except issues that deal with this \nlegislation.\n  Even just attempting to offer the managers' package, which has been \nnegotiated over the last month or so, in which we successfully \nnegotiated on about five or six very controversial issues--we \nnegotiated an agreement between the sides, and even being able to offer \nthat at this point is denied because someone who is not even on the \nHill told their staff to tell others that the leadership cannot allow \nthis. It is unbelievable to me.\n  One might expect, perhaps, that today we can make progress on this \nlegislation. Everybody puts on a blue suit and shined shoes and comes \nto work, and one might expect we can get something done for a change. \nWe will have additional morning business, and we will see if those who \nhave left the Hill and want the entire world to stop and wait for their \nwhims will show up at some point and maybe we can consider some \namendments. I hope that will be the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate up to 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Rural Report Card\n\n  Mr. BROWN. This past week, President Bush submitted to Congress his \nlast budget for the Federal Government. It is a revealing document that \npretty clearly demonstrates the priorities of this administration. It \nused to be that budgets were designed to rein in the Federal deficit. \nUnder this administration, budget after budget has been submitted that \nwould, if enacted, widen the deficit.\n  We know 7 years ago, when President Bush took the oath of office in \nJanuary 2001, we had a huge Federal surplus. Today, we have a huge \nFederal deficit that will be a burden on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  While funding for programs to help middle-class families hard hit by \nstagnant wages would be slashed by the President's budget, he gives \nenormous tax cuts to people who don't need them--and generally didn't \nask for them--the wealthiest 1 percent of the population. They simply \ndon't need a tax cut.\n  In 2009, the President will give tax cuts of $51 billion to those \npeople making over $1 million a year--again, that is $51 billion for \nthose making over $1 million a year. Yet he is cutting $15 billion from \nmany of the programs that I am going to mention.\n  Perhaps most disconcerting are the President's cuts in Federal \nprograms that serve rural America. The President has failing grades on \nhis budget and what it does. He gets an F in health care, an F in \neducation, an F in law enforcement, and an F in economic development. \nWith faltering infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, disappearing \njobs, underfunded schools, and spotty access to health care, rural \nareas in Ohio, southeast Ohio--and\n\n[[Page S1017]]\n\nnorthwest Ohio especially--and across our Nation, these areas are \nfighting an uphill battle without anywhere near the Federal support \nthey used to get or that they need now.\n  More than one-half of Ohio's counties are rural as defined by the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture. Of the top 10 counties in Ohio--and \nthere are 88 counties--with the highest unemployment, every 1 of them \nis rural. Of the top 10 counties in Ohio with the highest proportion \nbelow the poverty line, 9 out of 10 are rural. Of the top 10 counties \nin Ohio with the highest percentage of residents eligible for Medicaid, \n9 are rural.\n  Seven rural Ohio counties make all three of these lists: Vinton Pike, \nScioto, Adams, Meigs, Jackson, and Morgan--all counties in southeast \nOhio. Citizens of this counties need our help, and they need it today.\n  Yesterday, I spoke with about two dozen officials and activists in \nthose counties in southern Ohio--people from the chamber of commerce, \nthe county commissioners, the mayors, health department directors, \ncommunity development people--and the stories they told about the \nPresident's failure on health care, education, law enforcement, and \neconomic development will be devastating and are devastating for \nsoutheast Ohio.\n  Despite the alarming statistics and the crucial role rural America \nplays in our Nation's self-sufficiency and in our cohesiveness and \nculture, the President chose to slash funding for rural economic \nprograms, slash funding in rural health care, in rural law enforcement, \nin rural education--all so that he could give a tax cut of $51 billion \nin 2009 to people making over $1 million a year and look what happens \nto health care, education, law enforcement, and economics development.\n\n  While communities in rural Ohio struggle to keep jobs, President Bush \nproposes to wipe away established rural development programs that these \npeople with whom I talked yesterday--Republicans and Democrats alike, \nconservatives and liberals alike, public health people, chamber of \ncommerce people, mayors, commissioners, community development people--\nthese programs matter to their well-being, to the economic vitality of \nthese rural areas. These housing programs, for instance, support the \nconstruction, purchase, and rehabilitation of single-family homes, \ngiving struggling rural Ohioans a chance to own their own homes. With \nall the problems we have with foreclosures, they are not just urban \nproblems, suburban problems, or rural problems; they are every year. \nBut the President takes special attention to wiping out rural programs \nthat can make a big difference in people's lives.\n  These programs encourage rural business expansion, job creation, and \ngrants to extend broadband access across Ohio.\n  These are critical programs that provide water and sewer \ninfrastructure. The EPA comes in and says to these communities: You \nneed major renovation--major replacement in some cases--of a lot of \nthese water and sewer systems, and then they simply do not help them do \nthat. It means higher sewer and water rates for unemployed people and \nhigher sewer and water rates for people struggling, middle-class \nfamilies who are proud and struggling to stay above water.\n  In places such as Vinton County in southeast Ohio, a third of the \npeople are on Medicaid. Medicaid is not a luxury; it is a crucial \nsupport system for children, the disabled, and the elderly living in \npoverty. Medicaid covers about one in every three nursing home \nresidents. What is to be become of seniors under the President's \nMedicaid cuts? Medicaid cuts: F in health care. What is to become of \nthe seniors without this successful insurance program? The President's \nbudget cuts $18.2 billion from Medicaid over 5 years. These cuts touted \nby the administration as ``savings'' will be primarily achieved by \nshifting costs to States, regardless of whether States can actually \nshoulder these costs. Again, these $18 billion cuts to Medicaid are to \npay for a tax cut for people making over $1 million a year.\n  The Bush budget slashes other programs designed to help rural \ncommunities address unique health care challenges. People who have to \ngo to the emergency room have to drive 30 minutes, 45 minutes. A lot of \npeople go to emergency rooms in southeast Ohio because they cannot \nafford any other care, and they go in hoping to get charity care. These \nare not people who are lazy. These are not people without a decent work \nethic. These are people who work hard, have jobs, are barely making it, \nthey go to food banks, in too many cases, they are on Medicaid, and \nthey have to rely on the Government because they are struggling, \nworking hard, working a couple of jobs, and simply cannot make it.\n  Rural Ohio is experiencing unprecedented challenges in law \nenforcement as meth labs multiply and threaten families and \ncommunities. Yet, since 2001, President Bush has cut funding for State \nand local law enforcement programs by over 50 percent. Law enforcement: \nThe President gets an F in rural Ohio for his budget. This year's \nbudget would slash funding 63 percent for all State and local law \nenforcement programs in the Department of Justice. That is $1.6 \nbillion, again, so the President can give tax cuts to people making \nover $1 million a year.\n  The budget also eliminates funding for the COPS Program. Talk to \npeople in Windham, Athens, Gallipolis, Chillicothe or Blair, \ncommunities that need the COPS Program to keep these communities safe. \nIt is a program that has worked for 10 years. So the President wants to \neliminate it so he can give tax breaks to people making over $1 \nmillion.\n  I sound like a broken record, but it is morally outrageous to do tax \ncuts for people making over $1 million a year and then earn an F on \nhealth care, F on education, F on law enforcement, and F on economic \ndevelopment for these struggling communities, the same kind of rural \nareas in the Preside Officer's State of Missouri, rural areas where I \nknow she has spent a lot of time, rural areas where I have spent a lot \nof time, where people are struggling, trying to stay in the middle \nclass, trying to support their kids, and trying to just get along.\n  The President's proposal shortchanges overall education funding by \n$826 million. This budget would cut or eliminate programs to support \neducational opportunities for rural Ohio families, particularly \nprograms such as career and technical education, for elementary school \ncounseling, for Safe and Drug-Free Schools--the kinds of jobs many of \nthese people, young people in southeast Ohio, want to get--career \neducation, tech education, elementary school education. They want to \nteach, they want to be nurses, they want to be occupational therapists, \nthey want to be physical therapists. They want to work in their \ncommunities. They don't want to go off to big cities and leave home. \nThey want to raise their children where their parents are so their \nparents can see their grandchildren. And they need jobs in Chillicothe, \nin Zanesville, in Cambridge, and all over southern Ohio.\n  Our Nation's future depends on our actions now. We can either address \nbarriers to our children's success in education, we can address the \nissues of law enforcement, we can address the needs of health care, or \nwe can abdicate responsibility and watch our rural areas continue to \ndecline. If our rural areas decline--and we know the strength of our \nrural areas in building our country in the last 200 years--if they \ndecline in Missouri, Ohio, and around this country, it means our \ncountry declines, and we cannot stand for that.\n  As my State's first Senator to serve on the Agriculture Committee in \nfour decades and a member of the HELP Committee, which has jurisdiction \nover health and education programs, I will continue to fight to ensure \nthat our Nation invests in rural America. It is the smart thing to do \nfor our future. It is the right thing to do for our families.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I know my colleague, Senator Coburn, is here. He is going \nto offer an amendment. I should tell you how pleased I am. Senator \nCoburn indicated he would be here around 2 o'clock. He was good enough \nto come this morning at 9:30 and engage in discussion on this bill.\n  But we have discussion about virtually everything about the bill on \nthe floor of the Senate, Indian health care. The fact is we have had \nall kinds of amendments that have nothing to do with the bill. I hope \nwe can finally get this moving.\n  I had spoken this morning of some people whose experience with the \nIndian health care system and the lack of health care for American \nIndians has been devastating. Some people died as a result of not \nhaving access to adequate care that we would take for granted in our \ncountry.\n  Let me mention my colleague from Oklahoma is on the floor and is \ngoing to discuss one of his amendments. You know, we have a trust \nresponsibility. We have a responsibility to keep a promise we have made \nin treaty after treaty for Indian health care. I do not think there is \na disagreement on the floor of the Senate about that.\n  There is no disagreement that we have a responsibility, that \nresponsibility is in writing in all kinds of treaties. So we have made \nthe promise; we have not kept the promise.\n  Let me make one final point. There is no group of Americans who have \nserved this country in greater percentage of their population than \nAmerican Indians. You take a look at the percentage of veterans who \nhave served this country in wars and during peacetime, no population \nhas had a greater percentage of people who have gone to serve America \nthan American Indians.\n  I told my colleagues once previously about a Sunday morning in Fargo, \nND, at the veterans health care facility, veterans hospital, where a \nveteran named Edmond Young Eagle was dying of lung cancer. I did not \nknow it that day, but he would die 7 days later of lung cancer.\n  He was a man who lived on an Indian reservation. When called by his \ncountry, he served in Africa during the Second World War, at Normandy, \nthroughout Europe, served with great distinction.\n  He came back. He never had very much, lived a tough life, didn't have \nmany relatives. At the end of his life his sister asked if I could get \nhis medals he had earned but never received. I did. I took them on a \nSunday morning to the veterans hospital in Fargo, to this man who was \nin his mid- to late-seventies, a World War II veteran, had a tough \nlife, never had very much, was dying of lung cancer. We cranked up his \nhospital bed to a seated position. He was a very sick man but very well \naware of what was going on. I pinned a row of medals on his pajama top \nat the veterans hospital. The doctors and nurses from the hospital \npacked into his room. This proud man said to me, as I pinned his medals \non his pajama top: This is one of the proudest days of my life.\n  This is a man who had a difficult time in life. He never had very \nmuch but served his country when asked in Africa, in Europe, fought for \nhis country. Many years later, just prior to his death, he was \nrecognized by his country, as I told him: A country that is grateful \nfor your service. There are so many who have provided so much service \nfrom Indian reservations, from Indian nations.\n  We have made a solemn pledge to the Indians--we signed it into \ntreaties; we have it as a trust responsibility--we will provide for \nyour health care.\n  As my colleague from Oklahoma said this morning, take a look at \nMedicare, Federal prisons, Indian health, a whole range of things. Just \nto take Federal prisons as an example, we spend twice as much per \nperson providing health care for prisoners as we do meeting our \nresponsibility to provide health care for American Indians. That is a \ndisgrace. It has to change.\n  I can't tell you how pleased I am to see my colleague from Oklahoma \nbecause we have had so many amendments that have so little to do with \nthe underlying bill. I know my colleagues have offered a number of \namendments that deal directly with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, every amendment I have has something to do \nwith this bill. They are all germane, not meant to delay. I am happy to \nvote for cloture right now to prove that I don't want to delay this \nbill. What I am going to ask is unanimous consent for the regular order \nand discuss my amendment No. 4034, after which I will ask for a vote. \nThen if the leadership wants to stack votes, I am fine with that.\n  This is a simple amendment. I know the chairman is critical of it \nbecause he thinks it is false in terms of its intent. During our budget \ndebate, I plan on adding $2 billion to Indian health care. I also plan \non making us make the tough decisions on where we take it from. We \ndon't have extra money, so it is about priorities, about keeping \ncommitments. I will be offering that when we get to the budget to make \nsure there is an extra $2 billion for Native American care, and then we \nwill decide whether we think that is a priority as we vote on the \nbudget and on the appropriations bills.\n  This is a straightforward amendment. This allows tribal members to \nget insurance. If they want to use the IHS service, great. But if they \nhave to wait in line to wait in line to get care, maybe they can go \nsomewhere else. Then we are keeping our commitment. If they know that \nthe care for a certain type of disease is terrible at IHS, they can go \nwhere it is better. We are going to put the security of our promise in \nreal terms, and we are going to put choice, the same thing every Member \nof this body has, and security in health care, into the hands of the \nNative Americans. That is what the amendment does. The reason it \ndoesn't cost anything is because we are going to charge IHS for what it \ncosts. We have designed the amendment. We are waiting to see what the \nbudget chairman does with the budget and where we are going to find \nthis $2 billion. But I promise you, we are going to get a chance to \nvote on my amendment to put in $2 billion. So it is not an empty \npromise.\n  One of the things we know that improves everything is competition. \nOne of the ways to get rid of some of the waste that is in IHS and to \nput a priority back in is to start competing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is an authorization bill. The Senator is amending \nit. Does his amendment anticipate an increase by $2 billion for the \nauthorized level because we are authorizing expenditures? The Senator \nwill perhaps offer a $2 billion appropriations measure. I will as well. \nI hope we will be able to work together on that. But we will also have \nto increase the authorization. Does the amendment increase the \nauthorization?\n  Mr. COBURN. It does not at this time. I will give a commitment to the \nchairman. Under our rules, when I want to take money away from \nsomething else, I have to deauthorize it. We don't have enough money in \nIndian health so we have to deauthorize something else. If we get it \nunder the budget, I have every intention of making us make a choice. I \nwill vote for an increased authorization at this point in\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\ntime right now for $2 billion. But I will also come back and say we \nhave to find the money to pay for it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, why don't we do that, provide the \nauthorized room? The Senator this morning indicated--and I agreed--that \nwe are about $2 billion short of fully funding Indian health care. We \nhave full-scale rationing going on. The amendment has a restriction in \nit. He limits the amount of funding in his amendment to the amount of \nfunding that currently exists in Indian health. The President has just \nproposed a reduction in funding, even though we are only meeting 60 \npercent of current need. My question is, should we not then remove that \nrestriction and actually increase the authorization because he and I \nhave the same goal. Let's get the amount of money in the system that \nprovides health care for Indians that we have promised.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I will happily vote for that. But what we have to do is \ndeauthorize something else. I know you disagree with my thoughts on \nincreased authorizations versus offsets. I believe we have a \ncommitment. I believe we have a treaty obligation. I believe we have a \nmoral obligation. But I also believe it has to be balanced with the \nobligation that Members of Congress refuse to do, which is to make \njudgments about priorities. An empty promise to authorize that is not \noffsetting some authorization somewhere else without coming around and \ndoing it; tons of bills go through this place authorizing things so we \ncan send a signal out there that we did something, knowing that we \nnever intend to fund it.\n  Right now we have over $8 trillion a year in authorizations. It can't \nbe hard to find $2 billion to deauthorize to increase the authorization \nfor Indian health. We have to have a vote, and we have to decide what \nthat is.\n  I will commit to the chairman, I will vote for that, as long as we \nare decreasing somewhere else. I am willing to go find where that is \nfor the chairman. I will commit that I will offer an amendment to \nincrease the spending for this in our budget. I also will commit that \nwhen the appropriations come through, although I may not vote for the \nwhole appropriations bill because it is not going to just be for Indian \nhealth care, I will vote for amendments that will increase the amount \nof money that goes to Indian health care as long as it is within the \nbudget. That is why I said my goal is to do that within the budget \nwhere we could have a debate about priorities.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, one of the dilemmas in \nproviding Indian health care, not so much in the State of Oklahoma but \nin other areas where there are reservations, is in many cases the only \nhealth care that is available is the Indian Health Service clinic, and \nyou are 80 miles away from the nearest hospital. In many cases there \nwill never be competition in an area where someone is desperately sick \nand needs to see a doctor quickly. I happen to agree the underlying \nnotion of this amendment of providing a card to someone to say, take \nthis card to a health care facility and get that need fixed, if you \nmust--I happen to think that has merit. I will be working with the \nSenator on that with respect to the bolder approaches to Indian health \ncare. But on page 4, line 4, is where you have budget neutrality: In \nconducting the program under this section, the Secretary shall ensure \nthe aggregate payments made to carry out the program do not exceed the \namount of Federal expenditures which have been made available. That is \nsaying that we want to do all of this, which would expand contract care \nand so on but within the same amount of money that currently exists in \nIndian health care. It is kind of a chicken and egg.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to reclaim my time if I might. The fact is, \nwe appropriate $280 billion a year in stuff that is not authorized \nright now. So we will not have any problem appropriating this money if \nwe don't authorize it. A quarter of the discretionary budget is not \nauthorized right now. We will not have any problem with that. My \namendment says, on the areas the Senator just described, to do it only \nif it is geographically feasible. I recognize there are some places \nwhere we have isolated reservations and we have IHS. I am willing to \nput the money behind it, but I also realize more of the same doesn't \nget it done. So if we double Indian health care money, we are still \ngoing to have an inefficient system that will deliver care at a lower \nlevel than what you can get in the private sector.\n  What I am saying with my amendment is, let's have both. We ought to \ndo both. I am making a statement on the Senate floor--and the Senator \nwill recognize, I believe, that I usually keep my word about coming \nback and doing what I say I will do--I will work to get the extra $2 \nbillion, but an extra $2 billion in a broken system is not just money \nthat is broken with IHS. I believe the chairman will agree. What I \nwanted to do is fix the system and increase the money, increase the \nchoice and security that Native Americans are entitled to that all the \nrest of us have.\n  The fact is, if the only place a Native American can get care is IHS, \nthat is not freedom. That is not the promise kept in its fullest bloom. \nIt is saying, here is the only place you can get care. If the care \nhappens to be great, super. But if the care happens to be average and \nthey need better, they don't have that opportunity. If the care happens \nto be--and sometimes we know it is, like some of the cases the chairman \nhas presented--when it is substandard and that is the only choice they \nhave, that is not acceptable.\n  Let me finish my deal, and I will let you go and you can hammer me. I \nhope I can get you to come around. Maybe I would not get your vote. I \nknow I will get your commitment to work toward it in the future. But I \nthink just adding more money to IHS doesn't fix the problem. I \ndescribed that earlier when I talked about 30 or 45 minutes. What this \ndoes is, it treats Native Americans like every other American. That is \nwhat this amendment does. It gives them choice. It gets them out of the \nprison we have placed them in that says: You only have one place you \ncan go. And, by the way, if we run out of contract funds, even if you \nneed to go somewhere else, you can't go.\n  Contract funds actually have run out on average in June. So for 5 \nmonths of the year, when we need to send Native Americans somewhere \nelse, we don't have the money to do it. So who suffers?\n  Under this system, you would not run out of contract money because \nyou bought an insurance policy. You have given them the average cost of \nan individual insurance cost with what we are spending now on care.\n  By the way, I have another amendment where we describe what an Indian \nis because, in my State, we have people who are \\1/512\\th stepping in \nfront of a full blood. And most people don't think somebody that is \\5/\n11\\th out of \\5/12\\th ought to be getting full pay for their health \ncare. And in fact, there are .12 of 1 percent Native blood. We call \nthat light blood in Oklahoma. We have whole blood, mixed blood, and \nlight blood in our State. It actually is very complicated because what \nis happening now, we have tribes that have quantums and say: If you are \nnot a quarter or an eighth, you are not eligible. But under the IHS \nsystem, from some of the other tribes who have members who are \\1/\n512\\th, they come down to their area and they get into IHS. So here is \nsomebody with \\1/512\\th taking Indian dollars away from somebody who is \na quarter or somebody who is a full blood.\n  What we have said is: Tribes, you have to decide who is an Indian. We \nactually have some people who are a thousand and 24th that we are \ngiving full blown care to in Oklahoma. They have access to care \nsomewhere else, but they don't want to pay the deductible or the copay. \nSo they step in line in front of a full blood. We have to change that. \nWe have to fix that. We have to fix that because our obligation has to \nbe to the person with the most and then come down. So if we really have \nrestricted dollars, what we have to say is, if you are below a certain \nlevel, you have to contribute something. That is the other way that we \nsolve this problem. That doesn't demean the heritage of our Native \nAmericans.\n  What that says is, the reality is, in 2016 in this country, we are \ngoing to be cutting spending all over the place because that is the \nyear interest rises through the roof. That is the year we run out of \nSocial Security with which\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\nto pay for Medicare. That is the year in which for the projected \nspending, based on revenues, based on growth even at 4 percent, we \nstart running trillion-dollar deficits--trillion-dollar deficits.\n\n  Have we ever asked ourselves why gold is worth four times more \nagainst the American dollar than it was 10 years ago? Do you think it \nhas anything to do with people thinking we cannot pay back our debt?\n  So this idea that we are going to have more money in the future to do \nmore things is not going to be there. We need to come to the reality of \nthe situation. We need to start making some of the hard choices. To me, \nkeeping our commitment to Native Americans has to be set up now; \notherwise, it is not going to happen, and the funding is not going to \nget increased between now and 2016. Other than what we do this year, it \nis going to be hard. The money is going to be hard to get, even if we \nget out of Iraq.\n  We are going to get notice today on what I have been working on for 2 \nyears, talking to the Census Bureau about that they are going to be out \nof control and spend a whole lot more money. I am getting ready to get \nnotice by the Secretary of Commerce--I have a meeting with him this \nafternoon--that there is going to be a close to $3 billion more pickup \nto do something we have to do because it has been totally mismanaged--\ntotally mismanaged. We have been having hearings for 2\\1/2\\ years on \nit, where they have been denying it, and now they are coming to say it \nhas been mismanaged. They are coming to agree.\n  It is why oversight matters. Had we gotten some of the amendments \nthrough this body that we offered on the census, we would not be here. \nBut, instead, we are going to spend $2 billion to $3 billion more \nbecause we did not pass the amendments offered based on oversight that \nwe did in my committee.\n  The whole goal--I am not perfect. I am not right, necessarily, on how \nI want to do that. I will admit that to the chairman and ranking \nmember. But I know more money does not solve the problem on this, and \nunless we create real freedom, real choice, and real health care \nsecurity for Native Americans, we will never have an efficient IHS \nsystem, and we will never meet the commitments that we say we have.\n  So I will ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment. I will listen \nto the chairman. I do have a meeting at 2 o'clock I have to be at. \nWhenever the chairman would like to stack the votes, if we run others, \nI will be happy to work with whatever is his pleasure.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not currently pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4034\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask that amendment be brought up, No. 4034 be made \npending, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I inquire of the Chair, earlier this morning I made all \nmy amendments pending.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the regular order on amendment No. 4034.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for coming and \ndebating the amendment. I understand he has to leave.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma certainly is right, it is not more money \nnecessarily that is only going to solve the problem. But I guarantee \nyou that less money will not solve the problem. If we are 40 percent \nshort of money needed now, I guarantee you that the same amount of \nmoney will not solve the problem. The amendment he has offered has a \nprovision that says we are going to do something different, we are \ngoing to do something that is unique, and, by the way, you cannot spend \nany more money than you are now spending in a system that is already 40 \npercent short of money.\n  How can we have an amendment that restricts the amount of funding? \nWhen he says that--he started this morning by saying we are $2 billion \nshort. It is interesting, I do not necessarily disagree with the \nproposition of trying to find choices, providing an insurance card, or \nsome other mechanism by which we create some competition with the \nIndian Health Service. But this may be much better for Oklahoma than it \nmight be for other States.\n  If you have an Indian Health Service area where you are in an Indian \nreservation 80 miles from the nearest hospital, and the only health \ncare capability you have is to go to the Indian Health Service, well, \nyou know what, we better have adequate funding for that, at least \ncurrent funding for that. If you add another program on top of this for \nother Indians who can go somewhere else in a metropolitan area and be \nable to present a card, because they have now taken money out of the \nsystem and purchased their own insurance--you allow that to happen, \nthen the American Indian who is living on the reservation with the \ncurrent Indian Health Service clinic there has less money.\n  How does that work to help the folks who are stranded with no \ncompetition? It seems to me the way this is written, with a restriction \nthat says there cannot be any additional resources beyond that which \ncurrently exist--and, by the way, the President wants to cut that. We \nhave wide-scale health care rationing going on in this country, with \npeople dying because of it, and the President's budget cuts it.\n\n  My colleague says: I will support--quoting him--increased funding, \nincreased authorization. But the amendment he authors actually \nrestricts the amount of money available. In order to do something new, \nif you are going to restrict the amount of money available to what is \navailable now--if you are going to do something new--it is going to \ncome from some place. I will tell you where it is going to come from. \nIt is going to come from clinics out in those reservations where there \nis no choice.\n  There is only one opportunity for somebody who has broken an arm or \ndeveloped an illness or disease and needs to go someplace quickly to \nfind health care. They are going to go to the local Indian health \nclinic. This money is going to come out of their hide because this \namendment offered provides a restriction that no additional resources \ncan exist.\n  I do not denigrate the idea offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. But \nthis clearly is not something that would be helpful to a lot of \nAmerican Indians. In fact, I believe it would be hurtful to a lot of \nAmerican Indians who are the ones who have no choice--who have no \nchoice at all--but must try to get their emergency care and must try to \nget their basic health care met at those clinics.\n  I mentioned this morning a woman named Harriet Archambault whose \nhealth care was in McLaughlin, SD, in a satellite clinic of the Indian \nhealth care facility for the Standing Rock Tribe in Fort Yates, ND. \nThat was her health care: the McLaughlin, SD, satellite clinic. They \ncan handle 10 people in the morning and 10 people in the afternoon. \nThat is it. If you are not on the list of 10, that is it, and you \ncannot make a reservation. You come and you sign in.\n  Well, she came five times, drove 18 miles one way each time. Five \ntimes she came, and 5 times she was too late to be in the top 10. She \ncould not stay because she was taking care of her grandchildren. She \nwas the daycare provider for her grandchildren. Her medicine had run \nout for hypertension and high blood pressure in mid-October. Five times \nshe got up early in the morning to drive nearly 20 miles, and she did \nnot get there in time. There were 10 people on the list ahead of her. \nOne month later she died. She tried five times and never got there, in \na remote satellite location.\n  The fact is, people are dying. Children are dying. Elders are dying. \nThere is not nearly enough money to keep the promise this country made \nto American Indians. The amendment offered today is one I am very \ninterested in working with the Senator from Oklahoma on in a \nsignificant reform package in which we dramatically increase the \nresources to keep our promise, and then try to provide some competition \nand some choice. I am interesting in doing that, frankly.\n  I am not interested in passing an amendment that says, let's do this \nin a\n\n[[Page S1021]]\n\nway that restricts funding for others, which is what this amendment \ndoes. There is a specific restriction on funding, and that means there \nis going to be less funding for those clinics, including the satellite \nclinics. That is not something I am willing to entertain.\n  But, again, I appreciate finally getting an amendment offered. My \ncolleague indicated he will be back. I indicated earlier we are at \nparade rest because one of our colleagues apparently has an objection, \nthrough his staff, through leadership, and he is off, apparently, at a \nmeeting downtown, and has a speech, and he will be back sometime around \n3:30 maybe. But in the meantime, through his staff, we are told we are \nnot able to move on anything.\n  I have a managers' package that is agreed to, I believe, and I want \nto send it to the desk in a moment. My understanding is, we cannot move \nto embrace it despite the fact it would be a unanimous consent, because \none of our colleagues is downtown and will not be back for an hour and \na half. That will make him gone for 3 hours. In the meantime, we sit \nhere with our hands in our pockets trying to figure out how on Earth we \nexplain this is a body that is supposed to get something done.\n  I said this morning I have often called this place 100 bad habits, \ndespite the fact I feel enormously privileged to be here. I love the \nSenate. But I am not very happy about the way this place works today \nbecause we deal with an important issue that is life or death to some \npeople, and we are having a difficult time.\n  Senator Murkowski has worked on this bill with me for a long period \nof time. Before her, Senator McCain worked on this legislation. We are \nfinally on the floor of the Senate, and because of things that have \nnothing at all to do with this bill, we are standing here frozen \nbecause somebody is gone, apparently.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North Dakota, \nthis is a critically important bill for a lot of very vulnerable \npeople, Native Americans, who have not been treated well throughout our \nhistory. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership in \ntrying to bring this bill to the floor. But could I ask the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, how many days have we been on the bill on the floor \nof the Senate?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is this third day we have been on the \nfloor of the Senate. Our hope was this would be the day in which we \ncomplete action by late this afternoon. Obviously, it does not appear \nthat way.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is it my understanding that one Senator \nhas announced he is off for lunch and some meetings and would like to \nstop the Senate from any further consideration of this bill until he \ndecides to return? Is that the situation?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am told one of our colleagues, who is \nupset about something, has gone off to give a speech downtown at a \nmeeting and will not return for a while. His staff indicates we are not \nto move without his consent, and he won't provide consent until he \ncomes back, if then.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the Senate is at a halt at this point until the \nSenator's personal schedule accommodates his return?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, it sounds that way. But we will see. Again, it is \nvery frustrating. We have worked very hard to bring this legislation to \nthe floor of the Senate. I know a lot of people are counting on the \nCongress to do the right thing. My hope is we can move forward. I think \nwe have about four amendments we have cleared. We have a managers' \npackage that is cleared. We will get votes on the Coburn amendment, \nwhich is germane, right on target, on the bill. So there is no reason \nwe cannot move forward and get this piece of legislation done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like, through the Chair, to ask \nthe Senator from North Dakota, why don't we go ahead and move the \npackage then, and we can preserve the right of that Senator to offer \nhis amendment when he returns. That is preserving his right as a \nSenator if he wants to offer an amendment. But to stop the entire \namendment process and all the other possibilities--I hope we do not let \nthat happen.\n  Through the Chair, I ask the Senator from North Dakota, is that being \nconsidered?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. Let me do this. Let me say the managers' package is \nsomething we have negotiated. I believe it has been agreed to \nunanimously. I do not know of any objection to the package itself. I do \nknow of some objections to the process because one Senator who is not \nhere has staff objecting.\n  Let me suggest in about 5 minutes I am going to send the managers' \npackage to the desk and ask for its consideration. If there is someone \nwho feels a managers' package that has been unanimously agreed to and \nworked on very hard--by the way, let me say--and my colleague Senator \nMurkowski can add to it--we have about five or six areas in the \nmanagers' package that are very controversial and had caused us a lot \nof problems. We worked and worked and negotiated with all of those for \nwhom this controversy exists, and we negotiated something that is \nagreeable to everybody. It was a good thing to have done. Finally, this \nmanagers' package, I think, is now agreeable to everybody, and it is a \ngood piece of work. So in about 5 minutes I wish to send it to the desk \nand ask for its consideration.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield, through the Chair, \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. In order to try to get my schedule and Senator \nByrd's schedule--I know Senator Byrd wishes to speak for about 20 \nminutes. I wish to ask unanimous consent if I could follow him because \nthere was an amendment that involved California. I was not able to be \nhere, and I wish to answer that. If I could follow Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time is Senator Byrd requesting?\n  Mr. BYRD. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Murkowski may wish to add some \ncomments, at which point I believe I will send the managers' package to \nthe desk and ask for its consideration.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, can I have an answer to my question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I intend to answer the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Following that, I will be happy to yield the floor. As I \nunderstand it, the Senator from California wishes to follow the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I might, yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from West Virginia wants 15 minutes. And the \nSenator from California wants how much time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think if I have 15 minutes that would be fine.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me defer on the managers' amendment \nfor a moment, and let us begin with Senator Byrd's request for 15 \nminutes, followed by Senator Boxer. Then my hope would be that we can \ncome back to this bill. We have amendments pending and it is very \nimportant that we finish the bill itself this afternoon.\n\n  Does Senator Murkowski wish to comment at this point before Senator \nByrd takes the floor?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I will defer to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                               War Funds\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on February 11, 2008, the Congressional \nBudget Office responded to an inquiry from Senator Kent Conrad, the \nchairman of the Committee on the Budget, regarding the costs to date of \nU.S. operations and involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Allow me to \nquote in full the critical summary line of this letter:\n\n       If the administration's request for 2008 is funded in full, \n     appropriations for military operations and other war-related \n     activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in the war on \n     terrorism will rise to $188 billion this year and to a \n     cumulative total of $752 billion since 2001.\n\n  It can be difficult to truly grasp how large a number is $752 \nbillion. Let me offer some comparisons. According to Forbes Magazine, \nthe world's most expensive car, a 1930 Bugatti Type 41 Royale, is worth \nan estimated $10 million. For $752 billion, one could own a\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\nfleet--a fleet--of 75,200 Bugatti Type 41 Royales; that is, if more \nthan 6 had ever been made, or for $752 billion one could purchase 442 \nspace shuttles at $1.7 billion each, according to NASA.\n  Here is one final comparison: According to the Bureau of the Census, \nthe average price of a home in the United States in 2007 was $311,600. \nLet me repeat: According to the Bureau of the Census, the average price \nof a home in the United States in 2007 was $311,600, assuming one could \nstill get a mortgage in today's real estate market. For $752 billion, \none could buy 2,413,000 homes--enough homes to house every family in a \ncity roughly the size of Jacksonville, FL or Indianapolis, IN.\n  That is $752 billion and counting, as the President's fiscal year \n2009 budget request has come in, and Secretary Gates has suggested that \nafter the ``surge'' troops come home, troop levels in Iraq will not--\nnot--drop below 130,000 for at least--at least--the remainder of this \nyear. In Afghanistan, the 27,500 troops currently deployed will be \naugmented by an additional 3,200 marines this spring. So I do not \nbelieve that this budgetary comet will do anything but continue its \nmeteoric rise.\n  We all might still count this $752 billion as well spent if we \nthought we were getting good value for our money, if both nations were \nbeing rebuilt and showing signs of stability and recovery. However, \nthere is evidence that the vast sums of money being thrown at Iraq and \nAfghanistan are not all being well spent. Far too much money is being \nsiphoned off to line the pockets of greedy contractors while the work \nwhich they are being paid to do goes undone or is poorly done. \nAlarmingly, money, weapons, and oil profits have apparently been \ndelivered directly to insurgents and militias that are not under \ngovernment control in Afghanistan and Iraq. That must be stopped.\n  In Afghanistan, one U.S. think tank recently estimated that only $1 \nof aid out of every $10 actually reaches an Afghan. In Iraq, a local \nIraqi businessman told a reporter that:\n\n       I'd say that about 10 percent of business was corrupt under \n     Saddam. Now, it's about 95 percent. We used to have one \n     Saddam, now we have 25 of them.\n\n  Despite the growing reports of corrupt practices and the rising \nnumber of allegations of the fraud, waste, and abuse of Government \ncontracts, not enough is being done to apply diplomatic pressure on the \nGovernments in Iraq and Afghanistan to clean up their acts, and not \nenough resources are being applied to efforts to investigate and \nprosecute contract fraud. Congress has been watching, holding hearings, \nand complaining on behalf of the taxpayers, but much more--much more--\nneeds to be done. After 7 years, we cannot continue to hide behind \nfeeble excuses. Too much money is being lost to continue to let the \nsystemic abuses persist.\n  After 7 long years, 7 long years of occupation and reconstruction \nefforts, much, much remains undone that was supposed to be done long, \nlong ago. As long as in-country government officials and all of the \nassociated contractors continue to profit from corruption and an \nunchecked ability to commit fraud, waste, and abuse, there is little--\nlittle, I say--incentive for anyone to make the progress that would \nassist the United States and the rest of the international community in \ndeparting.\n  American taxpayers and the Committee on Appropriations have invested \n$752 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan. We expect to see that treasure \ntreated with the same respect that we give to our troops. They too have \nworked hard. They too have sacrificed much to provide the security for \nreconstruction efforts to take place. None of that sacrifice--none of \nthat sacrifice--should be thrown away on cases of fraud, waste, abuse, \nand through rampant corruption. I--the personal pronoun I--intend to \nconduct a hearing on this matter as a first step, as a first step in \nwhat will be a long, long, hard look at just where--just where--the \ntaxpayers' hard-earned money has been going.\n  I intend to invite Senator Dorgan, I intend to invite Senator Leahy, \nand I intend to invite Representative Waxman to testify on the findings \nof their earlier investigations. I will also invite other witnesses to \noffer their expertise on issues concerning the abuse, misuse, and loss \nof U.S. funds to corrupt practices. I appreciate the encouragement and \nsupport of our Democratic leader, Senator Reid, in tackling this issue.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Good governance and the wise use of \ntaxpayer dollars are always nonpartisan goals. It is the responsibility \nof all of us--and I mean all of us--to determine the scope and the \nscale of the problems and then to devise the best--nothing but the \nbest, and only the best--and fastest solutions to fix them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the announcement by the Senator from West \nVirginia, chairman of the Appropriations Committee is, I think, good \nnews. It is the case that the Appropriations Committee appropriates a \ngreat deal of money, and the question about oversight is very \nimportant. The Senator from West Virginia talks about understanding and \nneeding to know how the money is spent, where the money is spent.\n  With nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars having been spent on \nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on terror, there has been \nso much waste, fraud, and abuse, and there has been too little \noversight. The Senator from West Virginia is showing great foresight \nand courage in saying we are going to provide that oversight. I think \nthe Senate and the American people owe him a debt of gratitude for \nlaunching this effort. I say thank you.\n  I know the Senator from California is going to speak. When we finish \nthe request, to be able to share with our colleagues, I may ask her to \nyield so I might propound a unanimous consent request during her \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4067\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am speaking to an amendment that was \noffered by Senator DeMint, which he said he wants to reoffer. I want to \naddress this amendment which unfairly targets and penalizes taxpaying \nAmericans by denying them some very important appropriations that were \napproved by Congress in 2008.\n  Senator DeMint came to the floor to describe actions that the city of \nBerkeley took last week in relation to the U.S. Marine Corps recruiting \noffice. Let me be completely clear about those actions. Three of the \nmembers, in particular, wanted to send a letter expressing their \ndisapproval of the Marines having a recruiting center in Berkeley. The \nlanguage was offensive to many. I did not agree with anything they \nsaid.\n  Now, on Tuesday, they explicitly stated that the ill-advised letter \nthey were planning to send to the Marines would no longer be sent. \nTherefore, you would think Senator DeMint would then say, fine, I am \nglad they changed their mind. In addition, the city said this in \nwriting.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statement \nthey made about the Marines, if I might.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 City of Berkeley,\n\n\n                                        City Clerk Department,\n\n                                  Berkeley, CA, February 13, 2008.\n     To: Senator Barbara Boxer, Jennifer Tang:\n       Per your request, below is an excerpt from the February 12, \n     2008 City Council meeting Annotated Agenda in reference to \n     Item 25.\n       25. Reiteration of Berkeley's Opposition to the Iraq War \n     and Clarification of the City's Support for the Men and Women \n     who Voluntarily Serve this Country in the Military.\n        From: Councilmembers Olds and Capitelli.\n       Recommendation:\n       (1) That the City Council through adoption of this item, \n     publicly differentiate between the City's documented \n     opposition to the unjust and illegal war in Iraq and our \n     respect and support for those serving in the armed forces.\n       (2) Rescind point 2 of Item 12, of the January 29, 2008 \n     Berkeley City Council Agenda, ``Marine Recruiting Office in \n     Berkeley,'' regarding communications with the Marine \n     Recruiting Station in Berkeley.\n       Financial Implications: None.\n       Contact: Betty Olds, Councilmember, District 6, 981-7160.\n       Action: M/S/C (Mario/Moore) to--\n       1. Accept Councilmembers Olds and Capitelli's \n     recommendation to publicly differentiate between the City's \n     documented opposition to the unjust and illegal war in Iraq \n     and our respect and support for those serving in the armed \n     forces, and\n       2. Accept the following statement submitted by Mayor Bates \n     and Councilmembers Anderson, Maio and Moore:\n       Given the confusion about the Council's action on January \n     29, 2008, a strong statement of the Berkeley City Council's \n     position\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\n     regarding the Marine Recruiting Station is needed. The City \n     of Berkeley and the citizens are strongly opposed to the war \n     in Iraq. The war has resulted in over 4,000 soldiers killed, \n     tens of thousands wounded in body and spirit, hundreds of \n     soldier suicides, and millions of Iraqi people killed, \n     injured and displaced from their homes. In addition, the \n     hundreds of billions of dollars spent on this deeply immoral \n     war could have been spent to meet the needs of our people and \n     to strengthen our economy. We recognize the recruiter's right \n     to locate in our city and the right of others to protest or \n     support their presence. We deeply respect and support the men \n     and women in our armed forces. However, we strongly oppose \n     the war and the continued recruitment of our young people \n     into this war.\n       With the issuance of this statement there is no need to \n     send the letter to the Marine Corps that the City Council \n     approved on January 29, 2008.\n       Noes: Olds, Wozniak.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, they said they ``deeply respect and \nsupport the men and women of our Armed Forces.'' I think the council \ndid the right thing. They realized they should not mix up the Iraq war, \nwhich was brought to us by this President, and the warriors who fight \nit. There is a difference. They recognized that. I am very glad about \nthat. You would think Senator DeMint would be very glad about that. He \nis not. He is still angry and he is still wanting to fight the battle \nof a couple weeks ago and not recognize the fact that this letter he \nwas railing about, which offended him and many others, was never sent.\n  That aside, the DeMint amendment is an attack on the rights of \ncitizens to participate in free speech. There are a lot of things that \ngo on in this country that I think are terrible; I think they are \nwrong, mean spirited, and hurtful. I think a lot of things, because we \nall have our own opinions on what is said. If every time I heard about \nsome city councilman in some city in another State saying something I \nthought was offensive, that hurt our military, our seniors, disabled \npeople, minorities or children, I came out here and said: Oh, my \ngoodness, let's withhold funds from that city because of that city \ncouncilman, we would have quite a situation on our hands.\n  State and local governments all across this Nation pass resolutions \nand measures that many of us don't agree with on a host of issues. \nDisagreements are part of the political discourse. Why on Earth would \nwe punish good, decent citizens because some members of their local \ngovernment or the sewer district or mosquito abatement district or \nwater district or others say something that is offensive? Yes, we have \na right to come to the floor, as Senator DeMint did, and say it is \nterrible and wrong and take it back. That is fine. I welcome that. But \nI don't sit around waiting to hear what they are saying in South \nCarolina, Georgia, Texas, and Oklahoma--those are the States of the \nSenators who want to take away these funds from the good people of \nnorthern California. I don't sit around waiting to see what they might \nsay, and then say I am going to punish everybody because I don't agree \nwith that speech.\n  The other thing I found interesting is that in a press release the \nSenator from South Carolina, Senator DeMint, challenged the process by \nwhich the funding requests were granted by the Appropriations \nCommittee. Today, he called them ``secret'' earmarks. Yet every one of \nthese projects was funded in the most open and transparent manner.\n  I will show you what those earmarks are. As a matter of fact, this is \nan opportunity for me to celebrate those particular projects because \nthey are so important to the police, to the fire department, to the \nchildren, to the disabled, to students, to the memory of a wonderful \nCongressman Bob Matsui, and also to the environment. You will see what \nI mean. Every document pertaining to those projects was made available \nto the public. Every request was approved in the openness of the House \nand Senate Appropriations Committees and the openness of the House and \nSenate Chambers.\n  If the Senator from South Carolina, Senator DeMint, was so concerned \nwith these funding requests for our police, for our fire department, \nfor our children, the disabled community, for our environment, and for \nour college students, he had the opportunity to challenge the funding \nof those requests. He had that opportunity when the bill was on the \nSenate floor. He didn't do that. Oh, no, he is going to challenge them \nbecause someone in the city council--several members--said something \noffensive that he didn't like and, therefore, as a result of that, \ninstead of standing up and talking to those people who made those \noffensive comments and trying to change their mind, he tries to punish \nall the people in the surrounding area. The reason, I would posit, that \nthe Senator didn't challenge these earmarks at the time they were made \nis because they are excellent programs.\n  Congressional and executive funding requests, whether they are \nearmarks from the President or Congress, should be awarded based on \nmerit, not based on what someone in a community said. It is just beyond \nbelief. They should be able to stand on their own merits and serve the \npeople we represent.\n  I am going to show you some photographs that talk about some of these \nearmarks. The first is of these beautiful children standing in this \ngarden that is run for the benefit of public schools in the Berkeley \nSchool District. These students learn how to plant and grow vegetables \nand harvest the vegetables. They work the garden. They learn about \nnutrition. They learn how to cook the food, serve the food, and clean \nup. This is such a popular program that it is being replicated in \nplaces as far away as Louisiana. We all know we have serious problems \nwith our kids with diabetes. We know our kids don't eat the way we want \nthem to because they are attracted to high-sugar foods and sodas and \nall the things that are not good for them. Here is a program that \nteaches them to love the whole notion of eating in a healthy way. That \nis a program Senator DeMint went after, along with his friends who are \ncosponsors. I wish to show you some other programs that are impacted. \nThis is unbelievable.\n  In this photo, we see a few of the most seriously disabled people you \ncan find in America today. They want to live independently. Here is Ed \nRoberts, who needs oxygen every second, with a tube in his mouth. We \nwant these wonderful people--some of them who are veterans--to be able \nto live independently. Here you see pictures of them doing that, with \nparalyzed bodies--children, moms. He wants to take away the funding \nbecause he disagreed with what some people said at the Berkeley City \nCouncil, which they now have taken back. Outrageous. Outrageous.\n  Let's show you the other earmarks they are going after. Here are \nstudents at UC Berkeley. There is a program named after Bob Matsui, the \nbeloved Congressman. They are going after that program as well.\n  Here is a picture of congestion in the San Francisco Bay area, where \nyou can see the Bay Bridge here; and you can barely tell it from where \nyou are sitting, Mr. President, but all these dots are cars. We have \nthe most congested areas in the country. We want to get funding for a \nferry boat to carry people and get them out of their cars and use the \nwaterways. This was Congresswoman Lee's earmark. He wants to cut this \nbecause he didn't agree with members of the council who have now taken \nback what they said.\n  Here are our heroes, the firefighters. They are part of the \nrecipients of an award that we said they deserve so there could be some \ncommunication in our region between the fire and the police in the \njurisdiction, so that when we have a terror attack--and we hope we \nnever do--or when we have a fire--and we often do--or an earthquake, \nwhich we often do, they have communications equipment. This is what \nSenator DeMint wants to take away from law-abiding firefighters because \nhe didn't agree with something the city council said, which they took \nback.\n  Here is the real point I have to make about all this. Senator \nChambliss is an original cosponsor of the DeMint amendment challenging \nthese earmarks. Let's look at an earmark he got in his State. It was \nfor the Daugherty County School System Healthy Lifestyle Program. Ours \nis the Berkeley Unified School District School Lunch Initiative. I \ndon't see Senator Chambliss trying to give up his program. I would \nnever try to take that away from him because of something somebody said \nin his State that I didn't agree with.\n  Here is Senator Cornyn, another proud sponsor of the DeMint amendment \nto slash these earmarks: Ed Roberts Disability Services Campus in\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\nBerkeley. I showed the people coming back from the war, paralyzed \nveterans in wheelchairs. Senator Cornyn wants to cut that earmark \nbecause the city council said something offensive which they have now \nsince taken back. I would never go after Senator Cornyn's paratransit \nvehicle replacement in Abilene, TX.\n  Here we go: The Strom Thurmond Fitness and Wellness Center at the \nUniversity of South Carolina. We don't know who got that earmark \nbecause it was secret. It was secret. But I would never try to take \naway the Strom Thurmond Fitness and Wellness Center. Then let them \nleave alone the Bob Matsui Center for Public Service at UC Berkeley.\n  Senator Inhofe, my friend, is a proud sponsor of this amendment, too. \nHe has the Oklahoma City River Ferry Boat Transportation Program. He \nwas proud to get that earmark. I would never go after that if someone \nin Oklahoma said something that I did not like, a city councilman, a \nmayor. Maybe I wouldn't like it and I might write them a letter and say \nwhat they said was wrong, unpatriotic, I don't agree with it. But I \nwould never go after an earmark that helps move people from place to \nplace. So let him leave alone the San Francisco water ferry.\n  Here is Senator Vitter, another proud cosponsor of the DeMint \namendment. I cannot tell my colleagues how many times I have helped \nSenator Vitter in my committee get help for the people of Louisiana. Do \nI agree with what every city council member says in Louisiana? Probably \nnot. And if I did disagree with them, if they said something I found \nunpatriotic or not caring about our troops, I would send them a letter, \nbut I wouldn't go after Senator Vitter's earmark for the Baton Rouge \nCommunication Technology Pilot Program because I think it is important \nthat police, fire, and emergency workers, who are our heroes, have the \nfunding they need.\n  The final item I want to show my colleagues is this: This move by \nSenator DeMint to take away the funding was addressed by the chair of \nthe Military Affairs Department, Commanding Officer, ROTC, at the \nUniversity of California. I want to read what he said about the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley. I will just read certain \nstatements:\n\n       Given the recent spate of controversy surrounding the U.S. \n     Marine recruiting office . . . I feel it is my obligation to \n     inform members of Congress of the relationship we have with \n     the university and the outstanding support it provides not \n     just to the ROTC Program but to all military personnel, their \n     dependents and veterans as well.\n       UC Berkeley has been and continues to be a very big \n     supporter of all our ROTC programs here on campus. They \n     should in no way be associated with or linked to the actions \n     of the Berkeley City Council which has taken on a very \n     outspoken stance against the United States Marine Corps \n     Recruiting Station in the city. . . .\n       I would like to ensure that those in favor of the Semper Fi \n     Act understand that UC Berkeley is a tremendous supporter of \n     all the military programs on campus as well as all the \n     military personnel, their dependents and veterans who attend \n     this university. It would be a travesty of justice to . . . \n     punish UC Berkeley for the actions of the Berkeley City \n     Council.\n\n  When this was written, I don't know whether Captain Laird knew that \nthe Berkeley City Council did not send that letter and instead finally \nrealized their mistake and said how much they support our men and women \nin uniform.\n  The fact is, this kind of a punishment for a community such as this, \na community of families who care about their country, who are taxpaying \ncitizens, because of actions of a few, is an outrage. It would be a \nterrible precedent if we now started punishing children, policemen, \nfiremen, disabled veterans, and students. If that is what we are going \nto become in this Senate, then we do not deserve to be here. That is \nabsolutely wrong.\n  The Marine Corps has given 232 years of exemplary service to our \nNation and, tragically, 974 of the marines who served in Iraq paid the \nultimate price. More than 440 of those were based at Twenty-nine Palms \nand Camp Pendleton in my home State of California. The Marines deserve \nour respect and our gratitude and our support.\n  Again, I am glad that the council realized there is a difference \nbetween a war and a warrior.\n  Again, Senator DeMint seems to be making political points on an issue \nthat essentially was resolved. But if he wants to come here and debate \nwith me why it is right to take away money from students, if he wants \nto debate with me why it is OK to take away money from disabled \nveterans, why it is OK to take away money from firefighters, many of \nwhom are veterans, many of whom put their lives on the line every day, \nif he wants to have that debate, I will be on my feet, and I will have \nthat debate.\n  I know Senator Dorgan wishes to have the floor. Mr. President, is \nSenator Dorgan ready to make his UC request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, has the Senator from California completed?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield to Senator Dorgan or I can complete in 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from California to \ncomplete her statement, after which I will be recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The point I am making is, we all have our opinion on what \nconstitutes free speech. I support Senator DeMint's right to express \nhis opinion about what he thought of the proposed actions of the \nBerkeley City Council. He has every right to do that. He has every \nright to offer his amendment. But I have every right to come down here \nand say I think not only is it mean-spirited, it is hurtful to the \nwrong people. And I have every right to come down here and say: Senator \nDeMint, they never sent that letter to the Marines, happily. They \nrethought it.\n  If he wants to continue with this amendment, if he wants to offer it \nto every bill we have, then I will be right down here with these \nphotographs and others that I have. I will be right down here with more \ntestimony from the military who will testify to how incredibly \nwelcoming UC Berkeley is to our men and women in uniform.\n  There will be wars in the future--we all hope there will not be, but \nthere may be--with which we do not agree, but we must never confuse our \nanger at the people who would send our young people to a war of choice \nor a wrongheaded war and the young people who are sent there. We must \ncome here every day to support those young men and women. Let's not use \nthis as a way to take cheap political shots because they do not deserve \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have been patiently waiting for some \nhours now. It is pretty unbelievable to watch this process work. The \nold saying about watching sausages being made or laws being made, it is \nnot a very attractive picture. That certainly is true today on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  We have legislation we reported out from the Indian Affairs Committee \ndealing with an obligation that this country has to provide Indian \nhealth care. It is an obligation we promised in treaties. It is a trust \nobligation reaffirmed by our courts, and it has been nearly 10 long \nyears getting to the floor to reauthorize the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act. It is not as if anybody is speeding around here.\n  We finally get to the floor of the Senate, we are on the third day, \nand we have all kinds of amendments that have little to do with Indian \nhealth care.\n  We have been standing at parade rest for 3 hours while one of our \ncolleagues has been giving speeches downtown and their staff has \nindicated they must object to this request. I do not understand the 25 \nstages of approval required in this Chamber to say hello or goodbye. \nPerhaps we can find a way to move on the issue that confronts the \nSenate at this moment, and that is Indian health care. Even as we talk, \npeople die out there because there is full-scale rationing of health \ncare.\n  One part of this legislation that we have worked on is called the \nmanagers' package. It is not a typical managers' package we see with \nother legislation where there are a lot of additions. This managers' \npackage is a requirement we had to try to negotiate about five very \ndifficult and very controversial issues. We had great objections to \ncertain areas of the bill, so Senator Murkowski and I and our staffs \nworked over the last month to negotiate, and we reached agreement on \nfive or six areas.\n  That agreement was pretty difficult to reach, but we did it with a \nlot of people on both sides of the aisle. That is what is comprised of \nthis managers' package.\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\n                Amendment No. 4082 to Amendment No. 3899\n\n  Our managers' package is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside and that the managers' amendment, \nwhich is at the desk, be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Ms. Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 4082 to \n     amendment No. 3899.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, about 5 hours ago, we were hoping to send \nthat amendment to the desk and have it considered. We hoped to have a \nvote on it. What we are waiting for at the moment is the remainder of \nthe unanimous consent request. The remainder of the unanimous consent \nrequest I will propound, when we determine who offers levels of \napproval in the Chamber, will be that we have a vote--the way it is \nconstructed is at 3 o'clock, but that was 25 minutes ago--that we have \na vote on two amendments.\n  One will be the managers' amendment I sent to the desk on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Murkowski, bipartisan, I believe, an amendment that \ndoes not have objections anywhere in the Chamber because we have \nresolved those objections, but we will have a recorded vote on that, \nand then we will have a recorded vote on the amendment that has been \noffered by Senator Coburn, amendment No. 4034.\n  My hope is that we will be able to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest that will be approved in a few minutes, with a couple-minute \ndebate prior to each vote, and then we will have two votes. Our hope is \nto begin that at 3 o'clock. My hope remains that will be the case. I \nwill not propound the unanimous consent request at the moment because I \nunderstand it has not yet been cleared.\n  I understand it has now just been cleared, which is great news.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the following: that the pending \namendment, which is the managers' amendment that I just filed on behalf \nof myself and Senator Murkowski, be set aside and that at 3 p.m. today, \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, the managers' \namendment; that the amendment not be divisible; and that upon \ndisposition of that amendment, the Senate resume the Coburn amendment \nNo. 4034; that there be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in \nrelationship to that amendment; and that no amendments be in order to \neither amendment prior to the vote, with the second vote in sequence 10 \nminutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, the vote \nwill begin in about 3 minutes, and we will have two votes in sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3906\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to speak on amendment No. 3906, \nwhich has been pending. I believe I can do that between now and the \ntime of the vote. I ask to be recognized for the time remaining before \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, after high tax rates, the thing that \ndisturbs Americans the most about their Government is that their tax \ndollars are too often misspent. Nowhere is this problem more prevalent \nthan in the Medicare Program where fraud is concerned.\n  Currently, Medicare fraud consumes an estimated $60 billion a year. \nThat is as much as 20 percent of the program lost to criminals scamming \nthe Federal Government.\n  In South Florida, the region has only 8 percent of the Nation's AIDS \npatients. Yet 73 percent of Federal AIDS medication payments are sent \nthere. That alone is an estimated $2 billion of fraud.\n  We have only recently begun to uncover some of the cases of \nwidespread fraud and abuse. An 82-year-old constituent of mine kept \ngetting $10,000 Medicare payment statements. If you looked at the \nbills, it appeared this elderly woman had artificial knees, ankles, one \nglass eye, was in a wheelchair, and suffered from diabetes and AIDS. \nThe truth is, she is completely healthy. She had not called on \nMedicare, and someone else was using her stolen Medicare number.\n  Her case is typical of many in my State and far too many other States \nwhere Medicare fraud abuse has been reported.\n  Hard-working Americans are outraged by seeing their tax dollars lost \nto criminal fraud. My amendment to the Indian health bill will double \nthe jail time, double the penalties, and give judges greater discretion \nin sentencing those who are guilty of Medicare fraud. The message needs \nto be stronger than a slap on the wrist. It has to be hard time.\n\n  But tougher penalties are only a first step. There is a larger \nproblem. We need better oversight, more accountability, and fewer \ndollars sent to organizations that can't prove they are anything more \nthan a P.O. box. So I call upon my colleagues to join with me in \naddressing this situation. Help put a stop to the billions and billions \nof taxpayer dollars padding the pockets of criminals each and every \nyear. We owe it to the American people to handle their money with \ngreater care, and I believe we can do this by just cutting wasteful \nspending and stiffening the penalties that already exist for fraud \ncases.\n  There are a number of cases I can point to in my State, and these are \njust cases that have come to the attention of my office. Maggie of \nSunrise talks about a doctor she had never seen billing Medicare for \n$2,590 worth of services in July of 2006. Leslie of Punta Gorda \nreported a fraudulent claim filed using his deceased wife's claim \nnumber after her death. The claim was filed in April of 2006, and his \nwife passed away in March of 2005.\n  There are many other examples like these. For that reason, I urge \npassage of my amendment, and I know it may be part of the managers' \npackage, which I think would be a great step forward in stemming the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in this program.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4082, the managers' \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the Coburn \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second, and the yeas and \nnays have been ordered on the Coburn amendment as well.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided on the Coburn amendment, No. 4034.\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a pretty simple amendment. What \nit says is we are going to give the Native Americans what we promised \nthem in our treaties. We are going to give it to them in the same way \nwe deliver security, choice, prosperity, and health care for Members of \nCongress. We are going to give them an insurance policy. In basics, I \nthink my chairman agrees with it; he does not agree with the way we are \ndoing it at this time. I understand that. What you all should know is \nthree-quarters of the Native American population of this country lives \nin urban areas; it does not live on the reservation. That is three-\nquarters.\n  What this does is fulfill our commitment through giving them access \nto quality choice and care--not substandard care, not rationed care, \nbut real care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I oppose the amendment, as does my \ncolleague Senator Murkowski.\n  Senator Coburn offers some interesting ideas here, but he offers them \nin the context of saying: We will do some different and additional \nthings with Indian health care, but we will explicitly restrict any \nadditional money that is in the bill itself. That means if you have \nIndian reservations out in the country someplace, there is an Indian \nhealth clinic, and that is the only health care available, I guarantee \nyou they will end up with less money to provide health care to those \nIndians on those reservations given that restriction in the bill.\n  For that reason I do not support it, but I look forward to working \nwith my colleague from Oklahoma on ideas of this type.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, if I might, the Senator from Oklahoma is \nintending to debate and discuss amendment Nos. 4032 and 4036, and \nrequests recorded votes on both. First of all, I appreciate his \ncooperation. I understand he is prepared to initiate that debate. What \nI would like to suggest is whatever time he needs for that debate, we \ncould probably, by consent, with the consent of Senator Murkowski, \nagree to a time for both those votes.\n  I might ask the Senator, how long would he like to debate both \namendments?\n  Mr. COBURN. Probably, Madam President, I will not use more than 30 \nminutes and probably less.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, would it be satisfactory to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and Senator Murkowski if we set the two votes on \namendment No. 4032 and amendment No. 4036 no later than 4:20?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is 30 minutes for me and none for you.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let's make it 4:30, Madam President.\n  Mr. COBURN. I do not have any problem with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, amendment No. 4036 is a real simple \namendment. What it says is we are going to prioritize the funds that go \ninto the Indian Health Service. We have had debate all day on whether \nwe are improving Indian health care when we add services but do not add \nmoney, and we have not done the structural reforms that need to happen \nin the Indian Health Service.\n  We know the Indian Health Service is plagued by rationing on a life-\nand-limb basis. As to the quality of care we are offering in IHS, for \nsome places it is great, but on average it is less than what we offer \nother people. Instead of fixing the problem with basic medical \nservices, this bill includes new services. We are not funding the \nservices we do now, and the services we are funding are not at the \nlevel they need to be in terms of their quality.\n  This bill expands the burden of IHS to fund things that in terms of \npriority are not as important, No. 1, but, more importantly, most have \nan eligibility avenue with which to get these services through some \nother Government program. So by supporting this amendment, you are not \ndenying the four new services because they are already available, just \nnot through the IHS.\n  This amendment would require funding go to what has already been \npromised to tribal members before we expand to new promises. In other \nwords, before we add new services, let's make sure we are funding the \nservices we are offering now and that we are funding them at a level of \nquality that is acceptable.\n  So this would say IHS would have to prioritize basic medical services \nbefore paying for new programs. We have talked a lot about the history \non this. We know where our problems are. The chairman is trying to move \nin a direction to help solve some of the problems.\n  I disagree that we are making the major steps. I think we have to \ntotally reform IHS. I have said that to the chairman. He knows the \nstructural problems that are there. I think when we promise health \ncare, we ought to give it.\n  We talked earlier today that one in every four Native American women \nhave a baby without any prenatal care. The average number of visits for \nthose who have prenatal care is half what the national average is. So \njust in prenatal care, in pediatrics, and diabetes we know we are \nbehind the curve. Yet we are going to add new services in the bill that \nare already available in other ways.\n  We also know, as the chairman has said, that we spend half per capita \non Native Americans than we do on prisoners. We spend less than half \nthan we\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\ndo on veterans. We spend a third based on what we spend on Medicare. So \nwe are obviously not there, and a lot of it is money. There is no \nquestion about it. But it is not all money. It is structural.\n  Obviously, that is the reason for my opposition to this bill because \nI think we have an opportunity to go much further to totally change the \nstructure and quality and delivery and to get a lot of the bureaucracy \nout. I think we also need to add money. We need to do all three.\n  This amendment is designed to make IHS prioritize the money. So even \nthough we authorize these programs--this does not eliminate the \nauthorization--it just says you cannot effectively do it until you have \nfunded adequately what you are already promising Native Americans.\n  What this bill will do, in my estimation, is drain resources \navailable to basic core medical services. It is also going to do \nsomething else. Our tribes are getting to be pretty good businessmen. \nWhat it is going to do is, it is going to put into individual tribes \nbusinesses for these services.\n  So what is going to happen is, these services are going to be part of \nthe tribal organization business complex but not part of the service, \nand so we are going to transfer funds outside IHS, transfer IHS moneys \ninto tribal organizations with no guarantees that the money that was \nspent is going to come back into health care. So if we were to do this, \nwhat I would rather is these be IHS services only, rather than out for \nbid to be utilized that may be not at a competitive bid price so we \nenhance private profitability rather than tribal health care. So there \nis that other little problem. Again, if we make new promises, at a time \nwhen we are not funding the promises we have, we are not helping the \nNative American population.\n  This amendment is about priorities. It is not saying IHS cannot fund \nthese new programs. It is just saying we need to focus on basic medical \nservices first, such as prenatal care. When one in four Native \nAmericans do not have prenatal care, and we are going to add long-term \nhome health care, hospice, DME, and some of these other areas, when we \nare not taking care of the women who walk in and deliver without \nprenatal care, it does not make sense.\n  So I will put this amendment up. I am going to ask for the yeas and \nnays on amendment 4036. I appreciate the consideration of the chairman \nand his heart toward Native Americans. But a half promise fulfilled is \na promise not kept, and that is where we are on health care. Making us \nprioritize--in some places we will be able to do this; where we have \neffective, efficient care, they will have the money to offer these \nservices. In areas where we are not doing well, they should not be \nexpanding into new services when they are not taking care of the \nservices we have today.\n  So the flexibility is completely up to the IHS. Nothing limits it \nother than you have to meet the core basic medical needs first before \nyou go into other areas.\n  With that, I yield the floor and await the response from my chairman. \nThen I will talk about the other amendment in a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, with the permission of the Senator from \nOklahoma, let me ask if he might also discuss his second amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4032\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, amendment No. 4032, which the chairman \nhas graciously allowed me to discuss at this time, which I also would \nlike to call up and have as the pending order of business under the \nregular order, is real simple. We do this in a lot of other places, but \nwe do not do it in IHS.\n  I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent has been granted.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  This is a real straightforward amendment. It says if you are a tribal \nmember and you have been the victim of rape or sexual assault, the \nright to have your assailant tested for HIV and AIDS and other sexually \ntransmitted diseases cannot be denied you. We have done this a lot of \ntimes. Most of us agree with that. We think it is the right thing to do \nwhen somebody is an assailant and we have people at risk, and not \nputting those Native Americans into a period of a year waiting or \ntaking medicines they should not have to take because they do not know \nthe status of the person who committed an assault on them.\n  So it is very straightforward. I will not spend a lot of time on it. \nI am not trying to inflame the issue. I think it is something Native \nAmericans ought to have that every other American today has.\n  I yield back and intend to ask for the yeas and nays at the \nappropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me talk for a moment about amendment \nNo. 4032, the HIV mandatory testing issue. I support that, I think, at \nthe request of the victim. I think that is a thoughtful amendment and \nwould have accepted it. I understand the Senator wishes a recorded \nvote. I understand why that is the case. But I do think it is an \namendment that has a lot of merit.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4036\n\n  With respect to the other amendment, No. 4036, I understand what the \nSenator is trying to do. I am going to oppose the amendment and vote \nagainst the amendment. He is talking about using the funds for \nessential medical services. Yes, I am all in favor of that. But let me \nalso say that the issue of hospice care and some long-term care issues \nwe have added to this bill--if you visited a hospice care setting, it \nis pretty hard to take a look at what hospice care is offering dying \npatients and suggest that is not essential as well.\n  That is a wonderful health care option that is available to many in \nthis country. What we have tried to do in the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act is to expand some services. That is correct. The \nSenator and I talked a little bit about that this morning. But they are \nin most cases services that many other Americans have available to them \nthat we would hope and expect would be made available to American \nIndians as well. My colleague and I both described this morning our \ninterest in adequately funding Indian health care. He said--and I \nagree, and I said earlier--that about 60 percent of Indian health care \nis delivered to American Indians, and 40 percent is withheld. That \nmeans you have full-scale health care rationing going on. It should be \nfront-page, scandalous headlines in this country. It ought to be \ntrumpeting the news in this country. But it is not. There is a giant \nsleep going on about what is happening to people out there who are \nliving in the shadows, desperately poor, in many cases an hour, an hour \nand a half, 2 hours away from the nearest large-scale health care \nclinic, so their opportunity to get health care is through the Indian \nHealth Service, and we are trying very hard to improve that.\n\n  But I understand the purpose of the amendment offered by the Senator. \nI would hope, however, when we finish doing what he said he is going to \ndo, and what I said I am going to do, and when we talk about what we \nare really going to fund this year, that we will have sufficient funds; \nA, that we will have a system we are proud of, that delivers health \ncare to people who are sick and who were promised health care; and B, \nto fully fund the services that most people expect would be available \nto them and their loved ones, and that would include hospice care.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, will the Senator from North Dakota \nyield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, through the Chair, would the chairman \nagree a large portion of people who are eligible for Indian health care \nservice today already have these services available to them through \nanother Federal Government program?\n  Mr. DORGAN. A large portion? I don't know that I would agree with \nthat. I don't believe I would at all.\n  Mr. COBURN. A large portion of them are Medicaid eligible. As a \nmatter of fact, 27 percent of the funds that go into IHS are people \nfrom Medicaid. If they are Medicaid eligible, then they\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\nare eligible for every one of these programs. A large portion are \nMedicare eligible. A large portion of money that comes into IHS comes \nfrom Medicare, and they are also eligible under that. So the majority \nof our Native American population already have these services available \nto them under two other programs.\n  The other question I would ask through the Chair of the chairman is--\nthere are other clinics and IHS facilities, I believe, and please \ncorrect me, that are being run well and that will be able to utilize \nthese services for that smaller portion of Native Americans because \nthey will have the funds because they are meeting basic core medical \nneeds now. My amendment doesn't take that away. It just says if you are \nin an IHS clinic and over half of them already have these services \navailable through another government program, why would we add that \nwhen we are not taking care of the diabetes, the dialysis, and every \nother thing we have?\n  My question to the chairman is--I would love for him to consider that \nthis is a better way to go rather than blanketly treating everybody the \nsame and that we have to prioritize, and that by having IHS Directors \nmake that priority--in different areas, that is true--in terms of what \ngoes through the tribal government, what we will get is better care.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we look at this and, in many ways, see \nthe same side. I think the Senator from Oklahoma and I see a situation \nin which gripping poverty exists in many areas, joblessness, inadequate \nhealth care. The Senator from Oklahoma is correct there are \ncircumstances--I have been there, I have seen them--where the health \ncare is wonderful. I toured a clinic recently and the doctor--a \nwonderful doctor at that clinic working for the Indian Health Service, \nwho is very dedicated and by all accounts a terrific doctor--said to \nme: You know, we are waiting for this new x-ray equipment that is \nsupposed to come. The waiting room is full, by the way. The building is \nin disrepair, it is an old building, but the doctor is giving me a \ntour, and he says: We are waiting for this x-ray machine which is \nreally going to help us out.\n  I said: How long have you been waiting?\n  He said: Two years.\n  I said: What is the trouble?\n  He said: Well, I wish I knew. It is paperwork. Can't get it through \nthe regional office. The money is there. The money is there for it, but \nwe can't get the regional office to get the paperwork done to get the \nx-ray machine.\n  So the Senator from Oklahoma and I both know there are circumstances \nwhere there is unbelievable bureaucracy that is almost shameful, and \nnothing gets done. There are other areas where there is sterling \nmedical care by men and women who, in that service, get up every \nmorning and say: I want to make a difference in the lives of people. So \nall of that exists.\n  The point I have been trying to make most of today is when you have \n40 percent of the health care needs unmet, we are in a desperate \nsituation. We need to fix that.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has talked a lot about reform, and I am \nvery anxious, when we get this bill done--we will get it out of the \nSenate, we will get it to conference, and hopefully get it signed into \nlaw by the President. We will, for the first time in nearly a decade, \nhave advanced an improvement in Indian health care. I am very anxious \nto turn immediately--and the Senator serves on our committee--to work \nwith him and Senator Murkowski from Alaska to say: All right, now, \nlet's put this on a different course with a much bolder, a much bigger \nbite, to try to figure out how we dramatically improve health care. \nThat would not be done unless we have substantial additional income as \nwell. But income is not going to solve the problem by itself. You need \nreform.\n  It is interesting. When the Senator talked earlier today about giving \nAmerican Indians the opportunity to go someplace with a card and say: \nHere is my health care coverage--I am in favor of that. But that card \nwould not do much good for somebody who is sick and is living, for \nexample, in Fort Yates, ND, because the only option they have is to go \nto that Indian Health Service or they can get in the car and drive a \nfairly long way to find a hospital someplace. So we need to address \nthese issues.\n\n  I want the Indian Health Service to be better, to be more effective, \nto provide better health care for American Indians, and I want to \nreform the entire system to see if we can establish competition where \ncompetition will work. I know Senator Coburn will readily agree there \nare places in the country where you can't even talk about real \ncompetition because you are living way out, way away from any other \nfacilities, and all that exists is the Indian health care facility.\n  If I might make one additional point I understand why--I quoted Chief \nJoseph this morning. I understand why American Indians are a little \nskeptical. They have been lied to, cheated. They have had their \nagreements in writing, and they haven't been worth the paper on which \nthey are written. It is pretty unbelievable when you think about it. We \nhave all seen this, the promises that were made but never, ever kept. \nThe purpose of today and the purpose of our work is to say: You know \nwhat. These were the first Americans and we have certain obligations to \nthem and we must do a better job of meeting those obligations.\n  So I don't know that I was particularly responsive to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, but both of us want the same thing, we end up wanting \nexactly the same goals out of this debate. And my hope is, working \ntogether during the next couple of years we will take two steps, both \nin the right direction and both in a constructive way to help American \nIndians.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I just want a few more minutes and then \nI am through.\n  The Senator from North Dakota makes a great point: that there are \npeople who are using reservation-based IHS facilities who are \nessentially trapped. They are trapped. They don't get the option to go \nsomewhere else. What this bill does--and in many of those instances, \nthe core medical needs are not being met. What this bill does is makes \nsure the core medical needs are going to be met because we are going to \nadd four new services for those people. So now they are trapped in a \nsystem that doesn't deliver the quality, doesn't deliver the service, \nand doesn't deliver the prevention, we are going to make it worse. We \nare going to make it worse because we are going to add services that \nare available to half of the Native American population right now \nthrough another Government program, and we are going to dilute the \nresources for the very people who are trapped on reservations.\n  But the very point is, three-quarters of Native Americans are in an \nurban area. They are not limited to that. They are not limited at all. \nThey should have had the choice to be able to go wherever they wanted \nto go today. We turned that down. We had 29 people vote for that--or 28 \npeople vote for that.\n  I know the chairman is going to work with me to try to get there \nsomeday. But that is when you give Native Americans their due and meet \nour commitments. When they have the same choice, the same security, the \nsame health care that you and I have, then we will have met our \ncommitment under our treaties, and not until then would we have met it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator would yield on that point \njust briefly.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Do you know why in many cases the urban Indians are a \npopulation that is exclusive? Because we went through a period of time \nwhen we did these zigzags. At one point in this country we said to the \nIndian community: You know what. Yes, you are on a reservation. Here is \na one-way bus ticket. We want you to leave. So we sent them to the \ncities. Now we promised them health care back on the reservation. Now \nwe say: You have a bus ticket one way. Go to the city. In fact, the \nbudget request this year once again says: By the way, we don't intend \nto fund any--we don't intend to fund any health care for urban Indians. \nWell, we should, and I think we will say to the President that we don't \nagree with that recommendation. But we have done a lot of egregious \nthings in this country, even with respect to preventing Indians the \nright to vote for the majority of the history of this country. They \ndidn't\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\nget the right to vote until about 90 years ago or so.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I would like to reclaim my time, if I \nmight.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I want to make a couple of points \nbecause what we have heard is a lot of negative today. I want to say \nhow proud I am of the Cherokees, the Chickasaw, the Choctaw, and the \nCreek in Oklahoma. I totally disagree with gaming. I think it \nundermines virtue. I think it is destroying a lot of society. But \nseveral of the tribes in my State have invested their dollars--not IHS \ndollars, their dollars--in health care, and they need to be recognized. \nTheir facilities, most oftentimes, are fantastic, and their care is \nfantastic. So I don't want us to leave the debate without recognizing \nsome of the vast improvements that where we have failed, the tribes \nhave actually picked it up and supplied it, and that means shame on us \nbecause maybe there wouldn't be as much gaming if we were fulfilling \nthe needs. Gaming is not without its societal consequences, regardless \nof how much we benefit in terms of dollars that come into the Treasury.\n  So I didn't want us to leave this without recognizing that we have \nlots of great performance in lots of great areas. We also have lots of \ngreat providers and doctors and workers in IHS, but we have some who \naren't. We also have some who couldn't get a job anywhere else, some \nwhom nobody else would hire. Yet we will hire them because we are so \nshort, both on funds and needs. That ought not to be there either. If \nsomebody is not competent to practice with the public, they shouldn't \nbe competent to practice at IHS and the same at the VA and the same in \nour prisons and the same in other areas.\n\n  So it is my hope we will look straight forward. It is hard to run \nagainst your own chairman on amendments on a bill, and we intentionally \ndid not put up these amendments at the request of the chairman when we \nwere doing the markup on the Indian health care bill.\n  Again, I will state in finality, and then sit down, these \n``improvements'' in many areas will offer some improvement but in many \nmore areas will take away from core medical care that is offered to the \nvery people who aren't getting adequate care today. So it ought to be \nflexible. It ought to be where the core medical needs are met, we are \noffering these, and whether or not we shouldn't be offering them \nbecause what we are doing is, we are taking that lady who is going to \nbe on dialysis, and we could have prevented it because we are not doing \nthe core medical things and we are looking at the wrong thing. We are \ntaking a gal who has early diabetic neuropathy and we are going to \ncondemn her to a life on dialysis or a kidney transplant, and most of \nthem would not get kidney transplants. They are going to get hooked up \nto a machine for 8 hours a day because we are--but we are going to feel \ngood about ourselves saying we now have hospice and long-term care, and \nall of these other things.\n  I think it is a mistake the way we have done that. It is my main \nopposition to the bill. I think we have an opportunity to rigorously \nand tremendously change the structure, the delivery of care. We have an \nopportunity to change the paradigm under which we treat Native \nAmericans, to prevention. We have talked about suicide on all of the \nreservations. The chairman and many have been concerned about \nprevention of that. But we ought to be just as concerned about \nprevention of all of the other diseases and change the paradigm under \nwhich IHS works instead of more of the same.\n  So with that, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, the Senator \nmay seek the yeas and nays on both amendments with one show of hands.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond. There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when we do \nvote at 4:30, we vote on amendment No. 4036 first and amendment No. \n4032 second, and that there be 2 minutes between the votes, a minute on \neach side, and that there be no intervening second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 4070, 4073, 4066, and 4038 to Amendment No. 3899, and \n                           Amendment No. 4015\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside, and I call up these four amendments on \nbehalf of Senator DeMint: Nos. 4070, 4073, 4015, and 4066; and I call \nup amendment No. 4038 on behalf of Mr. Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendments, en bloc.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. DeMint, \n     proposes amendments Nos. 4070, 4073, 4015, and 4066, en bloc.\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski, for Mr. Vitter, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4038.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4070\n\n       On page 309, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       ``(c) Firearm Programs.--None of the funds made available \n     to carry out this Act may be used to carry out any \n     antifirearm program, gun buy-back program, or program to \n     discourage or stigmatize the private ownership of firearms \n     for collecting, hunting, or self-defense purposes.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4073\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                        TITLE III--APPLICABILITY\n\n     SEC. 3__.

Madam President, if I may take a few moments to speak \nto some of the issues the Senator from Oklahoma has raised about the \nprioritization, giving priority to the provision of those basic medical \nservices, medical needs.\n  I think we all agree that is the first requirement, to make sure \nthose services are provided for. In the State of Alaska, we hear from \nthose most vulnerable in our Alaska Native population, our elderly--the \nelders in the village who have lived through some pretty incredible \ntimes. At the end of their lives, they are certainly seeking basic \nmedical services. Yet we recognize that with the facilities we have \navailable to them, the services we have available to them, the medical \nprofessionals we have available to them, it is very difficult to meet \nall of those needs. So for them, the opportunity for hospice care, \nassisted living service, long-term care service, or the home or \ncommunity-based service--that is singled out in the amendment. They are \nlooking at this not as a luxury, or an add-on, certainly, but something \nthat is basic, something that would be fundamental to a quality of life \nin their final years.\n  This is a matter for many seniors, not just in the State of Alaska, \nand for many who are looking to, again, provide for those services at a \nlevel and in a manner that is culturally relevant and appropriate--the \ncommunity-based services, home-based services. I think it is important \nthat we recognize we are not without limitation when we are talking \nabout the services that are provided to American Indians and Alaska \nNatives. You have heard time and time again on the Senate floor that we \nare not meeting their needs; that we are funding at 60 percent; that \nthere is a curtailment or a shortage in services based on the \nresources. So when we are able to enhance the quality of life, whether \nit is through assistance, such as long-term care services or assisted \nliving or the community-based services, or whether it is enhancing the \nend-of-life care, as we do throughout this Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act, these are the things we ought to be encouraging, that \nwe ought to be moving forward with in a positive manner.\n  So I stand in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma which says we cannot attend to any of these quality-of-life \nissues--if it is in your final days--unless and until the Secretary has \ngiven priority to the provision of these basic medical services to all \nIndians.\n  It is, again, a situation where we want to attempt to do as much as \nwe possibly can. But I think if you were to tell the elder in the \ncommunity of Buckland that somehow or other services to help her in her \nfinal years, to die gracefully and with dignity in her home, is \nsomething she doesn't qualify for, is not eligible for, I think we \nwould all find that cuts to the quick.\n  Madam President, I understand that there are several Members who are \nhere and wish to speak briefly on FISA for a few minutes before we move \nto our vote. I am prepared to yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I will take a minute to update my \ncolleagues on some information we received from the Director of \nNational Intelligence in an open hearing that is going on in Hart 216 \nright now. I thought it was important to clarify some points that he \nmade in response to some very important questions raised by Chairman \nRockefeller.\n  Chairman Rockefeller asked what would happen if FISA expires--as it \ndoes on February 15--without being renewed. He asked, could these \ncollections not continue? There is a very important ``yes, but''--for \nacquisitions that have been ordered by the FISA Court which have years \nin length; it is possible that those could continue. But the major \nproblem the Director sees and the attorneys with him see is that if \nthey needed to change targets, if they needed to change methods, if \nthey needed to change means by which they gathered the information, \nthey would not be able to do so.\n  Furthermore, he highlighted a very real problem having to do with the \nprivate sector. As we have said on the floor before, the private sector \ncarriers are absolutely essential to the operation, not only of FISA, \nforeign intelligence surveillance, but for work with the FBI and others \non criminal matters. The fact that we have left the telecom carriers, \nthat are alleged to have participated in the President's lawful terror \nsurveillance program without liability protection, they are being \nadvised by their general counsel of their responsibility under \nSarbanes-Oxley, and others, that they could only cooperate with a fresh \ncourt order. Since there is no authority for additional court orders, \nthey have a grave question as to whether they are risking not only \ntheir firm's reputation but under Sarbanes-Oxley certain duties to \nshareholders. That is why he felt it was necessary to get this measure \nthat has passed the Senate implemented by the House.\n  I also noted in my comments that the House passed its bill almost as \nlong ago as the Senate passed its bill. At that time, the intelligence \ncommunity said it was not workable, that the Rockefeller-Bond proposal \nthat passed overwhelmingly 2 days ago was the only thing that was \nworkable; and the fact that the House says they don't have time to work \non it ignores the fact that they have known for a couple of months that \nthey were going to have to make significant revisions in their measure \nif they wanted it to be passed and signed into law. So my sympathies \nfor the House. I understand they are pressed for time, but they knew \nthis was coming. They have a measure before them that could be passed, \nwhich I hope they will pass.\n  One other thing. I asked the Director about some of the very \nmisdirected, improper, wrong and, in some instances, irresponsible \nsuggestions made on the floor about the tactics that the CIA may use in \nquestioning high-value detainees. The DNI made it clear, as I attempted \nto make clear yesterday, all of the things banned by the Army Field \nManual, such as burning, electrocuting, beating, sexual harassment--all\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\nthose things are not only repugnant but they are not permitted to be \nused by any of our intelligence agencies. He reiterated that \nwaterboarding is not permitted under the political guidelines that \ninclude legislation and that we have passed here in direct orders.\n  So what was done yesterday does not prevent torture. That is \nprevented already. It doesn't prevent cruel, degrading, and inhumane \ninterrogation techniques. It does not prevent other cruel, degrading, \nor inhumane acts by the intelligence agencies. Those are already \nprohibited.\n  What the measure that was passed yesterday does--were it to be signed \ninto law, and I certainly hope it will not be--would be to deny the \nintelligence community the ability to use techniques that are similar \nto but different from the techniques authorized in the Army Field \nManual. These enhanced techniques have been used only on roughly a \ncouple of dozen detainees in the custody of the CIA. They are lawful, \nand they have produced some of the most important intelligence that the \nintelligence community has gathered to identify high-level members of \nal-Qaida and other terrorist organizations, and to interfere, impede, \nand stop terror attacks directed not only at our troops abroad, our \nallies, but the United States.\n  Unfortunately, some people were misled by comments that were \nbordering on irresponsible on the floor yesterday, to say that we \nbanned torture, cruel, inhumane, and degrading conduct. That is not \nwhat happened. We tied the hands of the CIA with the purported \nprovision that would severely limit their ability to gain information \nusing totally lawful techniques in questioning high-value detainees. \nRather than being a blow for freedom, reaffirming our values, it merely \nproposed to cripple our intelligence collection.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I commend the ranking member and \nchairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence for the outstanding \nwork they have done on this critical piece of legislation, passing it \nin the Intelligence Committee by a vote of 13 to 2, which was no easy \nfeat. This passed in the Senate by a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to \n29, I believe. It is about as strong a bipartisan vote as you can \npossibly get. This is a well-thought-out piece of legislation that, \nonce sent over to the House of Representatives, we were told the House \nof Representatives, rather than to deal with this legislation, would \nsimply decide to fold their tent and go home. That is the height of \nirresponsibility.\n  The Senator from Missouri described why it is so important for us to \nbe able to listen to our enemies: because, simply, it saves American \nlives. We learned a harsh lesson on September 11, 2001, which is that \nwe are not safe even within our own shores.\n  There are those who believe in a radical ideology that celebrates the \nmurder of innocent men, women, and children, and who are willing to use \ninstruments of destruction, whether they be primitive tools such as \nflying an airplane into a building, or chemical, biological, or nuclear \nweapons--whatever they can get--to kill innocent civilians. We have to \ndo everything in our power to protect ourselves. Thank goodness, due to \nthe noble work of our men and women in uniform who are fighting in \nplaces such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere around the world, we \nare keeping the enemies of the United States on the run.\n  The best way we can deter these terrorist attacks is to listen in on \nconversations and communications. That is the only way we are going to \nbe able to continue to do it. For the House of Representatives to know \nthat they are causing our intelligence community to go deaf to the \ncommunications of terrorists who are plotting attacks against the \nUnited States is the height of irresponsibility. I hope it is not true \nand that they reconsider.\n  My hope is they will come back and they will pass this important \nlegislation that will encourage our telecommunications industry to \ncooperate with the lawful requests of the Commander in Chief as \ncertified by the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, \nand that is the Attorney General, so we can continue to listen to these \ncommunications in a lawful and legal way and protect the American \npeople. For the House of Representatives to refuse to take up this \nmatter and to vote on it is, again, I say, the height of \nirresponsibility, and it endangers American lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4036\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican leader.\n\n\n                                  fisa\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have a serious crisis confronting \nour country as a result of the House of Representatives' refusal to \ntake up the Senate-passed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. We \nknow for a fact the following: We know that the Senate approved \nyesterday, with 69 votes, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \ncrafted by Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond that came out of the \nIntelligence Committee 13 to 2. This is about as bipartisan as it ever \ngets around here. We know in addition this bill is the only bill that \ncan pass the House of Representatives. They took up yesterday a 21-day \nextension of existing law, and it was defeated. It was defeated because \nthere were 20 to 25 House Democrats who didn't want the bill at all, \nwant it to die, want to walk away from it and leave the American people \nunprotected.\n  In fact, there is a bipartisan majority for the Senate-passed bill in \nthe House, and that is the only bill for which there is a bipartisan \nmajority in the House. Now we have all learned that the House of \nRepresentatives is going to close up shop and simply leave town, \narguing that somehow allowing this law to expire will not harm America.\n  We know that at the heart of this struggle is retroactive liability \nfor communications companies that stepped up, in the wake of the 9/11 \ndisaster, at the request of the Government, to help protect us from \nterrorism. As a result, there are numerous lawsuits pending against \nthese companies, I assume largely by the American Civil Liberties \nUnion. The CEOs and the boards of directors of these companies have a \nfiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. These lawsuits have the \npotential to put them out of business. As a result of doing their duty \nand responding to the request of the President of the United States to \nhelp protect America, they run the risk of being put out of business. \nThat is what is before us. This retroactive liability problem \ncontinues. It is not solved by continuation of existing law.\n  In addition, with the law expiring, it hampers opportunities \nprospectively in the future to surveil new terrorist targets overseas. \nSo the notion that somehow no harm is done by allowing the law to \nexpire is simply incorrect. In fact, it borders on outrageous.\n  This was going to be another example of bipartisan cooperation on \nbehalf of the American people. We saw it at the end of the year last \nyear when we passed a bipartisan AMT fix without raising taxes on \nanybody else. We passed an energy bill without a tax increase and \nwithout a rate increase. We met the President's top line on the \nappropriations bills. And, yes, we appropriated $70 billion for Iraq \nand Afghanistan without any kind of micromanagement. At the beginning \nof this year, we came together. It was a bit challenging in the Senate, \nbut we came together and passed a bipartisan stimulus bill to try to \ndeal with our slowing economy. We did it in record time. In fact, the \nPresident had a signing ceremony 2 days ago.\n  I am wondering why this new bipartisan spirit we experienced in \nDecember and again in January is breaking down on a matter that is \nextraordinarily important to protecting the American people. It is \nabsolutely irresponsible for the House of Representatives to simply \nthrow up its hands and leave, particularly when the only measure that \nenjoys a bipartisan majority in the House is exactly what enjoyed a \nbipartisan majority in the Senate. It is the only measure that can pass \nthe House. So the refusal of the House leadership to take up and pass \nthe only bill that could possibly pass is an act of extraordinary \nirresponsibility. Nothing else would pass over there.\n  I don't know why the House is even thinking about leaving town. They \nhave an important responsibility to help protect the American people. \nThe opportunity is right before them, and they will not take it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield the Senator from Texas for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask the distinguished Republican leader whether the \nvoluntary cooperation of the telecommunications companies that have \ncooperated at the request of the Government and upon certification by \nthe chief law enforcement agent of the country, the Attorney General, \nis in jeopardy, if we merely continue the current law as opposed to \npassing the bipartisan Senate bill? And if that is the case, doesn't \nthat just as effectively deny us access to terrorist communications as \nif we did not pass the law itself?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My understanding is the question suggests the answer. \nThe leadership of these companies has indeed a Hobson's choice, two bad \nalternatives. They either continue to respond to the request of the \nAmerican Government to protect the homeland and then run the risk of \nsquandering all the assets of their companies and, thereby, generating \na lot of shareholder lawsuits against the directors for violating their \nfiduciary responsibility. It is a terrible position to be put in. They \nare entitled to be able to cooperate with the request of our Government \nand not squander all the assets of their companies.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to my friend from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nRepublican leader if, in fact, because of the burden of these lawsuits, \nsome 40 different lawsuits against any telecommunications companies \nthat may have participated, if, in fact, they chose not to participate \nin this program, is there any other option available to the \nintelligence authorities to listen in on communications between \nterrorists who are bent on wreaking havoc, death, and destruction on \nthe American people? Is there anywhere else to go?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't think so, Mr. President. This is the only \nsolution to the problem. What is tragic, we know as a result of a \nletter from the so-called blue dog Democrats, the more conservative \nDemocrats in the House, to Speaker Pelosi for sure that there is a \nbipartisan majority in the House for passing the bill the Senate \npassed. This is what the blue dog Democrats had to say to the Speaker.\n\n       Following the Senate's passage of a FISA bill, it will be \n     necessary for the House to quickly consider FISA legislation \n     to get a bill to the President before the Protect America Act \n     expires.\n\n  That, of course, will be Saturday.\n\n       We--\n\n  Referring to the blue dog Democrats----\n\n     fully support the Rockefeller-Bond FISA legislation, should \n     it reach the House floor without substantial change. We \n     believe these components will ensure a strong national \n     security apparatus that can thwart terrorism across the globe \n     and save American lives in our country.\n\n  The blue dog Democrats, coupled with House Republicans, make it \nabsolutely certain there is a bipartisan majority for our bill in the \nHouse.\n\n       Further, the consequences of not passing such a measure \n     could place our national security at undue risk.\n\n  This is 21 blue dog Democrats in the House requesting the Speaker to \ntake up the bill that passed the Senate with 69 votes, obviously an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote, pass it and send it to the President \nfor signature. This refusal to act is stunning, almost \nincomprehensible.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for one final question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Republican leader is aware that the House of \nRepresentatives only recently had widely publicized hearings into the \nuse of steroids\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\nand human growth hormone by baseball players. There has also been an \naction taken recently to hold a former White House counsel and the \nChief of Staff of the President in contempt. Yet there appears to be no \ntime available on the House calendar to do things that actually would \nprotect the lives of the American people. Perhaps it is an obvious \nanswer, but it would seem to me to be clear that this ought to be a \nhigh priority. Before we get to these kinds of political machinations \nor perhaps publicity stunts, we ought to first protect the security of \nthe American people by passing this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the House \nwas dealing with steroid use in baseball and trying to punish some \nWhite House official over some internal dispute. It does strike me that \nis a strange use of time, when we are 2 days from the expiration of \narguably the most important piece of legislation we have passed since \n9/11 to protect us here at home. It is no accident that we haven't been \nattacked again since 9/11. There are two reasons for it. One is, we \nwent on the offense and have had great success in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nkilling a lot of terrorists, many of them at Guantanamo, which I happen \nto think is a good place for them. A lot of the rest of them are on the \nrun. I am often asked: We don't have Osama bin Laden. I say: Well, we \nwish we did. But I can assure you, he is not staying at the Four \nSeasons in Islamabad. He is in some cold cave somewhere looking over \nhis shoulder, wondering when the final shoe is going to drop. So going \non offense was an important part of protecting America and also this \nextraordinarily significant legislation about which we have had \ntestimony from the highest officials that it has actually helped us \nthwart attacks against our homeland. There isn't anything we are doing \nthat is more important than this, certainly not looking at steroid use \nin baseball. As important as that may be, it certainly does not rise to \nthis level, or censoring White House officials.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to my friend from Arizona for a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the first question I have is: Could the \nintelligence community acquire new targets, if the Protect America Act \nexpires, without going to the FISA Court for some kind of an additional \nwarrant?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding they will not be \nable to do that. So in addition to the retroactive liability issue, \nwhich clearly is not solved by failing to act, we have this problem \nthat the Senator from Arizona has raised with regard to new targets. We \nare clearly more vulnerable as a result of allowing this legislation to \nexpire, which will happen Saturday if the House of Representatives does \nnot act.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator will continue to yield, my recollection of \nthe words of Admiral McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, is \nthat--and I ask the leader to verify if I recall this correctly; I \nthink I am recalling it correctly--it doesn't matter whether the \nProtect America Act expires or does not expire or is simply \nreauthorized in its exiting form; the reality is, unless a new law is \npassed that contains the retroactive liability protection feature, it \nwill become or is becoming increasingly difficult for the \ntelecommunications companies to provide the service the U.S. Government \nneeds them to provide to acquire this intelligence.\n  I wish to make sure I am not misstating this, that it is increasingly \ndifficult for these telecommunications companies to provide the service \nour Government needs to collect this intelligence.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My understanding is, the Senator from Arizona is \ncorrect. It is not exactly that these public, spirited corporate \nleaders do not want to help prevent terrorist attacks. It is that the \nexposure to their companies as a result of these lawsuits runs the risk \nof destroying the company and then opening them up to shareholders' \nsuits for irresponsible actions or violations of their fiduciary \nresponsibilities to their shareholders.\n  They are in an impossible position. We have, in effect, put them in \nan impossible position by failing to provide for them the retroactive \nimmunity from liability they clearly deserve. These were public, \nspirited Americans responding to a request from the Government to help \nprotect us at home. What they got for it was a couple of scores of \nlawsuits.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I still have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry about that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I did not want to interrupt the distinguished Republican \nleader. Have you finished?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield for a question from me?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tried to get the distinguished Republican \nleader to yield, but he was unwilling.\n  Let me ask the distinguished majority leader, is it not a fact that \nthese public, spirited telephone company owners are threatening to turn \noff wiretaps, according to the press accounts, that have been legally \nordered through search warrants because the U.S. Government has failed \nto pay them millions of dollars, and does not pay them the millions of \ndollars? I just wonder if any of the legislation we are talking about \nmight be mandating our own Government to pay the bills for the \nwiretaps.\n  I ask that only because it seems this public spiritedness goes one \nway if they want to be immunized or the administration wants to be \nimmunized from anybody asking them questions, but it goes a different \nway if it comes down to the question of getting paid.\n  Mr. REID. My understanding is, there are millions of dollars owed to \nthe telephone companies, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Texas talked about a \npublicity stunt. That is what we have, but it is inverse. The publicity \nstunt is all from the White House, supported by the people in the \nSenate, the Republicans, who always walk lockstep with whatever \nPresident Bush wants.\n  First of all, Mr. President, legal scholars are almost uniform in \nsaying that existing orders are broad enough and they would be broad \nenough for the next year. Whatever is happening now is good for next \nyear. In fact, if someone disagrees with that, you have existing FISA \nlaw that allows application for an emergency.\n  Mr. President, let me say this: I sent to the President of the United \nStates today a letter. Let me read this:\n\n       Dear Mr. President:\n       I regret your reckless attempt to manufacture a crisis over \n     the reauthorization of foreign surveillance laws. Instead of \n     needlessly frightening the country, you should work with \n     Congress in a calm, constructive way to provide our \n     intelligence professionals with all needed tools while \n     respecting the privacy of law-abiding Americans.\n       Both the House and the Senate have passed bills to \n     reauthorize and improve the Protect America Act. Democrats \n     stand ready to negotiate with Republicans to resolve the \n     differences between the House and Senate bills. That is how \n     the legislative process works. Your unrealistic demand that \n     the House simply acquiesce in the Senate version is \n     preventing that negotiation from moving forward.\n       Our bicameral system of government was designed to ensure \n     broad bipartisan consensus for important laws. A FISA bill \n     negotiated between the House and the Senate would have firmer \n     support in Congress and among the American people, which \n     would serve the intelligence community's interest in creating \n     stronger legal certainty for surveillance activities.\n       That negotiation should take place immediately. In the \n     meantime, we should extend the current Protect America Act. \n     Earlier this week you threatened to veto an extension, and at \n     your behest Senate Republicans have blocked such a bill. \n     Yesterday every House Republican voted against an extension.\n\n  So it is obvious the marching orders have come from the White House. \nThat was a paraphrase from me. That was not in the letter. I continue \nthe letter:\n\n       Your opposition to an extension is inexplicable. Just last \n     week, Director of National Intelligence McConnell and \n     Attorney General Mukasey wrote to Congress that ``it is \n     critical that the authorities contained in the Protect \n     America Act not be allowed to expire.''\n\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\n\n  In commentary, Mr. President, I say this is from the head of the \nNational Intelligence Agency, Director McConnell, and General Mukasey, \nour Attorney General. They said:\n\n       [I]t is critical that the authorities contained in the \n     Protect America Act not be allowed to expire.\n       Similarly, House Minority Leader Boehner has said \n     ``allowing the Protect America Act to expire would undermine \n     our national security and endanger American lives, and that \n     is unacceptable.'' And you yourself said at the White House \n     today--\n\n  That is today, Thursday--\n\n       ``There is really no excuse for letting this critical \n     legislation expire.'' I agree.\n\n  I agree, Mr. President.\n\n       Nonetheless, you have chosen to let the Protect America Act \n     expire. You bear responsibility for any intelligence \n     collection gap that may result.\n       Fortunately, your decision to allow the Protect America Act \n     to expire does not, in reality, threaten the safety of \n     Americans. As you are well aware, existing surveillance \n     orders under the law remain in effect for an additional year, \n     and the 1978 FISA law itself remains available for new \n     surveillance orders. Your suggestion that the law's \n     expiration would prevent intelligence agents from listening \n     to the conversations of terrorists is utterly false.\n       In sum, there is no crisis that should lead you to cancel \n     your trip to Africa. But whether or not you cancel your trip, \n     Democrats stand ready to negotiate a final bill, and we \n     remain willing to extend existing law for as short a time \n     or as long a time as is needed to complete work on such a \n     bill.\n\n  I signed that ``Harry Reid.''\n  Mr. President, the President has created a crisis. As I have said on \nthe Senate floor, during the past 7 years he has become increasingly \nproficient at scaring the American people. That is what he is trying to \ndo again today. Cancel his trip to Africa for this? But we, Mr. \nPresident, are willing to work with him. The expiration of the law \nstands on the shoulders of one person: George Bush. I am sure his ear \nhas been whispered in several times in the last week or so by the Vice \nPresident. But the President is the one responsible ultimately. He has \ninstructed Republicans in the House not to agree to any extension, and \nobviously the Senate Republicans also.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2615\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 571, S. 2615; the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. This is a 15-day extension.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. Reserving the right to object, there is no need \nfor an extension. This current law expires Saturday. We know 68 Members \nof the Senate have already voted for a Protect America Act that would \nextend the law for 6 years. We know a majority of the House of \nRepresentatives, on a bipartisan basis, thinks that law ought to be \ntaken up and passed. That is what we ought to be doing.\n  I am sure the Democrats in the House are grateful to their good \nfriend, the majority leader, for trying to protect them from their \nactions. But the fact is, there is only one reason we have a crisis. It \nis because the House Democratic leadership refuses to act on a bill \nthat enjoys bipartisan majority support in the House of Representatives \nthat we have already passed overwhelmingly. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3773\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nrequest the House to return the papers of H.R. 3773, FISA legislation; \nand that if the House agrees to the request, the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Is it my understanding the first request was objected to. Is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was objection. Objection was heard.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there is \nno need for a conference when you have an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate in favor of the bill and a bipartisan majority \nof the House in favor of the same bill that the Senate has already \npassed. There is no need to go to conference because we know where the \nmajority of the Senate is and we know where the majority of the House \nis. Why would we want to have a conference when the work the Senate has \ndone, the Rockefeller-Bond bill, is supported by a bipartisan majority \nin the House? Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what we are witnessing is not a crisis in \nsecurity. It is a crisis in logic. How can the Republican leader stand \nhere and argue how endangered America would be if we allowed this law \nto expire and then object to extending the law? How can the minority \nleader, Senator McConnell, stand here and argue that we should pass \nthis legislation and then object when the majority leader asks for a \nconference committee?\n  This is not a crisis in security. It is a crisis in logic. This is a \nmanufactured political crisis by the White House and the Republican \nleaders. If the Republican leader was so focused on giving this power \nto the President, he could have said, ``I do not object,'' when the \nmajority leader asked for a 15-day extension.\n  But, no, they want a press release. They want something to put in \nfront of the American people to take their minds off the state of our \neconomy, to take their minds off the fact that we are just, \nunfortunately, a few lives away from losing 4,000 soldiers in this war \nin Iraq. They want to manufacture a security crisis.\n  The Senator from Kentucky should know--and I am sure he has able \nstaff to alert him--the law, as it currently exists, the FISA law--even \nif we do not change it--gives ample authority to this President to \ncontinue to monitor the conversations of those who endanger the United \nStates.\n  But, instead, as Senator Harry Reid has said repeatedly, this \nPresident is trying to make America afraid--make America afraid. I \nthought there was a great leader who said once: The only thing we have \nto fear is fear itself. It turns out that it is fear itself that is \nmotivating this Republican leadership. If they would have provided 30 \nvotes yesterday in the House of Representatives, this law would have \nbeen extended. But they had their marching orders from the White House \nto vote no, and they did. So the attempt to extend it failed. If only \n30 Members on the Republican side in the House had stood up and voted \nto extend the law, it would have happened.\n  If the Republican minority leader, Senator McConnell, had not \nobjected just moments ago to the unanimous consent request of Senator \nReid, the Democratic leader, this law would have been extended.\n  It is obvious to those following the debate, the crisis is in the \nlogic on the Republican side. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot \ncomplain that the law is going to expire, and then object to an \nextension. It does not work that way. Even at the University of \nLouisville, it does not work that way. Their philosophy department \nwould tell you that does not track, it does not follow.\n  So I would urge the Senator from Kentucky, if you really are \nconcerned about whether this law is extended, please reconsider your \nobjection to extending this law, as Senator Reid has asked repeatedly. \nI think the American people know what is going on here. This is not \nabout security. This is about political cover. This is about \nmanufacturing a political argument and manufacturing a crisis--a crisis \nof the White House's own creation. The President and his party bear \nfull responsibility if any intelligence gaps result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, facts are a stubborn thing--a very \nstubborn thing--and I am sure the Democrat leadership over in the House \nappreciates the efforts being made by the majority leader and the \nmajority whip to protect them from the obvious. The obvious is--and \nthey know this even at the University of Illinois--that the majority of \nthe Senate has spoken, an overwhelming majority of the Senate, not just \non final passage which was 68 to 29, and cloture, which was 69 to 29, \nbut also the Feingold amendment\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\nwas defeated 63 to 35, the Dodd amendment 67 to 31, the Feingold \namendment 60 to 37, the Specter-Whitehouse amendment 68 to 30. This is \nnot close. This bill went out of the Senate with a riproaring, \nbipartisan majority. And we know for a fact--and facts are a stubborn \nthing, I say to my good friend from Illinois--we know for a fact that \nthe Rockefeller-Bond bill is supported by a bipartisan majority in the \nHouse of Representatives. We know that. It is a matter of simple \naddition. So why would we want to have a short-term extension to \nprovide an opportunity to resolve a dispute that doesn't exist?\n\n  The majority has spoken in the Senate. The majority will speak in the \nHouse if given the opportunity to speak. They are being denied the \nopportunity to speak because the House runs in a different way from the \nSenate, and the House leadership can simply refuse to take up a matter \nthat is supported by a bipartisan majority in the House. In this \nparticular instance--talk about a publicity stunt or creating a \ncrisis--what created the crisis was the refusal of the House of \nRepresentatives to act. Now, the notion that somehow they didn't have \ntime--we have been dealing with this issue since last August--since \nlast August. The House had previously sent a bill over here that was \nunacceptable. We are all familiar with the subject matter.\n  It is time to let a majority of the House of Representatives speak--\nlegislate. They are waiting there to be given permission to ratify the \nfine work led by Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond here in the \nSenate and ratified by a total of 68 out of 100.\n  So we have a crisis, but the crisis is created by the majority in the \nHouse and its refusal to accept the obvious, which is that a majority \nof the Congress wishes to pass the legislation in the form that will \nachieve a Presidential signature.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Texas for a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Republican \nleader--the majority whip has said there is some sort of crisis in \nlogic, but I ask the minority leader to respond. Isn't the crisis in \nlogic that the telecommunications carriers, whose cooperation is \nabsolutely essential to the continuation of our ability to listen in on \ncommunications between terrorists, isn't that what is at risk here, by \nmerely extending the current law and finally to come to grips with the \nbipartisan legislation that passed the Senate and is supported by a \nbipartisan majority in the House?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Texas, he is \nentirely correct. There are multiple lawsuits pending against the \ncompanies. They are surely being pressured by their shareholders and \ntheir boards of directors on the issue of whether continued cooperation \nmeans the demise of the companies. The status quo, as the Senator from \nTexas indicates, is not acceptable. Not only that, but we know for a \nfact that the continuation of the status quo hampers the ability to go \nup on new targets prospectively, so we not only have a deteriorating \nsituation in terms of continued cooperation from the communications \ncompanies--not because they are not public-spirited citizens, not \nbecause they don't want to help America, but because they run the risk \nof squandering all the assets of their companies and enhanced exposure \nto new actions that might occur by terrorists.\n  So the status quo is clearly not acceptable, I say to my friend from \nTexas. I think his question suggests the answer.\n  This is a very serious matter and I regret that we are where we are. \nWe had gotten off, I thought, to a pretty good bipartisan start this \nyear. I had hoped--and frankly expected--that we would be having \nanother signing ceremony down at the White House on the Rockefeller-\nBond bill in the next few days and we could breathe easy that we had \ndone our job and had protected the American people to the maximum \nextent possible for the foreseeable future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, facts are stubborn. The facts are that \nwithin the last few days, we received a communication from the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States and the man who is the Director of \nNational Intelligence saying: ``It is critical the authorities \ncontained in the Protect America Act not be allowed to expire.'' That \nis a fact. That was followed up with a statement by the House minority \nleader who said: ``Allowing the Protect America Act to expire would \nundermine our national security and endanger American lives, and that \nis unacceptable.'' And today, the President of the United States said: \n``There is really no excuse for letting this critical legislation \nexpire.''\n  Those are the facts. So when we ask to accomplish what they want, \nthere is an objection.\n  It is very clear, this is not an effort by the White House to protect \nthe American people, it is an effort to protect the phone companies. It \nis not the American people.\n  We heard from the Attorney General, we heard from the Director of \nNational Intelligence, the minority leader of the House, and the \nPresident of the United States. We agreed to do what they want to do to \ntry to extend. The Republicans were given the orders not to do what \nthey wanted. Those are the facts.\n  Now another issue that is very important: The majority in the House \nof Representatives and the majority in the Senate have both spoken. A \nbasic elementary rule of this Government is that we have a bicameral \nlegislature. We have the House and the Senate. In November, the House \npassed by a majority what they thought should happen in the way of \nextending this. We, a few days ago, decided what we thought we should \ndo. It is elementary that after that happens, there must be a \nconference. They won't let us go to conference--``they'' meaning the \nRepublicans. So a majority of the House voted in November for a \ndifferent bill. That is why we need a negotiation. That is why we need \na conference. That is how a bill becomes law. That is the way it is. \nThat is the law. We have already decided that facts are stubborn. \nClearly, if we were arguing this case to a jury--and I think probably \nas well the American people--they probably know that this is an effort \nby the President to scare us and in exchange for that, he wants to try \nto take care of the phone companies, not the American people.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, my name has been invoked frequently \nhere over the last several weeks as passing a bill which was not \nfavored by the majority of the people of my aisle, and the phrase \nactually was used by the majority leader, who is never wrong, that we \ndid what the President wanted.\n  I didn't do what the President wanted. I did what I thought was the \nright thing to do. I was joined by a variety of my colleagues, \nincluding the Presiding Officer, who reserved the right to have other \nviews on the floor, which he did, but ended up voting for the bill.\n  What absolutely baffles me is that we are literally--we can do this \nFISA bill. I am meeting tomorrow morning with the chairman of the House \nIntelligence Committee, who may be the only House member in town--I \nhave no idea, but I don't care because he is the chairman--on what we \ncan do to save this. I am absolutely convinced that we can have--in the \nhearing this afternoon, the Presiding Officer heard me put this to the \nDirector of National Intelligence, who couldn't answer it because it \nwas not a policy question, but more of a political question. I said: \nYou are going to get the majority of your information all the way \nthrough August. The President praised our bill and then came out the \nnext day and said: Of course, if the House doesn't pass it, we are \ngoing to lose our intelligence and we will be vulnerable to the \nterrorists. That was a misstatement, I think an annoying misstatement.\n  I don't understand. I simply don't understand, if something is good \nand if the President is willing to sign a bill which this Senator in \nhis conscience feels is right, and it takes 15 days to do it, what the \nminority leader needs to understand--and he served in the House. I am \nsure he understands that they have now been jammed twice. They have \nbeen jammed. There is something called human nature, and it is not \nillegal to talk about human nature on the floor of the Senate. They \nhave been jammed. They have been\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\npushed down to a 2-day period or a 3-day period when they had to make a \ndecision. They resent that. But if they were given a period of time, \nthey would come, in my judgment, to where we are, and the bill would go \nto the President and he would sign it.\n  Now, let me say something more. What people have to understand around \nhere is that the quality of the intelligence we are going to be \nreceiving is going to be degraded. It is going to be degraded. It is \nalready going to be degraded as telecommunications companies lose \ninterest. Everybody tosses that around and says: Well, what do you \nmean? I say: Well, what are they making out of this? What is the big \npayoff for the telephone companies? They get paid a lot of money? No. \nThey get paid nothing. What do they get for this? They get $40 billion \nworth of suits, grief, trashing, but they do it. But they don't have to \ndo it, because they do have shareholders to respond to, to answer to. \nThere is going to be a degrading of the nature of our intelligence in \nsome very crucial areas if we follow the path that the minority leader \nis suggesting, because we will go right back to where we were last \nAugust, and that will be a further jolt to the telecommunications \ncompanies, because they will understand that you cannot count on the \nCongress, you cannot count on us to make policy which will give \nstability to their--not government agencies but to their corporations.\n  Fifteen days. We are off for a week, so maybe it has to be 25 days. I \ndon't know. I don't care about that. We could have the same bill on \nthis floor from the House. I am convinced of it. It is human nature. \nGive them a chance to have a grudge. I am going to meet with the \nchairman tomorrow. Let him rip into me for not giving the House an \nadequate chance for the second time to discuss this matter. But I am \nabsolutely convinced that we could have that bill on the floor in this \nbody and pass it and send it to the President. Why they don't want to \ndo that, I do not know.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES OF UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the ancestors of today's Native Peoples inhabited the \n     land of the present-day United States since time immemorial \n     and for thousands of years before the arrival of people of \n     European descent;\n       (2) for millennia, Native Peoples have honored, protected, \n     and stewarded this land we cherish;\n       (3) Native Peoples are spiritual people with a deep and \n     abiding belief in the Creator, and for millennia Native \n     Peoples have maintained a powerful spiritual connection to \n     this land, as evidenced by their customs and legends;\n       (4) the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new \n     chapter in the history of Native Peoples;\n       (5) while establishment of permanent European settlements \n     in North America did stir conflict with nearby Indian tribes, \n     peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions also took \n     place;\n       (6) the foundational English settlements in Jamestown, \n     Virginia, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, owed their survival in \n     large measure to the compassion and aid of Native Peoples in \n     the vicinities of the settlements;\n       (7) in the infancy of the United States, the founders of \n     the Republic expressed their desire for a just relationship \n     with the Indian tribes, as evidenced by the Northwest \n     Ordinance enacted by Congress in 1787, which begins with the \n     phrase, ``The utmost good faith shall always be observed \n     toward the Indians'';\n       (8) Indian tribes provided great assistance to the \n     fledgling Republic as it strengthened and grew, including \n     invaluable help to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on \n     their epic journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific \n     Coast;\n       (9) Native Peoples and non-Native settlers engaged in \n     numerous armed conflicts in which unfortunately, both took \n     innocent lives, including those of women and children;\n       (10) the Federal Government violated many of the treaties \n     ratified by Congress and other diplomatic agreements with \n     Indian tribes;\n       (12) the United States forced Indian tribes and their \n     citizens to move away from their traditional homelands and \n     onto federally established and controlled reservations, in \n     accordance with such Acts as the Act of May 28, 1830 (4 Stat. \n     411, chapter 148) (commonly known as the ``Indian Removal \n     Act'');\n       (13) many Native Peoples suffered and perished--\n       (A) during the execution of the official Federal Government \n     policy of forced removal, including the infamous Trail of \n     Tears and Long Walk;\n       (B) during bloody armed confrontations and massacres, such \n     as the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and the Wounded Knee \n     Massacre in 1890; and\n       (C) on numerous Indian reservations;\n       (14) the Federal Government condemned the traditions, \n     beliefs, and customs of Native Peoples and endeavored to \n     assimilate them by such policies as the redistribution of \n     land under the Act of February 8, 1887 (25 U.S.C. 331; 24 \n     Stat. 388, chapter 119) (commonly known as the ``General \n     Allotment Act''), and the forcible removal of Native children \n     from their families to faraway boarding schools where their \n     Native practices and languages were degraded and forbidden;\n       (15) officials of the Federal Government and private United \n     States citizens harmed Native Peoples by the unlawful \n     acquisition of recognized tribal land and the theft of tribal \n     resources and assets from recognized tribal land;\n       (16) the policies of the Federal Government toward Indian \n     tribes and the breaking of covenants with Indian tribes have \n     contributed to the severe social ills and economic troubles \n     in many Native communities today;\n       (17) despite the wrongs committed against Native Peoples by \n     the United States, Native Peoples have remained committed to \n     the protection of this great land, as evidenced by the fact \n     that, on a per capita basis, more Native Peoples have served \n     in the United States Armed Forces and placed themselves in \n     harm's way in defense of the United States in every major \n     military conflict than any other ethnic group;\n       (18) Indian tribes have actively influenced the public life \n     of the United States by continued cooperation with Congress \n     and the Department of the Interior, through the involvement \n     of Native individuals in official Federal Government \n     positions, and by leadership of their own sovereign Indian \n     tribes;\n       (19) Indian tribes are resilient and determined to \n     preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their \n     unique cultural identities;\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\n       (20) the National Museum of the American Indian was \n     established within the Smithsonian Institution as a living \n     memorial to Native Peoples and their traditions; and\n       (21) Native Peoples are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and among those are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       (b) Acknowledgment and Apology.--The United States, acting \n     through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors Native Peoples for the thousands of \n     years that they have stewarded and protected this land;\n       (3) recognizes that there have been years of official \n     depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of \n     covenants by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the past and present to move toward a \n     brighter future where all the people of this land live \n     reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward \n     and protect this land together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the \n     United States against Indian tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian tribes within their boundaries.\n       (c) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this section--\n       (1) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (2) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is an amendment brought up at the \nvery outset of this debate. I understand there has been an agreement \nthat we can move forward with this amendment. So I have worked with the \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member, and the modifications \nhave been made.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that we were going to \nvoice vote this amendment. Senator Mikulski is in the room, and she \nwill want to call up her amendment No. 4023. My hope is that we could \nagree to these two amendments en bloc by voice vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. We do not need a recorded vote. I will agree to a \nvoice vote.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Coburn as a cosponsor \nof my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4023\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment No. 4023 be considered en bloc with Senator Brownback's \namendment. I do not need a recorded vote. I am more than happy to \naccept a voice vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, both amendments have been cleared. I ask \nfor a favorable consideration of the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Brownback \namendment No. 3893, as modified, and the Mikulski amendment No. 4023, \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3893, as modified, and 4023) were agreed to en \nbloc.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, be recognized for 7 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n\n                   veterans benefits enhancement act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak--again--\nabout S. 1315, the Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. This \ncritical legislation would affect real change in the treatment of our \nNation's veterans.\n  Provisions in S. 1315 would improve life insurance programs for \ndisabled veterans, expand the traumatic injury protection program for \nactive duty servicemembers, and provide individuals with severe burns \nspecially adapted housing benefits. These provisions are vital to \nimprove benefits and services for our veterans.\n  However, for many months now, S. 1315 has been blocked from debate by \nRepublican Members opposed to a provision in the bill that would extend \ncertain VA benefits to Filipino veterans, residing in the Philippines, \nwho fought alongside U.S. troops during World War II. These veterans \nhave been denied these benefits for over 50 years. I believe it is time \nto give these elderly veterans the benefits that they earned and so \nrichly deserve.\n  In the 62 years since the end of the Second World War, Filipino \nveterans have worked tirelessly to secure the veterans status they were \npromised when they agreed to fight under U.S. command during World War \nII. They were considered U.S. veterans until that status was taken from \nthem by an Act of Congress in 1946.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, I will ask that a letter to Senator \nCraig from General Delfin Lorenzana, the head of the Office of \nVeterans' Affairs for the Embassy of the Philippines, be printed in the \nRecord. This letter presents a historical overview of Filipino \ninvolvement during World War II and what has ensued since that time.\n  General Lorenzana notes that these veterans fought in a war between \nthe United States and Japan, under the U.S. flag as part of the U.S. \nArmy Forces in the Far East. He notes that out of the nearly half-a-\nmillion Filipino veterans who served, only 18,000 survive today. In \nanother decade, only a few of them will remain.\n  I am happy to note that many Filipino veterans enjoy eligibility for \nbenefits and health care services on the same basis as other U.S. \nveterans. However, there is still work to be done in order to extend \nthese eligibilities to all of those who served with the United States \nmilitary during World War II.\n  Last June the committee held a markup where the then ranking member, \nSenator Craig, offered an amendment to reduce the amount of pension \nthat Filipino veterans residing in the Philippines would receive under \nS. 1315. I stress that the amendment was not to strip pension benefits \nfrom the bill entirely--merely to reduce the benefit in line with what \nSenator Craig viewed as appropriate. I disagreed with Senator Craig's \nassessment and his amendment was not adopted.\n  In the months that followed markup, consideration of S. 1315 was put \noff while Republican leadership on the committee suddenly changed \nhands.\n  In late fall, my efforts to seek a middle ground between the level of \npension benefits in the bill as reported, and the level former Ranking \nMember Craig sought during markup, were rejected. When a counteroffer \nwas finally made by the committee's new ranking member, Senator Burr, \nsupported by Senator Craig, it proposed to entirely strip pension \nbenefits from Filipino veterans residing in the Philippines from the \nbill. This is not acceptable to me. It is possible, however, that it \nmight be acceptable to some in the Senate. That is why I continue to \nask that we move forward with deliberation of this measure. Let us have \na real debate on this bill, and then have an up-or-down vote.\n  I again ask that the Senate be allowed to debate this important \nmeasure. Our committee must be permitted to finish our work. America's \nveterans deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from General \nLorenzana, which I mentioned earlier, be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\n\n\n\n                                   Embassy of the Philippines,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     Member, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: In November and December last year, \n     S1315, the Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act (which includes \n     benefits for surviving Filipino World War II veterans) was \n     brought to the Senate Floor for unanimous consent. On both \n     occasions, you strongly objected to the passage of the Bill, \n     specifically Title IV, the portion on Filipino WWII veterans, \n     citing reasons such as: the Filipino veterans are not U.S. \n     citizens; the proposed benefits are too generous; they would \n     have undue advantage over U.S. veterans residing in the U.S.; \n     we have treated them fairly by providing $620M in \n     reconstruction after the war ($6.7B in today's dollars); we \n     have a hospital in the Philippines; we are taking away money \n     from our veterans to give to a foreign veteran--a Filipino \n     (the Robin Hood in reverse effect).\n       It would be reasonable for such arguments to appeal to the \n     American public, especially those who are uninformed of the \n     complete facts of the issue. But in the interest of fairness, \n     it is necessary to see the entire picture.\n       First of all, Filipinos who served under the U.S. Army \n     pursuant to a military order by President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt on July 26, 1941 were in fact U.S. veterans by U.S. \n     definition and the Rider to the Rescission Act of 1946 (PL \n     79-301) was, therefore, grossly discriminatory, unfair and \n     unjust.\n       The Filipino WWII Veterans claim is based on the \n     Philippines' status as a U.S. colony and a U.S. law, the \n     Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934, also known as the Philippine \n     Independence Act. This law was passed by the U.S. Congress on \n     March 24, 1934 to provide self-government to the Philippines \n     leading to its eventual independence from America after a \n     transition period of 10 years. This law mandates that all \n     citizens of the Philippines shall owe allegiance to the \n     United States. Under this law, the United States of America \n     retains control and supervision of national defense and \n     foreign affairs. The President of the United States of \n     America was likewise granted power to call into service all \n     military forces located within the Philippine Commonwealth \n     Government. This power was invoked and exercised by President \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 26, 1941 when war with Japan \n     became imminent.\n       Some have argued that the responsibility for taking care of \n     Filipino veterans rests upon the Philippine Government \n     because they fought for their country. Our Government has \n     been doing this within its resources for more than 60 years. \n     In fact the Philippine Congress is passing a law that would \n     allow these veterans to continue receiving their old-age \n     pensions even after the U.S. has passed a law that would give \n     them veterans benefits.\n       That they fought for their country's liberation cannot be \n     denied. But primarily, these veterans fought in a war between \n     U.S. and Japan, under the U.S. flag as part of the United \n     States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). Japan invaded \n     the Philippines to defeat the American forces stationed \n     thereat which it considered an obstacle in its drive to the \n     resource-rich Dutch East Indies. Some historians have argued \n     that if the Philippines then had not been a colony of the \n     U.S., it could have been easily bypassed by Japan in its \n     southward drive. Because of the vagaries of history we will \n     never know this for sure, but the fact is, Thailand, a \n     country not under a colonial rule, was not invaded.\n       You claimed that the pension benefit is too generous ($375 \n     for veterans with dependents, $300 for single veterans, and \n     $200 for widows of veterans). What is the price of the \n     services and sacrifices so generously given to America by \n     these veterans and the entire Filipino nation during that \n     Great War, Senator Craig? They were prepared to offer the \n     ultimate sacrifice for America. Their homeland was made a \n     battlefield in a war between Japan and the United States. An \n     estimated one million Filipinos, combatants and non-\n     combatants, died in that war. If at all, for so many of these \n     veterans, these benefits may be too little, too late.\n       And yet after the war, these veterans were denied their \n     benefits under U.S. laws by an Act of Congress (PL 79-301). \n     It was a discriminatory, unfair and unjust law because while \n     it barred these veterans from getting benefits it also \n     provided for widows and orphans of those who died in line of \n     duty and to those who had service-connected disabilities even \n     if only at 50 cents to the dollar. But were the services of \n     the survivors less important than those who were killed at \n     the onset of the war and later or those who were imprisoned, \n     wounded and incapacitated?\n       In reality, they were an indispensable part of the \n     underground Army that tied up large number of Japanese forces \n     otherwise deployed elsewhere. They aided and protected \n     American officers and soldiers who escaped capture. They \n     served in the underground units led by USAFFE officers. They \n     provided vital intelligence and forces-in-place that \n     facilitated the counter-invasion of the allied forces that \n     minimized allied casualties. They provided invaluable \n     intelligence and combat support in the rescue of 513 American \n     POWs in Cabanatuan in Central Luzon on January 28, 1945--\n     considered as the most successful rescue in the annals of the \n     U.S. Army. This rescue operation was later made into the \n     acclaimed book ``The Ghost Soldiers'' and eventually into a \n     movie ``The Great Raid''.\n       U.S. role in the Philippine postwar reconstruction and \n     rehabilitation was to be expected. The war, after all, was on \n     account of the United States. But these postwar \n     reconstruction and aid came at a great cost to the fledgling \n     Philippine Republic as this excerpt from a history book \n     states: ``The Philippines had gained independence in the \n     `ashes of victory'. Intense fighting, especially around \n     Manila in the last days of the Japanese retreat (February-\n     March 1945), had nearly destroyed the capital. The economy \n     generally was in disarray. Rehabilitation aid was \n     obviously needed, and President Roxas was willing to \n     accept some onerous conditions placed implicitly and \n     explicitly by the U.S. Congress. The Bell Act in the \n     United States extended free trade with the Philippines for \n     8 years, to be followed by 20 years of gradually \n     increasing tariffs. The United States demanded and \n     received a 99-year lease on a number of Philippine \n     military and naval bases in which U.S. authorities had \n     virtual territorial rights. And finally, as a specific \n     requirement for release of U.S. war-damage payments, the \n     Philippines had to amend its constitution to give U.S. \n     citizens equal rights with Filipinos in the exploitation \n     of its natural resources--the so-called Parity \n     Amendment.'' The aggressor nations were actually treated \n     better.\n       Your statement that granting these benefits to the Filipino \n     veterans is stealing money from U.S. veterans and giving it \n     to a foreign veteran--a Filipino (the Reverse Robin Hood \n     effect), is most unfair to all these veterans, Filipinos and \n     Americans. They served the United States faithfully and \n     selflessly and it is uncharacteristic that they should be \n     pitted against each other over benefits. These Filipinos are \n     U.S. veterans at the end of WWII as pointed out earlier. Our \n     research into U.S. Congressional records of early 1946 \n     indicates that, in fact, it was the Filipino veterans who \n     were stripped of their rightful benefits under U.S. laws by \n     an act of Congress. During the deliberation of the Rescission \n     Act of 1946, the Head of the Veterans Administration \n     testified that the Filipino soldiers who served under the \n     U.S. Army during World War II pursuant to the military order' \n     of President Franklin Roosevelt satisfy the statutory \n     definition of a U.S. veteran and that it would cost the U.S. \n     $3.2B to pay them on equal terms as their U.S. counterpart. \n     Subsequently, the Rider to P.L. 79-301 was inserted to become \n     Sec. 107, Title 38 of the U.S. Code which S1315 aims to \n     amend. How much is $3.2B in today's dollars, Senator Craig? \n     Furthermore, the Rider to P.L. 79-301 provided an \n     appropriation of $200M to the Philippine Army to compensate \n     Filipino veterans. Immediately upon enactment of P.L. 79-301, \n     the Philippine Resident Commissioner to the U.S., the \n     Honorable Carlos P. Romulo, protested the Rider and rejected \n     the $200M appropriation to the Philippine Army. Our research \n     yields no record of the amount going into the Philippine Army \n     budget in the years 1946-48. Again, how much is this in \n     today's dollars? By all accounts, this measure has saved the \n     U.S. billions of dollars at the expense of the Filipino \n     veterans.\n       Mr. Senator, these Filipino WWII veterans were no different \n     from the more than 15 million American men and women who were \n     discharged from the military service at the end of WWII. They \n     came from all walks of life and cross-section of the country \n     the same as their U.S. counterparts: from cities, small \n     towns, farms and villages. But the similarity ends there. \n     After the war the U.S. veterans could go to school under the \n     GI Bill of Rights. They were eligible to generous housing \n     loans, medical and other benefits. Educated and trained, they \n     became a vital cog of postwar America that propelled this \n     great nation to its preeminent place in the world today. Two \n     of your esteemed Senate colleagues, Senators John Warner and \n     Frank Lautenberg, both WWII veterans, jumpstarted their \n     careers through the GI Bill. No such luck came for the \n     Filipino veterans.\n       Senator Craig, the 110th Congress is in a position to \n     redress a 62-year old injustice done to Filipino veterans by \n     the same institution that you now serve, by passing S1315. \n     Out of the original 470,000 listed after the war which the \n     U.S. Army trimmed down to 260,143 in 1948, barely 18,000 \n     survive today. They are in their mid-80s and in about a \n     decade only a few of them would be left. They are not seeking \n     equal benefits as their American counterparts. The Veterans \n     Federation of the Philippines welcomes and fully supports the \n     Senate Veterans Affairs' Committee markup. Your statement \n     that it would give them undue advantage over U.S. veterans \n     residing in the U.S. vis-a-vis the difference in the cost of \n     living in both countries is not the case on closer scrutiny. \n     Whilst the U.S. veterans have access to VA medical facilities \n     & medicines, loan guarantees, low insurance premiums and food \n     stamps the Filipino veterans do not. Only those in Luzon have \n     easy access to the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Manila \n     (a hospital built by the U.S. in 1950 and conveyed to the \n     Philippine Government in 1953) but they usually pay for their \n     own medicines. Whatever meager income they have is augmented \n     by a 5,000 pesos old-age pension from the Philippine \n     Government. Furthermore, the appreciation of the Peso against \n     the Dollar which was 55:1 a year ago is now 40: 1, thus \n     greatly diminishing the real value of the proposed pension \n     benefits.\n       We hope that the debate on the Filipino WWII veterans issue \n     would focus more on the merits of their claims and not their \n     being non-U.S. citizens. After all, this was not an issue in \n     1941 when the U.S. President ordered\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\n     them into the service of the U.S. Army to fight under the \n     U.S. flag. They were U.S. veterans under U.S. law after the \n     war and entitled to VA benefits until PL 79-301 was passed.\n       As we commemorate the Anniversary of the Rescission Act of \n     1946 on February 18, we pray that this 62-year old claim for \n     recognition and benefits of these remaining gallant men and \n     women who served America with utmost loyalty and devotion \n     during WWII be finally granted.\n       Lastly, the Philippines is one of the leading allies of the \n     U.S. in today's war against terror. In the same way that the \n     Filipino soldiers in WWII shed their blood with U.S. soldiers \n     in defense of freedom and democracy, today's Filipino \n     soldiers help make the world a safer and more secure place to \n     live. Would it be too much to ask, therefore, that if only in \n     tribute to their long lasting partnership, that a great \n     injustice be formally corrected and our WWII veterans given \n     the recognition and benefits they so richly deserve. That's \n     all that we ask.\n       With my best wishes for your continued success, I remain\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                          Delfin N.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              section 303\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the senior Senator \nfrom North Dakota for his leadership on the issue of Indian health \ncare. As he and the Senator from Alaska have emphasized during the \ndebate in recent days, our Government must ensure that Native Americans \nhave access to quality health care throughout our country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his support.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand that in the managers' amendment, section \n303(b) of the bill has been modified so that the language is now \nidentical to current law; is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. The intent of the provision in the managers' \namendment to the bill is to maintain current law. Generally, when \nIndian health facilities are constructed or renovated, Davis-Bacon \nprevailing wage rates apply. However, pursuant to current Federal law \nand longstanding policy of the Department of Labor, Indian Health \nService, and Bureau of Indian Affairs, when Indian tribes and tribal \norganizations construct or renovate federally funded Indian health \nfacilities using their own employees, Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rates \ndo not apply. Our intention in the managers' amendment is to maintain \nthe status quo of current law and policy in these regards.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So this language does not change the construction or \napplication of existing statutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Correct, it does not change current law. It is our intent \nthat the prevailing wage provisions in both the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act and the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act will continue to apply when Federal funds are used for \nthe construction\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\nand renovation of Indian health facilities, except where such work is \ncarried out by tribal or tribal organization employees.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. That is my understanding as well. The only reason that \nthe managers' amendment restates section 303, as opposed to simply \nleaving section 303 in current law untouched, is a purely technical \nmatter arising from the difficulty, or awkwardness, of leaving only one \nprovision of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act in place while \nrestating or amending the rest of that act.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct, that is why the managers' amendment \nrestates current section 303 verbatim.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. More specifically, it is my understanding that by \nsimply restating section 303 verbatim in this bill, Congress is not \nsuperseding or altering the effect of the prevailing wage provisions of \nthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act--including \nthe exception referred to by the Senator from North Dakota applicable \nwhen construction or renovation work is carried out by employees of an \nIndian tribe or tribal organization--the regulations promulgated under \nthat act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment No. \n4023, which would halt draconian new rules that would hamstring cost-\neffective case management services under the Medicaid Program.\n  In March of this year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nplans to implement a regulation designed to limit case management \nservices: For children in foster care; for the elderly, who, if not for \ncase management, would be in nursing homes; for Americans with \ndisabilities; and or individuals with severe mental illness.\n  These are Americans who not only live with severe health or mental \ndisabilities, they live in poverty.\n  This administration is nothing if not consistent.\n  This administration consistently woos those with wealth and neglects \nthose in need.\n  Ohio has worked over the past 24 years to develop and fine tune an \neffective system for providing case management to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries who meet a nursing home level of care but want to remain \nin their homes.\n  Enabling these Ohioans, most of whom are elderly, to live \nindependently is not only right, it is smart.\n  Per capita nursing home care is more expensive than per capita home \nhealth care.\n  And home and community-based care fosters independence, self-\ndetermination, and rehabilitation.\n  Case managers are the foundation of this system of care. It cannot \nwork without them.\n  But case managers cannot do their jobs if they are hung up by rules \nthat just do not make sense.\n  CMS is attempting to chop the case management system into pieces, \nwrap it in red tape, and sit back as it withers on the vine.\n  They are limiting case management, as if the lack of it is in some \nway a reasonable solution to rising health care costs. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  At a time when our health care system is overburdened and our economy \nis in a slump, why would we introduce chaos into cost-effective, \ncoordinated care?\n  If the administration hamstrings effective case management, Medicaid \ncosts will not drop, they will likely balloon. Without solid case \nmanagement grounded in seamless administration and service delivery, \nstate Medicaid Programs will lose ground.\n  They will forsake precious progress they have made toward eliminating \nduplicative or unnecessary care, reducing hospitalizations, and \nimproving outcomes.\n  This rule is bad for Ohio and bad for the nation.\n  It is misguided, and frankly, it is cruel.\n  Whether your vote arises from compassion or common sense, I urge \nevery Member to support this amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act and the reauthorization we are considering \ntoday.\n  Passage of this bill in the Senate is long overdue. We haven't passed \nan update to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act since 1992, and the \nlaw has now been expired for 8 years.\n  Since this time, we have seen the continuation of unacceptable trends \nin the health of American Indians and Alaskan Natives. American Indians \nand Alaskan Natives across the country are 400 percent more likely to \ndie from tuberculosis, 291 percent more likely to die from diabetes \ncomplications, and 67 percent more likely to die from influenza and \npneumonia than other groups.\n  In my State of Washington, the average life expectancy of an American \nIndian is estimated to be 4 years below that of the general population, \nas reported by the Indian Health Service for the years 2000 through \n2002. This is a troubling increase from the gap of 2.8 years reported \nby the Indian Health Service for 1994.\n  These disparities must not continue. We owe it to Indian Country to \nmake good on our promise--a promise embedded in long-standing trust \nagreements--to ensure that the health needs of American Indians and \nAlaskan Natives are taken care of.\n  Enactment of this bill, of which I am a proud cosponsor, is a \nnecessary step that will help us fully realize our obligations. The \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act must be reauthorized, and most \nimportantly, modernized to ensure that the services delivered under the \nIndian Health Service reflect the advances made in health care \ndelivery.\n  This reauthorization makes much needed improvements to the way health \ncare is administered to American Indians. It makes new authorizations \nfor home and community based care, a cost-effective and much desired \nalternative to traditional long-term care facilities. It expands \nbehavioral health services to address disorders beyond the traditional \nfocus on alcohol and substance abuse. And it requires that individuals \nin need of mental help get access to a continuum of care such as \nhospitalization and detoxification services.\n  Importantly, this bill includes long-term reauthorization of health \nservices for urban Indians. As my colleagues know, urban Indians \naccount for a vast majority of the American Indian population, with \nnearly 7 out of 10 American Indians and Alaskan Natives living in or \nnear an urban area.\n  Such a large population cannot be left behind in this \nreauthorization. Urban Indians face similar health disparities as their \ncounterparts who live on reservations, and they are not removed from \nour Nation's trust obligation because of where they live.\n  Washington State is grateful for the efforts of two urban Indian \norganizations working to provide critically needed health care to this \nunderserved population. The Seattle Indian Health Board and the \nN.A.T.I.V.E. Project of Spokane have remained strong components of our \nState's health and social safety net, providing over 15,000 unique \npatients with comprehensive primary care, mental health, and social \nservices.\n  The Seattle Indian Health Board also serves as a vital health \nresearch and surveillance center for the country under its Urban Indian \nHealth Institute program. There is much to be learned about the issues \nand barriers facing urban Indians, making the comprehensive collection \nand analysis of information from this program indispensible to our work \nto improve the health of our communities.\n  Continuing Federal support for these and the other 32 entities \ncurrently receiving Federal resources for urban Indian health care must \nremain a top priority under this Government's strategy to address the \ndisparities facing all American Indians.\n  I am excited that we have come so close to passing this \nreauthorization. I hope to work with Chairman Dorgan, Vice Chairman \nMurkowski, and my colleagues on the Indian Affairs and Finance \nCommittees to seeing this through and getting a bill signed into law.\n  However, I want to also urge my colleagues to remember that our trust \nresponsibility does not end with reauthorization of the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act. It continues as we craft a budget for the coming \nfiscal year and make the appropriations for the Indian Health Service. \nThe programs we are about to reauthorize are useless if we don't make \ngains in the\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\npaltry amount of funds for health services, urban Indian health, and \nfacilities construction. As my colleagues know, the Indian Health \nService is only funded at 60 percent of estimated need.\n  Today's actions should be the beginning of a renewed commitment to \nour first Americans. I look forward to starting a new chapter in our \nrelationship with Indian Country.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act Amendments. American Indians and Alaska \nNatives--along with all other Americans--should receive modern, \nefficient, and quality health care. Unfortunately, too many of those in \nthe Indian health system do not receive that care today. This important \nlegislation will change that.\n  Reforming our Nation's broken health care system is one of my highest \npriorities and I strongly support efforts to shore up Indian health \ncare services, such as those proposed in this important legislation. \nLike all Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives cannot prosper \nwithout access to modern, efficient, and quality health care.\n  The most recent census information available indicates there are 2.3 \nmillion American Indian and Alaska Native people in the United States. \nIn my State of Oregon alone there are nine federally recognized tribes, \nand a large urban Indian population. Less than 40 percent of their \npeople reside on reservations. It is a continuing failure of this \nNation that American Indian and Alaska Native people rank at or near \nthe bottom of so many social and economic indicators.\n  Most striking of these indicators are the health statistics involving \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Natives. Diabetes, tuberculosis, alcoholism, \nfetal alcohol syndrome, and increasingly, AIDS, plague America's Native \ncommunities at rates far and above those of other Americans. As of \n2007, there is a $1 billion backlog in unmet needs for health \nfacilities, contributing to the degenerating health of Native \ncommunities.\n  The plight of Native American health care in this country is the \nresult of one simple and tragic fact: The Federal Government has failed \nto meet its promise to Native Americans.\n  Through treaties and statutes, the Federal Government has promised to \nprovide health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives. A critical \naspect of this promise is sufficient funding for the Indian Health \nService, IHS, part of the Department of Health and Human Services. IHS \narranges health care services for Native Americans and provides some \nservices through direct care at hospitals, health centers, and health \nstations, which may be federally or tribally operated. When services \nare not offered or accessible onsite, IHS offers them, as funds permit, \nthrough contract care furnished by outside providers.\n  In addition, in the Indian Health Amendments of 1992, Congress \nspecifically pledged to ``assure the highest possible health status for \nIndians and urban Indians and to provide all resources necessary to \neffect that policy.'' These combined commitments are absolutely \nessential to help the Federal Government meet its legal and moral \nresponsibilities to Native Americans.\n  Sadly, we haven't even come close to honoring these commitments. \nSufficient funding has not been provided. IHS is so underfunded and \nunderstaffed that patients routinely are being denied care that most of \nus would take for granted and, in many cases, would consider essential. \nThe resulting rationing of care means that all too often Indians are \nforced to wait until their medical conditions become more serious--and \nmore difficult to treat--before they can even access necessary health \ncare. The chronic underfunding has only grown worse in recent years, as \nFederal appropriations failed to keep up with the steep rise in public \nand private health care costs and expenditures.\n  The results are startling and disturbing. While per capita health \ncare spending for the general U.S. population is about $7,000, the \nIndian Health Service spends only about $2,100 per person on individual \nhealth care services. The Government also spends considerably less on \nhealth care for Indians than it spends for Medicare beneficiaries, \nMedicaid recipients, and veterans.\n  It is appalling that we can live in one of the most prosperous \nnations on Earth, where most--but by far not all--Americans have access \nto health care services, yet we provide woefully inadequate health care \nfor our Native American population.\n  These resource shortcomings underscore the need to make the Indian \nHealth Service a priority in the Federal budget. It is also why I am \nsupporting an amendment offered by my colleague from the State of \nOregon, Senator Gordon Smith, along with my colleague from Washington \nState, Senator Maria Cantwell. It would provide for innovative \napproaches in funding health care facilities by providing a way to \ndistribute funds more equally with the establishment of an area \ndistribution fund.\n  Each year, I travel to every county in Oregon to learn firsthand the \nchallenges confronting my constituents. I often find that my most \nenlightening visits occur when I travel to Indian Country, especially \nwhen I hear or read compelling stories about Indian health care \nafforded to my tribal constituents. But I am also pleased that the \nnorthwest region has its share of success stories and examples of \nmedical care for Native Americans that have worked.\n  With the support of the Native American Rehabilitation Association's \nDiabetes Prevention Program, made possible by the IHS Special Diabetes \nProgram for Indians, diabetes patients are losing weight and improving \ntheir lifestyle. I am also pleased to note that the One Sky Center, a \nNational Native Resource Center for Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices located at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, \nis the only National Resource Center of its kind in Indian Country. \nIndian Country is in a crisis in combating alcohol, substance abuse, \nand methamphetamine. There is a real need for such a center for not \nonly tribal people, but also for those who work and interface with \nIndian Country to try to find solutions, leverage programs, and build \npartnerships to address these key health issues.\n  In addition, on the national level, the recently reauthorized Special \nDiabetes Program for Indians, SDPI, has had significant success and is \nviewed as a model for improving preventive care and disease management \nfor this significant chronic illness. Tragically, Native Americans are \n2.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than the general \nU.S. population and diabetes mortality is believed to be 4.3 times \nhigher in the Native American population than in the general U.S. \npopulation. The combination of this special program and the legislation \nbefore us today could help make significant strides against this \nongoing public health threat that disproportionately hits Native \nAmericans. Importantly, the SDPI has given Indian health programs and \ntribal communities invaluable resources and tools to help prevent and \ntreat diabetes. And it has had real medically measurable results. In \njust 10 years, the mean blood sugar level has decreased by 13 percent. \nScientific research demonstrates that such a decrease results in a 40-\npercent decrease in diabetes-related complications, such as blindness \nand amputations. Furthermore, on the prevention front, it has also \nincreased school-based prevention programs for children, such as \nincreased physical activity programs, better school lunches, and \nremoval of junk food-filled vending machines, and diabetes awareness \neducation. There are also more community-based wellness centers \noffering exercise and nutrition programs for individuals at risk for \ndiabetes.\n\n  Yet, this program has been funded apart from the traditional sources \nof funding for Indian health care, the IHS. It is imperative that \nCongress pass the Indian Healthcare Improvement Act Amendments so that \nour country can begin to fill the many gaps in Indian health care and \nhave more success stories like the ones I just described.\n  I want to just take a few moments to reiterate how important it is \nfor all Americans that the Federal Government move to reform our \nnation's health care system. It is very clear, in my view, that our \nNation faces a health care crisis. In fact, I think when we get on the \nfloor debating any health program, the Senate will see and the\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\ncountry will see that this debate illustrates how broken our health \ncare system is.\n  Native Americans are not the only Americans who believed they would \nhave health care when they would need it, only to find that faced with \na serious or life-threatening illness the care or coverage available \ndoesn't match their need. Despite paying more per person for health \ncare services than any nation on Earth, so many go without care or \ncoverage. For some Americans, this happens when they have lost a job, \nand hence the coverage that went with it, or they had minimal insurance \nthat doesn't come close to providing them the financial security needed \nto cover the costs of the health care services they need. For 47 \nmillion Americans, often through no fault of their own and despite \nhaving tried to be able to afford or purchase health coverage, they \nfind themselves with no health coverage at all. These fellow citizens \nare at the mercy of hospital emergency rooms should health care tragedy \nstrike them or their families. Plus, in an unconscionably large number \nof cases, they are unable to pay for needed care without risking \npersonal bankruptcy, if at all.\n  Many people agree with the need for change, but have a healthy \nskepticism about whether real, meaningful structural reform is possible \nin our lifetimes. I understand these doubts, and I do not underestimate \nthe challenge. Yet, I do believe we have the possibility of a real \nideological truce now in health care. More and more Senators of both \npolitical parties have come to understand that to fix health care we \nmust cover everybody. If we don't cover everybody, people who are \nuninsured shift their bills to those who have insurance. So colleagues \non my side of the aisle who made the point about getting everybody \ncoverage, in my view, have been correct, and clearly the country and \ncitizens of all political persuasions have come around to that point of \nview.\n  There is also strong support for something the Republicans feel \nstrongly about, and that is not having the government run everything in \nhealth care. There can be a role for a healthy private sector in \nuniversal health care, one where there is a fairer and more efficient \nmarket. And there ought to be more choices; in fact, there can be an \nabundance of choices in a system like Members of Congress enjoy today.\n  I am very pleased that I could join with Senator Bennett of Utah, a \nmember of the Republican leadership, in offering a bill based on just \nthose principles. It is S. 334, the Healthy Americans Act, and it is \nthe first bipartisan universal coverage bill in more than 13 years. The \nlast bipartisan, universal coverage health bill was offered by the late \nSenator Chafee more than 13 years ago. Now we do have the opportunity \nfor the Senate to come together on a bipartisan basis and deal with the \npremier challenge at home, and that is fixing American health care.\n  My fellow Senators, it is my hope that we pass the Indian Healthcare \nImprovement Act Amendments as soon as possible and live up to our legal \nand moral obligations to provide health care services to our Native \nAmerican population. I have been proud to join efforts to increase \nfunding for the Indian Health Service, and I will continue to fight for \nmore IHS funding because it benefits all people, Native and non-Native \npeople, in tribal and surrounding communities. I am pleased to support \nthese needed improvements and funding, which will move forward the \ncause of improved Indian health care.\n\n\n             Life Insurance Benefits for Disabled Veterans\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, a few minutes ago the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee came to the floor and talked about the \nhistory of a bill, S. 1315, the spirited debate we had in committee and \nthe continued negotiations that have gone on since that markup. I am \nhere to announce that today I introduced an alternative bill to S. \n1315. I know I am joined by millions in America who also salute our \nNation's veterans. These brave men and women and their families have \nsacrificed so much to defend our country and to protect our freedoms.\n  As the ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I \ntake very seriously my responsibilities to ensure that our veterans are \ngetting the respect and benefits they deserve.\n  This appreciation is the very reason why I wish to talk about the \nsubstitute to S. 1315. My bill is a commonsense alternative to an \nomnibus veterans bill that was reported out of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs last June contained over 35 provisions compiled from \nother bills.\n  Unlike in past Congresses, S. 1315 does not enjoy the kind of \ncustomary bipartisan support that such omnibus bills have received in \nthe past. Why is this? In addition to all the good things it would do \nfor the veterans, this bill also is a vehicle for a provision that \nwould take money away from helping veterans of the war on terror and \ninstead send the money overseas. I am talking about a provision that \nwould establish a flat rate special pension for World War II Filipino \nveterans who did not suffer any wartime injuries, generally are not \nU.S. citizens, and who do not even live in the United States. In a few \nminutes, I will talk more about the Filipino provision benefits and why \nit is wrong and the wrong priority at the wrong time.\n  First, I wish to share some good provisions of S. 1315 which I have \nincluded in the alternative omnibus bill I have introduced today.\n  S. 1315 has some very important provisions to help our men and women \nwho have fought in the war on terror and should be passed as soon as \npossible by this body.\n  It provides retroactive payments--between $25,000 and $100,000--to \nall disabled veterans who sustained severe injuries since the war on \nterror began. Currently, severely injured veterans can only receive \nthis retroactive payment if they sustained their injuries in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. But if they were injured on the way to or returning from a \ncombat zone, they are not eligible. This provision would correct that \nmistake.\n  It also increases the amount of insurance coverage available to \nseverely disabled veterans under the Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance \nProgram.\n  Additionally, it provides adapted housing and auto grants to veterans \nwith severe burn injuries who require modifications to their homes or \ntheir vehicles. And it provides severely injured service men and women \nwith housing grant assistance who temporarily live with family members \nwhile still on Active Duty. My bill would keep these provisions and \nother good provisions from S. 1315.\n  So what would my bill do that differs from S. 1315?\n  First, it would eliminate the provision that creates a special \npension for non-U.S. citizens, Filipino veterans who live in the \nPhilippines and do not have wartime injuries. This would free up over \n$220 million to spend on benefits for veterans of Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  It is important to note it would still provide over $100 million to \ngrant full equity to Filipino veterans living in the United States and \nfull disability compensation for those living abroad who have service-\nrelated injuries.\n  Also, my bill would create savings by changing how S. 1315 would fund \nState approving agencies, the entities that accredit schools and \ntraining programs for VA education benefits. My bill would begin to \ntransition these entities from entitlement funding to discretionary \nappropriations. Subjecting these agencies to the annual appropriations \nprocess would help make sure veterans are being well served by any \nfunds spent on this bureaucratic function.\n  My bill then takes these savings, the savings we have gained from \neliminating this pension fund for non-U.S. citizens and Filipinos not \ninjured in the conflict and it would provide funding to increase the \nspecially adapted housing grants for severely disabled veterans from \n$50,000 to $55,000 and for less severely disabled veterans from $10,000 \nto $11,000. It would then annually adjust the amount of these grants \nfor inflation.\n  My bill would also increase the auto grant assistance for \ntraumatically injured veterans from $11,000 to $16,000, and then also \nindex that grant for inflation.\n  This benefit provides mobility and freedom to people such as SGT Eric \nEdmundson--whom my colleague from North Carolina talks about \nfrequently--a young veteran from my State of North Carolina who lost \nthe use of his legs after being injured during combat. As a result, \nEric now uses\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\na motorized wheelchair. The expense to get a van that is wheelchair \naccessible is enormous. This provision makes it financially possible \nfor others, such as Eric, to afford what most of us take for granted: \nmobility.\n  My bill would also provide annual increases in the funeral assistance \nand plot assistance benefits to families of deceased veterans to keep \nup with inflation.\n  It would increase ``kickers'' for members of the Guard and Reserve \nfrom $350 to $425 per month, providing extra monthly education benefits \nthat may be paid to members with certain critical skills.\n  It also allows Guard and Reserve personnel activated for a cumulative \n2 years after the war on terror began to receive maximum education \nbenefits. The current requirement is either 3 cumulative years or 2 \ncontinuous years of service. This change will make it easier for our \nmen and women who have gone on multiple deployments, including many of \nthe Guard and Reserve from my home State of North Carolina, to earn the \nhighest level of education benefits.\n  With these changes to S. 1315, we have a well-balanced package of \nbenefit enhancements for our Nation's veterans which could garner the \nsupport of the entire Senate.\n  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about S. 1315 in its current \nform. The problem with S. 1315 is the provision that creates a special \npension for World War II Filipino veterans. This is both wrong and it \nis costly. It is wrong because it takes money from American veterans \nand sends it to the Philippines to create a special pension for \nnoncitizen, nonresident Filipino veterans with no service-connected \ndisabilities.\n  Allow me to explain this provision in S. 1315 and what it would \nactually do.\n  It proposes to send $328 million over 10 years in benefits for \nFilipino veterans. Although I am supportive of the increased benefits \nfor Filipino veterans residing in the United States and even increasing \nbenefits for Filipinos with service-connected injuries residing \nelsewhere, I cannot support sending $221 million to the Philippines to \ncreate a special pension for noninjured Filipino veterans.\n  To some, this may sound like a nice thing to do, and I fully respect \ntheir desire to recognize the valued service made by Filipino veterans \nin defense of the Philippine islands. But I point out that our \nGovernment has already done a great deal to provide for Filipinos who \nfought in World War II.\n  For instance, after the war, the United States gave $620 million to \nthe Philippines for repair of public property and war damage claims; \nprovided partial-dollar VA disability compensation to Filipinos with \nservice-related disabilities, and provided benefits to the survivors of \nFilipinos injured in the war.\n  The United States also provided $22.5 million for the construction \nand equipping of a hospital in the Philippines for the care of Filipino \nveterans and later donated that hospital to the Philippine Government. \nOn top of that, the United States continues to provide annual grants to \nsupport the operation of that hospital in the Philippines.\n  For those Filipinos legally residing in the United States, the \nbenefits are even more robust. They are eligible for full-dollar \ndisability compensation, for cash burial benefits, access to our VA \nhealth delivery clinics and medical centers, and burial in our national \ncemeteries.\n  With these initiatives and others, our Government has taken a \nsignificant step to recognize the service of Filipino veterans. More \nimportantly, the money that S. 1315 would send overseas to create a new \nspecial pension for Filipinos is money that is needed in the United \nStates to support our men and women who have served our country, \nespecially in Iraq and Afghanistan. Simply put, with our Nation now at \nwar, this Filipino pension provision is the wrong priority at the wrong \ntime.\n\n  Since the committee's markup, we have tried to refocus this bill and \nthe priorities that so many of our colleagues share, such as enhancing \nbenefits for men and women fighting in the war on terror. Because those \nefforts have not worked, I introduced today an alternative omnibus bill \nto 1315. I kept most of the provisions found in 1315 because it is \ngenerally a good bill. It would provide enhancements to a wide range of \nbenefits for our Nation's veterans.\n  In short, my bill serves as a fair and just compromise. It improves \nbenefits for Filipinos, but it also places the appropriate priority on \nour returning OIF and OEF veterans. I believe it is a reasonable \nalternative to S. 1315, and I believe it is one we can all embrace and \npass quickly. I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I am ready to debate the contents of this bill against S. 1315. I am \nsure, if the leadership sees fit, they will set the structure up to do \nthat. But it is important that every Member of the Senate and every \nAmerican understand we have done a tremendous job of supporting people \nwho have fought with us in battle, and the Filipinos are no different. \nThe reality is, at this time, we should focus on the needs of those who \nare U.S. citizens, the needs of those who were injured in battle, but \nnot to create a special pension fund for individuals who had an \naffiliation, and I might say that exceeds the annual income of most \nFilipino residents.\n  I urge my colleagues to learn about this issue and to get ready to \nengage in debate.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       honoring our armed forces\n\n                       Sergeant Edward O. Philpot\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of a fallen \nsoldier. On October 23, 2007, SGT Edward O. Philpot of Manchester, KY, \nwas on patrol with U.S. soldiers and members of the Afghan National \nArmy in Kandahar, Afghanistan, conducting tactical convoy operations in \nhostile territory. Sergeant Philpot was killed in a tragic humvee \nrollover accident. He was 38 years old.\n  Sergeant Philpot handled a number of jobs in his unit, from gunner to \ndriver to humvee commander. He was proud to wear the uniform and proud \nto serve his country.\n  ``Ed had found his calling with the military,'' says Renee Crockett, \nhis sister. ``He loved being a soldier and felt he was finally doing \nexactly what he was supposed to do.''\n  For his bravery in uniform, Sergeant Philpot received numerous medals \nand awards, including the Bronze Star Medal.\n  Military service ran in Ed's family, as his Uncle Willard Philpot of \nManchester served in Vietnam and, sadly, perished in Thailand. Family \nmembers saw a lot of similarities between Ed and his uncle, who died \nbefore Ed was born. ``Both were quiet, warm, and caring individuals, \nand both gave the ultimate sacrifice while serving their country,'' \nsays Renee.\n  Raised by his parents, Ottas and Willa Philpot, Ed grew up a student \nof history. He soon amassed a personal library of books on many \nhistorical figures. He was also a fan of mystery books, and enjoyed a \nsharp political debate.\n  Ed was born in Farmington, MI, and grew up in that State. As a child, \nhe spent all his holidays and most of his summers in Kentucky, in \nManchester, with his paternal grandparents Walter and Lillie Philpot, \nand would travel back and forth often between Kentucky and Michigan.\n  When Ed was only 8 or 9 years old, he began to learn how to play the \nsaxophone. One day he took out his horn to practice and found a perfect \naudience in Sandy, the family dog, sitting on the patio. Young Ed began \nplaying with all the charisma and passion he could muster, but it \nwasn't good enough for Sandy, who ran all the way to the backyard and \nburied her head beneath her paws. Thus ended Ed's musical career.\n  Ed graduated from Garden City High School in Garden City, MI, in 1987 \nand Coastal Carolina University in Conway, SC, in 1992. After college, \nEd returned to Manchester, where he spent some of the happiest times of \nhis youth.\n  Ed went into law enforcement, becoming the director of a home \nincarceration program. In 1995, he married Stephanie, and they raised \nthree beautiful daughters, Hollen, Lily, and Ella Grace. Eventually, Ed \nand his family settled in South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\n  Ed's family was the most important thing to him. ``He would take his \ndaughters out to the coffee shop for cookies on Saturday mornings,'' \nhis sister Renee said. Ed loved to take walks with them and ride them \non his shoulders. He would also take them for daddy-daughter dates to \ncelebrate their accomplishments.\n  Sergeant Philpot's family ``was clearly his life and his \nmotivation,'' says MAJ Bill Connor, who served with him in Afghanistan. \n``He spent his little bit of off-duty time going to the nearest bazaar \nto buy trinkets for his daughters and his family.''\n  Ed enlisted in 2001 and served with the South Carolina Army National \nGuard's 1st Battalion, 263rd Armor Regiment in Afghanistan, where he \nwas promoted to sergeant. He enjoyed the simple pleasure of giving \ncandy to Afghan children.\n  ``He was one of the most dedicated men you would ever see,'' said SGT \nKenneth Page, who served alongside Sergeant Philpot. ``He always liked \nto hang around at the armory, even when it wasn't drill weekend. He \njust liked to be there.''\n  The Philpot family is in my prayers today as I recount Ed's story. We \nare thinking of his wife Stephanie; his daughters Hollen, Lily, and \nElla Grace; his father Ottas; his mother Willa; his sister Renee \nCrockett; his nephew Trevor Crockett; his niece Taylor Crockett; and \nmany other beloved family members and friends.\n  Ed was predeceased by his grandparents Walter and Lillie Philpot and \nTom and Viola Hollen, all of Manchester.\n  His funeral service was held October 30 last year in Manchester at \nthe Horse Creek Baptist Church. After the service, the funeral \nprocession stopped for a moment of silence in front of Hacker \nElementary School, where the entire student body and staff assembled \noutside. Ed's parents had both attended Hacker Elementary as children.\n  Thirty-eight young students each held a red, white, or blue balloon, \none for each year of Ed's life. At the same moment, they released the \nballoons up into the air. The rest of the students held up American \nflags, in honor of the soldier who had given his life for that same \nflag.\n  ``Ed was always quick with a smile and a positive attitude that was \nremembered by all,'' says his sister Renee. ``He is definitely a \nhero.''\n  I want the Philpot family to know that this Senate agrees, and today \nwe honor SGT Edward O. Philpot's life of honor and of service. His \nimmense sacrifice made on behalf of his Nation, State, and family \nallows us all to live in freedom.\n\n\n                 Important Mile Marker in War on Terror\n\n  Mr. President, an important mile marker in the war on terror was \npassed late Tuesday night. A terrorist by the name of Imad Mugniyah, \none of the world's most wanted murderers and a top commander of \nHezbollah, was killed in Damascus. With his death, long-delayed justice \nhas finally been served.\n  News reports are still coming in, and so far no one has claimed \nresponsibility for his death. But we know one thing for certain: As \nSean McCormack, a spokesman for the State Department put it, ``The \nworld is a better place without this man in it.''\n  Let me describe for my colleagues just a few of this murderer's many \nheinous crimes. American officials accuse him of plotting the 1983 \nbombing of a U.S. Marine compound in Beirut, killing 241 troops.\n  He is accused of masterminding a car bomb which exploded at an \nAmerican embassy in Beirut, also in 1983, killing 63 people.\n  American prosecutors charged him in the hijacking of a TWA jetliner \nin 1985. He is also accused of shipping arms to violent, radical \nterrorist groups.\n  And then there is one brutal act that struck deep in the heart of my \nhometown of Louisville, KY. Imad Mugniyah was behind the brutal \nkidnapping, torture and murder of U.S. Marine COL William Richard \nHiggins.\n  Colonel Higgins was a Kentuckian, born in Danville. He graduated from \nSouthern High School in Louisville, participated in ROTC at Miami \nUniversity in Ohio, and served multiple tours in Vietnam.\n  Over a 20-year military career, he received numerous medals and \nawards, including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense \nSuperior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star with \ncombat ``V'' and the Purple Heart.\n  On February 17, 1988, Colonel Higgins was captured by armed \nterrorists in Lebanon while serving on a U.N. peacekeeping mission. He \nwas held, interrogated and tortured.\n  A year and a half after his capture, terrorists released a grisly \nvideotape of Colonel Higgins's lifeless body, hung by the neck, which \nplayed on television sets around the world.\n  In Louisville, we built a memorial to Colonel Higgins on the grounds \nof his alma mater, Southern High School.\n  We were outraged then and we are still outraged now to see what \nhappened to this good and brave man at the hands of thugs.\n  Now, at long last, we know justice has been brought to his murderers.\n  In an essay titled ``My Credo,'' Colonel Higgins once wrote: ``As an \nofficer of Marines, I believe it is my charge to set the example.''\n  Well, Colonel, the high-school students in Louisville who pass by \nyour memorial every day will always remember the example you set. You \nserved your country with pride, and now may rest in peace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is difficult to speak publicly or \nprivately expressing your views that you are glad someone is dead, but \nI say, through the Chair to my friend, the distinguished Republican \nleader, I join in his remarks. This was a vicious man.\n  There is nothing we can do to restore the lives of those he is \nresponsible for killing, the number of which we don't know.\n  But what happened yesterday will cause this man not to be involved in \nkilling other innocent people. So as difficult as it is to recognize \nthat someone's life has been snuffed out, it goes without saying that \nfor mankind this was the right thing to do. However it happened, it was \nthe right thing to do. This was a person who was waiting for the next \nopportunity to see what he could do to act out his devilish ways.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk on the \nsubstitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Dorgan \n     substitute amendment No. 3899 to S. 1200, the Indian Health \n     Care Improvement Act Amendments.\n         Harry Reid, Russell D.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment occur at 5:30 \np.m., Monday, February 25; that if cloture is invoked on the \nsubstitute, all postcloture time be yielded back except for the times \nspecified in this agreement, and that the managers each have 10 minutes \nof debate for their use;\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\nthat all debate time be equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that Senator DeMint be recognized for up to 1 hour to speak with \nrespect to any of his pending germane amendments; that with respect to \nthe Vitter amendment No. 3896 and a first-degree germane amendment from \nthe majority on the subject matter of Vitter, that debate time on these \ntwo amendments be limited to 60 minutes each; that the Smith amendment \nNo. 3897 be limited to 20 minutes of debate; that no further amendments \nbe in order, and that upon the use of time with respect to the DeMint \namendments, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the \namendments; that the vote sequence occur in the order in which the \namendments are listed in this agreement except the majority amendment \nwith respect to the Vitter amendment would occur first; that there be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to each vote; further, that upon the \ndisposition of all pending amendments, the substitute, as amended be \nagreed to, and the bill be read a third time, and the Senate then \nproceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the bill; that if \ncloture is invoked, all postcloture time be yielded back, and without \nfurther intervening action or debate, the Indian Affairs Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 1328, the House \ncompanion, and the Senate then proceed to its consideration; that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. 1200, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be advanced to \nthird reading, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that upon passage of H.R. 1328, S. 1200 be returned to the \ncalendar; further, that the mandatory quorum be waived; provided \nfurther that if cloture is not invoked, this agreement is null and \nvoid.\n  I would further inform all Members that debate time utilized will be \nutilized on Monday. We will have three votes on Monday beginning at \n5:30, and we will have the other two votes Tuesday morning. Senator Kyl \nasked for this. I think it is reasonable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say that I send my appreciation to \nChairman Dorgan and Ranking Member Murkowski. They worked very hard. Of \ncourse, I want to express my appreciation to Senator Kyl who has been \ninvolved in our getting to this point. He has been a big help to our \ngetting here. It has been a difficult road.\n  It is a bill that is long overdue but certainly is necessary to do. I \nappreciate everyone's cooperation. I am going to confer briefly, in a \nmatter of minutes, with the distinguished Republican leader to \ndetermine if there is any reason for us to be in session tomorrow.

Mr. President, on Monday, February 18, the United States \nwill celebrate President's Day. President's Day takes on a particular \nsignificance this year, as the Nation is actively involved in the \nselection process for a new President. It is heartening to see the \nlevel of interest and participation in all of the Presidential campaign \nevents and in the primaries and caucuses. It is a sign that Americans' \nfaith in the basic processes of their Government is still strong, even \nas a recent poll indicates that the public holds a very low opinion of \nthe current President and of Congress. In a 1789 letter to Richard \nPrice, Thomas Jefferson wrote that, ``Whenever the people are well-\ninformed, they can be trusted with their own Government. Whenever \nthings get so far wrong as to attract their notice, they may be relied \nupon to set them to rights.'' I believe we are witnessing the truth of \nThomas Jefferson's observation.\n  As early as 1796, Americans were observing the birthday of our first, \nand still one of our greatest, Presidents, George Washington. According \nto various old style calendars, George Washington was born on either \nFebruary 11 or February 22, 1732. On whichever date people preferred, \nPresident Washington's birthday was feted with ``Birthnight Balls,'' \nspeeches, and receptions. Here in the Senate, one of our most enduring \ntraditions is the annual reading of Washington's 1796 Farewell Address \nby a current Member of the Senate. This practice began in 1862, and \nbecame an annual event in 1893. Beginning in 1900, the Senator who read \nthe address then signed his or her name and perhaps wrote a brief \nremark in a book maintained by the Secretary of the Senate. For the \nhistorically curious, both Washington's Farewell Address and a \nselection of the remarks from the book can be found on the Senate's Web \nsite (www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/\nFarewellAddressBook.htm).\n  After the 1865 assassination of President Lincoln, another revered \nPresident who was also born in February, similar memorial observations \nsprang up around the Nation. In 1865, both Houses of Congress gathered \nfor a memorial address. President Lincoln's birthday became a legal \nholiday in several States, although it did not become a Federal holiday \nlike President Washington's. However, in 1968, legislation was enacted \nto simplify the Federal holiday schedule. As a result, Washington's \nbirthday observance was moved to the third Monday in February, \nregardless of whether or not that day was February 22. Officially, this \nholiday is still known as Washington's Birthday, but it has become \npopularly known as President's Day to honor both Washington and \nLincoln, as well as all who have served as President.\n  Why were President Washington and President Lincoln so widely and \nspontaneously revered by the public, even in the immediate aftermath of \ntheir deaths, before time had a chance to burnish their memories and \nfade their less enobling characteristics? Certainly, the great events \nthat were shaped for the better by their decisions were a major factor. \nBoth George Washington and Abraham Lincoln made a name for themselves \nas inspiring leaders of men and the Nation during pivotal wars in our \nNation's history. Both demonstrated true patriotism, a deep love of the \nNation that was the prism through which they viewed all problems and \nmade all decisions. Both men selflessly sacrificed their own personal \nlives to serve the Nation throughout their lives.\n  In honor of President's Day, I urge everyone to listen to or read \nWashington's Farewell Address and apply its wisdom to the Nation's \ncurrent situation and to the decision each of us will make in November. \nA collaborative effort between George Washington and the authors of The \nFederalist Papers, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, \nHenry Cabot Lodge wrote of the Farewell Address that ``. . . no man \never left a nobler political testament.'' In it, Washington supported \nthe Federal Government as ``a main pillar in the edifice of your real \nindependence . . .'' warned against a party system that ``. . . serves \nto . . . agitate the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false \nalarms . . .'' and ``. . . kindles the animosity of one . . . against \nanother.'' He stressed the importance of religion and morality, \nfamously warned against the entanglements of permanent foreign \nalliances, cautioned against an over-powerful military establishment as \n`` . . . inauspicious to liberty . . .'' and urged the Nation to ``. . \n. cherish public credit . . .'' by using it as little as possible. Only \nthen could the Nation avoid the accumulation of debt, because ``. . . \ntowards the payments of debts there must be Revenue, that to have \nRevenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised, which are \nnot . . . inconvenient and unpleasant.'' We cannot have our cake and \neat it, too--tax cuts and deficit spending cannot occur simultaneously \nif the economy is to remain sound over the long run.\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\n  Washington's experience and wisdom may serve us well as the true \nlitmus test to apply to our prospective 44th President. Mr. President, \nI close with a poem by the author of The Life of Abraham Lincoln, \nJosiah Gilbert Holland (1819-1881) called ``God, Give Us Men!'' Penned \nbefore women had won the right to vote, it nonetheless resonates today \nand applies to anyone, man or woman, who would lead our Nation.\n\n                           God, Give Us Men!\n\n     God, give us men! A time like this demands\n     Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands;\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office can not buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie;\n\n     Men who can stand before a demagogue\n     And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking!\n     Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog\n     In public duty, and in private thinking;\n\n     For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds,\n     Their large professions and their little deeds,\n     Mingle in selfish strife, lo!

Mr. President, I never cease to be amazed at \nour senior colleague, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, for the great \noratorical skills he has, the vast memory store he carries, of which we \nhave just had an example that from memory he can recite poems and he \ncan recite historical dates. He is such an inspiration to the rest of \nthe Senators, and he is, indeed, the pillar upon which this Senate \nrests. Once again, we have been treated to the oratory of the great \nSenator from the State of West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am happy to yield to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I deeply thank the able and distinguished \nSenator from the State of Florida in which I once lived. I thank him. I \ncherish his friendship. May he ever be one for whom the motto ``E \npluribus unum'' will dwell in his heart.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, that is about the best \nadmonition this Senator could have. E pluribus unum--out of many, one. \nI am grateful to the Senator from West Virginia for reminding not only \nme but the whole Senate of that duty, that responsibility, that \nobligation we all have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1047-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FARC HOSTAGE TAKING\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it has been 5 years since four \nAmericans disappeared in the jungles of Colombia while helping that \ncountry's Government fight its war against narcoterrorism. Five years \nago yesterday, a single-engine plane carrying these Americans lost \nengine power and crashed into the jungle. One of those Americans and a \nColombian colleague were brutally executed by the terrorist group the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as FARC. The \nremaining three--Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes, and Goncalves--were \ntaken hostage by the FARC and have since languished in the Colombian \njungle prison, where they are held despite repeated appeals for their \nfreedom.\n  Fortunately, we think, through recent news crews, that those \nAmericans are still alive. They are being held somewhere in an \nundisclosed location in the jungle along with untold numbers of other \nhostages. These men were involved in our decades-long struggle against \ndrugs that are polluting our children's minds and the lawlessness in \nColombia. Their sacrifice and those of their families--and most of \nthose families live in Florida--is all too real. We can't forget them. \nThat is why I am making these remarks after this 5-long-years' \nanniversary that occurred yesterday.\n  Last year, I introduced a resolution condemning the FARC for its use \nof hostage taking and drug cultivation to visit terror upon peaceful \npeople. Our colleagues passed that resolution, which also called for \nthe immediate release of all those FARC hostages, including the \nAmericans I have mentioned.\n  I am here today, after 5 long years of these Americans' captivity, to \nagain remind our colleagues of the plight of these men and their \nfamilies and to ask for their support in doing everything possible, as \nwe continue to try to secure their freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Florida \nraising the issue of people whom we hope to get out alive and also \nappreciate the poetry of my colleague from West Virginia. I, too, am \namazed and quite a bit envious that he has so many poems memorized and \nhe can deliver them so well. It is a lost art, more of his generation \nthan mine, but maybe it will come back in the next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1047-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1047-S1049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CRISIS IN CONGO\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to raise the awareness of my \ncolleagues to an issue. I will be putting in a bill on it and hope to \nattract their attention.\n  I have worked on Africa for some period of time. A humanitarian \ncrisis of incredible proportions is taking place in many places in \nAfrica. We need to do more, and a lot more people are doing more.\n\n  I think we are at a moment where Africa is becoming a focus in both \nEurope and the United States, left and right; for economic reasons, the \nChinese are going in very aggressively; for militant Islamic reasons, \npeople are coming in trying to penetrate into the continent.\n  One of the first things we need to do to be able to grow the \ncontinent and allow people there to develop some sort of standard of \nliving, some sort of quality of life and to be able to live, is to get \nthe conflict out. One of the key things we need to go at in reducing \nthe conflict is getting the money out of the conflict. We have had some \nsuccess about this in the past.\n  A decade ago, people were talking about blood diamonds in Western \nAfrica and getting those out of the trafficked portion, out of the \ncommodity business, and getting them into legitimate means of commerce. \nOut of that, we reduced the money into the conflict, and, as a result, \nhad a substantial impact on the conflict and reducing the conflict in \nWestern Africa.\n  I wish to show a picture to my colleagues, many of whom I think \nprobably are not aware of what it is. This is coltan. It is a booming \ncommodity that is in this item. I realize, and I hope my colleagues, \nparticularly the Senator from West Virginia, will allow me to show \nthis, what should not be on the Senate floor, but to show this for \npurposes of demonstration of what this is doing and why it is \nimportant.\n  This is a BlackBerry. Cell phones used to get hot when people would \nuse them for a period of time. They tried to figure out what can we do \nto try to cool them down. They found a substance called coltan that \nthey were able to transition into tantalum. It now carries the current \nin this electronic equipment. It doesn't get hot. Eighty percent of \nAfrica's coltan comes out of Congo. Eighty percent of the world's \ncoltan comes out of Africa, and most of this comes out of a conflict \nregion in Eastern Congo.\n  I believe most of this is funding a good portion of the conflict in \nEastern Congo, where 1,500 people a day are dying because they cannot \nget access to medical care, they cannot get access to water, they \ncannot get access to food--because of the conflict. And the conflict is \nfunded by this stuff: It is funded by coltan.\n  There is a long history of what has been taking place in Congo. Many \npeople remember reading such books as ``The Heart of Darkness'' and \n``King Leopold's Ghost'' and about the raiding that has taken place in \nCongo for a century. Unfortunately, we are in the latest chapter of \nthat conflict.\n  In Joseph Conrad's ``Heart of Darkness,'' Conrad describes King \nLeopold's colonial project of the Democratic Republic of Congo, then \nknown as Congo Free State, as ``the vilest scramble for loot that ever \ndisfigured the history of human conscience.'' Solely for the purpose of \nextracting a very precious manufacturing resource of the day--and that \nresource was rubber--King Leopold seized Congo and exploited the local \npopulation by turning it into a slave colony. During his 24-year \ntyranny of Congo Free State, 13 million Congolese died. Leopold's \nlegacy lives on in the coltan mining processes of today.\n  That is chapter one.\n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\n  Chapter 2: In November of 1965, Lieutenant-General Mobutu seized \npower of Congo, then known as Zaire, in a bloodless coup. During his \n32-year dictatorship, he consistently exploited the natural resources \nof then Zaire. He evaded international humanitarian human rights \nstandards, and by the mid-1980s, Mobutu's personal fortune was \nestimated at 5 billion U.S. dollars.\n  The end of the Cold War brought internal and external pressure upon \nMobutu for a democratic transition. In 1997, with the support of \nBurundi, Uganda, and the Rwandan Tutsi Government, Laurent Kabila and \nhis forces pushed Mobutu out of Government in a full-scale rebellion.\n  A repetitive pattern of alliances made and broken began, and by 1998 \nKabila's former allies in Uganda and Rwanda had turned against him. In \n2001, Kabila was assassinated.\n  While he succeeded his father and took charge of the country in 2001, \nit was not until November 2006 Joseph Kabila was democratically elected \nas the Congolese President. However, his control of Congo is limited. \nToday in the mineral-rich eastern region of Congo, violent thugs from \nat least four factions wage near constant war for control.\n  Chapter 3: Sadly, 100 years later, Conrad's statement about the Congo \nwas not only astute but prophetic. The corruption and exploitation of \nnatural resources in the Congo has never stopped but has moved from \nhand to hand and moved from one resource to another; from rubber to \ndiamonds, from diamonds to gold, from gold to coltan.\n  The issue of conflict coltan--so we are calling it ``conflict \ncoltan'' and ``conflict commodities''--is not new. The coltan rush hit \nin the late 1990s, as the consumer electronic industry figured out we \nhave a problem, we have to solve this, and coltan arrived to the \nrescue. By December of 2000, a pound of coltan was worth as much as \n$400.\n\n  In 2001, a panel of experts for the United Nations went to eastern \nCongo and wrote a report on their findings concerning the illegal \nexploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth. The U.N. \nreport documents the rebel groups' use of forced labor, illegal \nmonopolies, and civilian murder in their high-stakes game to extract \nthese valuable resources.\n  I wish to show you a picture.\n  This picture was taken in 2007 of some of the mining techniques of \nthis coltan in the coltan rush. You can see a child here, in a very \nshallow mine, using a hammer and a pick to dig out coltan.\n  What is taking place is, many of these rebel groups will overrun a \nvillage, scatter the men, go directly to the coltan area, taking the \nwomen and children, and then start the extraction of coltan, to mine it \nand put it on the backs of people to carry it out at $400 a pound.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey has identified that most of the coltan \nmining in Congo is ``artisan.'' According to the U.N. report, most \ncoltan mining is done by poor people, and many of them are children.\n  These novice miners, who are often held against their will, sift for \ncoltan in riverbeds or dig it out of abandoned mines.\n  A report issued by the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International \nStudies, a review in 2002, found that the ``supply chain'' of coltan is \nextensive and distorted. The SAIS review report states that Rwanda and \nUganda were directly or indirectly appointing local rebel faction \nleaders and field commanders to serve as conduits for illicit trade \noriginating from the occupied territories of eastern Congo. The war \nappears now to be self-financing.\n  Rebel movements were motivated by economic incentives rather than the \npursuit of political ideals.\n  Middlemen were then hired to form relationships with clients. They \nthen facilitated transactions between those who controlled the \nresources and foreign corporations without the question of legitimacy.\n  At the time of the U.N. report of 2002, 34 foreign companies were \nidentified in importing minerals from the Congo via Rwanda.\n  The war in Congo officially ended in 2003 with a signed peace \nagreement between the Congolese Government and the rebels.\n  Yet, at the same time, rebel factions still controlled the east, and \nthere was no centrally elected government in Congo. Rwandan and Ugandan \nsoldiers were still attacking territories in the provinces of Ituri and \nthe Kivu across the boarder in eastern Congo.\n  With the election of President Kabila in 2006, it was reported that \nneighboring governments withdrew their troops from Congo.\n  But now chapter 4. The story continues. The U.N. and SAIS reports I \nhave cited were published in 2001 and 2002 respectively. However, these \npictures I am showing you were taken within the last 12 months.\n  The current fighting in eastern Congo--there was a peace agreement \nrecently signed, and then it was broken 2 days ago--involves renegade \nGEN Laurent Nkunda and his group, the National Congress for the Defense \nof the People, the Mai-Mai rebels, the Hutu extremists, and those loyal \nto the Congolese Government.\n  Now, if all these names can seem a bit blurring to people, at the \nbottom line, I hope you can remember two factors here: 1,500 people a \nday dying because of this; $400 a pound for coltan, financing this \ndeath and destruction daily.\n  After the release of the U.N. report, we saw companies within the \nhigh-tech industry respond to the report by asking suppliers to certify \nthat the tantalum--that is what coltan is processed into--tantalum they \nwere purchasing did not originate from the eastern region of DRC.\n  These same companies stated that without certification they would not \nbuy from the region of Central Africa. They were requesting that their \ntantalum be ``conflict free'' and from legit sources, and I applaud \ntheir efforts. Today, we know that most of the world's tantalum is \nsupplied by Australia. That is the processed coltan. But now where does \nAustralia get the coltan and these companies get the coltan?\n  Recent reports state that the channel in which coltan was once being \nsmuggled out of Congo is still alive and active. And in this chain of \nsupply and demand, one simple bad actor involves us all.\n  Recent reports state that Rwanda and others are using the war in \nCongo to continue the exploitation of coltan. Once it is extracted, we \nare told, it is then sent down to Australia, where it is mixed with \nAustralian coltan--where 20 percent of the world's coltan comes from--\nbefore being processed into tantalum. Processed tantalum is then traded \namong countries and private companies on the international market.\n\n  But as some private companies and some foreign countries are not \nrequired to produce public records of their tantalum trade, tracking \nexact amounts is extremely difficult to obtain.\n  Australia, specifically, has a confidentiality clause for private \ncompanies that purchase their tantalum. So we do not know. From 2002 to \n2005, Australia accounted for 54 percent of the world's tantalum. \nUnfortunately, it is impossible to say with any certainty that the \ntantalum supply coming out of Australia is conflict free.\n  While we know this exploitation continues today, as it did 10 years \nago, and we see the immense difficulty in tracking it, we will not turn \na blind eye to this.\n  I met with people from the consumer electronics industry today to \ntell them we are going to focus on this because if this can defund the \nconflict so people can live free and be able to survive--get some clean \nwater, get some health care, get some food--then we need to go at this. \nWe should not fund this conflict. We should not be buying the product \nif it is coming from conflict areas. We should be able to certify that \nis the case.\n  I commend to my colleagues a recent report from the International \nRescue Committee entitled, ``Mortality in the Democratic Republic of \nCongo, An Ongoing Crisis.'' This was released on January 22 of this \nyear, citing that 1,500 people a day are dying. In this report, we \nlearn that since 1998, 5.4 million people have died in Congo--5.4 \nmillion. These deaths can be directly or indirectly attributed to the \nongoing conflicts in the region, which can be attributed to the \nexploitation of natural resources, primarily coltan mining.\n  Death comes at the butt of a gun and with the bite of a mosquito. \nThere casualties stem from the violence of this\n\n[[Page S1049]]\n\nbrutal ongoing war, which has marred the country for the past 10 years, \nand from the resulting displacement of the Congolese. When you flee for \nyour life in these areas of Congo, there often is no other town or \nvillage in which to take shelter.\n  When you ask a Congolese about becoming displaced, their response to \nyou is: Which time? They flee into the bush for months at a time with \nonly the clothes on their back and a child in their arms.\n  Senator Durbin and I went to Congo together 2 years ago. We saw some \nof the impact.\n  Chapter 5. I want to show you a specific story here, a heartbreaking \nstory of one young boy and his family.\n  This is a picture of a 3-year-old boy. He is one of the millions of \nvictims of displacement and malnourishment. His family fled into the \njungle from a rebel group that had burnt their village to the ground in \nthe North Kivu Province in the eastern part of Congo. They lived in the \njungle and had been constantly on the move. Food became scarce, and \nmeals became as sporadic as two to three a week.\n  When his mother brought him and his younger brother to the local \nhealth clinic, they were immediately referred to an international \nhumanitarian organization in the area. There, this young boy was \ndiagnosed with malaria. They immediately began his treatments, which \nhis small, frail body rejected.\n  His doctors then discovered he had been eating that which his mother \ncould gather in the jungle and only once every 3 to 4 days. Due to lack \nof nutrition, he was anemic. As they started his anemia treatment, his \nbody began to shut down; he rejected the oral and IV treatments.\n  This 3-year-old passed away within 8 hours of first being diagnosed--\nminutes after this photo was taken. He is one of the millions of \nvictims from this raging, complex conflict. As the IRC reports, the war \nis having direct and indirect impact on these deaths. While a small \nportion is dying directly from the conflict--bullets, bombs, and rifle \nbutts--the majority are dying from malaria, malnourishment, diarrhea, \nand poor neonatal care.\n\n  While children under the age of 5 make up 19 percent of the \npopulation in the Congo, they comprise over 47 percent of the deaths in \nthe recent mortality study. Nineteen percent of the population under \nthe age of 5, 47 percent of the deaths in Congo.\n  The national rate of mortality is 60 percent higher in the Congo than \nthe average mortality rate in sub-Saharan Africa. Sexual violence and \nrape is also on the rise in the Congo and has become a symptomatic tool \nof war there.\n  The U.N. reported 4,500 sexual violence cases had been reported in \nSouth Kivu the first half of 2007. Most of these cases reported have \nbeen committed by some of the 6,000 to 7,000 members of foreign armed \ngroups operating in the eastern part of the Congo, funded by coltan \nthat we purchase to put in our Blackberries.\n  The U.N. reported that the Congolese national army, national police \nforce, and increasing numbers of civilians were also brutalizing women, \noften during violent clashes with political rivals. Perpetrators are \nnow making no distinctions between women and children. The local \nhospital in Goma, Congo, where Senator Durbin and I both visited, a \nhospital named Heal Africa, tells a story of a 13-year-old girl who had \nbeen raped so viciously by her perpetrators that she couldn't walk for \n2 weeks. She then walked approximately 7 miles to a facility for \ntreatment. Her doctors reported her internal injuries were beyond their \nimagination.\n  A collapse in infrastructure such as the one we see in the Congo does \nnot happen overnight. This is due to an ongoing 10-year conflict which \nhas exploited that country, its people, its children. Coltan and other \nnatural resources are at the root of that exploitation.\n  I want to show another display here. In spite of their sad history, \nthe Congo is a beautiful country with resilient people. It is a country \nwith so much potential for growth and development. Unfortunately, the \nCongo's story is one of devastation, forced labor, child soldiers, \nrape, curable illnesses left untreated, and deaths of 1,500 a day, as I \nhave stated, and all because, all because of--and funded by this--a \nBlackberry that we buy.\n  My colleagues can see here in the pictures taken of a very \nrudimentary mine, but a mining operation of coltan in the Congo; rebel \nchild soldiers--very common in this part of the world--well armed, \ndeadly; a coltan battery, and cell phones.\n  Peace agreements call for implementation of a commission to oversee \nthe conflict in this region. The Goma peace agreement was signed on \nJanuary 22, 2008. I mentioned that previously, and that has recently \nbeen broken. The immediate cease-fire of the peace agreement was broken \nthe first time within 5 days after it took place. While we must play \nour part, they must play their part as well, and I strongly urge all \nparties in that region to respect their commitments within this \nagreement.\n  The peace agreement calls for implementation of a commission to \noversee disarmament of the Nkunda rebels and the extremist fighters. \nThese fighters will either integrate into the Congolese national army \nor demobilize.\n  I strongly urge the implementation of these terms. This is another \nstep in the right direction for the Congo and its people. However, I \nfeel that as long as there is demand for valuable Congolese resources \nand thugs with the power to control these resources, this will not be \nthe final chapter of this conflict. It has happened for too long.\n  The United States is completely dependent on foreign supplies of \ntantalum, and we admit to this. Both the ``Minerals Yearbook,'' \npublished by the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Department of \nStrategic and Critical Material Report to the Congress, coltan, also \nknown as tantalum, is classed as a ``critical'' mineral.\n  We have come to a point where we cannot live without this mineral. \nHowever, neither can we ignore nor will we sit idly by while others \nsuffer. We need to be responsible as a nation and as consumers. We must \nhold our suppliers accountable.\n  In the coming days I will be introducing legislation requiring \ncertification of the origin of coltan for all U.S.-based companies that \nuse tantalum in manufacturing. It will further require manufacturers \nwho use tantalum to have a certificate of origin. All we want to do \nwith this is make sure that the coltan, the tantalum we are using, \ncomes from legitimate sources. That is all we are asking. As a supply \nchain, the Congolese government can set this up, saying that we \nregister and license and saying this is the coltan that is coming out \nof here, coming from legitimate sources. I am fine with that. But we \nwant that and we want to know where it is coming from and that is that \nit is not conflict coltan that is used to pay for the suffering of so \nmany people.\n  We all must be good actors in this chain. With 1,500 people dying a \nday, there is no room for turning a blind eye on this matter.\n  American greatness has always been founded on our fundamental \ngoodness. We need to be a nation where the strong protect the weak and \npeople of privilege assist those in poverty. It says a lot about the \nkind of America we all should work for when we speak out against this \ntype of tragedy and commit ourselves to those who are suffering there.\n  I will be sending around a ``Dear Colleague'' letter about this. I \nwill be happy to supply more information. There are a number of reports \nfrom the United Nations and from Johns Hopkins that I have been citing, \nand others. We have some photographs of what is taking place presently, \nand I ask simply that if people are going to cause this suffering which \nwe completely disagree with, they are not going to do it by us paying \nfor it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1049-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1049-S1050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING SENATOR DANIEL K. INOUYE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with great pleasure I extend my most \nheartfelt congratulations to our esteemed colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Daniel K. Inouye, for casting his 15,000 vote in the \nSenate.\n  Many times on this floor I have referred to Senator Inouye as my \n``No. 1 hero,'' and he is. Few have ever served our country more \nbravely and with more loyalty and determination than has Senator \nInouye.\n\n[[Page S1050]]\n\n  Daniel Inouye was a member of the famed 442nd Infantry Regimental \nCombat Team of World War II, the most decorated Army unit in U.S. \nhistory. During one bloody battle, Platoon Leader Inouye led an assault \non a heavily defended Nazi position. Although gravely wounded, he still \nmanaged to destroy three Nazi machine gun nests. Anyone who is not \nfamiliar with the details of this amazing display of heroism should \nmake it a point to become so.\n  For his incredible heroism, Dan Inouye was awarded the Distinguished \nService Cross, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the Congressional \nMedal of Honor, making him one of only seven Senators to have achieved \nour Nation's highest military honor. Senator Inouye is the Senate's \nonly Congressional Medal of Honor recipient from World War II.\n  In 1963, he became the first Japanese American to serve in the U.S. \nSenate, where he continues to represent his State and our country with \ngreat distinction and dedication. This man of incredible integrity has \nworked tirelessly in the Senate on behalf of his constituents and our \ncountry. Senator Inouye served on the Select Committee on Presidential \nCampaign Activities--Watergate Committee--the Select Committee on \nSecret Military Assistance to Iran, and the Nicaraguan Opposition, \nIran-Contra. He is the next in line on the Democratic side to chair the \nSenate Appropriations Committee and is currently the chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense.

Mr. President, I was sad to learn that Richard Darman \npassed away last week. Mr. Darman was a good man, an outstanding public \nservant, and a great American. I liked him very much. Dick Darman was a \ngraduate of Harvard and Harvard Business School whose career in \nWashington spanned two and a half decades. He served in five \nPresidential administrations and worked in six Cabinet departments and \nthe White House.\n  Mr. Darman was a player in many of the important events of the last \nquarter of the 20th Century. While serving in the Justice Department, \nhe helped arrange the plea bargain that eased Vice President Spiro T. \nAgnew out of office. Along with his boss, Attorney General Elliot \nRichardson, he was a victim of the infamous Saturday Night Massacre of \nthe Watergate era. He served in the Reagan administration, eventually \nrising to the position of Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, where he \nhelped formulate the economic policies of the Reagan revolution and \nhelped negotiate the 1986 Tax Reform Act. And he served as Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget in the administration of the first \nPresident Bush.\n  It was during the 1990 budget summit that I really came to know and \nrespect Mr. Darman. I quickly learned that Budget Director Darman was a \npragmatist and a realist, who was opposed to budget gimmicks and simple \nand easy solutions to our Nation's fiscal woes. Concerned about a \ndecade of devastating budget deficits he called for serious, realistic \nsteps to get our Nation's budget under control. And he was not opposed \nto working with Democrats in seeking those solutions. As a result, we \nwere able to craft the landmark 1990 deficit-reduction plan--a deal \nbetween a Republican-controlled White House and a Democratic Congress \nthat marked a high point of bipartisan cooperation. This budget \nagreement helped reverse a decade of budget deficits and gave the \neconomy a boost that lasted for more than a decade. Along with \nPresident Clinton's 1993 budget agreement, it helped lay the groundwork \nfor the fiscal balance and economic growth of the 1990s.\n  This incredibly successful budget agreement, unfortunately, destroyed \nMr. Darman's career in government. This man of deep integrity and \nincredible intelligence was eventually forced out of Government because \ntoo many people in his own political party had ideological differences \nwith the contents of the 1990 budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, I extend my most heartfelt condolences to his wife \nKathleen and his three sons and all of his family and friends. I am so \npleased and proud to consider myself as one of the latter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1050-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1050-S1051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SERVICES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the enactment of bipartisan Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA, reform legislation late last year, Congress \ndemanded and won more openness and accountability in monitoring the \nactivities of our Government. But, regrettably, just weeks after this \nhistoric open government legislation was signed into law, there are \ntroubling signs from the Bush administration regarding how this law \nwill be enforced.\n  Last week, the President buried a provision in the administration's \nfiscal year 2009 budget proposal that would move the functions of the \nnew Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, which was created \nunder the OPEN Government Act, from the independent National Archives \nand Records Administration to the Department of Justice. The \nPresident's proposal is not only contrary to the express intent of the \nCongress, but contrary to the very purpose of this legislation--to \nensure the timely and fair resolution of American's FOIA requests.\n  The Office of Government Information Services was established to, \namong other things, mediate FOIA disputes between Federal agencies and \nFOIA requestors, review and evaluate agency FOIA compliance and house \nthe newly established FOIA ombudsman. When Senator Cornyn and I drafted \nthe OPEN Government Act, we intentionally placed this critical office \nin the National Archives, so that OGIS would be free from the influence \nof the Federal agency that litigates FOIA disputes--the Department of \nJustice. We also placed OGIS in the apolitical National Archives to \nenhance this office's independence, so that all Americans can be \nconfident that their FOIA requests would be addressed openly and \nfairly.\n  Given the clear intent of Congress to establish OGIS as an \nindependent office in the National Archives, the President's budget \nproposal should not--and cannot--go unchallenged. What's more, given \nthe Justice Department's own abysmal record on FOIA compliance--a \nrecent Bureau of National Affairs Daily Report for Executives article \nfound that the Justice Department's Office of Information Policy is \nburdened by increasing FOIA backlogs--it is simply unfathomable that \nthis agency would be entrusted with overseeing the processing of \nAmerican's FOIA requests.\n  When the Congress unanimously passed the OPEN Government Act just a \ncouple months ago, Democrats and Republicans alike joined together in \npromising the American people a more open and transparent government. I \nintend to work to ensure that that this was not an empty promise, but \none that will be honored and fulfilled.\n\n[[Page S1051]]\n\n  I call on all Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle and in \nboth Chambers, to join with me to ensure that the Office of Government \nInformation Services is promptly established and fully funded within \nthe National Archives. The American people have waited for more than a \ndecade for this office and for the other historic FOIA reforms \ncontained in the OPEN Government Act. They should not be forced to wait \nany longer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from a \ncoalition of more than 40 different open government organizations that \nstrongly oppose moving the Office of Government Information Services to \nthe Department of Justice be printed in the Record.\n  Congress must work to beat back the administration's ill-advised \nattempts to undermine the intent of Congress in a bill that this \nPresident signed into law. In the coming weeks and months, I will be \nworking with other advocates of FOIA in the Senate to do just that.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd, Chairman\n     Hon. Thad Cochran, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran: We are \n     writing to express our concern that the Bush Administration's \n     proposed FY 2009 budget attempts to repeal a section of law \n     and shift funding for a new Office of Government Information \n     Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records \n     Administration (NARA) to the Department of Justice (DOJ). \n     President Bush signed the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in \n     our National Government Act (OPEN Government Act), which \n     creates OGIS at NARA, a mere five weeks ago. We urge you to \n     ensure the President's budget reflects congressional intent \n     and the explicit mandate of the statute as the budgetary \n     process unfolds.\n       Currently, the president's budget proposes: ``The \n     Department of Justice shall carry out the responsibilities of \n     the office established in 5 U.S.C. 552(h), from amounts made \n     available in the Department of Justice appropriation for \n     General Administration Salaries and Expenses. In addition, \n     subsection (h) of section 552 of title 5, United States Code, \n     is hereby repealed, and subsections (i) through (I) are \n     redesignated (h) through (k). (Commerce, Justice, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008.)'' (Section 519 of Title V \n     of the Department of Commerce; p. 239 of the Appendix)\n       The OPEN Government Act (P.L. 110-175) established OGIS \n     specifically at NARA. It did so as a result of congressional \n     findings that interests promoted by the Freedom of \n     Information Act (FOIA), as well as American traditions and \n     ideals regarding the value of an informed citizenry and the \n     legitimacy of representative government, were being \n     insufficiently served by the existing system of agency \n     practices and implementation, in which DOJ has been the lead \n     agency for 30 years. Additionally, since it is the \n     responsibility of the Department to defend its government-\n     agency clients in litigation brought by requestors, there is \n     a built-in conflict of interest in vesting DOJ with \n     responsibilities to resolve FOIA disputes informally and to \n     hold agencies accountable for FOIA implementation. Congress \n     specifically directed the creation of an ombudsman office \n     apart from the Department of Justice for mediation of \n     contested requests, thus reducing the amount, and concomitant \n     costs, of litigation--burdens whose reduction would be \n     beneficial to all. The new office, established with strong \n     bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress, also has the \n     critical mandate to evaluate agency implementation of FOIA \n     with a disinterested eye.\n       We strongly oppose this effort to use the budget process to \n     rewrite the law, undermining congressional intent and \n     flouting a specific statutory mandate. We urge you to \n     appropriate necessary funds to establish the Office of \n     Government Information Services in the National Archives and \n     Records Administration, as your legislation wisely requires, \n     and, to reinforce the intent of the OPEN Government Act, \n     reject Section 519 of the proposed budget.\n           Sincerely,\n         Access Reports, Inc.; American Association of Law \n           Libraries; American Association of Publishers; American \n           Civil Liberties Union; American Library Association; \n           American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression; \n           Association of Research Libraries; Bill of Rights \n           Defense Committee; Californians Aware; Citizens for \n           Responsibility and Ethics in Washington; Citizens for \n           Sunshine; Coalition on Political Assassinations; \n           DownsizeDC.org, Inc.; Electronic Frontier Foundation; \n           Essential Information; Feminists for Free Expression; \n           Government Accountability Project; Indiana Coalition \n           for Open Government; The James Madison Project; Justice \n           Through Music; League of Women Voters of the U.S.;\n         Liberty Coalition; Maine Association of Broadcasters; \n           Minnesota Coalition on Government Information; National \n           Coalition Against Censorship; National Freedom of \n           Information Coalition; The National Security Archives; \n           9/11 Research Group; OMB Watch; Open Society Policy \n           Center; OpenTheGovernment.org; PEN American Center; \n           Project On Government Oversight; Public Citizen; \n           Readthebill.org Foundation; The Rutherford Institute; \n           Society of Professional Journalists; Society of \n           Professional Journalists Montana Professional Chapter; \n           Special Libraries Association; Sunlight Foundation; \n           United States Bill of Rights Foundation; Velvet \n           Revolution; Washington Coalition for Open Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1051-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I congratulate the American Society of \nHematology--ASH--on its 50th anniversary and to pay tribute to the \ncontributions they have made in preventing and eliminating blood \nrelated diseases.\n  The society has grown substantially from its 200 members at its \ninception in 1958, to over 15,000 members presently, and is recognized \nas the world's premier organization in research promotion, clinical \ncare, education, training, and advocacy in the field of hematology.\n  Society members consist of practitioners and researchers who have \nbeen able to translate Federal research dollars into effective \ntreatments for millions of people afflicted with diseases that were at \none time untreatable and fatal. The blood and blood-related diseases \nstudied and treated by hematologists include disorders such as leukemia \nand lymphoma, thrombosis, anemia and bleeding, and congenital disorders \nsuch as sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, and thalassemia. The \nadvancements in remedies of these disorders are a direct result of the \ncontinuing efforts made by the AHS.\n  I sustained an episode with Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer 2 years ago. \nThat trauma, that illness, I think, could have been prevented had that \nwar on cancer declared by the President Nixon in 1970 been prosecuted \nwith sufficient intensity. All of us know people who have been stricken \nby fatal diseases and many other maladies. It is my hope that other \norganizations will use the success of the AHS as an example in \ncontributing to this Nation's desire for finding cures for the most \nfatal diseases.\n  As chairman, and now ranking member of the appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, I have been an ardent \nsupporter of securing Federal funds for the National Institutes of \nHealth the crown jewel of the Federal Government, maybe the only jewel \nof the Federal Government. Health is the country's No. 1 capital asset, \nand the American Society of Hematology has contributed to its success.\n  Hematologists have been instrumental in pioneering the use of \nhydroxyurea in the treatment of sickle cell disease and have developed \nthe first successful cure of childhood leukemia. Moreover, \nhematologists were responsible for the research that led to, Gleevac, \nthe first anticancer drug developed to target a molecular problem that \ncauses chronic myelogenous leukemia.\n  The American Society of Hematology has played an important role in \nthe unprecedented growth and advancement of hematology research. With \nso many great successes over the past 50 years, I am confident the next \n50 years will bring ASH and its over 15,000 members even more \naccomplishments in treating and eliminating blood diseases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1051-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1051-S1052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        COMMENDING ESTHER G.

Kee who is retiring as president of the United States-\nAsia Institute which she cofounded with the late Joji Konoshima in \n1979, with the encouragement and support of then-President Jimmy \nCarter.\n  The objectives of the United States-Asia Institute are to promote \nbetter understanding between the United States and Asia, to conduct \nwork and educational visits to Asia for Members of Congress and their \nstaff, to maintain close ties with Asian diplomatic missions, to \norganize international and\n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\nconferences and symposiums in the U.S. and Asia on political, economic, \nand security topics, and to host small, off-the-record meetings of \nAmerican and Asian officials, businessmen and academic leaders \nproviding a venue for free and open discussions and exchange of views.\n  Under Mrs. Kee's stewardship, the institute has successfully met its \nobjectives, and I am confident that it will continue to do so under the \ntutelage of her successor. One of Mrs. Kee's most successful \ninitiatives has been staff codels which she has organized and led. As \nan example, there were 70 staff codels with 800 senior congressional \nstaff that traveled to China to meet and discuss issues with high \ngovernment officials. This has facilitated mutual understanding, a core \nobjective, and people-to-people diplomacy the benefits of which will \ncontinue to inure to our mutual benefit.\n  As Mrs. Kee retires from active leadership of the United States-Asia \nInstitute, I have every confidence that she will continue to be active \nin the institute and United States-Asia relations as a valued adviser. \nOn a personal level, I look forward to her continued counsel and \nadvice.\n  Mahalo nui loa--thank you very much--Esther G.

DELL'OLIO\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish today to commend someone whom \nI have admired for my entire time in this body, a man who has committed \nhis life to helping society's most vulnerable. Joe Dell'Olio, who is \nretiring after 35 years at Child, Incorporated, is a dedicated public \nservant in the true sense of the word.\n  Joe started at Child, Inc., of Wilmington after spending his early \ncareer fighting to reduce Delaware's crime rate. In 1972, after just 2 \nyears as the executive director of the Delaware Agency to Reduce Crime, \nwe saw the crime rate cut by 7 percent. As the head of the agency \nresponsible for leading that fight, perhaps no one was due more credit \nthan Joe.\n  Joe then joined Child, Inc. in 1973, the same year I was sworn in to \nthe Senate. As executive vice president, he was responsible for the \ndevelopment and administration of a wide range of advocacy and service \nprograms for victims of domestic violence and their families. Joe and I \ngrew together as we fought to empower and protect victims of domestic \nviolence in our community.\n  While I labored in the Senate to write and pass the Violence Against \nWomen Act, Joe Dell'Olio was on the front lines in our battle. He was \nthe one on the street or in the counseling room. He was the one \nsecuring legal help when victims could not afford it. And he was the \none who made sure someone was there when a victim had nowhere to go.\n  I consider the Violence Against Women Act my proudest legislative \naccomplishment. But the Joe Dell'Olios of the world are the ones who \ndeserve the credit for our progress. Joe has received several awards, \nincluding some from the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and \nHuman Services.\n  Throughout my career, I have been privileged to work with some of the \nfinest public servants our Nation has ever known, those who committed \ntheir lives to the greater good. None have been more unwaveringly \nfocused on a worthy cause than has Joe Dell'Olio, even as he raised a \nloving family of his own. Joe's tireless sense of duty and his \nunrelenting service never cease to amaze me.\n  I wish him the best in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1052-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF LARKSPUR\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the city of Larkspur, located in \nMarin County, CA.\n  The city of Larkspur was incorporated into the State of California on \nMarch 1, 1908. This year, we celebrate its centennial anniversary. With \na downtown that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, \nthe architecture that defines the city of Larkspur has fascinated and \ncharmed visitors for decades. Its historical structures and natural \nsurroundings provide residents and visitors alike a glimpse of \nCalifornia the way it was at the start of the 20th century.\n  The city is divided into two distinct areas, with its historic \ndowntown area to the west of Highway 101 and Larkspur Landing, an \noutdoor shopping area with sublime bay views, to the east of Highway \n101. Just across the street from Larkspur Landing, travelers can catch \nthe Larkspur Ferry to the San Francisco Ferry Building, a ride that \noffers spectacular views of Mount Tamalpais, Angel Island, and the \nGolden Gate Bridge. This outstanding natural scenery in the midst of \nsuch a finely preserved historical setting makes the slogan ``Meet me \nin Larkspur'' a common phrase amongst residents and visitors alike.\n  From the preservation of historic Magnolia Avenue to the conservation \nof the celebrated Blue Rock Inn, the city of Larkspur offers visitors a \nvibrant look at smalltown California as it was in the early 1900s. For \n100 years, the city of Larkspur has not only served as a recreational \nescape and historical wonderland for those visiting the city but a \nplace to call home for its more than 11,000 residents. I commend the \ncity of Larkspur for maintaining the natural beauty and historical \nsignificance that defines this fine city.\n  The city of Larkspur's vision and commitment to protecting its small \npiece of California history should be commended. I congratulate the \ncity of Larkspur for its hard work on this special occasion, and I look \nforward to future generations having the opportunity to visit and enjoy \nthis unique city.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1052-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF CAROLYN DOWNS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the service of \nCarolyn Downs. She has tirelessly worked on behalf of the poor \nthroughout her life, including many years of outstanding service as the \ndirector of The Banquet in Sioux Falls, SD. Carolyn has been committed \nto providing a safe place where people may gather to receive \nnourishment and fellowship.\n  Throughout her 20 years at The Banquet, Carolyn has touched the lives \nof innumerable needy individuals and families. Her devotion to feeding \nthe hungry sets an example to the community of a life devoted to the \nbetterment of people all over South Dakota. All of the guests that she \nhas served have seen what is described as her cheerful strength.\n  Her work at The Banquet has not only touched the lives of the hungry \nbut has given many South Dakotans an opportunity to volunteer and \nbecome involved in their community. Carolyn's work has brought out the \nbest in people around her and is an inspiration to all of South Dakota.\n  Under her leadership, The Banquet turned into a vital resource center \ninstitution for the hungry and is one of the pillars of the Sioux Falls \ncommunity. Her humility, grace, leadership skills, and humble service \nwill be greatly missed when she retires. All of her work has not been \nfor public praise or external reward but, rather, a deeply held belief \nin serving others. The State of South Dakota and all of its residents \nowe her a debt of gratitude for all that she had done to better it.\n  Carolyn will be retiring this February. Though her day-to-day \npresence at The Banquet will be greatly missed, her years of hard work \nare appreciated by all that volunteer and use The Banquet. I applaud \nCarolyn Downs's service and thank her for her time and efforts. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1052-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1052-S1053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO LaBRADFORD EAGLE DEER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to offer a statement \nabout a distinguished South Dakota youth, LaBradford Eagle Deer. \nLaBradford, 16, of St. Francis, SD, was one of two teens who \nrepresented the United States at the United Nations' observation of the \n20th International Day for the Eradication of Poverty last October. Six \nyoung people from across the world were chosen to speak at the event on \na panel about what they thought needed to be done about poverty.\n  According to the United Nations' Web site, the U.N. General Assembly \ndeclared October 17 as the International Day for the Eradication of\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\nPoverty and invited all States to devote the day to presenting and \npromoting, as appropriate in the national context, concrete activities \nwith regard to the eradication of poverty and destitution. The \nresolution further invites intergovernmental and nongovernmental \norganizations to assist States, at their request, in organizing \nnational activities for the observance of the day, and requests the \nSecretary-General to take, within existing resources, the measures \nnecessary to ensure the success of the day's observance by the United \nNations.\n  Eagle Deer exemplifies the goals of this important day. Eagle Deer \nlives on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation, where almost half of \nchildren younger than 17 live in poverty, according to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Economic Research Center. Eagle Deer \ndiscussed the hopelessness that poverty creates in a person saying, \n``suicide, addiction, dropout and crime rates are so high in poverty-\nstricken areas on our reservation, as well as other areas in the \nworld.''\n  Eagle Deer has taken a leading role to improve his community. An \nhonor student at Todd County High School, he is president of the St. \nFrancis Youth Center He coaches flag football and is himself involved \nin cross country, basketball, and track. Staying true to his culture, \nhe has organized a traditional youth-honoring powwow. A sentiment that \nI agree with, Eagle Deer values education as a pathway out of poverty.\n  LaBradford is an example to other poverty stricken children, and I \ncommend his efforts to alleviate the effects of poverty on children in \nSouth Dakota and children worldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1053-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING VADA SHEID\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that \ntoday I honor one of the true pioneers for women in Arkansas, Vada Webb \nSheid, who passed away this past Monday. Mrs. Sheid was a remarkable \nwoman who was an enterprising entrepreneur and built a business, \nSheid's Furniture Company, with her husband Carl in Mountain Home.\n  But Mrs. Sheid is best remembered as a dedicated public servant who \nbecame the first woman in Arkansas to serve in both the Arkansas House \nof Representatives and Senate.\n  She began her public service at 19 years old when she became the \nIzard County welfare director. Soon after, she met Carl, and they \nopened the area's first self-serve food market in Mountain Home. During \nWorld War II, Carl was drafted in the Army, and Mrs. Sheid went to work \nas a payroll clerk for a company building the Norfork Dam. After the \nwar, they opened up a grocery store before finally starting the Sheid's \nFurniture Company in 1957, which her family still runs today.\n  It was around this time that Mrs. Sheid began to consider furthering \nher career in public service. She served as Baxter Country treasurer \nfrom 1960 to 1964 before being elected to the Arkansas House. As a \nState legislator, she focused on issues affecting the elderly and was \nasked by then-Governor Dale Bumpers to serve as a representative to the \nWhite House Conference on Aging.\n  In 1976, Mrs. Sheid sought higher office and was elected to the \nArkansas Senate. She served in that capacity until 1985. Shortly \nthereafter, then-Governor Bill Clinton appointed her to the Arkansas \nPolice Commission, where she later served as chairman.\n  Mrs. Sheid had many great accomplishments in the Arkansas \nLegislature. She sponsored legislation creating Arkansas State \nUniversity-Mountain Home and North Arkansas Community College in \nHarrison. She also authored legislation to construct the twin bridges \nover Lake Norfork, as well as numerous highway projects.\n  Mr. President, as a woman growing up in Arkansas, Vada Sheid was a \ntrue inspiration to me and many others. The example she set is one that \nI can only hope to follow. She will be missed by all Arkansans. At this \ntime, my thoughts and prayers go out to her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1053-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING MIKE WILSON\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I speak with great sadness as I \nremember the life of a great Arkansan who passed away on February 8, \n2008: Michael Evans ``Mike'' Wilson.\n  For the last 20 years, Mike served as the chairman and CEO of Lee \nWilson and Company, a business that began to transform and build the \nArkansas Delta region more than 100 years ago. Growing up the daughter \nof a rice farmer in eastern Arkansas, I knew of the Wilson family and \nhow their name was synonymous with the values of hard work and \nenterprise throughout our region.\n  Mike was not only the leader of his longtime family business; he was \nalso a tireless servant for the city of Wilson and the State of \nArkansas. He had served as mayor of Wilson since 1986 and was committed \nto economic development and advancing educational opportunity in \nArkansas. He also lent his time to a considerable number of charitable \norganizations' boards and committees to further those goals.\n  A 1965 graduate of the Citadel, Mike also loved his country. He \nserved our Nation in the U.S. Army upon graduation and achieved the \nrank of captain before his honorable discharge.\n  He was passionate about life, and I consider him a true friend. He \nwill be missed by us all.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Pat, son Perry, daughter \nNatalie, and their entire family at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1053-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF JOHN ROBERTS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to honor \nJohn Roberts of Omaha, NE.\n  John was an independent and dedicated individual who found comfort in \nlife through helping others. He was a 2001 graduate of Omaha Westside \nHigh School and a 2005 graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, \nstudying art history. His inquisitive nature toward different cultures \nand languages, along with his desire to help others, led him to \nvolunteer for the Peace Corps. John was sworn in on December 8, 2005, \nand served as a construction and skilled trades education volunteer on \nthe island of Erromango in the Republic of Vanuatu.\n  John's impact in Vanuatu was tangible to the people who lived in his \nvillage. He was credited for strengthening South River's \ntransportation, income generation, and communications capabilities. \nWhen his parents visited him in Vanuatu, they were proud to see the \nsense of community John brought to his village. His father, Doug, said \nthe people loved him as though he were one of their own; one Erromango \ncommunity representative regarded him ``as our son.'' His sincerity and \nenthusiasm to help those in need is epitomized by his Peace Corps \naspiration statement:\n\n       Why I have volunteered is a question that I do not fully \n     know the answer to. Coming from a stable farming family I was \n     always taught to help my neighbors but I also feel an \n     internal pull to help lend a hand. Somewhere back in my short \n     life, I made a choice to serve and have been doing so every \n     since. Instead of a single moment defining my reasons to \n     serve, a whole lifetime of learning is driving me to \n     volunteer for the Peace Corps.\n\n  On October 11, 2007, John passed away while working at his site, a \nbranch that was being cut by a student inadvertently struck John and \nanother member of the community. He is survived by his parents Doug and \nRose of Omaha.\n  Today, I join all Americans in mourning the loss of this remarkable \nyoung man. John Roberts' altruism, compassion, and exemplary service \nwill remain an inspiration for those who wish to follow in his \nfootsteps. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1053-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1053-S1054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING HAVEN'S CANDIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as today is Valentine's Day--a day \nwhen everyone deserves to enjoy at least a little chocolate--I commend \na small chocolatier from my home State of Maine that has produced \nquality chocolates and candies for nearly a century. Haven's Candies of \nWestbrook is an innovative candy factory that sells a wide variety of \nchocolate favorites in addition to both traditional and original Maine \ntreats.\n  The early history of Haven's Candies has an element of romance to it. \nHerbert Haven, the company's founder, followed his sweetheart from \nBoston, MA, to Portland, ME, in the early 1900s. They were soon \nmarried, and Herbert, who was the son of a candy maker, teamed up with \nhis wife to produce handcrafted candies in their kitchen, which they \nbegan selling from the\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\nfront parlor of their house in 1915. From this humble start, Haven's \nCandies has grown to become a well-known name in candy making. The \ncompany now has a factory and store in Westbrook, as well as retail \nlocations in Windham and Portland, one block from the house where \nHaven's began. And as ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I am particularly pleased that the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration has been able to help Haven's over the \nyears through financing and other assistance.\n  Using time-tested methods, Haven's still handcrafts its candies. \nHaven's offers customers an extensive array of exquisite goods, \nincluding homemade fudge, marzipan, jumbo peanut butter cups, and \nbuttercrunch toffee. The company also produces a varied selection of \nsugar-free candies, including peanut brittle and cashew turtles. Some \nof the Maine-themed candies sold at Haven's include the needham, a \nchocolate with a soft potato, coconut, and vanilla center, and \ndelicious blueberry creams, celebrating Maine's rich heritage of \nblueberry harvesting. Perhaps Haven's most impressive production is its \nsalt water taffy. Made by hand, its dozens of unique flavors include \ncreamsicle, maple, and watermelon. Haven's salt water taffy has \nattracted significant attention, and retailers of the candy include \nMaine's own L. L. Bean.\n  Haven's production methods allow for the romantic in all of us to \nsurprise our sweethearts any day of the week. The company can make \nmonogrammed chocolates and offers personalized packaging to create \nanyone's favorite combination of sweets. For Valentine's Day, Haven's \noffers chocolate-dipped strawberries, fancy hearts filled with a mix of \nchocolates, and the unique Valentine party tray, which includes a great \nvariety of chocolates surrounding a heart-shaped tray filled with mixed \nnuts. Haven's also makes assorted holiday gifts for other occasions, \nincluding Easter and Father's Day. The company holds a free open house \nevery Columbus Day when children can make their own candy at the \nfactory. Additionally, Haven's raises funds annually for the Center for \nGrieving Children by hosting ``make your own candy cane'' events.\n  On Valentine's Day, we take the opportunity to enjoy the sweeter side \nof life. Luckily for the employees of Haven's Candies, they get to \nenjoy it every day! Not only is the candy they produce scrumptious, but \ntheir work ethic is exemplary, and their dedication to putting smiles \non the faces of children of all ages is commendable. I congratulate \nowner Andy Charles and everyone at Haven's who continue to make \ndelectable candies nearly 100 years after this company's remarkable \ninception and wish them future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1054-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1054-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1054-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2633.

A bill to change the date for regularly scheduled Federal \nelections and establish polling place hours; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Weekend Voting \nAct. This legislation will change the day for Congressional and \nPresidential elections from the first Tuesday in November to the first \nweekend in November. This legislation is nearly identical to \nlegislation that I first proposed in 1997.\n  Currently, we are in the midst of the most serious business of our \ndemocracy--the primary elections to select the nominees to be our next \nPresident. We all want every eligible voter to participate and cast a \nvote. But recent elections have Shown us that unneeded obstacles are \npreventing citizens from exercising their franchise. The debacle of \ndefective ballots and voting methods in Florida in the 2000 election \ngalvanized Congress into passing major election reform legislation. The \nHelp American Vote Act, which was enacted\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\ninto law in 2002, was an important step forward in establishing minimum \nstandards for States in the administration of Federal elections and in \nproviding funds to replace outdated voting systems and improve election \nadministration. However, there is much that still needs to be done.\n  With more and more voters needing to cast their ballots on election \nday, we need to build on the movement which already exists to make it \neasier for Americans to cast their ballots by providing alternatives to \nvoting on just one election day. Twenty-eight States, including my own \nState of Wisconsin, now permit any registered voter to vote by absentee \nballot. These States constitute nearly half of the voting age citizens \nof the U.S. Thirty-one States permit in-person early voting at election \noffices or at other satellite locations. The State of Oregon now \nconducts statewide elections completely by mail. These innovations are \ncritical if we are to conduct fair elections, for it has become \nunreasonable to expect that a Nation of 300 million people can line up \nat the same time and cast their ballots at the same time. And if we \ncontinue to try to do so, we will encounter even more reports of broken \nmachines and long lines in the rain and registration errors that create \nbarriers to voting.\n  That is why I have been a long-time advocate of moving our Federal \nelection day from the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November \nto the first weekend in November. Holding our Federal elections on a \nweekend will create more opportunities for voters to cast their ballots \nand will help end the gridlock at the polling places which threaten to \nundermine our elections.\n  Under this bill, polls would be open nationwide for a uniform period \nof time from 10 a.m. Saturday eastern time to 6 p.m. Sunday eastern \ntime. Polls in all time zones would in the 48 contiguous States also \nopen and close at this time. Election officials would be permitted to \nclose polls during the overnight hours if they determine it would be \ninefficient to keep them open. Because the polls would be open on both \nSaturday and Sunday, they also would not interfere with religious \nobservances.\n  Keeping polls open the same hours across the continental U.S. also \naddresses the challenge of keeping results on one side of the country, \nor even a State, from influencing voting in places where polls are \nstill open. Moving elections to the weekend will expand the pool of \nbuildings available for polling stations and people available to work \nat the polls, addressing the critical shortage of poll workers.\n  Most important, weekend voting has the potential to increase voter \nturnout by giving all voters ample opportunity to get to the polls \nwithout creating a national holiday. There is already evidence that \nholding elections on a nonworking day can increase voter turnout. In \none survey of 44 democracies, 29 held elections on holidays or weekends \nand in all these cases voter turnout surpassed our country's voter \nparticipation rates.\n  In 2001, the National Commission on Federal Election Reform \nrecommended that we move our federal election day to a national \nholiday, in particular Veterans Day. As expected, the proposal was not \nwell received among veterans and I do not endorse such a move, but I \nshare the Commission's goal of moving election day to a nonworking day.\n  Since the mid 19th century, election day has been on the first \nTuesday of November. Ironically, this date was selected because it was \nconvenient for voters. Tuesdays were traditionally court day, and \nlandowning voters were often coming to town anyway.\n  Just as the original selection of our national voting day was done \nfor voter convenience, we must adapt to the changes in our society to \nmake voting easier for the regular family. We have outgrown our Tuesday \nvoting day tradition, a tradition better left behind to a bygone horse \nand buggy era. In today's America, 60 percent of all households have \ntwo working adults. Since most polls in the United States are open only \n12 hours on a Tuesday, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., voters often have only \none or two hours to vote. As we have seen in recent elections, long \nlines in many polling places have kept some voters waiting much longer \nthan one or 2 hours. If voters have children, and are dropping them off \nat day care, or if they have a long work commute, there is just not \nenough time in a workday to vote.\n  With long lines and chaotic polling places becoming the unacceptable \nnorm in many communities, we have an obligation to reform how our \nNation votes. If we are to grant all Americans an equal opportunity to \nparticipate in the electoral process, and to elect our representatives \nin this great democracy, then we must be willing to reexamine all \naspects of voting in America. Changing our election day to a weekend \nmay seem like a change of great magnitude. Given the stakes--the \nintegrity of future elections and full participation by as many \nAmericans as possible--I hope my colleagues will recognize it as a \ncommon sense proposal whose time has come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to improve the transparency of information on skilled nursing \nfacilities and nursing facilities and to clarify and improve the \ntargeting of the enforcement of requirements with respect to such \nfacilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor for the purpose of \nintroducing a bill. The bill's title is the Nursing Home Transparency \nand Improvement Act of 2008.\n  I introduce this bill along with Senator Kohl of Wisconsin. It is a \nbipartisan bill. Senator Kohl, because he is in the majority, has the \ndistinguished pleasure of serving as chairman of a special committee on \naging which is also a very important responsibility, particularly since \nour Government spends about more than $50 billion a year on nursing \nhome care for elderly, among other things that are the responsibility \ntie of that committee.\n  The bill that we are introducing is an important piece of legislation \nthat aims to bring some overdue transparency to consumers regarding \nnursing home quality. It also provides long-needed improvements to our \nenforcement system.\n  This legislation further strengthens nursing home staff training \nrequirements. In America today, there are over 1.7 million elderly and \ndisabled individuals in roughly 17,000 nursing homes.\n  As the baby boom generation ages, that number probably will rise, \nunless we do something about the problems of osteoporosis and \nAlzheimer's and diabetes. Hopefully, we can do those things so our \nnursing homes do not fill up more. But those are some of the health \nproblems that are facing 77 million baby boomers. Some of them \nundoubtedly will end up in nursing homes.\n  So we have to have not only a tremendous interest in ensuring nursing \nhome quality based upon the number of people who are already there, but \nwe are going to have more in the future.\n  While many people are using alternatives such as home care or other \nmethods of community-based care, nursing homes are going to remain a \ncritical option for our elderly and our disabled. I always think in \nterms of nursing homes being at the end of a continuum of care for \npeople who need some help.\n  People want to stay in their own home. When there is a question, can \nthey do that without endangering them, bring some help to the home, \nrelatives or home health care types.\n  If that is not the right environment, then assisted living. And then \nother things that might eventually bring a person to a nursing home. \nBut a nursing home is a last resort. I say that because during my \ntenure as chairman of the Aging Committee from 1997 to the year 2001, \nversus the period of time I was chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, dealing with a lot of aging issues, interacting with a lot \nof older people, I have never once had anybody say to me that: I am \njust dying to get into a nursing home.\n  So I think it is important we do whatever we can to keep people out \nof nursing homes. But there are some people, a lot of people, and a \ngrowing number of people who are going to need that type of care.\n  So we have to be concerned about the quality of care in nursing \nhomes. We surely owe it to them to make sure they receive the safe and \nquality care they deserve. Unfortunately in many areas, the nursing \nhomes, we have a few bad apples always spoiling the barrel. Too many \nAmericans receive poor care, often in a subset of a nursing home.\n  Unfortunately, this subset of chronic offenders stays in business, in \nmany ways keeping their poor track records hidden from the public at \nlarge and often facing little or no enforcement from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have a \nlongstanding commitment to ensuring that nursing home residents receive \nthe safe and quality care we expect for our own loved ones. But this \neffort requires transparency, transparency in the nursing home industry \nso consumers are armed with information, consumers having information \nthey need to make the best decisions possible for loved ones. This same \ntransparency also provides additional market incentives for bad homes \nto improve.\n  This effort also requires a strong mandatory enforcement and \nmonitoring system to ensure safe and quality care at facilities that \nwould not take the steps needed to do so voluntarily.\n  The Grassley-Kohl legislation seeks to strengthen both areas, \ntransparency and enforcement. It is a bill that is good for consumers, \ngood for nursing home residents, and good even for the nursing home \ncommunity.\n  Let's look at transparency. In the market for nursing home care, \nsimilar to all markets, consumers must have adequate data to make \ninformed choices. For years people looking at a nursing home for \nthemselves or loved ones had no way of knowing whether that home was--\nthis is kind of a legal term in the regulations--a ``special focus \nfacility,'' a designation meaning they had been singled out as a \nconsistently poor performer.\n  Why should consumers not have access to this information? The \nGovernment has it and so should consumers. To that end, this bill \nrequires that the ``special focus facilities'' designation be placed on \nthe CMS website. Nursing Home Compare is the name of that website.\n\n  By giving consumers this information, we will both give consumers \ninformation necessary to make informed choices and poorly performing \nhomes an extra incentive to shape up or consumers then can go \nelsewhere.\n  This bill also requires more transparency about ownership \ninformation. What is so secretive about who owns a nursing home? Also, \nit provides transparency in inspection reports and more accountability \nfor large nursing home chains and the development of a standardized \nresident complaint form so there is a clear and easy way to report \nproblems and have them resolved.\n  The bill would also bring more transparency on what portion of a \nnursing home's spending is used for direct care for residents and also \nbring more uniformity to the reporting of nursing staffing levels so \npeople can make an apples-to-apples comparison between nursing homes.\n  But even with improved transparency, there are some nursing homes \nthat will not improve on their own. In the nursing home industry, most \nhomes provide quality care on a consistent basis. But as in many \nsectors, this industry is given a bad name by a few bad apples that \nspoil the barrel.\n  So we need to give inspectors better enforcement tools. The current \nsystem provides incentives to correct problems only temporarily and \nallows homes to avoid regulatory sanctions while continuing to deliver \nsubstandard care to residents. That system must be fixed.\n  In ongoing correspondence that I have had with Terry Weems, the \nActing Administrator of CMS, that agency has requested the statutory \nauthority to collect civil monetary penalties sooner and hold them in \nescrow pending appeal. To that end, this bill requires penalties be \ncollected within 90 days following a hearing; after that, they be held \nin escrow pending appeal.\n  Penalties should also be meaningful. Too often they are assessed at \nthe lowest possible amount, if at all. Penalties should be more than \nmerely the cost of doing business, they should be collected in a \nreasonable timeframe and should not be rescinded easily.\n  These changes would help prod the industry's bad actors to get their \nact together or get out of business. In addition to increased \ntransparency and improved enforcement, this bill provides commonsense \nsolutions to a number of other problems as well.\n  This legislation requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto establish a national independent\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\nmonitoring program to tackle problems specific to interstate and large \nintrastate nursing home chains. This legislation directs the Government \nAccountability Office to, one, conduct studies on the role, if any, of \nfinancial problems in the poor performance of special focus facilities; \nidentify best practices at the State level in temporary management \nprograms; and, three, determine what are the barriers preventing the \npurchase of nursing homes with a record of poor quality.\n  Finally, in the case of nursing homes being closed due to prior \nsafety or quality of care, the bill requires that residents and their \nrepresentatives be given a sufficient notice so they can adequately \nplan a transfer to a better performing nursing home. I happen to be \nvery sensitive to the fact that nursing home residents are often old \nand fragile. Moving them into new facilities is often very traumatic. \nSo we have to make sure these residents are transferred appropriately \nand with the time and care deserved.\n  This bill would also strengthen training requirements for nursing \nstaff, by including dementia and abuse prevention training as part of \nthe preemployment training.\n  The Grassley-Kohl bill also requires a study on the appropriateness \nof increasing training requirements for nurse aids and supervisory \nstaff.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill today, along with the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, the chairman of the Aging Committee. \nHe and I have a long history of working on issues together, \nparticularly for the elderly. We will continue to do everything we can \nto make sure America's nursing home residents receive the safe and \nquality care they deserve. Increasing transparency, improved \nenforcement tools, and strengthening training requirements will go a \nlong way toward achieving this goal.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nursing Home \nTransparency and Improvement Act of 2008 with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley conducted a great deal of \nvaluable oversight for nursing homes during his tenure as Aging \nCommittee chairman from 1997 through 2000, and he continues to make \nmajor contributions in this area today. Working toward higher standards \nof nursing home quality is a tradition of which I am proud to be a \npart.\n  It is staggering to think that the most recent major law dictating \nFederal standards for quality, for data reporting, and for enforcement \nwas passed in 1987. Twenty-one years later, we know that it has spurred \nimportant improvements in the quality of care provided in nursing \nhomes. Yet we are far from finished, and there are additional \nimprovements that need to be made.\n  The first is in the area of transparency. If consumers can easily \ntell which homes have a solid enforcement track record, which are well-\nstaffed, which are owned by a chain with a good reputation for \nproviding excellent services--and which homes are not--then this sort \nof disclosure can serve as a powerful motivation for homes to provide \nthe best possible care, to hire and keep the most dedicated staff, and \nto always prioritize the interests of residents. The court of public \nopinion and the strength of market forces are powerful and inexpensive \ntools we should be putting to good use.\n  Our legislation will make sure all this information is available to \nconsumers in a timely and easy-to-use fashion. We want Americans to be \nable to use the Federal Government's Web site, Nursing Home Compare, \nwith ease. We want Americans to have access to the type of information \nthat matters, such as the number of hours of care their loved one will \nreceive from staff every day. We want Americans to be able to use this \nWeb site to lodge complaints of mistreatment or neglect. These are \nsimple, effective ideas, and our bill will make them a reality.\n  The second area in need of improvement is our Government's system of \nnursing home quality enforcement. Under the current system, nursing \nhomes that are not providing good care, or--even worse--are putting \ntheir residents in harms way, can escape penalty from the Government by \nabusing a lengthy appeal process, while they slip in and out of \ncompliance with Federal regulations. This is unacceptable. We need the \nthreat of sanctions to mean something--and under my bill with Senator \nGrassley, they will. Our legislation will require that all civil \nmonetary penalties be collected and placed in an escrow account as soon \nas they are levied, pending the final resolution of any appeal. \nFinancial penalties will be increased for serious quality deficiencies \nthat cause actual harm to nursing home residents or put them in \n``immediate jeopardy.''\n  In addition, our policy enables regulators to respond effectively \nwhen serious quality problems are evident in order to protect the \nsafety of residents. The bill requires that States and facilities \nprovide a secure and orderly process when relocating residents due to a \nnursing home closure. It also proposes national demonstrations to \npromote innovations in information technology and ``culture change'' in \norder to improve resident care.\n  The Federal Government now spends $75 billion annually on nursing \nhomes through Medicare and Medicaid, and spending is projected to rise \nas costs associated with the boomer generation increase. Congress has a \nresponsibility to demand high-quality services for residents and \naccountability from the nursing home industry in return for this huge \ninvestment of public resources. I urge my colleagues to join Senator \nGrassley and myself in sponsoring this commonsense piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 2642. A bill to establish a national renewable energy standard, to \nextend and create renewable energy tax incentives, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the American \nRenewable Energy Act which I am introducing today, along with my \ncolleagues, Senator Snowe from Maine and Senator Cantwell from \nWashington.\n  Last week, we passed a short-term stimulus package that will help \nchange the economic direction of this country by putting money in the \nhands of American families, including our seniors and veterans. Last \nweek's action was a start, but we must begin focusing on long-term \npolicies that will help our economy long after these rebate checks have \nbeen cashed. If we do not do that, we are going to be back exactly in \nthe place we were before. We need long-term policies that will \nencourage sustainable economic growth in every corner of this country.\n  In January, I traveled all around my State on a Main Street tour of \nMinnesota. We talked about the economic challenges facing the people of \nour State, but we also talked about the opportunities. Energy was a \ntopic that came up everywhere. It came up when people were filling up \ntheir cars and trucks with gas, and it came up when we talked about the \nopportunities.\n  I visited southwestern Minnesota, which is home to hundreds of large-\nscale wind turbines, helping to make Minnesota the Nation's third \nlargest producer of wind energy. Along with ethanol, these wind-energy \nfarms have spurred a rural economic renaissance in our part of the \nState.\n  For example, in 1995, SMI & Hydraulics, Inc., began their business in \nPorter, MN, primarily as a welding and cylinder repair shop for local \nfarmers and businesses. Today, SMI & Hydraulics manufactures the bases \nfor the wind towers we sell all across this country. It just recently \nexpanded its facility to 100,000 square feet and created over 100 new \njobs, many of which are traditional manufacturing jobs.\n  My colleagues have to understand, these places are like barns. They \nstarted out as farmers' barns and have expanded and expanded as they \nhave been able to meet this country's rising energy needs.\n  The success of companies such as SMI & Hydraulics is not unique to \nMinnesota. Renewable energy has been a bright spot in an otherwise \nlagging economy. Last year, the renewable electricity sector pumped \nmore than $20 billion into the U.S. economy, generating tens of \nthousands of jobs in construction, transportation, and manufacturing.\n  Throughout the country, renewable energy has led us down a path \ntoward new jobs, lower energy bills, and enhanced economic development. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S1060]]\n\nwhy today I am introducing this bill, along with my friends Senator \nSnowe and Senator Cantwell, to help lead us further down the path to a \nbetter, cleaner, more prosperous energy future, with new opportunities \nfor investment, innovation, and job creation.\n  Our bill, as I said, is called the American Renewable Energy Act. \nThere are two key elements of this legislation.\n  First, the American Renewable Energy Act creates strong, consistent \nincentives for private sector investment in renewable energy resources \nand technology by extending tax incentives, such as the production tax \ncredit, for 5 years. Of course, this covers wind, solar, geothermal, \nhydro, and other forms of renewable energy, and making sure that is in \nplace so we can spur the kind of investment that will create jobs and \nallow us to be on the same path other countries around the world are \non.\n  Second, the legislation establishes a national renewable energy \nstandard requiring that 20 percent of our energy come from renewable \nsources, such as wind, solar, and biofuels, by the year 2025. A \nnational renewable energy standard will create a large market for clean \nsources of energy, reducing global warming pollution, and strengthening \nour economy.\n  Let me briefly describe each of these elements. First, the renewable \nenergy tax incentives. Already the industries for solar, wind, and \nbiomass are expanding at annual rates exceeding 30 percent. But at the \nsame time, we are no longer the world leader in two important clean \nenergy fields. Even though all the technology was developed in our \ncountry, we rank third in wind power production behind Denmark and \nSpain, and we are now third in photovoltaic power installed, behind \nGermany and Japan.\n  Ironically, these countries surpassed us largely by adopting \ntechnologies that had been first developed here in the United States. \nWe came up with the right ideas, but we didn't capitalize on these \nincentives by having these innovations, by having the right policies in \nplace to support their commercial development and rise and support the \njobs that would have come with developing the technology. Our foreign \ncompetition was able to leapfrog over American businesses because these \nother countries have government-driven investment incentives, \naggressive renewable energy targets, and other bold national policies.\n  What I am proposing with my legislation is a package of tax \nincentives to spur investment in advanced clean technologies to serve \nthe growing market for renewable energy sources. Specifically, in the \nbill Senator Snowe and Senator Cantwell and I are introducing today, we \nwant to extend and expand the existing Federal production tax credit \nfor renewable energy, and I want to make sure it is a long-term credit \nand businesses will have the clarity and certainty they need to make \ntheir own large-scale, long-term capital investments in these \ntechnologies.\n  Currently, the production tax credit and other key energy efficiency \ntax incentives are set to expire at the end of this year. Our \nlegislation will extend these tax incentives for 5 years.\n  To pay for these incentives, the legislation will repeal several tax \ngiveaways that currently go to the major oil companies. ExxonMobil \nshattered another record profit, earning $11.7 billion last quarter and \ntotaling over $40 billion in profits in 2007. Big oil doesn't need \nthese tax incentives, but our rural economies do.\n  Over the years, the production tax credit has been a problem because \nof its short-term green light-red light nature. The cycle begins with \nstrong investment and growth in the renewable power industry, thanks to \nthe tax incentive, but then the investment and growth slow down as the \ntax incentive nears expiration and is allowed to lapse. When the \nincentive gets restored, the renewable power industry takes time to \nregain its footing, and then experiences strong growth again until the \nincentive nears expiration again. Up and down, up and down, up and \ndown. It is no way to run a government policy that should be geared \ntoward creating more jobs in our country.\n  In fact, the American Wind Energy Association has recently noted that \nthe slowdown in wind industry activity actually starts about 8 months \nbefore the tax credit's expiration date. These are large-scale, \ncapital-intensive projects that often take long years to develop. But \nuncertainty about the future of the production tax credit discourages \nproject development and investment. Extending the tax credit for 5 \nyears would create a much stronger incentive and investment environment \nfor renewable energy development.\n  Simply put, a new economic sector is emerging. It is one that can \nshift the Nation's economy to clean energy production, generation, and \nuse. But without the continued support of tax incentives to help this \nemerging industry compete on a level playing field, the opportunity \nwill be lost.\n  Over the past few years, the solar energy industry has witnessed \nunprecedented growth. This growth pumped over $2 billion into the U.S. \neconomy and created 6,000 new jobs. Developing solar energy is an \neconomic engine for our country. From 2006 to 2007, the job base in the \nsolar energy industry grew by 103 percent. Almost all of this growth is \ndirectly attributable to the solar investment tax credits that are \nscheduled to expire at the end of this year. If we allow these credits \nto expire, those jobs will dry up. We will lose out on creating new \ncompanies and we will lose out on creating new opportunities for clean \nenergy.\n  I have focused on wind and solar, but there are amazing opportunities \nin other renewable energy fields, including hydro. There are amazing \nopportunities with geothermal. But we are never going to reach the full \npotential for jobs in this country if we keep going back and forth, up \nand down. We have to have a policy that is geared to the long term.\n  I will also say that in visiting with farmers and ranchers around our \nState, the other thing we need to do--but we will have to focus on in \nanother bill--is look at creating incentives for individuals and small \nbusinesses that may want to put up their own wind turbine. That is a \nsubject for another day, but we have to do everything we can to promote \nthis renewable energy.\n  The second element in this legislation would provide an additional \nincentive for investment in renewable energy technology and resources. \nIt would establish an aggressive, nationwide renewable electricity \nstandard, one requiring that all electricity providers generate or \npurchase 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by the \nyear 2025.\n\n  Currently, as I show on this chart here, there are 24 States, plus \nthe District of Columbia, that have renewable electricity standards. \nTogether, these States account for more than half of the electricity \nsales in the United States. You can see what these States are doing \nhere. All on their own, the States have risen to the occasion, and \nsaid: Well, the Federal Government isn't doing anything, so I guess we \nwill do it on our own.\n  California is at 20 percent, Minnesota at 27.4 percent by 2025--one \nof the most aggressive standards in the country. Bipartisan agreement, \na Democratic legislature, and a Republican Governor reached this \nagreement with our utilities, including Excel Industry signing on and \nnot opposing this agreement. We have New York at 24 percent, Wisconsin \nat 10 percent by 2015; 15 percent by 2015 for Montana--15 percent by \n2020. Look at these States along the way, all over this country, and we \nare seeing these standards taking place.\n  While Minnesota, Maine, Washington, and other States are already \nheaded down the path toward a new clean energy economy, the Federal \nGovernment hasn't even made it to the trail yet. The Federal Government \nis still stuck in the fossil age. There is a famous phrase: ``the \nlaboratories of democracy.'' That is how Supreme Court Justice Louis \nBrandeis described the special role of States in our Federal system. In \nthis model, States are where new ideas emerge and innovative proposals \nare tested. But Brandeis did not mean for this to serve as an excuse \nfor inaction by the Federal Government. Good ideas and successful \ninnovations are supposed to emerge from the laboratory and serve as a \nmodel for national policy and action. The responsibility is on us.\n  We know what is going on in these States around the country. The \ncourage we are seeing in the States as they\n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\nseize opportunities offered by renewable energy should be matched by \ncourage in Washington. I think it is time for the Federal Government to \nfollow the lead of Minnesota, Washington, Maine, and other States \naround the country and adopt a forward-looking renewable energy \nstandard.\n  There are many benefits from having a strong national standard. It \nwould save money for American consumers, as much as $100 billion in \nlower electricity and natural gas bills. It would aid in the fight \nagainst climate change by preventing well over 3 billion tons of carbon \ndioxide from being emitted into the atmosphere by 2030. It would create \njobs and increase income across the country, especially in rural areas. \nEach large utility-scale wind turbine that goes on line generates over \n$1.5 million in economic activity. Each turbine provides about $5,000 \nin lease payments for 20 years or more to farmers, ranchers, or other \nlandowners.\n  You can see from this chart the job creation with this national \nrenewable electricity standard set at 20 percent--355,000 new jobs, \nnearly twice as much as generating electricity from fossil fuels; $72.6 \nbillion in new capital investment; $16.2 billion in income to farmers, \nranchers, and rural landowners; $5 billion in new local tax revenues.\n  Then look at these consumer savings--$49 billion in lower electricity \nand natural gas bills; a healthier environment; reductions in global \nwarming pollution equal to taking nearly 71 million cars off the road; \nless air pollution, damage to land, and less water use. These are the \nbenefits.\n  We pay for it by taking back some of those tax giveaways we give to \nthose oil companies--ExxonMobil, $11.7 billion in one quarter. So are \nwe going to give them more money or try to create 355,000 new jobs in \nthis country? That is the choice.\n  I believe the combination of an aggressive renewable electricity \nstandard and a strong package of tax incentives can begin to move our \nNation to a new, cleaner, and more prosperous energy path. It is long \noverdue. The private sector is already beginning to invest in this \nenergy future, and they are ready to invest more. But our Government \nmust provide the right policies and incentives so they will be prepared \nto make the large-scale, long-term investments that are required to \nmake it happen.\n  The opportunities are enormous for creating new technologies, new \nindustries, new businesses, and new jobs, while at the same time \npromoting our energy independence, strengthening our national security, \nand protecting our global environment. This piece of legislation, \ncosponsored by my friends Senator Snowe and Senator Cantwell, this \nbipartisan piece of legislation is about leading the new economy, not \nfollowing along; not doing countless rebate checks after rebate \nchecks--which we need to do right now, but we are never going to get on \nthe path to a new economic future unless we lead the way, and this is \nWashington's time to lead. This is about making America the global \nenergy leader instead of the lagger. It is about creating a better \neconomy for the next generation by leading a whole new industry. It is \nabout not being complacent. It is about getting on a new energy path.\n  I believe an aggressive renewable electricity standard, coupled with \nstrong tax incentives, leads us down this path. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support the American Renewable Energy Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 2647. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on fan assisted, \nplugin, scented oil dispensing, electrothermic appliances; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould temporarily suspend the duty on fan assisted, plug-in air \nfresheners imported by S.C. Johnson, a company headquartered in Racine, \nWI.\n  I understand the importance of manufacturing and the role it plays in \nour everyday lives. It is no secret that the Bush administration has \nenfeebled the manufacturing sector, cutting needed funding that helps \nmanufacturers stay competitive. Since 2001, Wisconsin has been hit \nhard, losing over 63,000 manufacturing jobs. A healthy manufacturing \nsector is key to better jobs, rising productivity and higher standards \nof living. Every individual and industry depends on manufactured goods. \nThe production of those goods creates the quality jobs that keep so \nmany Amerian families healthy and strong.\n  This legislation would suspend the duty on fan assisted, plug-in air \nfresheners which S.C. Johnson assembles and packages in Racine, WI. \nCurrently, there is no domestic manufacturer, which forces S.C. Johnson \nto import the product that has a 2.7 percent tariff. Suspending the \ntariff will cut production costs, keep jobs at home and allow S.C. \nJohnson to be more competitive in the global marketplace.\n  S.C. Johnson was created in 1886 as a parquet flooring company and \ntoday is one of the world's leading manufacturers of household products \nincluding Ziploc storage containers, Windex glass cleaner, Raid insect \nrepellant, and Glade fragrances. Today, S.C. Johnson employs 3,000 \npeople in Wisconsin and provides products in more than 110 countries \naround the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 2648. A bill to amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to \nimprove programs carried out through youth opportunity grants, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the STEP-UP \nAct. The STEP-UP Act is a comprehensive policy solution directed toward \nfighting unemployment, particularly among less educated African \nAmerican men, by implementing innovative and \nsuccessful job training efforts and improving existing tools like the \nEarned Income Tax Credit and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.\n  In America and my home state of New York there is a growing crisis of \njoblessness for African American men. The crisis is profound, \npersistent and perplexing. Across the country and in our own backyard, \nfar too many black men lack an adequate education and face difficulty \nfinding and keeping work. The numbers are staggering and getting worse.\n  Poverty is not new. African American disadvantage is--sadly--not new. \nBut now is the time for fresh solutions and urgent action, especially \nnow that we are facing an economic recession. We know all too well, \nthat when our economy faces a downturn, the most vulnerable members of \nthe labor force face the greatest challenges in the job market.\n  My goal today is to both shine a firm spotlight on a problem has \nreceived scant attention, inadequate resources, intermittent focus and \npoor coordination and also to introduce legislation that will offer \nsome solid, practical steps forward. To be clear, the provisions in the \nSTEP-UP ACT will be open to all Americans, but the legislation contains \nservices and incentives that are particularly needed among young \nAfrican American men.\n  I am introducing the STEP-UP ACT for several reasons.\n  First, the problem of African American male unemployment is severe \nand it is worsening. Consider this: In 2000, 65 percent of black male \nhigh school dropouts in their 20's were jobless--in other words not \nlooking or unable to find work--and by 2004, the share had grown to 72 \npercent ``jobless.'' That translates to almost one out of three men. By \ncomparison the rate for white male high school dropouts was 34 \npercent and Hispanic males 19 percent. Between 1992 and 1999--the \ngreatest economic expansion in our nation's history--the labor force \nparticipation of young black men actually declined from 83.5 percent to \n79.4 percent. Clearly the rising tide did not lift all boats.\n  Second, there is an unprecedented need to fill unskilled and semi \nskilled jobs across the countries as baby boomers retire, and there is \na large supply of jobless black men who could fill them.\n  Third, after much trial and error, we now have several successful job \ntraining programs that work, as well as federal policy options with a \nproven track record of making a real difference in the labor force. Yet \nsadly, while the programs are finally working, the Federal funding has \ngone down by 90 percent.\n  There is a complex interplay of forces that led us to this point, and \nmany of them are familiar culprits such as: failing schools, \ndysfunctional families, high incarceration rates, overt and subtle \nracism, and the decimation of\n\n[[Page S1062]]\n\nmanufacturing jobs that typically afforded opportunities to men.\n  All these political, cultural, economic and personal elements combine \nto erect a steeplechase of barriers that is far too difficult to \ntraverse for far too many urban black men.\n  While this is a sensitive subject, there is also a subculture of the \nstreet that provides easy money and allows some to eschew personal \nresponsibility. But we can't sit passively by and let that subculture \nclaim another generation of these men. The public sector--on all \nlevels--has an obligation to intercede. The Reverend Johnny Ray \nYoungblood, a pastor and friend of mine from Brooklyn, said it best: \n``Government has a moral responsibility to compete against, and win \nagainst, subcultures that are immoral, illegal and really inhuman.''\n  Let me be clear: there is a host of dedicated, even heroic, leaders \nwho have been addressing these issues every day for years. There are \nideas and leaders out there can turn this problem around. However, on \nthe Federal level, there has been no comprehensive public policy \nresponse to this situation. We have allowed the problems of black men \nto grow worse unabated.\n  Last year, as Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, I held a \nhearing on this very issue. Our witnesses provided testimony that \nvividly illustrated how devastating this crisis truly is. This hearing \nwas an eye-opener for me and my colleagues. The hearing also began a \ndialog in Congress on how we can move forward legislatively to expand \njob opportunities and incentives for African American men.\n  I believe there is a rare confluence of forces that should be \nexploited--now--to ramp up efforts to aggressively attack the plight of \njobless black men. The American labor force is in transition and \ntherein lies the opportunity. By 2010 as many as 64 million Americans \nfrom the generations born before and after World War II will approach \nretirement age. Over this period we will be losing 20 percent of our \nentire workforce--a turnover rate the likes of which our country has \nnever experienced.\n  Many of the new jobs I am speaking about don't require college \ndegrees, many are entry level, but many can pay upwards of $40,000 with \nbenefits. And the best part is, they can't be outsourced or downsized--\nbecause they're crucial to keeping cities working. A nurse, welder, \nmechanic or long-haul commercial driver doesn't do us any good if he or \nshe is working in Bangalore. We have never before had such a clear \npicture of where the jobs will be--or what we have to do to connect our \nstruggling young people to them.\n  What we need to do now is ensure that black men have access to the \nbest, most successful job training programs that can prepare them for \nthese jobs. After years of trying, I believe there is a new paradigm \nfor job training that will make this possible. For the past year, I \nhave been working on the STEP-UP Act to do just that.\n  Let me tell you about one innovative job training program that was \nfounded in East Harlem but has been replicated successfully throughout \nthe United States and Europe: its called STRIVE and it offers some good \nclues on what makes a job program work.\n  Here is the most important thing you need to know about STRIVE: 70 \npercent of their graduates retain their jobs after 2 years, compared to \na 40 percent city-wide average. I visited them to see firsthand how \nthey do it. It impressed me so much I brought 3 Senators to visit \nSTRIVE's offices in Washington, DC, and it blew their hair back as \nwell.\n\n  First, STRIVE's core program does not begin with teaching \nparticipants how to read an account ledger or hammer in a nail. It \nbegins with what they call ``soft skills'' like how to dress for work, \ninteract with your boss and superiors, and accept criticism. Seems \nobvious enough, but for many it is harder than it should be to tell the \ndifference between constructive criticism and a provocative ``dis'' \nthat, in the code of the street, demands an aggressive reaction.\n  In addition to focusing on those elemental ``soft skills,'' STRIVE \nprovides intensive follow-up, long-term involvement with additional \ntraining opportunities, and wrap-around services to address the whole \nhost of obstacles that black men face when trying to enter and remain \nin the workforce.\n  Our current Federal job-training program--the Workforce Investment \nAct--WIA--has been steadily underfunded in recent years. To give a \nsense of how much we have walked away from such initiatives, in 1978 we \nspent $9.5 billion on jobs programs--$30 billion in today's dollars. In \n2007 we spent only $5.1 billion. On top of that, WIA does not mandate \nor even encourage the STRIVE model. The WIA program hasn't been \nreauthorized since it expired in 2003 and it needs to be updated to \nincorporate the lessons of STRIVE.\n  My bill, the STEP-UP Act, moves our job training agenda closer to the \nSTRIVE model. If we can duplicate some semblage of STRIVE's 70 percent \nsuccess rates--which they have duplicated in 22 locations around the \ncountry--we can begin to really move the employment needle in the right \ndirection.\n  The STEP-UP Act reauthorizes funding for the Youth Opportunity \nProgram, YO, which was originally established in 1998 to provide grants \nto programs that offer intensive job training and placement services \nfor hard-to-serve youth between the ages of 16 to 24. When it was \ncreated, the YO program was meant to be the ``model'' job training \nprogram, the shining star in a system replete with false starts and \nfailed efforts. It drew on the best practices from a generation of \nprevious job training efforts, understanding that attacking the scourge \nof unemployment meant offering comprehensive services to at risk youth. \nPreparing young men and women for the workforce has to be more than \njust teaching someone to touch-type or hammer a nail. A job training \nprogram can put anyone into a job, but their efforts will only be \nsuccessful if we give them a comprehensive skill set and support \nservices.\n  This legislation draws on the strengths of the YO program but makes \nsome important modifications based on the experience of grantees. \nFirst, programs that receive YO grants will be required to provide \n``wrap-around'' services. This means not only workforce training, but \nalso those ``soft skills'' that are so essential to keeping a job.\n  Secondly, the STEP-UP Act encourages grantees to engage with local \nresources, such as labor organizations, educational institutions, as \nwell as the private sector. By bringing in private businesses, we can \ntruly bridge the gap between training and employment.\n  Finally, to make sure we don't travel willy-nilly down the same path, \nwe must invest in proven models, we must track progress and we must \nmake adjustments to improve programs as the facts flow in. That is why \nthe STEP-UP Act mandates strict oversight of job training programs that \nwill participate in the Youth Opportunity Grant programs. My bill \nrequires the Secretary of Labor to perform evaluations of participants \nafter the 24 months and report to Congress on the best practices \nimplemented by participants. Too frequently, we have funded job \ntraining efforts but we have not demanded results. The Department of \nLabor needs to dedicate themselves to understanding what programs work \nbest and why.\n  To summarize for a moment: we know the jobs are out there for young \nblack men, we know there are training programs that work, so what's the \nmissing link? The missing link is ensuring that work pays well enough \nto help lure young men into the workforce.\n  Given the limited earning potential for many young African American \nmales, there can be a lot of bottom line reasons not to work in the \nformal economy. Working a tough job in a warehouse for $7 an hour would \nput less than $300 a week and around $13,000 a year in your pocket. In \n2008, those wages don't go too far.\n  We need to make work pay for African American men.\n  The STEP-UP Act offers an economic incentive to join the workforce \nthrough a targeted expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, EITC. My \nbill doubles the current credit from $438 up to $875. Effectively, this \nbroadens the scope of the credit and you will be able to receive some \ncredit up until your income reaches $22,880. For someone without kids \nor a family to support, the extra money you would get from this program \nwould make a real difference.\n\n[[Page S1063]]\n\n  The second thing my bill does is extend the EITC to those low-wage \nearners who have kids and are current on their child support payments. \nThere are lots of men out there who really want to work and do right by \ntheir families. It can be an uphill battle for them, but many find a \nway to make it happen.\n  Considering that about a third of low-income noncustodial fathers \nnationwide are black, a federal EITC expansion could have a big impact \nfor them. Here is how my bill does it: If you are a dad paying your \nchild support, the existing childless tax credit is quadrupled from \n$438 to $1,719 a year. This is still much smaller than the credit a \nfamily with one child will receive, which is $2,917 in 2008.\n  Let me be clear: enhancing the EITC is not just about getting men \nworking but about strengthening families, and encouraging low-income \nfathers to fulfill their parenting responsibilities and stay current on \ntheir child support payments. Studies have documented a direct \ncorrelation between fathers who pay child support and their involvement \nin their children's lives. If we can get men working and they become a \npositive force in the lives of their sons and daughters, we will have \nachieved two very worthy objectives.\n  The Earned Income Tax Credit is just one example of a tax incentive \nthat translates to real dollars for working families. Another issue \nthat I want to address is the problem of keeping people in the \nworkforce. Too many men are cycling in and out of employment. We need \nto make steady employment pay.\n  The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, or WOTC, is one incentive that I \nthink needs to be strengthened and modified. Currently, WOTC is only a \ncredit for employers, and at its maximum it is worth $2,400 if the \nworker is employed for 400 hours or more. So if a worker making $7 an \nhour stays on the job for about 5 months, then his employer gets the \nmaximum credit, but he does not receive anything for hitting this \nbenchmark.\n  The STEP-UP Act expands WOTC to include employees so that it is not \nonly an employer credit, and to maximize its potential over time. \nSpecifically, once a worker has reached 1,500 hours on the job, or 52 \nweeks, both the employer and employee should get a $500 credit. We need \nto encourage employers to really invest in their workers and to ensure \nthat workers are staying on the job.\n  Today I am asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ncarefully consider this legislation. Given the severity of the African \nAmerican jobless problem and the unprecedented opportunity that will \nresult from the mass retirement of workers from the post war \ngeneration, shame on us if we do not figure out how to take action to \nput people who want to work into jobs that pay. It is up to us to align \nthese tools and make them work. We must. Not only must it be a moral \nimperative that we give more opportunity to African American men, it \nmust be a national imperative to keep our country competitive in the \n21st century. I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort and take \nthis initial step towards success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2648\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Training and \n     Employment Potential for Underemployed Populations Act'' or \n     the ``STEP UP Act''.\n\n                TITLE I--YOUTH OPPORTUNITY GRANT PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Finding employment that provides steady income and a \n     career track is a problem for young, undereducated men and \n     women who lack educational credentials and are disconnected \n     from the labor market.\n       (2) That problem is particularly acute for young African-\n     American men. In 2006, over \\1/5\\, or 21.8 percent, of black \n     men ages 16 through 24 were unemployed. This is roughly \n     double the unemployment rate for all young men (11.2 \n     percent).\n       (3) Even over a period of relative economic growth, \n     employment for disconnected African-American men has \n     declined. In 1999, 65 percent of African-American male high \n     school dropouts were jobless and not looking for work. In \n     2004, that rate had risen to 72 percent.\n       (4) The Youth Opportunity Grant Program was established in \n     the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to provide intensive job \n     training and placement activities as well as other \n     educational, social, and recreational services to at-risk, \n     hard-to-serve youth.\n       (5) The Youth Opportunity Grant Program built upon the most \n     promising strategies of previous demonstration programs that \n     strongly suggest the effectiveness of intensive case \n     management and follow-up services in assisting disconnected \n     young men and women in finding long-term employment.\n       (6) By reauthorizing and refining the Youth Opportunity \n     Grant Program, Congress could help make strides against those \n     serious problems faced by both young African-American men and \n     other disconnected youth.\n       (7) Over the course of the Youth Opportunity Grant Program, \n     36 localities with high poverty rates received funding \n     through grants. The Youth Opportunity Grant Program was \n     effective in assisting hard-to-reach populations. The \n     Department of Labor estimates that 42 percent of the eligible \n     youth and 62 percent of the eligible out-of-school youth in \n     the target areas enrolled in the Youth Opportunity Grant \n     Program.\n       (8) Further understanding of the successes of, challenges \n     faced by, and shortcomings of, the Youth Opportunity Grant \n     Program in the past, and in the future, will require \n     extensive evaluation and study by the Department of Labor.\n\n     SEC. 102.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Earned Income Tax Credit \n     Enhancement Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The earned income tax credit is considered one of the \n     most successful antipoverty programs in the United States. \n     Previous expansions of the earned income tax credit in the \n     1990s were instrumental in lifting families, especially \n     single parents, out of poverty by increasing income and \n     building assets.\n       (2) However, the earned income tax credit provides little \n     assistance for childless workers and noncustodial parents. \n     The credit for childless workers is only 15 percent of the \n     credit for a worker with 1 child.\n       (3) Increasing the maximum earned income tax credit amount \n     for childless workers would help to lift more individuals out \n     of poverty and mirror the successful credit expansion of the \n     1990s. Additionally, lowering the age of eligibility will \n     extend this important credit to the growing population of \n     young adults living in poverty.\n       (4) Although the effectiveness of the work opportunity tax \n     credit has come under scrutiny, the credit is limited in \n     scope. The credit is only available to employers and offers \n     no benefits to employees to encourage job retention. \n     Additionally, the credit only addresses short-term job \n     retention, not long-term employment.\n       (5) Expanding the work opportunity credit to employees and \n     increasing the time period of the credit's availability could \n     provide greater incentives for employees to stay in their \n     jobs and for employers to retain these workers over long-term \n     periods.\n\n     SEC. 203.

A bill to provide for a 5-year carryback of certain net \noperating losses and to suspend the 90 percent alternative minimum tax \nlimit on certain net operating losses; to the Committee on Finance. \n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to expand a widely used business tax benefit whereby \nbusiness owners balance out net losses over prior years when the \nbusiness has a net operating gain. Spreading out this tax liability \nhelps a business to decrease the adverse impact of a difficult year. \nSpecifically, this legislation increases the general net operating \nloss, NOL, carryback period from 2 years to 5 years in the case of an \nNOL for any taxable year ending during 2006, 2007, or 2008.\n  I am pleased with the quick passage of H.R. 5140, the Recovery \nRebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008. It \nprovides tax rebates for individuals, capital investment incentives for \nbusinesses, and important modifications to our housing laws that will \nenable more homeowners to refinance their unmanageable mortgages. \nHowever, it is my belief that several important items were left behind \nthat deserved to be included. The bill I am introducing today is \nidentical to Section 113 of a modified Senate Finance Committee \nEconomic Stimulus package, Senate Amendment No. 3983 to H.R. 5140. On \nFebruary 6, 2008, the Senate rejected this broader package on a \nprocedural vote, leaving it just one vote short of the 60 that were \nrequired. I am still hopeful that Congress will revisit some of these \nimportant issues in 2008, either as stand-alone legislation or as part \nof another stimulus package if it is determined to be appropriate.\n  One particular industry that would benefit from passage of this \nlegislation is the home building industry, which is currently \nstruggling due to a huge inventory of new homes under construction with \nfew buyers. Under present law, a business loss can only be deducted \nfrom taxes paid from the previous 2 years. If the loss cannot be \ncarried back, it must be used in the future. Many home builders are now \nreporting financial losses when a few years ago they were generating \njobs, providing local development, and paying taxes. Expanding the NOL \ncarry-back provision to 5 years would enable builders and other \nbusinesses to receive an immediate rebate on taxes paid in previous \nyears and provide a much needed infusion of capital to their \nbusinesses. The inability to do so will result in the need to either \nincrease high-cost borrowing or further liquidate land and homes, which \nwould only compound the existing inventory problem.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that passage of this \nprovision as part of the Senate Finance Committee Stimulus package \nwould have cost $15 billion in 2008 and $5.1 billion over 10 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation that will \nhelp numerous industries that are currently struggling to survive in a \nharsh economic downturn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 2651. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to make technical \ncorrections to the renewable fuel standard; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works. \n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Technical \nCorrections to the Clean Air Act's renewable fuels standard. This bill \nis a measured response to the overly aggressive biofuels increase \nmandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 passed in \nDecember. The Energy bill's mandates allow no room for error in a fuels \nindustry already constrained by tight supplies, full capacity, \nenvironmental regulation, and volatile market conditions. This \ntechnical corrections bill is not an effort to substantively overhaul \nthe RFS program but rather is an attempt to smooth its unintended \nconsequences. Recognizing the delicate political balance surrounding \nRFS, these simple fixes are intended to provide flexibility for the \nfuels industry in meeting these mandates. As ranking member on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee I did not support the 2007 \nEnergy bill. The enactment of these technical corrections would not \nchange my overall opposition to the current flaws enacted to the RFS \nprogram, but my bill does make this new RFS less onerous.\n  The first correction to the Clean Air Act's renewable fuels standard \nallows a carryover of ethanol credits. This improvement does nothing to \nchange the currently mandated numbers. Rather, it provides flexibility \nto an industry facing many uncertainties. In 2007, the industry used \napproximately 2 billion gallons of ethanol over and above the necessary \nlevels prescribed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, EPACT. However, \nEPACT language and EPA rulemaking do not allow for 2-year consecutive \n``carryover'' of credits. This means that although the industry has \nexceeded the 2007 requirements, they would be unable to apply these \ncredits after 12 months. My bill would accommodate the uncertain levels \nof production from year to year. Considering the myriad variables \ninvolved in the ethanol production process including crop yields, land \nuse, and feed stock prices, it only makes sense to allow more \nflexibility.\n  Another fix extends the small refinery exemption by 2 years. This \nlanguage also does nothing to change mandated levels. A small refinery \nproduces less than 75,000 barrels average daily aggregate and EPACT \nexempts these facilities from the renewable fuels numbers until 2011. \nThese refineries are dealing with drastically smaller economies of \nscale in production. In order to protect these refineries from \npotential economic hardship and subsequent job loss, this exemption \nshould be extended from the year 2011 to 2013. \n  I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate will join me and \nquickly pass the bill I am introducing today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Graham, and \n        Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 2652. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Defense to make a grant \nto the National World War II Museum Foundation for facilities and \nprograms of America's National World War II Museum; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Second World War will probably be \nknown as one of the greatest achievements in American history. The \nultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in Europe is a \ntestament to the uncommon valor of American Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, \nand Marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an unprecedented \nmobilization of domestic industry which supplied our fighting men on \ntwo distant fronts. As the generation that faced this challenge comes \nto a close, it is important that we take the time to honor them for the \nmany sacrifices they made. It was the gallantry of American troops \nabroad and the tireless devotion of workers at home that brought the \nend of this Great War.\n  I come to the floor today, to honor all of the 16 million World War \nII veterans and their families for the many sacrifices they made. \nToday, along\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\nwith eight of my colleagues, I would like to introduce America's \nNational World War II Museum Expansion Act.\n  On June 6, 2000, the 56th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of \nNormandy, the National D-Day Museum, operated in New Orleans, LA, \nopened their doors. The museum is the only museum in the U.S. that \nexists for the exclusive purpose of accounting for the American \nexperience during World War II, both on the battlefront and at home. \nThe museum educates on all of the branches of the Armed Forces and the \nMerchant Marine.\n  The museum was founded by the late World War II historian Stephen \nAmbrose. The museum and the decision to locate it in New Orleans was \nthe result of a conversation Mr. Ambrose had with President Dwight D. \nEisenhower. It was said in the conversation that President Eisenhower \nand former Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe, \ncredited Andrew Jackson Higgins, the man behind Higgins Industries in \nNew Orleans, as the ``man who won the war for us''. Higgins designed \nand produced amphibious landing crafts that became known as the Higgins \nBoats. These boats were used in every major amphibious operation of \nWorld War II, including D-Day, and responsible for transporting the men \nfrom the ship to the shore.\n  The museum is a premier educational institution, which educates \ndiverse audiences through its collection of artifacts, photographs, \nletters, documents, and personal testimonies of participants in the war \nand on the home front. It is important that we continue preserving, \nmaintaining, and interpreting the artifacts, documents, images, and \nhistory collected by the museum. For these reasons, in 2003 Congress \ndesignated the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans as America's \nNational World War II Museum. Since the designation, the Museum Board \nhas embarked on an extraordinary expansion, with plans to quadruple its \nsize. The museum will account for all service branches and campaigns of \nthe war, including the war on the home front.\n  This bill is a one time permanent $50 million authorization for the \nexpansion of the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. \nSpecifically, the $50 million authorization would provide funding for \nthe U.S. Freedom Pavilion, which is part of the museum's expansion. The \nU.S. Freedom Pavilion will be the main entrance building to the main \ntheatre, exhibit halls, and other pavilions. Among its major exhibits, \nthe Freedom Pavilion will contain an interactive exhibition honoring \nall of the World War II veterans who have also served the nation as \nPresident, or as a member of the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives between the years of 1941 and 1945.\n  A combination of State, local, and private funding, totaling $240 \nmillion, will match the $50 million Federal authorization. To date, the \nState of Louisiana has already dedicated $33 million toward the \nexpansion, and has pledged additional funds up to $50 million to match \ndollar for dollar the $50 million Federal authorization, if approved by \nCongress. The private sector support has already surpassed $40 million, \nand the remaining balance of the expansion will be raised privately.\n  A House companion bill, H.R. 2923, has been introduced by Chairman \nDingell and is cosponsored by 11 other members, including all members \nof the Louisiana U.S. House of Representatives Delegation. In closing, \nI want to give many thanks to Senators Inouye, Stevens, Lautenberg, \nVitter, Dole, Alexander, Cochran and Graham, for joining me in helping \nto preserve an important piece of our history. I would like to give \nspecial thanks to Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and Senator \nLautenberg.

A bill to further United States security by restoring and \nenhancing the competitiveness of the United States for international \nstudents, scholars, scientists, and exchange visitors and by \nfacilitating business travel to the United States; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today, along with my distinguished \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, I am introducing \nlegislation to restore and enhance our Nation's competitiveness for \ninternational students, scholars, scientists, and exchange visitors, \nand better facilitate legitimate business travel to the U.S.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the events of 9/11, it was necessary to \ntake the steps we did to improve and enhance our Nation's security. But \nin the more than 6 years since 9/11, these well-intentioned changes \nhave had unintended consequences, stifling legitimate academic and \nscientific exchange and international business travel, and tarnishing \nour Nation's image around the world.\n  Three years ago, Senator Bingaman and I introduced a similar bill \ndesigned to reverse the decline in the number of foreign students \nstudying at American colleges and universities. At that time, \ninternational applications to U.S. graduate schools and to English as a \nSecond Language, ESL, programs were plummeting, and visa delays were \nnumbering in the thousands. Visa delays were also negatively impacting \nthe scientific and business communities, resulting in billions of \ndollars of losses for the U.S. economy, as scientific research, \nconferences, and business meetings had to be canceled and shifted to \noverseas locations.\n  Over the past 3 years, there have been improvements with visa \nissuance, and it is the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, \nparticularly Assistant Secretary Maura Harty, who deserves much of the \ncredit. I am pleased with their advancements to enhance consular staff; \nadopt newer,\n\n[[Page S1069]]\n\nmore efficient technology; offer international students, scholars, and \nexchange visitors preferential consideration when scheduling in-person \ninterview appointments; and extend security clearance validity. The \nDepartment also has established a business visa center to field \ninquiries from U.S. businesses and their worldwide counterparts, \nalthough the center cannot expedite in-person interview appointments or \nthe processing of visa applications.\n  This is not to say that visa delays have disappeared entirely. Delays \ndo continue to occur, albeit not at the huge volume they once were. \nBecause of this, there is a lot of lingering uncertainty about the \nprocess which generates a great deal of concern for international \nstudents, scholars, exchange visitors, and business travelers, and \nreinforces a perception that America is not a welcoming place for \ninternational visitors.\n  Indeed, serious concerns remain regarding the U.S. position in the \ncompetition for international talent, particularly among higher \neducation, the scientific community, and the private sector. Our \ncompetitiveness problem is not just a visa problem--we cannot solve it \nsimply by fixing the visa problems that were created after 9/11.\n  The U.S. now faces strong competition for international students, \nscholars, scientists, and exchange visitors. The United Kingdom, \nAustralia, New Zealand, and the European Union all have coordinated, \ngovernment-led strategic plans in place for attracting international \nstudents and scholars to their colleges and universities. Even our \nneighbor to the north, Canada, plans to announce a strategic plan this \nyear. Meanwhile, traditional sending countries such as China and India \nare expanding their own higher education offerings, both to retain more \nof their own students and to attract international students. In the \nface of this competition, the U.S. still struggles along with piecemeal \nefforts, with each positive action seemingly cancelled out by a \nnegative action and persistent negative perceptions. The results are \nworrisome.\n  While international student enrollment in the U.S. declined in both \nthe 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 academic years, and remained stagnant in \n2005-2006, over the same period, enrollment in the United Kingdom \njumped more than 80,000, in Australia and France more than 50,000, and \nin Germany and Japan more than 20,000. In 2006, then-U.K. Prime \nMinister Tony Blair announced a goal of attracting an additional \n100,000 international students to Great Britain in the next 5 years.\n  Although we have started to see the enrollment numbers tick upwards \nslightly just this past year--in Minnesota, 9,048 international \nstudents were studying at colleges and universities last academic year, \ncontributing $186.4 million to the state's economy--it is still below \nthe peak level of 9,143 achieved in 2003-2004, so there is still ground \nto make up for what was lost over the past 3 years to ensure we regain \nour place as the most desired destination for study and for research. \nEven if we return to pre-9/11 numbers, we may find we have lost market \nshare to competing nations.\n  Why should this matter to the U.S.? Recent public opinion polls taken \naround the world show that the U.S. has fallen out of favor. But these \nsame polls also show that foreigners who have personally visited the \nU.S. have a significantly more favorable opinion than those who have \nnever visited.\n  International students and scholars benefit greatly from their \nexperiences in the U.S., not only from their studies and research, but \nalso from living in daily American life. They carry these experiences \nhome, often becoming ambassadors of goodwill and understanding. Many go \non to achieve leadership positions in their home countries in \ngovernment, business, or education. These exchanges also benefit \nAmerican students, researchers and business colleagues, who similarly \nhave the opportunity to learn about another culture in this globalized \nworld.\n  Two expert commissions recently issued recommendations citing \ninternational educational exchange as a critical form of public \ndiplomacy outreach. Last November, the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies' Commission on Smart Power cited international \neducational exchange as a key element for improving America's declining \nstanding and influence in the world. Just last month, the Secure \nBorders and Open Doors Advisory Committee, a federal advisory committee \ntasked by the Departments of Homeland Security and State to provide \nrecommendations on the Departments' missions to protect not only \nAmerica's security but also our economic livelihood, ideals, image, and \nstrategic relationships with the world, cited the need for a proactive \nnational strategy to mobilize all the tools and assets at our disposal \nto attract international students and scholars to the U.S.\n  International students and scholars are not only important for public \ndiplomacy, they also are essential for our Nation's global \ncompetitiveness. They make significant contributions to our economic \ngrowth and innovation. According to recent National Science Board data, \nnearly half of all graduate enrollments at U.S. colleges and \nuniversities in the science and engineering fields are international \nstudents. And these students often go on to positively impact future \nresearch and technology output in this country. I strongly support \nefforts to build up America's own supply of science and technology \ntalent, but we also must continue to actively attract international \ntalent to our shores if we are to retain our innovative edge.\n  It is a reality of our time that, at the high-skill level, the \ntemporary immigration system has become a conveyor belt of talent into \nthe permanent immigration system. Most foreign students do want to go \nhome after graduation, but some want to stay and use the knowledge they \nhave acquired at our universities. For example, Ms. Indra Nooyi, the \ncurrent CEO of PepsiCo, the world's fourth largest food and beverage \ncompany, is herself a former international student who received her \nmaster's degree from Yale University's School of Management.\n  So it is for all these important reasons that Senator Bingaman and I \nonce again introduce legislation on this important issue: The American \nCompetitiveness Through International Openness Now, ACTION, Act of \n2008.\n  This year's bill once again calls for the establishment of a \nstrategic plan for increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. in \nrecruiting international students, scholars and exchange visitors. The \nU.S. can no longer sit back and rest on its laurels when engaging in \nthis global competition, especially when all of our competitors clearly \nhave stepped up their game.\n  Our biggest problem is our inability to marshal the efforts of all \nthe relevant agencies into one coherent effort. Too often, these \nagencies work in an uncoordinated manner, or worse, at cross purposes. \nThe PR blunder cases, where one arm of our government sets up exchange \nprograms to attract people and another arm of the government detains \nthem at the border, is only the tip of the iceberg. Our legislation \nwould create a White House-chaired International Education Coordinating \nCouncil to guide the work of the myriad agencies that affect our \ncompetitiveness for international students and exchange visitors.\n  One of the most important provisions in the legislation would remove \nthe nonimmigrant intent requirement for international students, the so-\ncalled 214(b) rule. This outdated requirement that all applicants for \nstudent visas must intend to return home after their studies makes no \nsense, especially when talent-starved high-tech industries actively \ncourt international students upon graduation. As I stated earlier, our \nability to attract international talent is essential to sustaining our \ncompetitive edge in the world. Retaining such a requirement is simply \nout of step in this day and age, especially when most of our \ncompetitors are going out of their way to enact policies to make it \neasier for international students to stay after graduation.\n  The bill calls for further improvement in the timeliness and \nefficiency of the visa issuance process for those in the sciences. It \ndirects the Secretary of State to issue guidance to reduce the length \nof time to issue visas to scientists to a maximum of 30 days, and to \nprovide a special review process for those cases that are delayed more \nthan 45 days. It also directs the Secretary of State to review and \nupdate the Technology Alert List on a regular basis,\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\nand to consult with academia and the private sector as part of this \nreview, to ensure the list reflects the current state of technology.\n  It also calls for expediting visa reviews for so-called ``Trusted \nTravelers'': easily identifiable, low-risk frequent travelers who have \na history of past visa approvals, haven't violated their immigration \nstatus, and have provided their biometric data, plus any additional \ninformation required, to the consulate. This would both ease travel for \nthese individuals and permit consular resources to be focused on more \nimportant cases. There is also a provision to also allow expedited visa \nreviews for international students, scholars and exchange visitors who \nleave the United States temporarily to visit their families or attend \nconferences and require a new visa to return to the same program. \nToday, these people can be stranded abroad for months without being \nable to return to their programs.\n  The legislation calls for the reinstatement of domestic or stateside \nvisa renewals for those here on employment-based non-immigrant visas. \nThis practice was discontinued in 2004, because U.S. consulates abroad \nwere better equipped to collect the required biometric data from the \nrenewal applicant. Given today's available technology, we should seek \nto reinstate this practice. This would help to alleviate the volume of \nrenewal applicants at our overseas consulates, as well as help renewal \napplicants who often opt to forgo travel overseas due to the \nuncertainty of timely and efficient processing of their renewal \napplications.\n  Finally, there has been much public debate about driver's licenses \nand Real ID. In our well-intentioned efforts to ensure that only \npersons in the U.S. legally are able to acquire driver's licenses, we \nhave unintentionally hamstrung the ability of legal nonimmigrants to \nhave licenses. Real ID's unrealistic documentation and renewal \nrequirements for international students and scholars send yet another \nnegative signal about America's openness to them, and frankly ignore \ntechnical advances which could provide both better assurances about a \nperson's legal status and licenses of a longer validity. Our bill will \ncorrect this problem in a way that will strengthen, not weaken, the \nintegrity of driver's licenses.\n  For all of these reasons, our legislation is endorsed by NAFSA: \nAssociation of International Educators, the world's largest \nprofessional association advocating for international education and \nexchange programs, by the National Foreign Trade Council, the Nation's \npremier business organization dedicated to advancing global commerce, \nand by USA Engage, a leading broad-based coalition of trade \nassociations promoting global economic engagement.\n  The American way of life owes its success and vitality to its \nhistoric ability to harness the best in knowledge and ideas, not only \nthose that are homegrown, but also those that come from outside our \nborders. The longer we wait to take action, the more we risk missing \nout on future U.S. academic, business, and research success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Competitiveness \n     Through International Openness Now Act of 2008'' or as the \n     ``ACTION Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although the United States is engaged in a global \n     competition for international students and scholars, the \n     United States lacks a comprehensive strategy for conducting \n     and succeeding in this competition.\n       (2) In January 2008, the Secure Borders and Open Doors \n     Advisory Committee of the Homeland Security Advisory Council \n     issued a report that specifically cites international \n     education as a key component of public diplomacy, stating: \n     ``America is losing competitiveness for international \n     students for one primary reason . . . because our competitors \n     have--and America lacks--a proactive national strategy that \n     enables us to mobilize all the tools and assets at our \n     disposal, and that enables the federal bureaucracy to work \n     together in a coherent fashion, to attract international \n     students.''\n       (3) Attracting the world's most talented students and \n     scholars to campuses and research institutes in the United \n     States will contribute significantly to the leadership, \n     competitiveness, and security of this Nation.\n       (4) The international student market has been transformed \n     in the 21st century. Traditional competitor countries have \n     adopted and implemented strategies for capturing a greater \n     share of the market. New competitors, primarily the European \n     Higher Education Area, have entered the market. Traditional \n     sending countries, such as China and India, are expanding \n     their indigenous higher education capacity, both to retain \n     their own students and to attract international students. All \n     of these changes are giving international students many more \n     options for pursuing higher education outside their home \n     countries.\n       (5) The number of international students enrolled in United \n     States higher education institutions declined in the academic \n     years 2003-04 and 2004-05, and remained constant in academic \n     year 2005-06. In academic year 2006-07, international student \n     enrollments increased 3 percent, yet remained below the peak \n     level, achieved in the 2002-03 academic year.\n       (6) From 2003 to 2006, international student enrollments \n     increased--\n       (A) by more than 80,000 in the United Kingdom;\n       (B) by more than 50,000 in Australia and France; and\n       (C) by more than 20,000 in Germany and Japan.\n       (7) Anecdotal evidence indicates that international \n     students, scholars, and scientists continue to find the \n     process of gaining entry to the United States to be demeaning \n     and unnecessarily cumbersome.\n       (8) While intensive English programs in the United States \n     are a gateway to degree programs, international student \n     enrollments in such programs have declined by almost 50 \n     percent since 2000, and many schools offering such programs \n     have closed. This is due primarily to the difficulty of \n     obtaining a United States visa for the purpose of studying \n     English.\n       (9) At a time when talent is both scarce and mobile and \n     attracting talent is essential to the leadership, \n     competitiveness, and security of the United States, it is as \n     important for our Nation's visa system to be a gateway for \n     international talent as it is for it to be a barrier to \n     international criminals. Although the Department of State has \n     made significant progress in improving the United States visa \n     system, the system still does not effectively serve this dual \n     purpose.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that it should be the policy of \n     the United States--\n       (1) to make international educational exchange a priority \n     in order to promote United States leadership, \n     competitiveness, and security;\n       (2) to restore United States competitiveness for \n     international students, scholars, scientists, and exchange \n     visitors;\n       (3) to ensure that all agencies of the United States \n     Government work together to create a welcoming environment \n     for legitimate international students, scholars, scientists, \n     and exchange visitors, without sacrificing safety;\n       (4) to pursue a visa policy that keeps the United States \n     safe, prosperous, and free, by--\n       (A) addressing legitimate security concerns; and\n       (B) keeping the United States a welcoming Nation; and\n       (5) to ensure that United States consulates have adequate \n     resources to perform their required duties.\n\n     SEC. 4.

which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 454\n\n       Whereas Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) \n     is a type of infection that is resistant to treatment with \n     the usual antibiotics and is one of the most common pathogens \n     that cause Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) in the \n     United States and in many parts of the world;\n       Whereas a study led by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention estimates that in 2005 more than 94,000 invasive \n     MRSA infections occurred in the United States and more than \n     18,500 of these infections resulted in death;\n       Whereas the percentage of Staphylococcus aureus infections \n     in the United States that are attributable to MRSA has grown \n     from 2 percent in 1974 to 63 percent in 2004;\n       Whereas the annual number of hospitalizations associated \n     with MRSA infections, including both HAIs and community-based \n     infections, more than tripled between 1999 and 2005, from \n     108,600 to 368,600;\n       Whereas approximately 85 percent of all invasive MRSA \n     infections were associated with healthcare;\n       Whereas serious MRSA infections occur most frequently among \n     individuals in hospitals and healthcare facilities, \n     particularly the elderly, those undergoing dialysis, and \n     those with surgical wounds;\n       Whereas individuals infected with MRSA are most likely to \n     have longer and more expensive hospital stays, with an \n     average cost of $35,000;\n       Whereas there has been an increase in reported community-\n     acquired staph infection outbreaks, including antibiotic-\n     resistant strains, in States such as Illinois, New York, \n     Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, \n     and the District of Columbia;\n       Whereas clusters of community-acquired MRSA infections have \n     been reported since the late 1990s among competitive sports \n     teams, correctional facilities, schools, workplaces, military \n     facilities, and other community settings;\n       Whereas a person who is not infected with MRSA can be a \n     vehicle for the transmission of infections through skin-to-\n     skin contact; and\n       Whereas many instances of MRSA transmission can be \n     prevented through the use of appropriate hygienic practices, \n     such as hand washing and appropriate first aid for open \n     wounds and active skin infections, are followed: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the need to apply what is already known \n     about reducing the transmission of infections in hospitals, \n     effectively using diagnostics, and ensuring appropriate use \n     and utilization of antibiotics to meet patient and public \n     health needs;\n       (2) recognizes the need to pursue operational research to \n     find the best ways of preventing hospital- and community-\n     acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) \n     and developing new antibiotics for improving care for MRSA \n     patients;\n       (3) recognizes the importance of raising awareness of MRSA \n     and methods of preventing MRSA infections;\n       (4) supports the work of advocates, healthcare \n     practitioners, and science-based experts in educating, \n     supporting, and providing hope for individuals and their \n     families affected by community and healthcare associated \n     infections; and\n       (5) designates the month of March 2008 as ``MRSA Awareness \n     Month''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in response to the emerging threat of \nmethicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, infections, I \nintroduced legislation in November to improve the prevention, \ndetection, and treatment of community and healthcare-associated \ninfections. The Community and Healthcare Associated Infections \nReduction Act of 2007 builds on what hospitals are already doing and \nwhat infectious disease experts and government agencies agree is \ncritical to reducing the emergence of these infections.\n  In the last few months, the problem has persisted and Congress has \ndone little. The problem is not going away. Just last month a hospital \nin Chicago treated a patient with a nasty sore on his wrist that was \nattributable to MRSA. Unfortunately, the hospital found that the \ninfection was unresponsive to two medications that have been \nrecommended, mainstay treatments for MRSA. The already-formidable \nmicrobe has strengthened its defenses.\n  Scientists are constantly trying to learn more information about MRSA \nand its impact on communities, even while healthcare professionals are \nfighting to keep patients safe. Although MRSA infections can be mild or \nmoderate, almost 100,000 become serious and lead to 19,000 deaths each \nyear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  The CDC estimates that in 2005 in the U.S., 94,000 people developed \nan\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\ninvasive drug-resistant staph infection. Out of 94,000 infections, \nresearchers found that more than half were acquired in the health care \nsystem--people who had recently had surgery or were on kidney dialysis, \nfor example. The 9,000--often needless--American deaths from these \ninfections every year account for more than the number of people who \ndied from HIV/AIDS, homicide, emphysema, or Parkinson's.\n  MRSA infections are a persistent crisis. In 2002, Illinois hospitals \ndiagnosed 6,841 cases of MRSA. In 2006, that number was 10,714. Steady \ngrowth in the incidence of MRSA cases shows a 56.7 percent increase \nover a 5-year period. As a result, the State of Illinois has taken \naggressive steps to identify the infection before it grows out of \ncontrol. Illinois was the first State to require testing of all high-\nrisk hospital patients and isolation of those who carry the MRSA \nbacteria. Twenty-two States have passed laws that will give their \nresidents important information about hospital infections. Nineteen \nStates have laws that require public reporting of infection rates.\n  Hospitals are actively working to identify and control infections, \nimplementing infection control plans to maintain the safety of \npatients. For example, Evanston Northwestern Hospital is now placing \npatients who test positive for MRSA in ``contact isolation.'' That \nmeans patients are placed in private rooms or rooms with other MRSA-\npositive patients. Also, patients who developed symptoms of infection \nat the hospitals are tested and treated on the premises. The strategy \nis working. Evanston Northwestern went from 1,200 cases of patient-to-\npatient MRSA transmission in 2003 to 80 cases in 2006, and the \n$600,000-a-year program saved twice as much as it cost.\n  But we can't leave it up to the hospitals to control these \ninfections. About half of the infections that end up being treated in \nhospitals were actually picked up in the community. Schools in \nIllinois, Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and \nKentucky have had to close to help contain the spread of an infection. \nSchool officials in Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, and Virginia \nhave reported student deaths from bacteria, while officials in at least \nfour other States reported cases of students being infected.\n  Today, I am introducing a bipartisan resolution with the support of \nmy colleagues Senator Hatch, Senator Menendez, Senator Specter, and \nSenator Brown to designate March as MRSA Awareness Month. We hope this \nresolution will bring more attention to the need to address this \ncritical public health issue--not only by communities and healthcare \norganizations, but by the Federal Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1073-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1073-S1074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SENATE RESOLUTION 455--CALLING FOR PEACE IN DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nColeman, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 455\n\n       Whereas, during the past 4 years in Darfur, hundreds of \n     thousands of innocent victims have been murdered, tortured, \n     and raped, with more than 2,000,000 people driven from their \n     homes;\n       Whereas some but not all of the parties to the conflict in \n     Darfur participated in the first round of a United Nations-\n     African Union peace process launched in October 2007 in \n     Sirte, Libya;\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) reached \n     between the Government of Sudan and the Sudanese People's \n     Liberation Movement (SPLM) in January 2005 has not been fully \n     or evenly implemented;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan has continued to obstruct \n     the deployment of a joint United Nations-African Union \n     peacekeeping force to Darfur that would include non-African \n     elements;\n       Whereas elements of armed rebel movements in Darfur, \n     including the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), have made \n     violent threats against the deploying peacekeeping force;\n       Whereas 13 former world leaders and current activists, \n     including former president Jimmy Carter, former United \n     Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Bangladeshi \n     microfinance champion Muhammed Yunus, and Archbishop Desmond \n     Tutu, have called for the immediate deployment of the \n     peacekeeping force; and\n       Whereas, while these and other issues remain pending, it is \n     the people of Darfur, including those living in refugee \n     camps, who suffer the continuing consequences: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls upon the Government of Sudan and other \n     signatories and non-signatories to the May 5, 2006, Darfur \n     Peace Agreement to declare and respect an immediate cessation \n     of hostilities, cease distributing arms to internally \n     displaced persons, and enable humanitarian organizations to \n     have full unfettered access to populations in need;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of Sudan to facilitate the \n     immediate and unfettered deployment of the United Nations-\n     African Union peacekeeping force, including any and all non-\n     African peacekeepers;\n       (3) urges all invited individuals and movements to attend \n     the next round of peace negotiations and not set \n     preconditions for such participation;\n       (4) calls upon the diverse rebel movements to set aside \n     their differences and work together in order to better \n     represent the people of Darfur and end their continued \n     suffering;\n       (5) encourages the participation in future talks of \n     traditional Arab and African leaders from Darfur, women's \n     groups, local nongovernmental organizations, and leaders from \n     internally displaced persons (IDP) camps;\n       (6) condemns any intimidation or threats against camp or \n     civil society leaders to discourage them from attending the \n     peace talks, whether by the Government of Sudan or rebel \n     leaders;\n       (7) condemns any action by any party, government or rebel, \n     that undermines or delays the peace process in Darfur; and\n       (8) calls upon all parties to the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement (CPA) to support and respect all terms of the \n     agreement.\n\n  Mr. DUBRIN. Mr. President, time and time again I have come to the \nfloor to speak about the ongoing genocide in Darfur.\n  For more than 4 years the world has watched this humanitarian crisis \nunfold--thousands murdered, tortured, raped, and chased from their \nhomes. Thousands more languishing year after year in refugee camps.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly called for \ngreater U.S. and international action. President Bush has called the \nsituation genocide and British Prime Minister Brown said ``Darfur is \nthe greatest humanitarian crisis the world faces today.''\n  U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has made ending the crisis in \nDarfur one of his top priorities.\n  Thirteen former world leaders and current activists--a group of \n``Elders''--including former president Jimmy Carter, former U.N. \nSecretary General Kofi Annan, Bangladeshi microfinance champion \nMuhammed Yunus, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu have called for the \nimmediate deployment of a peacekeeping force to Darfur.\n  Here at home, thousands of students, churches, and other activists \nhave helped raise awareness of the horrible human suffering in Darfur.\n  Such efforts led to an important vote last year by the U.N. Security \nCouncil to deploy 26,000 peacekeepers from the U.N. and African Union. \nThis peacekeeping force would go to Darfur to halt the violence and \ncreate conditions for a long-term political settlement.\n  Late last year, Congress passed the Sudan Divestment and \nAccountability Act, which will help concerned Americans ensure that \ntheir investments do not support the murderous regime in Khartoum.\n  Yet, despite such overwhelming calls for action, the Sudanese \ngovernment continues to brutalize its own people and thumb its nose at \nthe international community.\n  Earlier this week Sudanese army and allied militia forces, with the \nhelp of helicopter gunships and planes, conducted yet another major \nassault in Darfur, burning villages, killing civilians, and forcing \nthousands more to flee into increasingly unstable Chad.\n  Equally troubling are blatant efforts by the Sudanese government to \nobstruct deployment of the peacekeeping force. For example, Sudan's \nleaders have balked at deployment of non-African forces. Last month \ngovernment forces fired upon a peacekeeping convoy.\n  In recent months the regime has even appointed notorious figures \ncomplicit in the Darfur genocide to senior government positions. Two \nare wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes.\n  Incredibly, one such figure, Ahmed Haroun, was actually appointed to \nbe Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, ostensibly to assist the very \npeople he helped displace.\n  It is time to bring an end to the violence and set the conditions for \na long-term political settlement.\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\n  Last week Senator Biden led a resolution that called on the President \nto immediately address any equipment shortcomings with the peacekeeping \nforce.\n  I wholeheartedly agree.\n  The White House must not allow a modest shortage of equipment to \nprolong the suffering in Darfur.\n  Today I am introducing a resolution, along with Senators Biden, \nBrownback, Coleman, Feingold, Menendez, and Voinovich calling for an \nimmediate halt to the violence and a commitment from all sides to \nparticipate in the next round of peace talks.\n  The resolution also calls upon the government of Sudan to facilitate \nthe immediate and unfettered deployment of the U.N.-African Union \npeacekeeping force, including any and all non-African peacekeepers.\n  The resolution calls upon the diverse rebel movements to set aside \ntheir differences and work together in order to better represent the \npeople of Darfur and end their continued suffering.\n  The resolution condemns any action by any party--government or \nrebel--that undermines or delays the peace process.\n  The resolution call upon the government of Sudan to enable \nhumanitarian organizations to have full unfettered access to \npopulations in need; and it calls upon all parties to the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement between North and South Sudan to support and respect \nall terms of the agreement.\n  We have allowed the humanitarian crisis in Darfur to continue for far \ntoo long. We have allowed a brutal regime to repeatedly obstruct and \nignore the international community.\n  I call on my colleagues to join us as we call on the U.S. to put is \nfull weight behind deployment of a peacekeeping force and pushing all \nsides toward a long-term political solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1074-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1074-S1075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 456--DIRECTING THE UNITED STATES TO UNDERTAKE \nBILATERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH CANADA TO NEGOTIATE AN AGREEMENT TO CONSERVE \n POPULATIONS OF LARGE WHALES AT RISK OF EXTINCTION THAT MIGRATE ALONG \n                 THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD OF NORTH AMERICA\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Sununu) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 456\n\n       Whereas populations of large whales in the north Atlantic, \n     including north Atlantic right whales, fin whales, and \n     humpback whales, were substantially reduced, largely due to \n     commercial whaling efforts that ended more than 60 years ago \n     in the United States and more than 30 years ago in Canada, \n     and rebuilding and protecting these species requires \n     significant conservation efforts;\n       Whereas the United States and Canada share the goals of \n     marine resource conservation through sound scientific \n     research and seek to protect large whales at risk of \n     extinction;\n       Whereas north Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and \n     fin whales are listed as ``endangered'' under the United \n     States Endangered Species Act and ``depleted'' under the \n     Marine Mammal Protection Act, and north Atlantic right whales \n     are listed as ``endangered'' and fin whales are listed as a \n     species of ``special concern'' under Canada's Species at Risk \n     Act;\n       Whereas north Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and \n     fin whales, migrate throughout the north Atlantic Ocean, \n     including through the waters of the United States and Canada \n     along the eastern Atlantic Seaboard;\n       Whereas the populations of large whales in the north \n     Atlantic Ocean are affected by natural factors including \n     availability of forage and oceanographic conditions such as \n     water temperature, salinity, and currents, and additional \n     research on these topics will facilitate whale conservation;\n       Whereas some fishermen in both the United States and Canada \n     employ fixed gear types within the migratory range of large \n     whales, thereby exposing the species to risks of \n     entanglement, and ships transiting both United States and \n     Canadian waters have been known to strike large whales \n     resulting in injury or death of the cetaceans;\n       Whereas the United States has taken significant regulatory \n     and advisory steps to reduce the impacts of its fishing and \n     shipping activities on large whale species, including \n     restrictions on fixed fishing gear, closures of areas to \n     certain types of fishing effort seasonally, and advisory \n     restrictions on vessel traffic;\n       Whereas effective regulations to ensure conservation and \n     protection of these large whale species must be a \n     transboundary, bilateral effort that equitably distributes \n     the costs and benefits of whale conservation among regulated \n     and other concerned parties in each Nation, including the \n     United States and Canadian governments, the fishing and \n     shipping industries, States, Canadian provinces, and \n     interested nongovernmental organizations;\n       Whereas Canada and the United States have a history of \n     cooperation on transboundary marine resource issues, \n     including a joint effort by the Canadian Department of \n     Fisheries and Oceans and the United States' Provincetown \n     Center for Coastal Studies and the New England Aquarium to \n     assist entangled large whales in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of \n     Maine;\n       Whereas the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration has long been involved with a series of \n     bilateral discussions with Canada concerning the United \n     States Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, and the \n     Canadian Species at Risk Plan;\n       Whereas encouraging collaboration between representatives \n     of the United States and Canadian Federal governments, \n     affected States and Canadian provinces, affected fishing and \n     shipping industries, and non-governmental organizations will \n     facilitate the parties' ability to develop a sound, \n     scientifically supported, mutually acceptable agreement: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate, That--\n       (1) the United States should undertake bilateral \n     discussions with Canada to negotiate an agreement for the \n     conservation and protection of migratory or transboundary \n     populations of large whales at risk of extinction in the \n     northwest Atlantic Ocean;\n       (2) the agreement negotiated pursuant to paragraph (1) \n     should contain mechanisms, inter alia, for reducing incidents \n     of endangered large whales becoming entangled in fishing \n     gear, being struck by ships, or otherwise adversely impacted \n     by human activity;\n       (3) the mechanisms developed pursuant to paragraph (2) \n     should ensure that--\n       (A) the costs and benefits of whale conservation \n     regulations are to the extent feasible fairly and equitably \n     distributed among regulated and other concerned parties \n     including the United States and Canadian governments, the \n     fishing and shipping industries, States, Canadian provinces, \n     and interested nongovernmental organizations;\n       (B) the full economic impact on fishing communities is \n     considered in the development of such measures; and\n       (C) the best available science on whale behavior, including \n     diving, feeding, and migration, is used to develop \n     conservation mechanisms;\n       (4) as any bilateral agreement is negotiated and \n     implemented, the United States and Canada should consult \n     with, inter alia, affected fishery management agencies, \n     coastal States and provinces impacted by the agreement, and \n     appropriate industry and nongovernmental organizations; and\n       (5) until the agreement pursuant to paragraph (1) becomes \n     operational, the United States should continue to undertake \n     efforts to reduce the impacts of human activity on endangered \n     large whales while taking steps, to the extent consistent \n     with United States law, to minimize the economic impact of \n     such efforts on affected industries.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \ndirecting the U.S. to undertake bilateral discussions with Canada to \nnegotiate an agreement to conserve endangered large whales that migrate \nalong the Atlantic seaboard of North America. I would also like to \nthank my colleagues, Senators Collins and Sununu for their \ncosponsorship. Whales do not recognize international boundaries, and it \nis critical that we work with our neighbors to develop consistent means \nto protect whales from potentially harmful interactions with fishing \ngear, ships, and other manmade threats.\n  Both the U.S. and Canada have taken steps to reduce the impacts of \ntheir respective maritime industries on endangered whale populations, \nbut neither country can provide adequate protection working \nindependently of the other. Large whales, including critically \nendangered north Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and fin \nwhales, migrate throughout the north Atlantic Ocean, crossing \nfrequently between Canadian and U.S. waters where fishermen on both \nsides of the boundary employ fishing methods that pose a risk of \nentanglement, and transiting ships have been known to strike the \ncetaceans, resulting in serious injury or death.\n  The U.S. has long been a global leader in marine mammal protection. \nThe Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, developed under the \nauspices of the National Marine Fisheries Service, NMFS, carries a \nmandate to reduce incidents of whale entanglement with fishing gear and \nof ship strikes, and it has issued numerous regulations aimed at \nachieving its goals. Unfortunately, many of its regulations on the U.S. \nfishing industry have not been matched by their management counterparts \nnorth of the border. Most recently, in\n\n[[Page S1075]]\n\nOctober of this year, NMFS issued new regulations, including a mandate \nfor lobster fishermen to use sinking rope to connect their strings of \nlobster pots. The intent of this rule is to reduce the amount of rope \nin the water column and thus the risk of a whale becoming entangled. \nTraditionally, lobstermen have fished using floating rope because in \nthe strong tides and rocky sea floor we experience in many areas off \nthe coast of Maine, sinking rope can chaff, abrade, and break quite \neasily. These rules, which are due to take effect in October of this \nyear will increase fishermen's overhead cost by requiring more frequent \nreplacement of degraded rope, and pose a safety hazard for our \nlobstermen. Canadian fishermen experience no similar restrictions on \ntheir gear, thereby reducing their overhead costs relative to U.S. \nfishermen. This not only gives them a competitive advantage in the \nmarketplace, but also provides no benefit to the endangered species of \nwhales our lobstermen are making sacrifices to protect.\n  Canada should be praised, however, for its efforts to implement \nregulations on its shipping industry, including imposing speed limits \nin areas whales are known to frequent. NMFS's Take Reduction Team has \ndeveloped similar regulations for shippers transiting areas of U.S. \nwaters, and NMFS sent its final rule to the Office of Management and \nBudget nearly 1 year ago, but to date, that office has failed to \nrelease it. I find it inexcusable that the administration finds it \nacceptable to impose harsh restrictions on the lobster industry, which \nis comprised of hardworking small businessmen struggling to make ends \nmeet, but refuses to impose restrictions on a multi-billion dollar \nindustry. This despite the fact that the cost of the ship strike rules, \nexpressed as a percentage of the affected industry's total earnings, \nwill be a fraction of the cost of the gear restrictions. This inequity \nis exacerbated by the fact that since 2001, nearly three times more \nwhales have been confirmed killed by ship strikes than by entanglement \nin fishing gear.\n\n  I expect that this resolution will serve to spur productive \nconversations between the U.S. and Canada that will ultimately lead to \ndevelopment of bilateral whale protection measures. By agreeing to \nequal protection measures in U.S. and Canadian waters, we can not only \nguarantee more comprehensive protection for endangered whales, but also \na fair distribution of cost to affected industries and a level playing \nfield for both U.S. and Canadian products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1075-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 457--RECOGNIZING THE CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL \n        SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHINESE NEW YEAR OR SPRING FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

We in Nevada experience the very hot summers, and people in \nNevada who are poor and infirm suffer as much from the heat as people \nin Vermont do from the cold.

Reserving the right to object, and I certainly will not, \ngiven that the Senator from Florida has offered the consent on my \nbehalf, I thank him for stepping forward and offering his request.\n  This is legislation that I coauthored with Senator Clinton. On the \nHouse side, there were Representatives Jan Schakowsky and Peter King \nwho introduced companion legislation. It addresses the issue of known \ntraffic accidents. There were 230 children killed last year in \nnontraffic auto accidents. We worked very cooperatively with Senator \nNelson and others on the Commerce Committee to put together a package \nthat could be implemented quickly and effectively to help reduce this \nunnecessary loss of life.\n  I thank Senator Nelson for his work on the committee and certainly \noffer my praise for the work done on the other side.

Mr. NELSON of \nFlorida. Mr. President, I just want to say this has been a long time \ncoming. There was a hiccup back in December. We tried to get it cleared \nthen. This is the backover bill, the horror of any parents that their \nchild is behind the car, and they cannot see the child or a neighbor is \nbacking from their garage down their driveway, and they cannot see the \nchild.\n  So what this bill will require is a device that can be either a \nsensor or a viewer. It will require that in future vehicles. It will \nalso require that when automatic windows go up, if they hit an object, \nsuch as a child's neck and head, automatically that window goes down.\n  This is much-needed legislation. We are very appreciative that the \nSenate has cleared this action, and we can get it over to the House and \ntry to get it passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/14/senate-section/article/S1083-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA\n\n  Mr. REID.
