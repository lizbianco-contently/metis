A vote in relation to that amendment is \nexpected to occur at 10:10 or 10:15 this morning. Last night cloture \nwas filed on the Baucus-Grassley amendment, and cloture was filed to \nthe substitute amendment and the Energy bill itself.\n  Last night I stated the obvious. Every step of the way for 6 months \nwe have had to procedurally jump through every hoop the complicated \nSenate rules allow. That is unfortunate. We, as Democrats, have been in \nthe minority, and we never did anything similar to this. There were \ntimes when it was necessary, because of what we did not allow, that \ncloture was filed. But this is untoward, what is happening now.\n  I hope the Republican leadership would look at this. Is it necessary, \nif we get cloture on the substitute, to have to go forward on a cloture \nvote on the bill itself? I hope not.\n  Germane first-degree amendments to the substitute and the bill need \nto be filed at the desk by 1 p.m. today. There will be votes today and \ninto the evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8001-7", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8001-S8002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, a few feet out of this Chamber, I \nhad the opportunity to meet with three young ladies from Nevada. Megan \nChristensen is 14 years old; Anna Ressel, from Sparks, 13 years old; \nand Jordan Exber, a 14-year-old from Las Vegas.\n  These girls were here to present me with a little award as a result \nof work I have done on juvenile diabetes. I was representative of many \npeople who have worked on the issue. But the reason I mention this is \nnot any award that was given to me or any of the other Senators but the \nplight of these young ladies.\n  One of the girls was determined to have diabetes 3 months ago--a \nbeautiful child, Jordan, from Las Vegas. They prepared a book for me: \n``2007, Children's Congress.''\n  Among other things, one of the pictures in this is a bunch of \nsyringes. Look at this. I can't count them. This is 1 week's picking \nand poking at this young lady's body that she has to go through because \nof diabetes.\n  Type 1 juvenile diabetes is a chronic disease and for the child with \ntype 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce insulin, a hormone \nnecessary to sustain life. Without insulin the sugar in the blood can't \nbe used. It builds up in the bloodstream, even though the body is \nstarved for energy. A person with type 1 diabetes must take one or more \ninjections of insulin daily to stay alive.\n  She has written here: ``I take 42 shots, at least, every week. This \ndoes not count the testing,'' to find out\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\nwhat her blood sugar levels are; 42 a week.\n  The reason I mention this is these young and beautiful children were \nhere to talk about something the President is going to do today--veto \nstem cell research legislation. What a shame. Last year, the \nRepublican-controlled House and Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill to \nopen up hope for these young ladies.\n\n  To indicate this is not just something that is important for Nevada, \nthey had there a girl from Australia. A teenager from Australia was \nhere to indicate this is an international problem. We in America, with \nthe genius we have here--out of the top 142 universities in the world, \nwe have 129 of them in America. One of the best, of course, is in the \nState of the Presiding Officer--Johns Hopkins. Research is going on \nthere. Stem cell research should be going on there, and it is not.\n  It was a happy day for all of us when the bill passed the House and \nthe Senate. It was a day Democrats and Republicans put politics and \npartisanship aside to do the right thing for the American people. Yet \nwhen we sent this historic bill to the President's desk, he vetoed it. \nIt was his first veto of his Presidency.\n  With the health and hope of literally millions of Americans hanging \nin the balance, he vetoed the bill. It was the first veto, I repeat, of \nhis administration.\n  A year passed. The best scientists continued to work with one hand \ntied behind their backs. I indicated 129 great universities in America, \nthe best universities in the world, are not allowed to do this. \nCountless millions of Americans have been diagnosed with dread \ndiseases, thousands and thousands, with Parkinson's, spinal cord \ninjuries, heart disease. A year has passed, but today we are told the \nPresident plans to veto the stem cell bill again.\n  These children suffer from diabetes. They were here to help get this \nbill passed.\n  When we sent the bill to the President 2 weeks ago, Speaker Pelosi \nand I were joined by 10-year-old Toni Bethea, who lives in the District \nof Columbia and suffers from diabetes, and Allison Howard, who suffers \nfrom Rett Syndrome--beautiful children, one of them extremely ill. They \ndeserve hope, just like these girls from Las Vegas, Sparks, Reno, from \nAustralia.\n  President Bush has indicated that he would not give them any hope. He \nis going to veto the bill, we are told. He would not listen to the more \nthan 500 leading organizations who support this bill, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, AARP, the American Medical Association, \nthe American Diabetes Association, more than 500 organizations. He \nwould not listen to 80 Nobel laureates who have said this is essential. \nHe would not listen to his own Director--I am talking about President \nBush--his own Director of the National Institutes of Health, who \nsupports embryonic stem cell research. He is not listening to the \nmajority of the American people. This proposal is supported by more \nthan 80 percent of the American public. They call for stem cell \nresearch.\n  This narrow ideology that has guided this administration, that has us \nin this intractable war in Iraq, that has us losing standing in the \nworld community, having 47 million Americans with no health care and no \nplan coming from the White House to improve that--a program that is \nlacking in keeping our children in school. On the environment, global \nwarming is taking place. It is being ignored by this White House. This, \na hope for millions--stem cell research--indicates this narrow ideology \nis wrong, and it is preventing the curing of diseases, the prevention \nof diseases. We deserve better. We are a nation of endless compassion \nand unlimited ingenuity. Megan, Anna, Jordan, Toni, and Allison deserve \nto know we are a better country than this narrow ideology.\n  President Bush's veto is a setback, but we are going to continue to \ngive hope to these children and the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8002-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 30 minutes of debate on amendment No. 1546, offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint, with the time equally divided \nand controlled between the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, and \nMr. DeMint.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 5 minutes and that it count \nagainst my allocated 15 minutes on my amendment and that it appear in a \nseparate place in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeMINT are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1546\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak \nabout my amendment which the Senate will be voting on a few minutes \nafter 10 this morning. This amendment would create a 60-vote point of \norder against bills or amendments in the future that would raise the \nprice of gasoline.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. It would require the \nCongressional Budget Office to score legislation to determine if it \nwould increase the cost of gasoline. If the legislation would increase \nthe cost of gasoline, a 60-vote point of order would lie against the \nbill.\n  This applies the same principle we use in the Congressional budget \nprocess to our energy policy. The traveling public is coping with the \nhigh price of gasoline every day. While there are many factors out of \nour control forcing up the price of gas, we can control what we do here \nin the Senate.\n  For all the time that has been spent over the last few weeks railing \nagainst big oil or the high cost of gasoline, little time has been \nspent to examine one of the leading causes of high prices of gasoline, \nwhich is the Congress. Too often the idea of a rational energy policy \nhere in Congress is to create burdensome regulations, onerous mandates, \nand higher taxes, all of which directly translate into higher prices at \nthe pump for American families. My amendment proposes to hold Congress \nin check by instituting a safeguard that encourages the Senate to take \na ``do not harm'' approach when considering legislation affecting gas \nprices.\n  My amendment, again, is very straightforward and very simple. If the \nSenate wants to pass legislation that\n\n[[Page S8003]]\n\nwill make it more expensive for American families to fill up their \ntank, we will be required to get 60 votes instead of 51 to pass the \nlegislation. While this amendment is relatively simple, it is also \nvitally important, because, while many of the Democrats in this body \nlike to tell the American people they are working to ``stick it to big \noil'' and lower the price of gasoline, their legislative record shows \nsomething quite different.\n  The current bill is a perfect example. According to a study completed \nthis week by the Heritage Foundation, the Energy bill we are currently \ndebating could result in significantly higher prices for gasoline to \nconsumers. A review of the legislation, including the new amendment \ndealing with tax changes, revealed the bill could increase the price of \nregular unleaded gasoline from $3.15 per gallon, which is the May \naverage right now, to $6.40 a gallon by 2016.\n  That is an increase of over 100 percent. The point of order my \namendment proposes could not be used against this bill because it \ncannot take effect until the bill is enacted. But my amendment could be \nused to stop similar legislation in the future. If this Congress is \nwilling to consider legislation that would raise the price of gasoline \nby over 100 percent, as this bill may do, we need to put some \ncommonsense safeguards in place.\n  I know some of my colleagues may in the future support policies that \nwould raise the price of gasoline. That would cause the point of order \nI am proposing to lie against the bill. But I would encourage even \nthose to support this amendment. If their policy goal is so important, \nthen we can overcome the point of order and we can get 60 votes to pass \ntheir legislation.\n  We should adopt this commonsense proposal that ensures that at the \nvery least the Senate is less likely to increase the cost of gasoline. \nAfter all the concerns we have heard from my Democratic colleagues \nabout the price of gasoline, this seems the least we can do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the DeMint amendment as described by \nSenator DeMint creates a 60-vote point of order in the Senate on any \nlegislation or part of legislation that would ``result in an increase \nin the national average fuel price for automobiles.''\n  By legislation, that is usually interpreted to mean a bill, a joint \nresolution, an amendment, a motion, or a conference report. The \ndetermination of whether any of those enumerated items would result in \nan increase in the national average fuel price for automobiles would be \nmade by CBO in consultation with the Energy Information Administration.\n  This is another piece of ``feel good'' legislation that would have \nthe probable effect of making a great deal of what we do here in the \nSenate subject to a 60-vote point of order. Frankly, world oil prices \nand domestic fuel prices are swayed by all sorts of influences and \npsychological factors in the market. To think the Congressional Budget \nOffice would be able to analyze price effects of legislative proposals \nmight play in this complex stew of what traders and producers and major \nrefiners think will happen is not realistic. This point of order would \ngive a tremendous amount of influence to the petroleum industry. Most \nanything we do up here causes them to complain we are likely to raise \ngasoline prices as a result.\n  For example, they are saying that right now about the \nantimanipulation and consumer protection provisions in the bill that \nwere voted out of the Commerce Committee. If there were a 60-vote point \nof order their complaint could trigger, they would certainly be in \nconstant contact with Member offices and with the Congressional Budget \nOffice trying to boost the minimum votes necessary for these proposals \nto 60 votes.\n\n  Let me give you a few examples of amendments to the bill Members want \nto offer that might be caught up in this kind of a point of order. \nSenator Cochran has an amendment he wants to offer to increase the size \nof the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Any purchase of oil for the SPR \nwould take that oil off the market and potentially raise fuel prices. \nThat would trigger the DeMint point of order.\n  Another example is the provision in the amendment that was adopted in \nthe Senate by over 60 votes yesterday that is referred to generally as \nNOPEC, which essentially says U.S. courts will be open and available \nand have jurisdiction to consider antitrust claims against foreign \ngovernments that are getting together and trying to conspire to set oil \npolicies. That legislation could clearly affect the price of oil and \nthereby the price of gasoline at the pump. We have an interest in \ncreating reserves of products for refined gasoline. We already have a \nheating oil reserve. Legislation to establish new product reserves or \nto increase the size of the heating oil reserve would likely trigger \nthis point of order my friend is suggesting we ought to put into our \nprocedural law.\n  Our military posture in the Persian Gulf has a great deal to do with \nthe world price of oil. We might find that amendments or other \nlegislative proposals dealing with sensitive military or diplomatic \nissues in that region would have an effect on automobile fuel prices \nunder this amendment and could thus trigger the point of order. We \nmight see the whole Defense bill annually subjected to the DeMint point \nof order on the claim that what we are proposing to do in the Defense \nbill could increase the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  It is worth focusing on the fact that the point of order is triggered \nby ``an increase'' found by the Congressional Budget Office. That \nincrease could be less than a penny a gallon and still the 60-vote \npoint of order would be triggered as the amendment is drawn.\n  Another example would be any legislation that might be considered on \nthe Senate floor related to Nigeria and our relations with Nigeria. \nClearly, we are heavily dependent upon oil from Nigeria to meet our \nenergy needs. Any instability in that relationship could affect the \nprice of oil or the price of gasoline as a result of increases in the \nprice of oil.\n  People are always complaining it is hard to get things done here in \nthe Congress. We have too many procedural wrangles here in the \nCongress. There is an abundance already of procedural hurdles that any \nlegislative proposal has to surmount in order to get passed.\n  We have been pleading with various Senate Members in connection with \nthis exact bill to try to get permission to bring up different \namendments, even agreeing that we would be bound by a 60-vote point of \norder or a 60-vote requirement to do that. So we already have \nprocedural hurdles in place in abundance. We should not be inserting \ninto Senate procedures a requirement that will come back to haunt both \nRepublicans and Democrats in completely unforeseen and unforeseeable \nways just in order to say we did something about high gas prices.\n  I strongly urge that we not agree to the DeMint amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the Senator's \nremarks. I think the remarks were very instructive. It is clear that \nmany of things we do in the Senate actually do result in increased gas \nprices.\n  Most of the discussion and a lot of the initiative and motivation of \nthe bill we are working on is to lower gas prices. The fact is, in the \npast, though, we have not been honest and transparent with the American \npeople. Many times we are talking about our good intentions, things we \nare going to do here, and we do not expose the fact that what we are \ndoing is going to increase the cost of gasoline. I think that is a fair \npart of the debate. If we want to increase our national reserves of \noil, then it is fair in that debate to make it clear to the American \npeople that if we do it, it may increase the cost of gasoline to them \nat home, so all of us who are considering the issue can balance it.\n  If some aid program to Nigeria is going to increase the cost of \ngasoline here at home, the American people should know that, so we \ncannot claim to be doing something for people without them realizing it \nis costing them more and more money.\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\n  I understand the objections to procedural hurdles here. Actually, \nthat is the way the Senate was designed so that we do not do things in \na knee-jerk fashion, without openness and debate, so we actually do \nfigure out the consequences of what we do in advance of passing \nlegislation.\n  We have not done that in the past. Many of our rules have created \ndifferent boutique, different fuel requirements in many States, a lot \nof environmental concerns--a lot of things that are good actually \nincreased the cost of gasoline a significant degree.\n  It is important that we include that in our debate. While we may be \nresistant to procedural hurdles, much of the bill we are debating \ncreates multiple procedural hurdles to increase new gas supplies, oil, \nnatural gas. It creates new mandates, new taxes. We create a lot of \nhurdles for the energy business to create more supply so we can lower \nthe price of gasoline. This amendment exposes us for what we are and \nwhat we are doing. If we are going to propose things in the Senate \nrelated to energy, the Congressional Budget Office, as my amendment \nsays, in consultation with the Energy Information Administration and \nother appropriate Government agencies, can help make a determination if \nwhat we are doing is going to raise the price of gasoline. That is a \nfair part of an honest debate.\n  To snuff this out and to come down to the Senate floor and make great \nclaims about what we are going to do to help the American people while \nall the time hiding from them that we are the ones raising their gas \nprices--it is not big oil, it is not necessarily even OPEC, it is us. \nWe add lots of costs to gasoline every time we pass an energy bill. \nThis Energy bill is no exception.\n  While my amendment doesn't affect this bill, it does create a point \nof order in the future. You can call this a hurdle, but if 60 people in \nthe Senate cannot decide that it is more important to increase the size \nof our national reserve, even though it might increase the cost of \ngasoline, if 60 of us are not for that, then perhaps we should hesitate \nbefore we increase the cost of gasoline again to the consumers.\n  This is one of the rare simple bills that come to the Senate. It is \njust a couple of pages. All it does is say that when we introduce a \nbill that increases the cost of gasoline for American consumers, we \nhave to get 60 votes instead of 51 to pass it. It is a reasonable \nproposal. If we are willing to come here and talk every day about what \nwe are doing to help the consumer and at the same time we want to hide \nfrom them that the things we are doing are actually increasing the cost \nof gasoline, then shame on us.\n  This amendment is simple. It is about transparency, openness, and \nhonesty to the people. That is exactly what they deserve.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it has been brought to my attention that \nthe majority will seek to defeat my amendment by raising another point \nof order against it. This demonstrates exactly how much the Democrats \ndislike this amendment. It proves that they have additional plans in \nthe works to raise gasoline prices on the American people. Why else \nwould they be fighting it so hard? I also believe this effort to deny \nthe Senate a clean up-or-down vote on this amendment shows that some in \nthis body are more interested in defending the jurisdiction and rights \nof a Senate committee than they are in defending American consumers. If \nthe other side raises a point of order against my amendment, I \nencourage my colleagues to ask themselves which is more important: \nprotecting Americans from high gas prices or protecting the \njurisdiction of the Budget Committee?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to waive the Budget Act. If the other \nside tries to kill my amendment and stick it to the American people at \nthe pump, I encourage Members to vote against such an effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, part of our debate has involved the \nquestion of whether we have too many procedural hurdles already \nimpeding the work of the Senate and keeping us from conducting up-or-\ndown votes on things. I strongly believe we do have too many procedural \nhurdles. Obviously, the purpose of the DeMint amendment would be to put \nmore procedural hurdles in place so that a 60-vote point of order would \nbe required in many circumstances in the future where it is not \nrequired today for the Senate to act.\n  I am informed that one of the procedural hurdles already in law is \nunder the Budget Act and that the pending amendment deals with matter \nwithin the Budget Committee's jurisdiction in that the DeMint amendment \nwould direct CBO to take a variety of actions. That is exclusively \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee.\n  I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I move to waive the budget point of order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act in relation to amendment No. 1546.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

It would be 40 \nminutes prior to any vote in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, for \nclarification, we are going to have 40 minutes of debate and then at \nsome point we will have the vote, right?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We will have 40 minutes of debate and then at some \npoint we will have a vote. We may not have it immediately at the end of \nthat 40 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. But we will have 40 minutes of debate now equally divided \nbetween myself and Senator Grassley, and then when we get to a vote on \nit, we will have 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am suggesting we go ahead and vote at the end of 40 \nminutes. So we will have 40 minutes of debate equally divided and then \nwe will have a vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. If that is agreeable with the managers, that is fine with \nme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to remedy what \nis an unfortunate situation, which is that people who cannot buy \nethanol from the Midwest and have to buy it from other sources, \nespecially outside the United States, end up being taxed at 54 cents a \ngallon.\n  So people from the east coast and, to some degree, from the west \ncoast are paying an excessive amount to use product which significantly \nimproves the environment and which also obviously reduces our \ndependence on oil.\n  The argument at the time this tariff was originally initiated was we \nneeded to protect the ethanol production capability of the Midwest, the \ncorn producers. That may have had some resonance a few years ago, but \nit certainly does not have any resonance any longer. It does not have \nany credibility any longer.\n  Today, there are about 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol produced in \nthis country. Under this bill it is required that go up to 36 billion \ngallons. Most of that will come from the production of corn, most \nlikely in the Midwest. So there is already a huge demand for corn, and \ncorn prices are high. In fact, they are so high as a result of the use \nof corn for ethanol that many people who use corn as feedstock are \ncomplaining vociferously. So there is no need to protect production in \nthe Midwest with a tariff that impacts people on the east coast \ndisproportionately.\n  The second reason there is no need for this tax is that people from \nthe east coast cannot get ethanol from the Midwest because it cannot be \nshipped efficiently. That is because ethanol cannot be shipped through \npipelines because of its volatility. Therefore, our only option on the \neast coast is to buy ethanol that comes from outside the country, the \nCaribbean Basin and Brazil. Therefore, it makes no sense to penalize \nthe east coast to try to encourage production in the center of the \ncountry for corn and ethanol when the corn is already being \nsignificantly subsidized to the tune of $3 billion annually just \nthrough agricultural subsidies. But, in addition, its production is \nbeing encouraged by the requirement that we produce so much ethanol in \nthis country that corn is essentially the feedstock for it, and that we \ntherefore are having a dramatic expansion in the production of corn and \nthe utilization of corn.\n  This is not as if in any way this is going to affect that production \ncapability. What it does do, however, is put us in the right place \nenvironmentally, and in the right place from a standpoint of \nutilization of energy sources because we should be using ethanol, \nobviously, and on the east coast we want to use ethanol. We just want \nto pay a fair price for it.\n  When we have this 54-cent-a-gallon tax on the consumers in the \nNortheast and the East, it is not a fair price. If we take this tax \noff, we will actually expand ethanol consumption in the East, and so, \nhopefully, at some point they will figure out a way to ship ethanol \nthrough pipelines and that will create a greater demand for ethanol \ngenerally in this Nation since so many people live on the east coast. \nAnd that will, again, help the production in the Midwest once we figure \nout how to ship it efficiently to the East because the demand will have \nbeen created.\n  Secondly, we have a choice. We can either heat with oil and we can \nrun our cars on oil and gas or we can run in part on ethanol. The \nsimple fact is, however, I would rather buy ethanol from Brazil than \noil from Venezuela. It makes a lot more sense geopolitically as to how \nwe protect ourselves. It is a cleaner burning energy, it is a better \nform of energy, and it is an energy which should be burned and is an \nenergy that I think is a national policy\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\nwe would rather buy than underwriting the present Venezuelan Government \nby having to buy oil there.\n  So the concept of having this tariff, which is essentially a 54-cent-\na-gallon tax on everybody who lives on the east coast, is no longer \nviable. It is not viable because corn production is up dramatically, \nthe price of corn is up dramatically, and it will continue to go up \nespecially under this bill since we are going to require a dramatic \nincrease in the number of gallons which are ethanol based.\n  So the ethanol industry, to the extent it is corn based, is going to \ncontinue to grow and be viable, and they do not need this tariff \nproduction, which is its only purpose. It is not viable because it is \nnot an efficient way for us to purchase energy, to have us pay this \nmuch extra money in tariffs so we basically undermine the use of \nethanol on the east coast. It is not a good policy because it \nencourages the use of Venezuelan or other types of oil imports over \nethanol because of the pricing situation. And it is not a good idea \nbecause it is simply bad policy to have in place this type of tariff.\n  This is not the mercantile period of the 19th century when we \nbasically arbitrarily threw tariffs on products in order to create an \ninefficient marketplace, which was something we thought was going to \nhelp some producer here or there. It makes much more sense to have a \nsituation where consumers can purchase ethanol-based products at \nreasonable prices so we can get more utilization of ethanol.\n  This amendment would eliminate the 54-cent-a-gallon tax which is \ntargeted on a majority, quite honestly, of the American population and \nwhich the majority of Americans should not have to pay.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope Senator Thune is here. I was \ngoing to yield time to him first.\n  I yield myself a couple minutes while we are waiting for Senator \nThune.\n  Mr. President, first of all, to change direction from where Senator \nGregg was, today corn is $3.50 in central Iowa, and it is down 25 cents \nfrom yesterday because it rained in Illinois in the last 48 hours. So \nweather is affecting the price of grain quite a bit. If city slickers \nare worried about the price of corn flakes going up, just remember that \na farmer only gets a nickel out of every box of corn flakes that is \nhalf filled with air anyway. There are events that are affecting the \nprice of corn a lot different from just ethanol. But the impression one \ngets around here when reading the papers is that there is so much corn \ngoing into ethanol that it is driving up the price of food for city \npeople around this country.\n  The other issue is that the Senator from New Hampshire said corn is \nbeing subsidized $3 billion. When corn is above roughly $2 in the \nMidwest, there is no loan deficiency payment being paid out for that \ncorn. So at the price corn is today, there is no subsidy for corn.\n  Another issue we ought to think about is, whether we are importing \nethanol or importing oil--don't forget, a few years ago, we started a \nprogram of tax incentives for ethanol and other renewables so we would \nbe energy independent. Do we want to be dependent on imported ethanol \nas we are dependent on imported oil?\n  What is involved is an infant industry that is just now being able to \ncome to a peak with great advancement in the future but still infant \nfrom the standpoint that the next step in ethanol production is \ncellulosic ethanol, to get ethanol not from grain corn but from wood \nchips, from switchgrass, or from corn stover. It will be 3 to 5 years \nbefore the scientific process of enzymes is efficient enough for that \nproduction to come about.\n  Even though we are now having a massive production of ethanol from \ngrain corn, we cannot sustain this beyond 15 billion gallons of ethanol \ncoming from grain corn or corn getting above that figure. And the \nunderlying bill from the Senate Energy Committee recognizes that point \nbecause they have a 15-billion-gallon limit of grain corn producing \nethanol. Beyond that, it is going to have to come from wood chips, \nswitchgrass, corn stover--anything that has cellulose in it from which \nthey can make ethanol.\n  Just because all of a sudden we have a burgeoning production of \nethanol from grain corn doesn't mean this industry is mature to a point \nwhere we are going to be as energy efficient as we should be, as energy \nindependent as we should be, and that is why it is still necessary to \nkeep the tax incentives. That is why it is still necessary to have this \nimport duty.\n  I am going to continue to yield time to myself until Senator Thune \narrives. I wish to make a statement in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  With today's gas prices, many in Congress are looking for solutions \nand for someone to blame. Unfortunately, some have chosen to pinpoint \nethanol as the culprit. Because of new demand for ethanol, some of my \ncolleagues have begun to argue that there is a shortage and that it is \nresponsible for the rising cost of gasoline. They look to increased \nimports of ethanol and the lifting of the import tariff as a solution, \nand that is the substance of the amendment that is before us. But \nincreased imports would have little impact on the price of gasoline. \nLet me emphasize because that is the basis of the amendment and I am \nsaying the amendment is not going to accomplish its goal. Increased \nimports will not reduce the price of gasoline. This is the case because \nethanol is such a tiny fraction of the cost of gasoline. In fact, in \nIowa, you can buy a gallon of ethanol gasoline mixture--90 percent \ngasoline, 10 percent ethanol--for 8 to 10 cents under what the price of \n100 percent of ethanol costs.\n  In regard to not changing the price of gasoline, I quote Guy Caruso, \nAdministrator of the Energy Information Administration of the \nDepartment of Energy, last year saying that the 10-percent blend of \nethanol is affecting price by ``just a few pennies.'' Ethanol's role in \ngasoline prices is a tiny fraction of the overall increase.\n  In addition, it is important to point out that the United States \nalready provides significant opportunities for countries to ship \nethanol into our market duty free. Numerous countries do not pay the \nU.S. ethanol tariff at all. Through our free-trade agreements and trade \npreference programs, some 73 countries currently have duty-free access \nto U.S. markets for ethanol fully produced in those countries. For all \nother countries, including Brazil, the world's major exporter of \nethanol, the United States provides duty-free access through a carve-\nout in the Caribbean Basin Initiative.\n  Get it right: Brazilian ethanol exporters don't have to pay the U.S. \ntariff today. Under this CBI, ethanol produced in Brazil and other \ncountries that is merely dehydrated in a Caribbean country can enter \nthe United States duty free up to 7 percent of the U.S. ethanol market, \na very generous access, and it has been on the books for 20 years. Yet \nBrazil and other countries have never come close to hitting this 7-\npercent cap of ethanol that can come into our country duty free \nalready. In fact, we are almost halfway through 2007, and this duty-\nfree cap has been filled only 23 percent for this year.\n  Moreover, this cap grows every year because this 7 percent is 7 \npercent of a higher figure because of higher production of domestic \nethanol every year. And it isn't that the Caribbean countries don't \nhave the capacity to dehydrate more ethanol. They do have that \ncapacity.\n\n  So we are already providing duty-free access for Brazilian ethanol \nthat is shipped through the Caribbean countries. Much of this duty-free \nethanol is being exported to the East Coast, the part of the country \nthat Senator Gregg contends would benefit from the complete lifting of \nthe U.S. tariff on ethanol.\n  The fact of the matter is that Brazil isn't taking full advantage of \nduty-free treatment currently available to them. I don't know why we \nshould bend over backward to provide more duty-free access for Brazil. \nIn fact, I would offer to the authors of this amendment that when this \n7 percent loophole gets filled and that much ethanol has come into the \ncountry, I would be glad to sit down and see if there is a need to lift \nthe cap totally.\n  I especially don't know why we should do this, given Brazil's stance \nin the Doha Round negotiations of the World Trade Organization. Brazil \nis the\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\nleader of the G20 negotiating group in the WTO negotiations, a group \nthat is resisting our efforts to obtain improved market access for U.S. \nproducts, both manufactured and agricultural, throughout the entire \nworld.\n  In addition, the Brazilian Government intervenes extensively in the \nprice and supply of ethanol in that country. But the U.S. tariff on \nethanol operates as an offset to a U.S. excise tax credit that applies \nto both domestically produced as well as imported ethanol. So by \nlifting the tariff, we would, in effect, be giving the benefits of this \ntax credit to subsidize the Brazilian production of ethanol.\n  Providing yet more duty-free treatment for subsidized Brazilian \nethanol would send the wrong signal to those Americans who are devoting \ntheir careers to helping America become more energy independent. The \nU.S. ethanol industry is working every day to lessen our dependence \nupon foreign oil. This is a virtue that President Bush has touted again \nand again. Last year, the President restated his goal to replace oil \naround the world by expanding the production of ethanol.\n  The President stated:\n\n       The Federal Government has got a role to play to encourage \n     new industries that will help this Nation diversify away from \n     oil. And so we are strongly committed to corn-based ethanol \n     produced in America.\n\n  And today the President would add to that we are committed to doing \nmore in cellulosic production of ethanol as well.\n  The President clearly understands the need to assist our infant \ndomestic ethanol industry so we can get a foothold and we can succeed. \nWhy would the United States now want to send a signal that we are \nbacking away from our efforts to seek energy independence? We are \nalready dependent upon foreign oil. Surely we don't want our country to \ngo down the path of eventually becoming dependent upon foreign ethanol \nas well.\n  Providing yet more duty-free treatment would be a step in the wrong \ndirection, discouraging the advancement of investment in biorefineries \nfor ethanol and biodiesel. It would be bad for energy independence and, \nobviously, bad for our national security. So I hope my colleagues will \noppose the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator have a minute left for the Senator \nfrom New Mexico?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nMexico and then 5 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator on \nhis remarks and say I concur with them. I would say this is the wrong \ntime, while we are trying to enhance the investment in cellulosic \nethanol and everything that goes with that, to come along with this \nidea. This would weaken the investment potential and the credibility of \ninvestment right when it is ripening and really generating interest.\n  This requires billions of dollars to be invested in cellulosic \nethanol as we move to the next generation, and to have weakening that \ncomes from this issue as to what is going to happen with this export-\nimport issue is the wrong thing. I encourage colleagues to follow the \nlead of Senator Bingaman and Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Thune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from Iowa in \nopposing this amendment. In 2006, America's ethanol industry \ncontributed over $41 billion to the national economy. Operation and \nconstruction of domestic biorefineries created 163,034 jobs in all \nsectors of the economy last year alone.\n  The bill before the Senate builds upon this success by boosting the \nrenewable fuel standard to 36 billion gallons by the year 2022 and \nestablishing other valuable incentives for renewable energy production. \nThe amendment proposed by Senator Gregg, our colleague from New \nHampshire, would send mixed signals to our ethanol producers, their \ninvestors, and the farmers who sell their products to ethanol plants.\n  In effect, what Congress would be doing is telling the ethanol \nindustry: We are demanding more of your product, but at the same time \nwe are going to open the back door and begin subsidizing foreign \nsources of ethanol. If this amendment is adopted, our marketplace would \nbe flooded with heavily subsidized ethanol from foreign countries.\n  In 2006, Brazil exported 433 million gallons into the United States, \nwhich is an increase of 400 million gallons over the year 2005. That \nsame year, Brazil paid over $220 million in duties to import this \namount of ethanol. They were already importing ethanol into this \ncountry through the Caribbean Basin Initiative. They have not reached \nthat cap, but I think it is fair to expect they are going to continue \nto flood the U.S. market every opportunity they get with ethanol that \nis produced in Brazil.\n\n  The tax credit that currently is in place for domestic ethanol is \ncritical to the success of our industry, and it does not discriminate \nbetween domestic or foreign sources of ethanol. So what happens is, as \nsoon as the Brazilian ethanol is blended with gasoline in the United \nStates, taxpayers begin paying 51 cents for each gallon of foreign \nethanol. If Senator Gregg's amendment is accepted, American taxpayers \nwill immediately begin subsidizing hundreds of millions of gallons of \nforeign-made ethanol each year with no offsetting duty. Simply put, by \neliminating this tariff, we would trade our dependence upon foreign \nsources of oil for a new and growing dependence upon foreign ethanol.\n  I would add the critics of this tariff have argued that it inflates \nthe cost of gasoline in this country. In fact, gasoline prices, as my \ncolleague from Iowa has noted, would not be affected by removing the \ntariff on imported ethanol. Ethanol itself represents less than 5 \npercent of U.S. motor fuel supplies, and imported ethanol represents a \nsmall fraction of that percentage.\n  The factors truly driving the price of gasoline higher have nothing \nto do with ethanol supplies. Record crude oil prices, tight refining \ncapacity, lower gasoline production, and limited expansion of domestic \nrefining expansion all play a much greater role than the supply of \nethanol in today's higher gasoline prices.\n  Critics of the tariff also claim we will need ethanol imports to meet \nthe growing demand for ethanol and to comply with the strengthened \nrenewable fuel standard. Again, the facts tell a very different story. \nOur Nation's current domestic production capacity is 6.2 billion \ngallons of ethanol. According to industry experts, an additional 6.4 \nbillion gallons of capacity are currently under construction and will \nsoon be refining ethanol. That is a total of 12.8 billion gallons in \ncurrent planned production, which is more than enough--more than \nenough--to meet the heightened renewable fuel standards in the near \nterm.\n  Additionally, we have to keep in mind the limitations placed on \nethanol demand due to blend restrictions. Right now, only E10, 10 \npercent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline, is approved for use in \nnonflex-fuel vehicles. There is a point at which we are going to hit \nthe E10 wall. Domestic production, as you can see if you look at this \nchart of ethanol production in this country, is more than adequate to \nmeet the full market potential for E10. Some industry analysts predict \nwe will very soon have excess ethanol production capacity when we hit \nthe E10 wall.\n  That is why it is so important we expand ethanol and allow for higher \nblends--E15, E20--which in my view is something long overdue. The E10 \nwall is the point at which the market for E10 ethanol is saturated if \nethanol production continues to grow at a record pace. While some in \nthe industry disagree on when we will hit the E10 wall, it is clear it \nwould have a harmful effect on the overall ethanol industry if Congress \nfails to act. Lifting the tariff on ethanol imports would only flood \nthe marketplace with foreign ethanol, further magnifying the impact of \nthe E10 wall.\n  Clearly, there are several reasons why my colleagues in the Senate\n\n[[Page S8008]]\n\nshould oppose this amendment, which undermines our national energy \npolicy of greater energy independence. So I ask my colleagues to oppose \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Baucus amendment from the Finance \nCommittee would extend the tariff on imported ethanol for 2 more years. \nThe Gregg amendment properly repeals the tariff.\n  Now, why do I say properly? Because the ethanol tariff acts as a tax \non U.S. consumers at the gasoline pump. It increases the cost of \ngasoline because the cost of ethanol is increased due to the tariff. If \nAmericans want anything out of this Energy bill, it is a reduction in \ngasoline prices.\n  In fact, in a recent Associated Press poll, 60 percent of the \nrespondents said that gas prices--which, by the way, are currently \naround $3 a gallon--are causing them hardships. Now, it is one thing to \nmaybe have to pull back a little on your family vacation this summer, \nbut an awful lot of people have to drive to get to work and have to \ndrive as part of work. Clearly, when over half of Americans are caused \nhardships by the current high level of gasoline prices, Congress has \nthe responsibility to do something about that.\n  We should act. One of the few ways in which we can directly impact \nthe price of gasoline at the pump is to eliminate the tariff of 54 \ncents per gallon on ethanol that is brought into the United States. \nNothing else in this bill will directly bring down gasoline prices. In \nfact, there are several provisions that will actually have the effect \nof increasing gasoline prices. Promoting a competitive market for \nethanol will help bring down gasoline prices because it increases the \nsupply that is available and provides, therefore, access to lower cost \nethanol.\n  The bottom line is this: When there is a supply of potential fuel out \nthere and our companies are trying to find that supply so they can \nbring it into the United States to meet the demand of consumers, but \nthey have to pay 54 cents a gallon on part of that supply, they are \neither going to buy the supply at 54 cents a gallon and pass the cost \non to the consumer or they are not going to be able to do that, thereby \nreducing the supply of gasoline available. What happens when you have \nmore demand and less supply? The cost goes up anyway. Either way, \nhaving this tariff in place causes an escalating cost of the price of \ngasoline because it reduces available supply to the American consumer.\n  We have a mandate now to use ethanol. That is required. That mandate \nmeans the companies that provide the gasoline to consumers have no \nchoice but to acquire ethanol. If much of that ethanol is abroad, and \nwe are charging 54 cents a gallon for it, obviously, you can see it is \ngoing to increase the cost of gasoline for the American consumer. \nAmericans are a competitive people who know how the free market works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 1 more minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I need an additional 30 seconds, Mr. President.\n  One way we know the free market can work better is if we don't have \nartificial prices on a product which the American consumer needs in \norder to work. That means we can reduce the cost of gasoline by \neliminating this costly ethanol tariff.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, could the Chair advise us as to the time \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Senator Grassley has how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors Senators Feinstein, Sununu, Kyl, and Ensign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think there is some inconsistency coming \nfrom the argument of the other side on this issue. There is the \nargument, well, reducing the 54-cent-a-gallon tax would not reduce the \nprice of gasoline. That is very hard to sustain on its face; it is \ncounterintuitive, for obvious reasons. If you cut the cost of gasoline \n54 cents a gallon, or if you cut the cost of ethanol 54 cents a gallon, \nobviously, the price of gasoline is going to go down.\n  It is equally hard to defend that position when, within two sentences \nof that argument, you make the argument that the country is going to be \nflooded with low-cost ethanol.\n  You can't have it both ways. As a practical matter, yes, this will \nreduce the price of gasoline. But that is because the ethanol blend \nwill be more affordable in pricing gasoline, and that should be our \ngoal, obviously, for the American consumer--to produce a more \nenvironmentally positive form of energy at a lower price.\n  The second major argument made here is, we can't do this because it \nwill assist the foreign producers over domestic producers, which is \ntotally inconsistent with the bill itself. The bill requires that 36 \nbillion gallons of ethanol be produced by 2022. There is no way that \ndoes not mean our domestic production is going to expand dramatically \nto meet that obligation, so the bill already has in it the built-in \nobligation and requirements to expand domestic production, coupled with \nthe fact there is a $3 billion subsidy already paid independent of the \nethanol benefit, which is accruing to the corn-producing segment of our \neconomy. A $3 billion subsidy for corn producers is paid directly, \ncoupled with the fact that Midwestern-produced ethanol cannot be \nshipped to the east coast, so it is not a competition. We have to buy \nthe ethanol off-coast because that is the only way we can get the \nethanol efficiently and safely because ethanol cannot be shipped \nthrough pipelines.\n  As a practical matter, this tariff is a holdover from a day when, \nyes, there may have been a fledgling industry in the ethanol community. \nMaybe there was some viability to it 5 years ago. But that is no longer \nthe case. We have seen a significant increase in corn prices as a \nresult of the expansion of ethanol use. We are going to continue to see \na significant increase in corn production, in corn prices, because of \ncontinued ethanol use. The simple fact is, as other types of ethanol \nsources are brought on line, they are going to be brought on line at a \ncompetitive price. In fact, they may even be more competitive than \ncorn. And that competitive price, and hopefully a way to ship it, will \nthen be taken advantage of in the East and obviously be a benefit to \nthe entire community of ethanol producers.\n  The arguments being put forth are classic protectionist arguments, \nbut they have no feet underneath them. They have no basis underneath \nthem. Protectionism, to begin with, is a lousy idea, but it is \nespecially a lousy idea when it is basically not accomplishing its \ngoal.\n  On the face of it, we know it is not accomplishing its goal. Again, \nthe argument of the Senator from Iowa made this point for us when he \nsaid the 7 percent was being allowed in the country, and he had no \nproblem with that. If he has no problem with 7 percent, then why not \nmore, as a practical matter? As a practical matter, we are not \ncompeting with the Midwest, we are just trying to get a reasonable \nprice for ethanol in the East.\n  This tax--and that is what it is--on American consumers, on a product \nthat we should be using, is totally inappropriate and cannot be \njustified on the basis of protecting a domestic industry, specifically \ncorn production, in light of the economics of corn production in \ntoday's market--which is doing extraordinarily well. It is seeing a \nmassive expansion. Its prices are at their highest level in recent \nmemory. They are going to continue to expand because this bill requires \nthat expansion with the requirement that we use 36 billion gallons of \nethanol by 2022, which is almost a quadrupling of the amount of ethanol \nrequired today.\n  I hope Members of the Senate would join me in voting to eliminate \nthis unfair tax, this inappropriate tax. Down the road there is going \nto be an amendment to eliminate the blenders credit which would offset \nany of the revenues this would incur.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself the 1 minute I have left.\n  First of all, there is no $3 billion to corn farmers, when corn is $4 \na bushel or $3.50 a bushel.\n  Second, as to the point made by Senator Kyl, as well as Senator \nGregg, that consumers want lower prices and somehow ethanol is driving \nup that price, let me tell you that ethanol today, this very day, if \nyou check the market, is cheaper in the Northeast and the east coast \nthan gasoline is. The spot market price for ethanol is $2.10 compared \nto the spot price for gasoline at $2.21 at the New York Harbor. There \nis no shortage of ethanol. There are no gasoline marketers unable to \nget ethanol supplies in the Northeast or the east coast. Ethanol is \nblended today in the RFT area, along the east coast, including Boston, \nNew York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington. There is imported \nethanol shipped into New York and Baltimore Harbor today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from seven agricultural groups, including the American Farm \nBureau Federation and the National Farmers Union, in opposition to the \nGregg amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Majority Leader Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Chairman Jeff Bingaman,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate.\n     Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Ranking Member Pete Domenici,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators: Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH) is proposing an \n     amendment to the energy bill that would eliminate the current \n     tariff on imported ethanol. Such a change is not only unfair, \n     but also inconsistent with efforts by the Administration and \n     Congress to promote the growth of domestically produced \n     renewable fuels.\n       Current U.S. policy provides refiners and gasoline \n     marketers a 51 cents per gallon tax credit for every gallon \n     of ethanol blended into gasoline. This tax credit is \n     available to refiners regardless of whether the ethanol \n     blended is imported or domestic. To prevent U.S. taxpayers \n     from subsidizing foreign ethanol companies, Congress passed \n     an offset to the tax credit that foreign companies pay in the \n     form of a tariff.\n       Clearly, companies in countries--like Brazil--that \n     subsidize their own ethanol industry should not have an \n     unfair advantage over U.S. companies. The tax credit offset \n     results in a level playing field and allows a system of fair \n     trade to operate.\n       The tax credit offset on imported ethanol is not a barrier \n     to entry. In 2006, for example, the U.S. imported of 650 \n     million gallons of which more than 430 million gallons came \n     from Brazil. Clearly, Brazilian imports compete quite \n     effectively when needed.\n       Simply put, the credit offset merely asks Brazilian and \n     other foreign ethanol producers to pay back the tax incentive \n     for which their product is eligible. Congress correctly put \n     this offset in place to prevent foreign ethanol industries \n     access to American taxpayer dollars while not preventing \n     access to the U.S. market.\n       At a time when America's domestic ethanol industry is \n     seeking to expand, to invest in new technologies, and to \n     attract investment in cellulosic ethanol production capacity, \n     it makes little sense to undercut those efforts by \n     eliminating the tax credit offset on ethanol. We strongly \n     urge a ``NO'' vote on the Gregg amendment to subsidize \n     foreign produced ethanol.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Coalition for Ethanol.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Sorghum Producers.\n       Renewable Fuels Association.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, before we go to the vote, I want to clarify \ntwo things. First, there was an implication that the administration \nmight not support this amendment. In fact, the administration supports \nthe repeal of this tariff, and they openly supported it. They were on \nrecord as supporting it when they were negotiating with Brazil. They do \nsupport the repeal of this tariff.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Will you yield on this point, please, not to make a \nstatement?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, to ask a question.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I do ask this question: Does the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire know that the President of the United States, when \nhe was in Brazil, was quoted in the paper as telling President Lulu \nthat the ethanol export--the import credit would not be repealed while \nhe is President of the United States?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reclaiming my time----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I asked you a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to say that I did not understand the question. \nIf I did understand the question, I believe it was that the President \nsaid he would not repeal the ethanol credit during his time in office, \nwhich I don't happen to think is the administration's position, which \nwas that they publicly do not support this tariff. They do not support \nthis excessive tariff; they do not support this tax. This \nadministration has a strong record on opposition to taxes and tariffs, \nand they have been publicly in opposition to this for a while.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to add Kay Bailey Hutchison as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to have a statement from the \nTaxpayers for Common Sense in support of the amendment printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Taxpayers for Common Sense Action,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: Taxpayers for Common Sense Action urges you \n     to support Senator Judd Gregg's (R-NH) second degree \n     amendment to the Senate Finance Committee's amendment on H.R. \n     6. This amendment would eliminate the 54 cent per gallon \n     tariff on imported ethanol, and it is an important first step \n     in righting our flawed ethanol policies.\n       The combination of ethanol tariffs and a domestic tax \n     credit for blenders of ethanol wildly distorts the \n     marketplace, artificially propping up a narrow sector of the \n     farm economy and stiffing consumers in the process.\n       The Gregg amendment opens U.S. markets to additional \n     sources of ethanol that would lower domestic prices. Two Iowa \n     State University economists estimate that removing the \n     existing ethanol duties would reduce the domestic price of \n     ethanol by 13.6 percent. Taken one step further, if the \n     blender's tax credit were also repealed, the domestic price \n     of ethanol would drop by a total of 18.4 percent, according \n     to their estimations.\n       Taxpayers for Common Sense Action urges you to vote for \n     Senator Gregg's amendment to the Senate Finance Committee \n     amendment that is expected to be attached to H.R. 6.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ryan Alexander,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the remainder of my time and suggest we go to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent resolution on \nthe budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 201 of S. \nCon. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution, for consideration \nof H.R. 6.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, I rise in support of including Puerto \nRico in the Federal Weatherization Assistance Program. I want to thank \nChairman Jeff Bingaman and Ranking Member Pete Domenici for accepting \nthis amendment as part of the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. This is simply \na matter of fairness and of equity.\n  Puerto Rico is currently ineligible for Weatherization Assistance, \nand only receives a small set aside from the LIHEAP program. To include \nPuerto Rico in the weatherization program would cost less than 1 \npercent of the program's funds but would make a huge impact.\n  Though Puerto Rico is blessed with warm weather, the Weatherization \nAssistance Program is desperately needed there. Because it is an island \nthat must import the fuels it needs, energy costs are extraordinarily \nhigh. The average cost of electricity in the U.S. is under 10 cents a \nkilowatt-hour, but in Puerto Rico, electricity costs almost twice that \nat 18 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\n  And these high energy costs have a devastating impact on the \nCommonwealth's low-income population. Approximately 45 percent of the \npopulation is under the U.S. poverty line.\n  Many homes rely on old, inefficient air conditioners to cool their \nhomes and much of the low-income housing has not been built or \nmaintained with energy efficiency in mind.\n  Puerto Rico already has an active program to educate people about the \nimportance of energy efficiency and to increase the energy efficiency \nof government buildings. But the weatherization program would help \nPuerto Rico offer weatherization assistance to low-income households \nand incentives for energy efficient appliance purchases, solar water \nheaters, lighting replacement, and other energy-saving measures.\n  The CLEAN Energy Act of 2007 expands authorization for the \nWeatherization Program from $700 million per year to $750 million per \nyear. This vital program helps thousands of low-income families keep \ntheir energy costs down and also helps the environment by making energy \nconsumption more efficient. It is time we help the low-income families \nof Puerto Rico gain access to this vital program.\n  I again thank Chairman Jeff Bingaman and Ranking Member Pete Domenici \nfor their leadership in accepting this critical amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe the order now is for the \nSenator from New York who wishes to offer an amendment. I yield to my \ncolleague to see if he is in agreement with that course of action.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am. I say to Senator Schumer, we had no objection to \nyour amendment. It took an extra amount of time because of matching up \none versus one side and the other. It was nothing fundamental. It was \njust that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I thank him \nfor that. If we can accept the amendment, I don't have to debate it. \nAre we able to do that or are we still able to match up?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I think the better course is for the \nSenator from New York to go ahead and explain the amendment, offer the \namendment. Then during the course of his debate, we will see how \npersuaded we are and whether a voice vote is adequate or whether a \nrollcall vote is required.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank both my colleagues from New Mexico. They put a \nbig burden on me to make a good explanation. I will do my best.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so I \nmay call up my amendment which would then be set aside when I am \nthrough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have to object to your bringing up the amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Then I withdraw the request, and I will speak about the \namendment without bringing it up.\n  The amendment we are speaking about here would raise the level of \nbuilding standards so that our buildings across America would be more \ngreen. There has been tremendous focus on automobiles--of course, there \nshould be--in raising their mileage standards. But what is forgotten is \nthat a huge percentage of energy consumption and greenhouse gases come \nfrom buildings and, more importantly, the heating and cooling of our \nstructures, both residential and commercial. The bottom line is, if \neverybody in America were to adopt green building standards, we could \ngreatly reduce--and these are prospective, not retrospective--the \namount of greenhouse gases and energy consumption.\n  For instance, according to the Alliance to Save Energy, the amendment \nI wish to offer could save our country 5 percent of its total energy \nuse, save consumers $50 billion a year, and--listen to this, this is an \namazing statistic--reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an amount \nequivalent to taking 70 million cars off the road.\n  You say: Can this work? Yes, because a good number of States have \nstarted doing this already. California has taken the lead. California \nincreased its energy efficiency in buildings in the late 1970s, and now \nthey, in terms of greenhouse gases, are at the level of some European \ncountries, even though California is a car culture. There are lists of \nStates that have already moved forward in this regard. They are \nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, \nPennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, and other \nStates are on the road to doing so. The bottom line is, by making our \nbuildings more efficient, we can reduce gases.\n  Let me tell you what the amendment does. The organizations that draft \ncommercial and residential building codes will be required to meet \nspecific energy use targets. We don't tell them how. Obviously, it is \ndifferent in Minnesota than it would be in Florida or Arizona. They \nwill be required to meet specific energy use targets. They must be more \nefficient by 30 percent than the 2006 codes by 2015 and 50 percent more \nefficient by 2022. Because this affects new buildings, obviously people \nare given a timeline. You can't start this next year. But, again, \nCalifornia did this in the 1970s, and they are reaping the benefits \nnow.\n  Since energy independence and since global warming are long-term \nissues--we all know we are not going to solve them in a year--acting \nnow is important. We give the States time to change their building \ncodes in the way they wish, and we would greatly reduce the amount of \ngreenhouse gases.\n  My mayor is in the news today but for other matters. The mayor of New \nYork City, for instance, has proposed that the city do this on its own. \nWe give credit to specific cities that would do this as well. They \nwould have the same benefits and responsibilities under the bill as \nStates would, when States did it. If your State didn't but your city \ndid, you would still be able to get the benefits and meet the \nrequirements of the legislation. But it is estimated that it will \nreduce the amount of energy consumption in New York City by 40 percent. \nIs that incredible?\n  We have a lot of debate, as we should, on automobiles, on renewables, \non coal to gas, but there is a quiet little secret out there that this \namendment sort of makes public. That is that conservation--conservation \nof things that are much easier and much less controversial than, say, \nautomobiles--is where the real bang for the buck is in terms of energy \nindependence, reducing greenhouse gases, and in terms of lowering the \ncost to the average consumer of electricity and gasoline, because when \nwe are more efficient in terms of our buildings, petroleum is used for \nother purposes, and supply and demand would even reduce the price for \ngasoline.\n  One of the environmentalists I know put it well. He said: Alternative \nfuels are the sizzle and conservation is the steak. They are both \nimportant. When you barbecue, you like to have the sizzle. It is fun. \nBut you also like to eat the steak.\n  I have two other amendments, one that does the same on appliances. \nThe bill has good provisions on appliances, but we move them further in \nterms of California, although I am not talking about that one here \nright now.\n  If we were to do it for utilities, where we would require them to be \nmore efficient--and they could choose the way--we could do dramatic \nthings in this bill just on its own. The cost for most energy \nconservation, the cost for reducing the consumption of petroleum, for \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, is about one-quarter what it is for \nproducing new alternative fuels.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It is not \ncontroversial, I do not think. It does not have universal support, but \nit has great support. The Department of Energy has looked favorably \nupon it. I do not know if they are officially in favor of it, but we \ntalked to them, and they know we have to move in this direction.\n  I hope the amendment can be adopted. I hope I have convinced my \ncolleague from New Mexico, if not with eloquence--which I am sure I do \nnot have--at least with the facts and the structure of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield back the floor, unless my \ncolleague wishes me to go on further about this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. He \nhas persuaded me of the merit of his\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\namendment, but I am not in a position to procedurally move to actual \ndisposition of the amendment at this time.\n  So if the Senator has completed his statement, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1704\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since we seem to be unable to move ahead \nand actually dispose of amendments for a few minutes, while we get the \nprocedural circumstance untangled, let me speak briefly about the tax \npackage that has been reported from the Finance Committee.\n  The energy tax package that is now a pending amendment to this bill \nrepresents a dramatic shift in the direction of our national energy \npolicy from fossil fuel dependence to one that promotes diversified \ndomestic sources of clean energy.\n  The package the Senate will consider as part of this tax package \ncontains three times the incentives for energy efficiency and \nrenewables and other clean energy than we were able to enact in the \n2005 Energy bill--three times more clean energy.\n  The energy tax provisions are intended to complement and augment the \nauthorizing legislation. These vitally important energy measures \ninclude:\n  First, a 5-year extension of the section 45 tax credit for producing \nelectricity from wind, geothermal, biomass, and other green resources; \nan extension of the section 48 investment tax credit for business \ninvestments in solar, fuel cells, and microturbines for a total of 8 \nyears in the package that has now been reported to the Senate; \nextending the newly proposed residential wind credit; extending several \nresidential and commercial energy efficiency tax incentives; expanding \nthe section 48 A and B investment tax credits to fund the development \nof clean coal facilities, with a particular requirement that \nCO2 be captured and sequestered; expanding the program for \nclean renewable energy bonds by up to $3.6 billion; adding $3 billion \nto a newly established program for clean coal bonds; extending the \nadvanced vehicle consumer credits and adding a category for plug-in \nhybrids and electric vehicles; and an important new incentive to \nencourage the production of cellulosic ethanol.\n  These are important provisions individually, but combined I think \nthey will play a major role in moving our country along toward a path \nof forward-looking energy policy.\n  The Finance Committee amendment also contains a severance tax on all \noil and gas production from the Federal Outer Continental Shelf in the \nGulf of Mexico. This severance tax proposal needs to be viewed in the \ncontext of the larger energy tax title in the Energy bill that is \nbefore the Senate. By including this OCS severance tax in the Energy \ntax bill, we are able to secure the revenue that is vitally needed for \nthese energy measures I have detailed.\n  This OCS severance tax has been carefully crafted to raise revenues \nwhile doing the least possible to discourage production. First of all, \nit applies to oil and gas production on the OCS in the Gulf of Mexico \nonly. We carefully considered where the tax should apply. The Alaska \nOCS is an important frontier area, and additional costs on those \noperations could truly impact leasing and development activity. The \nonly other area with production in the OCS is California, where \nproduction is minimal and no new leasing is occurring.\n  However, the industry in the Gulf of Mexico is robust--particularly \nwith the price of oil where it is today--and the lessees and operators \nthere tend to be large: either the major oil companies or large \nindependent producers. This is in contrast to the Rocky Mountain \nregion, where many small independents operate. Additional taxes or fees \nin that region could make the difference between production occurring \nor not occurring. Thus, this tax would only apply to oil and gas from \nthe Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf.\n  In addition, the tax is designed to ensure that it is not overly \nburdensome. The tax would be levied at a rate of 13 percent of the \nvalue of production with a credit against the tax for royalties paid on \neach lease. The Government Accountability Office recently completed a \nstudy comparing the combined tax and royalty costs imposed on the oil \nand gas industry in the United States versus elsewhere in the world.\n\n  I note the GAO found the climate for doing business in the U.S. is \nvery favorable, with the U.S. having one of the lowest combined \n``government takes'' in the world. Using this construct of considering \nthe combined tax and royalty costs, we designed the severance tax with \na credit for royalties paid to ensure no lessee would be required to \npay more than 13 percent of the value of their production in combined \nseverance taxes and royalties.\n  Of course, any lessee who is paying a 16\\2/3\\-percent royalty--that \nthe President has now established as the appropriate royalty on Federal \nleases going forward--any lessee that is subject to that royalty will \npay no tax. Any lessee paying a 12.5-percent royalty will pay an \neffective rate of 0.5 percent for the severance tax, and lessees paying \nless than a 12.5-percent royalty rate will pay the tax at an effective \nrate of the difference between the 13 percent and the royalty rate \nbeing paid.\n  Furthermore, I believe the 13-percent tax rate is extremely \nreasonable. Earlier this year, the White House did announce the royalty \nrate for all new leases in the Gulf of Mexico would contain terms \nrequiring that royalties be paid at a rate of 16\\2/3\\ percent. This was \nmet with little, if any, opposition from the industry.\n  Again, I commend Senators Grassley and Baucus. Senator Baucus has \nbeen our leader on this issue from the beginning of putting this entire \npackage together. He and his staff have done yeoman's work. I also have \nbeen proud of the work my staff has done on this important issue as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Employee Free Choice Act\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a matter that is \nbefore the Senate, the Employee Free Choice Act. In summary, what this \nact will do is--and I have three brief points about the act itself--it \nwill enable workers to form unions when a majority sign union \nauthorization cards. Second, it will establish mediation and binding \narbitration when the employer and workers cannot agree on a first \ncontract. Third, it will strengthen penalties for companies that coerce \nor intimidate workers.\n  We know today what we are facing in our economy. We have rising \nlevels of productivity, thank goodness, but at the same time \nproductivity has been up and our workers have been more productive than \never, our wages have not kept pace. Salaries and wages have not grown \nthe way productivity has.\n  We know that so many more of our working families have had to suffer \nthat disparity, that gap between productivity and wages and benefits.\n  I think a lot of Americans believe the freedom to choose a union is \nvital to restoring the American dream, especially for the most \nvulnerable Americans. Unfortunately, vulnerable Americans now include \nworking families.\n  Unions help American workers get their fair share, as you well know, \nMr. President, in your State, as well as in my State of Pennsylvania. \nUnion wages are almost 30 percent higher than wages in nonunion fields. \nUnions are also a cure for rising inequality because they raise wages \nfor more low- and middle-income wage earners, more so than for higher \nwage workers.\n  For example, if we talk about some lower wage occupations, cashiers, \nfor example, earn 46 percent more than nonunion cashiers and those \ncovered by unions, 46 percent more.\n\n[[Page S8013]]\n\n  Union food preparation workers earn nearly 50 percent more than \nnonunion food preparation workers.\n  I will share a couple of demographic categories. Women, for example, \nwho are represented by a union earn 31 percent more than women workers \nwho do not have the benefit of a union. African-American union workers \nearn 36 percent more than their nonunion counterparts. Latino workers \nearn 46 percent more than those Latinos who are not represented by a \nunion. Finally, union workers are almost twice as likely to have \nemployer-sponsored health benefits and pensions at work--twice as \nlikely--than their counterparts who do not have union protection. They \nare more than four times likely to have a secure and defined pension \nbenefit plan than nonunion workers.\n  Protecting the freedom to choose a union benefits all Americans, and \nI believe this in my bones, as we all do who support this act. Whether \nsomeone has a union I think raises and lifts all boats. In industries \nand occupations where many workplaces are unionized, nonunion employers \nwill frequently meet union standards, lift their sights, so to speak, \nand otherwise improve compensation. A high school graduate in a \nnonunion workplace whose industry is 25 percent unionized gets paid 5 \npercent more than similar workers in less unionized industries.\n  We know what this act can mean for workers and their families to \nraise their standard of living, in wages and benefits and other parts \nof their compensation, but also I believe this act is about America. We \nknow the unions, the right to organize and selectively bargain, helped \nbuild the American middle class over decades, when those who said at \nthe beginning of those fights this is not a good idea.\n  What we will do by passing this legislation that is before the Senate \nis to move to a new chapter where more and more of our families can \nhave the benefit of union protection so they can live in a country \nwhere their work, their labor, and the fruits of their labor is \nrecognized.\n  I ask all of my colleagues respectfully, as they consider this \nlegislation, to think not only of what this will do for our unions and \nfamilies who are covered by those unions but what it does for all \nAmerica, for all our collective interests in a stronger economy. I ask \ntheir consideration of this bill.\n  I know, Mr. President, you and so many others have been leading the \nfight on this effort, and we are grateful for that leadership, for our \nfamilies, and for our country.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill, and think that it \nis a vital part of an agenda aimed at restoring a balance to our \nNation's labor policies and alleviating the insecurity felt by so many \nAmerican families.\n  The bill, if passed, would enable workers to form unions when a \nmajority sign union authorization cards, establish mediation and \nbinding arbitration when the employer and workers cannot agree on a \nfirst contract, and strengthen penalties for companies that coerce or \nintimidate workers.\n  These changes to our labor laws are quite frankly vital to the \npreservation of the American middle class, because unions, which were a \ndriving force in the creation of that middle class, are also one of the \nbest tools we have to protect it.\n  We live in a remarkable time, when corporate profits are rising, \nlargely because of the rising productivity of the American worker. At \nthe same time, corporations in America are receiving unprecedented \naccess to foreign markets because of our nation's trade policies. But \nwhile we are working to give corporations that access, we must work to \nensure that workers have rights and protections, and opportunities in \nthe new global economy that is emerging. After all, families are made \nup of workers, not corporations.\n  Unfortunately, workers are being left behind in large part because we \nhave stripped them of rights and protections and made it ever harder \nfor them to organize in a union if they wish to do so. The effects of \nthis are dramatic, and are changing the economic landscape of America. \nAt a time when productivity has been rising and companies are making \nhuge profits on the backs of their workers, workers' salaries are not \nincreasing.\n  Corporate profits are up by more than 83 percent since 2001. Yet the \nshare of national income going to wages and salaries in 2006 was at its \nlowest level on record. The share of national income captured by \ncorporate profits, in contrast, was at its highest level on record. \nSome 51.6 percent of total national income went to wages and salaries \nin 2006.\n  Today, more than 40 percent of total income is going to the \nwealthiest 10 percent of Americans--the biggest gap in more than 65 \nyears. The share of pretax income in the Nation that goes to the top 1 \npercent of households increased from 17.8 percent in 2004 to 19.3 \npercent in 2005.\n  Between 2004 and 2005, the average income of the top 1 percent of \nhouseholds increased by $102,000, after adjusting for inflation. The \naverage income of the bottom 90 percent of households increased by \n$250.\n  It is bad enough that wages aren't rising for the vast majority of \nAmericans, but to make matters worse, the costs they face in their \ndaily lives are rising, sometimes with life and death consequences. Six \nmillion Americans have lost their health insurance, and their \nretirement security is fading as well. It doesn't make sense that at a \ntime when corporate balance sheets are so healthy, Americans are being \nforced to go without basic health care. In fact, we all know that that \nwill have the effect of reducing our productivity, and profits, if we \ndon't address it.\n  That is why I support the Employee Free Choice Act. The freedom to \nchoose a union is vital to restoring the American Dream, especially for \nthe most vulnerable Americans. Union workers are far more likely to \nhave health care benefits, and pensions that will actually provide for \nthem in retirement.\n  Unions help American workers get their fair share--union wages are \nalmost 30 percent higher than nonunion wages. Unions are also a cure \nfor rising inequality because they raise wages more for low- and \nmiddle-wage workers than for higher wage workers. Unions can also help \nthe American worker weather the storm of globalization, and the \ndisplacement and insecurity that it has brought to some many families.\n  Just this week, the OECD, which is known for its unapologetic \npromotion of free trade, released a report that highlighted the fact \nthat countries should focus on improving labor regulations, for \nworkers, not just companies, and social protection systems to help \npeople adapt to changing job markets.\n  The report also found that offshoring may have reduced the bargaining \npower of workers, especially low-skilled ones and that the prospect of \noffshoring may be increasing the vulnerability of jobs and wages in \ndeveloped countries. That is an amazing finding from an organization \ndevoted to promoting free trade.\n  The OECD also found that in 18 of the 20 OECD countries where data \nexist, the gap between top earners and those at the bottom has risen \nsince the early 1990s. The inequality in the United States was higher \nthan all of those countries by a large margin, save one, Hungary.\n  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which I represent here, was built \non stable union jobs, and the industries that employed those union \nworkers helped to build America as we know it today. Pennsylvania steel \ncan be found in every corner of the country, but unfortunately most of \nthe plants that made that steel are now closed, and most of the union \njobs that were the engine of those plants are gone.\n  But that is what makes this legislation so important here and now. We \nneed to act quickly to give American workers a leg up in this global \neconomy, and create jobs that add value to workers' lives, to their \ncommunities, and to the American economy. We can't do that if we only \nreward capital. Capital can now flow over borders and across the world \nlike never before. But our workers and families remain, and so we must \nstand with them and give them the tools they need to continue to be \nproductive and competitive in this global economy. Workers from \nPennsylvania can compete, but only if we give them a level playing \nfield and the proper tools. This legislation takes one step to do just \nthat, and that is why I support it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe tax part of this energy bill. I think it is common sense that if \nyou tax something, the price will probably go up because the higher \nbusiness costs are passed on to the consumer at some point.\n  This is a tax bill that is $29 billion of new taxes. How could \nanything make less sense when we are trying to pass an energy bill that \nwill do two things: make America less dependent on foreign oil for our \nenergy needs, and bring the price of gasoline down at the pump. This \nbill, with the tax part, is not going to do either of those things.\n  In the past 2\\1/2\\ years, the average price of a gallon of gas has \nrisen about 68 percent due to increased demand in America and around \nthe world. The price increase has harmed American families, and \nbusinesses, especially small businesses, and higher taxes are going to \nmean a higher price at the pump.\n  Mr. President, I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum for just \none moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we must address the tax issue. There \nare some good parts in this energy package. This energy package could \nincrease conservation. It could increase the supply of renewable energy \nsources. I have an amendment that I think is very positive which would \nprovide for more research into new sources of energy, and there are all \nkinds of renewable, environmentally safe energy possibilities. Yet we \nhave now put a tax bill in this bill which has just gone through \ncommittee. It came out yesterday, and we are going to, I am afraid, \nmake the mistake that Congress has made before.\n  In 1980, Congress passed a windfall profits tax. The consequences to \nthe domestic oil industry, to consumers, and to our national security \nwere devastating. In the 6 years that followed that action, domestic \noil production dropped by 1.26 billion barrels, and imports of foreign \noil rose 13 percent. Today, 60 percent of our oil comes from foreign \ncountries. The collapse of the domestic oil and gas industry had a \nripple effect on other sectors of the economy, especially banking and \nreal estate.\n  The windfall profits tax was terrible for this country, and it was \nrepealed. Now we have a tax bill that will have the same effect, with \n$29 billion in taxes on energy production.\n  Let's go through those. A repeal of the manufacturer's deduction for \nrefineries: everyone who has looked at the energy crisis knows it is \nthe lack of refinery capacity that has driven up the demand while we \nhave not driven up the supply. We are making it harder to invest in \nrefineries. No one is doing it, and we need more refineries. So taking \naway any deductions for refineries is counterintuitive.\n  We would establish an excise tax of 13 percent on crude oil and \nnatural gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico. That is the biggest source \nof oil and natural gas production in our country that we are able to \nproduce and explore. ANWR would be larger, but we have not been able to \ntap into ANWR. So the Gulf of Mexico is our best source.\n  Other States are now looking at exploring and then possibly drilling \noff their shores because there is now an opportunity for States to get \nrevenue, and it can be done environmentally safely. So now we are \ntalking about increasing the tax, which is going to have the effect of \nlessening the exploration and drilling and will also go back on a \ncontract that was made earlier to induce people to drill in the Gulf of \nMexico because it is more expensive--the deep drilling is much more \nexpensive.\n  The bill would also impose a tax on finished gasoline--$824 million \nover 10 years. It would seem that is going to increase the price of \ngasoline at the pump. It would eliminate tax credits for foreign oil \nproduction, exposing them to double taxation.\n  So what do you think that is going to do? We are in a situation \nalready where we are seeing more and more new formations of public \ncompanies going overseas because of Sarbanes-Oxley, with CEOs saying it \nis the instability of our regulatory process and the taxes and the \nlitigation in our country that has caused more and more companies to \ndecide to move their corporate headquarters to London or other \nexchanges. Furthermore, the jobs are going with them. So here we are \ntrying to address this issue in a responsible way, and what are we \ndoing to our oil companies? Why wouldn't they just go and register on \nthe London stock exchange and make that their headquarters? That is \nwhat many American companies are doing now.\n  If we decide we are going to double-tax this segment of industry in \nour country, we are just saying we don't want American oil companies. I \ncan see why they would not only incorporate overseas but move more and \nmore of their production overseas as well.\n  I hope we will not pass this tax bill. A recent review by the \nHeritage Foundation estimated this tax package, combined with other \npolicies in this bill, could increase the price of regular unleaded gas \nto $6.40 by the year 2016. That is ridiculous. Why would we pass an \nenergy plan that would have the potential effect of doing that?\n  No, what we should be doing is encouraging more refineries, \nencouraging nuclear power plants that are environmentally safe, \nencouraging drilling and exploration of our own natural resources, and \nwe should be looking for renewable sources of energy--cellulosic \nethanol, corn-based ethanol biodiesel, wind, solar. We have so many \nsources. My amendment would also create the ability to start research \non wave and current energy resources, which they are doing in a limited \nway in Europe right now, using the Gulf of Mexico and our oceans for \ntheir energy potential.\n  There is so much we can do that would be positive that we could agree \non in a bipartisan way. This tax bill is a poison pill. The tax portion \nis unnecessary, it is counterintuitive, it will have the effect of \nincreasing gasoline prices at the pump, it will ship jobs that are in \nAmerica overseas, and I think we are going to lose major corporate \nbusiness.\n  That is unnecessary and I hope my colleagues will not pass this tax \npackage, and I certainly hope we can take this part out of the \nequation, work on the bill that is before us--which has some very good \npoints--and then we will be doing something to try to help with the \nrising cost of gasoline at the pump in our country.\n  I hope we can help relieve the high price of corn which has resulted \nfrom our emphasis on ethanol. That is causing a rise in livestock \nprices, because the feedstock for livestock that is being raised has \nincreased the cost. So all the meat we eat in this country is going to \nbe at a higher price because ethanol is taking from the corn market and \nthe feedstock market is suffering.\n  We need to address these things. I certainly hope we will, in a \nresponsible way, bring the costs of energy down and not have side \neffects such as the increased costs to livestock producers.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this tax portion so we can get down to the \nbusiness of doing what the purpose of this energy bill was, and that is \nto increase supply so we can be less dependent on foreign sources and \nlower the price of energy in our country.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the bill on the floor of the Senate deals \nwith energy. While there are many important things we discuss in \nCongress these days, energy ranks right near the top, in my judgment. I \nhave indicated previously that most of us take energy for granted. We \nget up in the morning and turn on the hot water, and that\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\ncomes from energy. We flick a light switch, and that comes from energy. \nWe get in the car and turn the ignition key, and that comes from \nenergy.\n  I told a story a while back about John Glenn and energy. I was on a \ntrip with John Glenn, the former astronaut and former Senator. I was a \nyoung boy when John Glenn orbited the Earth in Friendship 7.\n  Late one evening on what was the old Air Force One, a group of us \nwere flying to Asia, and John Glenn was with the group. We were meeting \nwith heads of state in several governments, Vietnam and China and so \non. We were flying over the Pacific late at night in this little cabin \nin this Air Force 707. I leaned forward and began to ask John Glenn \nabout his first space flight. I pumped him with a lot of questions. One \nof the questions I asked him about was whether he actually saw Perth, \nAustralia. The history that has been written about this, and I recalled \nas a kid, was when John Glenn, up there alone in this tiny little \ncapsule orbiting the Earth in Friendship 7, was orbiting the Earth and \nwent to the dark side of the Earth, the town of Perth, Australia, \ndecided they would all turn on their lights. All the lights in Perth, \nAustralia were to be turned on to greet this astronaut flying alone, \norbiting the Earth. I asked him if he saw the lights of Perth, \nAustralia, and he said he did. On the dark side of the Earth in this \nlittle capsule orbiting the Earth all alone, John Glenn looked down and \nthe sign of human existence on Earth was the product of energy, the \nproduct of lights, radiating that beam to that astronaut, saying a \nhello--greetings.\n  It comes from energy. It is what we do to produce energy and use \nenergy to make our lives better. They are better in many ways.\n  One part of this energy issue we are debating in the Energy bill \ndeals with oil. Oil is an interesting debate because on this little \nplanet of ours that circles the Sun, there are about 6.4 billion of us. \nWe have a lot of neighbors who are in tougher shape. About half of this \nplanet's population lives on less than $2 a day. Half of them have \nnever made a telephone call. On this planet there is a little spot \ncalled the United States of America and we are blessed through divine \nprovidence to be here, to live here. But it is interesting that while \nwe have created a standard of living that expands the middle class and \ncreates an increased standard of living, we do not have the quantity of \noil that exists elsewhere on Earth. We use 25 percent of the oil that \nis needed every single day; 25 percent of all the oil used on this \nEarth is used in this country. Yet most of the oil is produced \nelsewhere--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Venezuela, and other countries. \nOver 60 percent of the oil we use comes from outside of our country. \nGod forbid something should happen that would interrupt that, because \nif it did, this country would be flat on its back with respect to its \neconomy. It would dramatically impact the way we live.\n  Over 60 percent of our oil comes from other countries, much of it \nfrom troubled parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East. Many \nof us believe we need to be less dependent on foreign sources of oil. \nWe are dangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil and we need to \nbecome less dependent. How do we do that?\n  One point is this. Seventy percent of all the oil we use in America \nis used in vehicles, where we run it through the carburetors and fuel \ninjectors in the form of gasoline. Seventy percent of the oil is used \nthrough vehicles.\n  So we have to find a way to make vehicles more efficient. That brings \nme to the debate about what are called the CAFE standards or the \nstandards that require greater efficiency for automobiles.\n  Now I serve on the Commerce Committee. I and Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Inouye and others included from the Commerce Committee a \nprovision that requires vehicles to be more efficient.\n  I know the auto industry is very aggressive in trying to see if they \ncan jettison that provision in the underlying Energy bill that comes \nfrom the Commerce Committee. They do not want these increased \nefficiency standards. They believe they are pernicious, they will \ninjure the auto industry. I think that is untrue.\n  Now, they make the point, and in my judgment they deliberately \nmisrepresent the point, in full page advertisements in my State and \nothers and direct mail pieces to constituents, they make the point that \nwhat we are trying to do is to say: You must make automobiles or \nvehicles more efficient, and you do it on a fleet average, as CAFE has \nalways been done.\n  If you are making too many pickup trucks and not enough small cars, \nyou have to make more small cars and fewer pickup trucks, so, \ntherefore, you have an increase in fuel efficiency and, therefore, this \napproach threatens to take your pickup truck away.\n  Well, that is not true. It is not accurate. But that is what is being \nalleged. This is a different approach. This standard says that for each \nclass of vehicle, the class itself must be made more efficient. I come \nfrom North Dakota. We in North Dakota have, on rare occasions, I \nemphasize only rare occasions, some harsh weather. When it is 30 below \nzero and a 40-mile-an-hour wind, you do not want to drive in a Chevette \nout to check the calves during calving season in March, you want a \nvehicle, a four-wheel drive vehicle that has some weight, that has some \npower. That is what we use. I am not interested in full efficiency \nstandards that discriminate against larger vehicles, but I also believe \nthis: All of the vehicles, including pickup trucks, including larger \nvehicles, should be made more efficient.\n  For 25 years, there has not been one change in the standard. For 25 \nyears in this Congress, we said: No, no. The auto industry doesn't want \nan increase in the efficiency requirement, therefore, we will not do \nit.\n  I say ``we.'' I was part of that. But at some point, you have got to \nsay to the industry: Look, they are making more efficient vehicles \nelsewhere. They ought to make them here. I mean, I have described the \nposition of the industry in opposition to this as ``yesterday \nforever.'' I guess it is wonderful if you have romantic feelings about \nyesterday and you want it to continue forever with respect to your \nvehicles and the lack of a requirement to make them more efficient.\n  But it does not help this country, it retards this country's ability \nto become less dependent on foreign sources of oil. That is what this \nvote is about: Do you believe we ought to become less dependent on \nforeign sources of oil? If so, then you better belly up and you better \nbegin to support this kind of thing, or do you believe that we are not \ndangerously dependent? If it is fine for us to have 60 percent, heading \ntoward 65 and 69 percent, we are told of our oil coming from off our \nshores, if you think that is fine, if you are perfectly content going \nto sleep at night saying it doesn't matter how much we get from \noverseas, it doesn't matter how troubled those areas are, let's hang \nour future, our economic future, on our ability to keep getting oil \nfrom troubled parts of the world, if that is how you feel, then, in my \njudgment, it ignores the reality.\n  If you are one of those, as I am, who believes that we are too \ndangerously dependent on foreign sources of energy, then it seems to me \nyou have to come to the floor and be supportive of CAFE standards, or \nat least greater efficiency standards for vehicles\n  We have established a system in the underlying bill that establishes \neight classes of vehicles. And you have to make them more efficient by \nclass. Should not those who drive pickup trucks expect to have a more \nefficient pickup truck as well; better mileage on those vehicles as \nwell? The answer is, yes, in my judgment.\n  Now, my hope would be that someday, in some way, we will be able to \nfind a way not to be dependent on oil itself. But I cannot see that in \nthe near term. We are going to continue to use fossil fuels. I have \ndescribed too many times for my colleagues that my first vehicle I \nbought for $25 as a young kid, it was a 1924 Model T Ford that had been \nin a grainery for some decades. I bought it for $25 and restored it \nlovingly as a young boy when I was in high school.\n  So I ended up with a Model T that was decades and decades old. But I \nsold it later because you cannot, as a young boy, you cannot \neffectively date in a Model T; nobody wants to ride with you. But the \npoint of the Model T is that in 1924 they made a car, and it is \ninteresting. You put gasoline in that car exactly the same way you put \ngasoline in a 2007 or 2008 vehicle. Exactly\n\n[[Page S8016]]\n\nthe same way. You go to the gas pump, stick a nozzle in the tank, and \nstart pumping gas. Nothing has changed. Everything else about the car \nhas changed. Computer technologies. More computer technology in a new \ncar than existed on the lunar lander that put Neil Armstrong on the \nMoon.\n\n  Better cup holders, keyless entry, iPod holders, heated seats, you \nname it. But let me ask you, do you think there has been an increase in \nthe efficiency standards for those vehicles? The answer is no. The \nanswer is no.\n  I ask you to take this test. Go back and look 10 years ago at any \nmodel of car and then look at today's identical model and see how much \nhas changed with respect to miles per gallon that are estimated for \nthat vehicle. What you will discover is almost no change.\n  Those of us who support the standards in the Commerce Committee have \nbrought a bill to the floor that is a good bill. Now there are some in \nthis Chamber who do not support it, and the auto industry itself is \nfuriously working to get the votes to defeat our increased efficiency \nstandard.\n  The problem is, there is no amendment coming to the floor of the \nSenate that I can see. I mean, it seems to me, we have an underlying \nprovision that I support, it is in the bill. Having had the bill now on \nthe floor for some while, it is time to say: If you want to try to \namend it, let's have an amendment on the floor, let's vote, let's have \na thorough discussion and debate and let's have a vote.\n  I am not someone who suggests the underlying amendment is the only \namendment that has merit or has worth; there are, perhaps, other ideas. \nBut I was in a meeting last evening and have been at some meetings \ntoday. It appears to me that the effort is simply, by the industry, to \nsay: Let's not do this. Well, you know, we have been through that time \nand time and time again. When they say to the Congress: Let's not do \nthis, the Congress salutes and says: Let's not do this.\n  But we have come to a different intersection, it seems to me, with \nrespect to the future of this country and the energy security of this \ncountry. That intersection requires us now to do what we must do to \nmake us less dependent on foreign sources of oil. If we do not find a \nway to be independent, or at least less dependent on foreign sources of \noil that come from troubled parts of the world, we are in deep trouble.\n  Someday, I would hope, perhaps we can develop hydrogen fuel cars that \nare commercially available. I hope that our children and their \ngrandchildren will be able to get in a vehicle that is a hydrogen fuel \ncell vehicle.\n  I authored the legislation 2 years ago that established the title on \nhydrogen fuel cells. You know, interestingly enough, hydrogen fuel cell \nvehicles will have twice the efficiency of power to the wheel of the \nvehicle and put water vapor out the tailpipe. Wouldn't that be a \nwonderful thing? The fact that hydrogen is ubiquitous, is everywhere--I \nhad this wonderful experiment going on in North Dakota that I \nestablished in the Appropriations Committee of using a wind tower, a \nmore efficient wind turbine, take energy from the wind, use the \nelectricity that you take through the turbine, you take energy from the \nwind in the form of electricity, use the electricity in the process of \nsomething called electrolysis, and separate hydrogen from water with a \nprocess of electrolysis.\n  So you actually take an intermittent power source of wind and produce \nhydrogen, store the hydrogen for vehicle use. I believe we can get to \nthe point of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which will make us much less \ndependent on foreign sources of oil. We will not need foreign sources \nof oil if we do what we can with this fleet. But that will not happen \nin 3, 5, or even 10 years from now. There has to be interim steps in \nwhich we take action to reduce our dependence, even as we continue to \nuse the internal combustion engine, as we continue to use nearly 70 \npercent of all our oil through our vehicles, even as we import over 60 \npercent of the oil from overseas, we must take some interim steps to \nbegin to address that.\n  That is why this issue is so important, the efficiency of our \nvehicles. Finally, let me say this. I want our auto industry to \nsucceed. I want this industry to succeed. I do not want to be a part of \nsomething that says to them, that, you know, you have been asleep at \nthe switch, and so, therefore, we don't care about you. That is not my \npoint.\n  My point is, this industry will succeed, in my judgment, if they are \nunder the gun and under some pressure to produce more efficient \nvehicles. Other companies in other countries are doing it and so too \nshould ours. I wish to be helpful to our industry.\n  One final point. There is a discussion about a couple provisions in \nthe underlying Commerce Committee bill. One is the second 10 years, the \n4 percent efficiency a year, which was part of my offering, and the \nsecond was Senator Cantwell's offering of standards for the production \nof flex-fuel vehicles. We are building a 36-billion-gallon biofuels \nrequirement in this bill. We are going to produce 36 billion gallons of \nethanol, biofuels.\n\n  Where are you going to use all of that if you do not have the flex-\nfuel vehicles on the road so you can move that through those \ncarburetors or fuel injectors. You have got to be able to have a flex-\nfuel standard, so that when the automobile industry is producing cars, \nthey are producing flex-fuel vehicles so they can run either the E85 or \nthe regular gasoline. But if you are producing 36 billion gallons of \nbiofuel and do not have flex-fuel vehicles on the road to be able to \ntake those fuels and be able to run E85 through a vehicle, we are going \nto see this ethanol market collapse.\n  That is why the flex-fuel provisions in the underlying bill from \nCommerce are so important. I wish to make the point that my hope is \nthis afternoon, those who wish to try to amend the underlying provision \nin the Commerce Committee bill would come to the floor, let's have a \ndebate about it. I believe the Commerce Committee provision is a \nthoughtful provision, that finally aggressively represents change and \nreform on automobile efficiency. I think the standards are achievable.\n  I think they will be good for the industry. They certainly will be \ngood for the driving public in this country, and, most especially, they \nwill move us in the direction of being less dependent and move us in \nthe direction toward being independent of foreign sources of oil, which \nI think is important to this country's economic well-being.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to discuss the tax provisions in this legislation because I \nthink they are very much in the public interest and something I have \nbeen working on for many years.\n  In the last Congress, for the first time in many years, the \nexecutives of the major oil companies--we are talking about Shell and \nBP and Exxon, the big five companies--were in front of the joint \nhearing I attended, a joint hearing of the Energy Committee and the \nCommerce Committee.\n  With the executives there before this important hearing, I asked all \nof the oil CEOs if they agreed with a recent statement that President \nBush had made. President Bush, of course, an oil man himself, hardly \nsomebody who has any predisposition against the oil industry, recently \nsaid that: When oil is over $55 a barrel, the oil companies do not need \nincentives to explore and develop for oil.\n  I asked each of the executives that day, the first time they had been \nasked the question in years and years, and to a person, the executives \nsaid they did not need those subsidies. Every single one of the \nexecutives said it. What was so stunning about it is that their \nadmission was completely contrary to everything the Congress has been \ndoing pretty much for the previous decade.\n  For the previous decade, the Congress had just been throwing one \nsubsidy after another at these major oil companies, amounting to \nbillions and billions of dollars. Yet in the last Congress, when the \nexecutives were asked to go on record and publicly state their \nposition, the executives admitted they did not need the money that the \nCongress has been throwing at them, the billions of dollars in \nsubsidies the Congress has been throwing at them.\n  So what we have is essentially a time now when the companies are \nmaking record profits, and they are charging record prices when clearly \nthey do not need record subsidies. That is what the\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\nSenate Finance Committee legislation does with respect to the tax \nprovisions. I have reviewed them. They are clearly targeted at the \nmajor companies. They are not targeted at the independents and the \nsmall companies, and we ought to be taking steps to help them. In fact, \nI particularly credit our friend and colleague, the late Senator \nThomas, for doing extraordinary work over the years, some of which I \nwas privileged to work on with him, to help those small independent \ncompanies. Our good friend, the late Senator Thomas, championed that \nwork. This is not going to affect those small independents. This is \ntargeted at the major companies, the companies that, when I asked \nthem--the first time they had been asked in years--admitted they did \nnot need the billions of dollars worth of subsidies they were getting.\n  It ought to be put in the context of what it means for the consumer. \nOur friend from North Dakota began this discussion as well. The reality \nis, when somebody pulls up to a gasoline station in New Jersey or \nOregon or anywhere else, they are paying what amounts to a ``terror \ntax.'' That is what we ought to call it. Our addiction to foreign oil \nis literally a terror tax because when you pull up to that filling \nstation in Oregon or New Jersey or anywhere else, you pay this huge \nprice. Eventually, some of that money gets into the coffers of a \ngovernment in the Middle East, and they backdoor it to people who want \nto kill us.\n  Our addiction to foreign oil ought to be put in a context that is \nappropriate. It is a terror tax. This legislation which has been put \ntogether by a number of committees helps us to move away from that \naddiction to foreign oil. That is why I support it. By taking away some \nof the subsidies to the major companies, subsidies they have now \nclaimed they don't even need, it makes it possible for us to look at \nsome opportunities for developing renewable energy sources at home.\n  I was at a filling station not long ago in Oregon that hopes to get \nall its fuel from Oregon crops--not from oil from the Middle East--\nwaste oil and other products. That is our vision of an important part \nof our energy supply in the future. If we get out of the business of \nshoveling billions and billions of dollars worth of subsidies to the \nmajor oil companies, subsidies they have now made clear they don't \nneed, we can begin to develop a very different energy future.\n  One last point I wish to make relates to a debate I am sure we will \nhave, and that is a quick comment about the provisions which were added \nyesterday, Senator Bingaman's provisions, to the legislation. We are \ngoing to hear a lot about how somehow this is taking illegal action \nwith respect to oil royalties; it is taking action retroactively, and \nit is illegal. We are going to hear that probably many times in the \ncourse of discussion of the Bingaman legislation that was added \nyesterday.\n  The first thing I wish to make clear--and we were told this yesterday \nby counsel, because I asked about it--is that the Bingaman provision \nwould be applied prospectively on oil produced on Federal offshore \nleases in the Gulf of Mexico. It would apply to future activity, all \noil produced on Federal offshore leases in the gulf. As we go to this \ndiscussion and we are told repeatedly that this in some way unravels \nprevious agreements, that this is illegal, this is retroactive, I hope \ncolleagues will remember that we were told yesterday that it applies \nprospectively. It does not change the terms of any existing oil and gas \nlease. We are clear with respect to the Bingaman provision. It doesn't \nchange the terms of any existing oil and gas lease, and it would be \napplied prospectively on oil produced on these Federal offshore leases \nand all oil produced on those leases in the gulf.\n  One last point with respect to this issue is comments we have \nreceived from the Government Accountability Office with respect to the \namount of revenue the Government receives from oil production from the \ngulf. What the Government Accountability Office has told us on this \npoint is that the taxpayer receives revenue with respect to this \nproduction that is lower than virtually anywhere else in the world. \nThey have done a comparison to take a look at all of the other \ncountries where you have similar activity going on. Basically our take, \nthe revenue for the taxpayer, hard-working taxpayers across the \ncountry, is lower than virtually anywhere in the world. The only place \nthat is even close to us is where you have an oil company doing most of \nthe production, essentially a government corporation.\n  The reality is, with respect to drilling on our lands--and that is \nwhat I am talking about here, the people's lands, public lands, our \nlands--the taxpayer has been getting fleeced for years and years. The \nBingaman provision begins to right the scale to get a fair shake for \nthe taxpayers.\n  I hope colleagues will support the work done by the Finance Committee \nwith respect to the tax titles. It is important that they know the \nmajor oil companies have now admitted they don't need the subsidies, \nand the price per barrel is way over the amount the President said was \nthe level when we ought to stop paying out subsidies. I hope colleagues \nwill look at the facts with respect to the important provisions that \nwere added yesterday by Senator Bingaman. I am of the view that \ntaxpayers have been fleeced with respect to oil drilling on their \nlands, the people's lands. The Bingaman provision begins to right the \nscale.\n  I will have more to say on this issue down the road.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support legislation which \nis pending before the Senate which would increase fuel economy \nstandards in automobiles and trucks over the next 10 years. Regardless \nof what opponents of this amendment may say, technology is available \ntoday to reach this goal. We don't have to compromise the safety of the \ncars and trucks we drive and American jobs don't have to be lost to \nmeet these standards. The CAFE legislation we have proposed is \ndifferent than it has been in the past. It is a true compromise, a \nmiddle-ground position.\n  We have come a long way with this compromise, and I applaud the \nefforts of Senators Inouye and Stevens. It is not an easy issue to meet \nin the middle on, but we have. I am sorry the automobile industry, \nwhich has resisted efforts to improve fuel efficiency over the last 20 \nyears, is still resisting these efforts.\n  This is something most Americans understand intuitively. If we are \ngoing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, if we are going to \nreduce the pollution we are creating with the cars and trucks we drive, \nwe should be using fewer gallons of gasoline for the miles we drive. \nYet what we have seen consistently over the last 22 years, while we \nhave not had a national fuel economy standard, is that the cars and \ntrucks being sold on average are getting less mileage. So each year, we \nbuy these vehicles and find we need more gasoline than we did the \nprevious year to drive the same number of miles. That is unacceptable.\n  The CAFE provisions have come a long way since I offered my amendment \n2 years ago. When I came to the floor and suggested it was time to \nstart talking about fuel economy, there were not too many Senators \njoining me. I called for an increase in fuel economy standards that \nwould have had vehicles reach a target of 40 miles a gallon with a \ntarget date of 2016.\n  This legislation before us sets a target of 35 miles per gallon, \nproviding even more lead time for the automobile industry to the year \n2020. The last time we debated 40 miles a gallon, my opponents said \nthat was just too high a standard to reach. Now we have lowered that \ntarget to 35 miles a gallon, and the industry proposal has 36 miles per \ngallon 2 years out. It makes me wonder why they no longer think it is \narbitrary or whether they have any intention of ever meeting the \ntarget.\n  My amendment 2 years ago did not provide the industry the flexibility \nthis legislation does. I originally called for a hard target. You \neither had to reach it or pay fines. This legislation before us allows \nfor flexibility, providing the National Highway Transportation\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\nSafety Administration the authority to lower the target if it is not \ntechnologically feasible.\n  My amendment did not reform the CAFE program by creating attribute-\nbased standards, something I understand the industry would rather see \nthan the existing system. This legislation does. My amendment did not \ncreate a fleetwide fuel economy standard. This legislation does. Nor \ndid it extend the credit trading program, as this amendment before us \nwill do.\n  We have come a long way to reach a compromise on this legislation. We \nunderstand the concerns about the existing programs brought to our \nattention. We understand the difficulties in the domestic auto \nindustry. We tried to address them honestly. Unfortunately, for the \npast 2 years the auto companies were not at the table when they could \nhave been. So we changed the CAFE system to allow for a more level \nplaying field between American and foreign manufacturers.\n  We provided NHTSA the authority to create attribute-based standards \nfor passenger cars, something President Bush asked for. We already \nwitnessed NHTSA set new fuel economy standards for light trucks by \nusing this system. The CAFE standards will no longer be by manufacturer \nbut, instead, fleetwide, based on the size-attribute system. That means \nthe total fuel economy for all cars in the United States will meet the \nfuel economy targets we set. The targets will be set for different \ngroups of cars based on their size attributes, not based on the \nmanufacturer. Since the fuel economy target is fleetwide, the relative \nmix of vehicles manufactured by each company is not a real issue in the \ndebate. GM will not be penalized for making more SUVs and fewer small \npassenger vehicles than Toyota.\n  In order to meet a fleetwide average of 35 miles per gallon, each \nvehicle group will have to meet its own average fuel economy. For \nexample, all midsized sedans will have to attain an average fuel \neconomy standard. For example, the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Toyota \nCamry, and Chevy Malibu must attain roughly the same fuel economy. \nThese cars will have to get about 36 to 38 miles per gallon based on \ncurrent trends. Likewise, all large SUVs will be subject to different, \nlower average fuel economy. We will be comparing apples to apples. Each \nvehicle will have to reach an attainable fuel economy standard based on \nits size. All of these targets must average out to 35 miles per gallon \nfor the entire fleet sold in the United States by 2020.\n\n  I repeat that because it is a large and important change on how CAFE \nstandards are now structured. The relative mix of any manufacturer's \nfleet between similar passenger cars and larger SUVs is less relevant \nin the fuel economy debate. The American auto manufacturers should not \nbe at any disadvantage relative to foreign automobile manufacturers.\n  Now we are focused completely on increasing the fuel economy of \nvehicles driven in the United States, regardless of who makes them and \ntheir size.\n  Even though our legislation now addresses one of the major issues \nraised in the 2002 National Academy of Sciences report and does what \nNHTSA has requested, sadly, the auto manufacturers still oppose our \ncompromise and have come up with even more arguments to try to persuade \nmy colleagues to vote against improving the fuel economy of the cars \nand trucks we drive.\n  Let me remind everyone about the impact on the transportation sector \nof more fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  In 2005, the United States used 20.8 million barrels of oil per day. \nSixty percent of it, or 12.5 million barrels of the oil we use, is \nbought from other nations--60 percent in the year 2005. Of the 20 \nmillion barrels of oil we use every single day, 69 percent is used for \ntransportation, and of this, 62 percent is used for surface \ntransportation by cars and light trucks. Every minute, we consume more \nthan 267,000 gallons of gasoline in America. You could say we import \noil to run our cars, and by and large we do.\n  Any increase in fuel economy will decrease our dependence on foreign \noil. How significant is the issue of foreign oil? I don't need to \nremind anyone that we are in the midst of a war in the Middle East. We \nhave lost 3,521 of our best and bravest soldiers. Ten times that number \nhave been injured. Twice that number have been seriously injured, \nfacing traumatic brain injury and amputations.\n  It is no coincidence that these battlegrounds time and again are \nbattlegrounds in the Middle East, which is the source of our energy. We \nhave to reach a point where we are less dependent on that region of the \nworld to fuel the American economy.\n  NHTSA estimates that if we had not established CAFE standards in \n1975, highway fuel usage would be 35 percent higher today. A lot of \ncritics of what we did in 1975 said that was a Government mandate, and \nthey are right. It was a Government mandate which was resisted by the \nautomobile industry. They said to us that it was impossible, there was \nno technology that could result in cars being more fuel efficient than \nthe ones we drove in 1975. The manufacturers also argued that any cars \nbuilt to meet these standards would be so light in weight that they \nwould be unsafe. They argued that only foreign manufacturers would be \nable to make them. Thankfully, Congress ignored that argument and \npassed CAFE standards in 1975 and 10 years later saw the average miles \nper gallon of cars in America almost double because of the Government \nmandate.\n  The Natural Resource Defense Council estimates that the Ten-in-Ten \nFuel Economy Act now before the Senate will save 1.2 million barrels of \noil per day by 2020. Think about it, 1.2 million barrels of oil per \ntoday. I think the price of oil is around $70. Do the math. That is the \nkind of money we will not be sending overseas, oftentimes to countries \nthat do not agree with us in terms of our values and the kind of \nAmerica and world we would like to see in the future. Raising fuel \neconomy standards will reduce our demand for gasoline, which will \ndecrease the amount of oil we have to import.\n  Does anyone remember waiting in gas lines in 1973 to get their 10 \ngallons of gas? I do. The shortage was due to an OPEC embargo on oil \nexports to the United States in response to actions we had taken in the \nMiddle East. Overnight, the price of oil went up from $3 a barrel to \n$5.11 a barrel. Three months into the embargo, oil prices rose further \nto $11.65 a barrel. This embargo came at a time when the United States \nimported less than 30 percent of its annual oil--about 28 percent, in \nfact. And it hit America hard. Suddenly, Americans had to ration \ngasoline. Sales were maxed at $10 per sale, gasoline stations closed on \nSundays, and people waited in lines. OPEC succeeded in exerting its \ninfluence on global markets, as well as the United States. Our \nvulnerability was revealed in 1973, and so easily we forget.\n  Currently, crude oil costs just over $68 per barrel. Oil costs about \n27 percent more now than it did the last time we talked about CAFE on \nthe floor, the last time I offered an amendment 2 years ago. And it \nmakes the $11 a barrel during the oil embargo of the seventies seem \nlike some sort of utopia.\n  OPEC brought us to our knees in the 1970s. Imagine what they could do \nnow. We do not import 28 percent of our oil now; we import 60 percent \nof our oil. If other countries we buy oil from decided to stop selling \nto the United States or to hike the cost, our economy and individuals \nand families, small businesses and family farmers would be in big \ntrouble.\n  Literally 40 percent of all U.S. oil imports come from potentially \nhostile or unstable nations, and 92 percent of all conventional oil \nreserves are in these nations. Amazingly, we continue to operate in a \nbusiness-as-usual mode, reliant on imports to quench our thirst from \nsome of the most unstable countries in the world. Venezuela, one of the \ntop five oil exporters to the United States, is also one of the most \nautocratic in Latin America. The Chavez government regularly threatens \nnationalization of key industries and pursues policies inconsistent \nwith many of our policies in the United States. Nigeria, while \nstruggling on a path to democracy, is also extremely unstable, with \nongoing violence in the oil-producing regions. They are also in the top \nfive oil exporters to the United States. The more we rely on foreign \nnations to supply us with oil, the more susceptible we are to their \ninstability.\n  I hope my colleagues realize that any future crisis that prevents or \nsignificantly restricts the production or flow\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\nof oil resources will have consequences on our economy far worse than \nanything we experienced in the 1970s. So we can do nothing and hope \nthat some manifestation of 1973 does not occur again or we can take \nsteps now, wise steps to prepare for our future.\n  Another argument we hear is that if you raise fuel economy standards, \nAmerican auto companies will be forced to make small cars that are not \nas safe. That is just not true.\n  This argument comes from the same industry that has fought \nincorporating new technology into their automobiles that now make our \ncars safer--including seatbelts and airbags. They now argue that they \nare concerned about your safety and that raising fuel economy will put \nyou at risk.\n  Better fuel economy does not mean a vehicle needs to be smaller. Take \nfor instance, the Saturn VUE. This vehicle's hybrid system will provide \na 20 percent increase in fuel mileage over the conventional VUE engine \nand not be one inch smaller.\n  Their safety argument stems from the idea that the only way to make a \ncar more fuel efficient is to decrease weight and size of the vehicle.\n  This, they posit, would decrease the safety of the vehicles.\n  Although reducing vehicle weight will increase fuel economy, it is \nnot our only option.\n  The International Council on Clean Transportation released a report 2 \nweeks ago called ``Sipping Fuel and Saving Lives: Increasing Fuel \nEconomy Without Sacrificing Safety.''\n  This report highlighted many mechanisms that would increase safety \nwithout affecting fuel economy, including: rollover-activated seatbelt \npretensioners; window curtain airbags; and electronic stability control \nwhich allows each tire brake to be individually activated depending on \ncircumstances.\n  They also advocated the use of advance high-strength construction and \naluminum and a shift to unibody construction.\n  This would not only increase the safety of the vehicle, it would \ndecrease the weight of the vehicle, thus also increasing fuel economy.\n  Smart design and use of strong materials to protect the passengers in \nstrategic places will also lead to decreased overall weight of the \nvehicles without diminishing either vehicle size or safety.\n  The report went on to state that most of the technologies available \nto increase fuel economy have no impact on safety.\n  In fact, as fuel economy has increased, the number of traffic \nfatalities has decreased.\n  During the late 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the number of \nfatalities per vehicle mile traveled decreased dramatically. During the \nsame time, the fuel economy doubled.\n  I think this shows us without a doubt that increased fuel economy can \nbe obtained without jeopardizing vehicular safety.\n  The National Research Council's 2002 report, ``Effectiveness and \nImpact of CAFE Standards'', found that increases of 12 to 27 percent \nfor cars and 25 to 42 percent for trucks were possible without any loss \nof performance characteristics or degradation of safety.\n  In fact, 85 percent of the gains in fuel economy we have witnessed \nhave come from technologies that had no impact on vehicle safety--\nincluding changes in valve control, throttling, or increasing the \nefficiency of accessories like air-conditioning and heating units.\n  The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has \nrecently cited both the 2002 National Academies study and its own \nrecent review of safety noting that down-weighting if concentrated \namong the heaviest vehicles could produce a small, fleet-wide safety \nbenefit.\n  Additionally, scientists have the ability to develop superior, \ncutting edge materials that can reduce the weight of the largest and \nmost fuel inefficient vehicles.\n  For instance, ``composite materials'' made from graphite fibers, \nmagnesium alloy and epoxies comprise 60 percent of Boeing's 7E7--\nproviding greater durability, reducing maintenance and maintaining \nsafety--and increasing efficiency between 20 and 30 percent over its \nrival similar product.\n  The same auto industry that fought against safety belts, airbags, \nmandatory recalls, side-impact protection and roof strength is fighting \nagainst better fuel economy.\n  I am not surprised--just disappointed.\n  We have heard the argument too, that increasing fuel economy \nstandards will force American automakers out of work.\n  Sadly, we are already witnessing tremendous job loss in our American \nautomotive manufacturing sector, and it wasn't caused by an increase in \nfuel economy standards.\n  Instead, it has been this industry's failure to change with the times \nand recognize that the growing global dependence on oil would \ninevitably force gasoline prices to increase and that consumers would \nrespond to the high prices at the pump by demanding more fuel-efficient \ncars.\n  Some companies are adapting to consumer demand--they are making more \nfuel-efficient vehicles, and being rewarded by higher sales.\n  Other companies are not adapting as quickly to consumer demand and \ncontinue to make cars that are more difficult to move off the lots.\n  The argument that increased CAFE standards would result in job loss \nspeculates that the industry would just stop producing vehicles instead \nof introducing new vehicles.\n  I suggest that they would still make vehicles--that they would need \nexpertise and labor to design new cars and retool existing models to be \nmore efficient--expanding to potential for jobs in the U.S.\n  Consumers across America are paying over $3 per gallon at the pump, \nand they are not happy about it.\n  Stagnant fuel economy and increasing gasoline costs pinch American \nfamilys' pocketbooks.\n  In a poll released right before Memorial Day, 46 percent of \nrespondents said they expect spiking gasoline prices to cause them \nsevere financial problems.\n  Increasing fuel economy standards would help consumers save more than \n$2,500 over the life of the vehicle.\n  According to another recent poll conducted by the Mellman Group, 88 \npercent of rural pickup owners support higher CAFE standards.\n  Eighty-four percent of people who use their pickup trucks on the job \napprove of increased CAFE standards.\n  Eighty-seven percent of people who are economically dependent on the \nauto industry are supportive of increased CAFE standards.\n  The consumers who actually have the most to gain from increased fuel \neconomy are people who live in rural areas--they frequently have larger \nvehicles and must drive further on a daily basis.\n  They are therefore spending more at the pump and are overwhelmingly \nsupportive of increasing the fuel economy of the vehicles they need to \ndrive.\n  A constituent of mine, Chuck Frank, owner of ``Z'' Frank Chevrolet/\nKia recently visited with me to discuss the bill we are debating.\n  Chuck runs a family business. His family has been selling and leasing \ncars and trucks in Chicago since 1936--and has sold well over 1 million \nChevrolets.\n  He doesn't want to be at odds with the manufacturers he represents, \nbut he recognizes that times are changing.\n  In a letter he sent us, Mr. Frank wrote:\n\n       It is important for you to know that there is support from \n     within the auto industry for moving forward with raising \n     Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards.\n\n  Mr. Frank also shared with me a recent editorial by Keith Crain, the \neditor-in-chief of Detroit's Automotive News. The editorial states:\n\n       It's a real shame that the industry and the Alliance of \n     Automobile Manufacturers can't be a part of the solution \n     rather than an embarrassment to the nation.\n\n  If there is no objection, I would like to have both the letter and \neditorial printed into the Record.\n  Since 1999, Chrysler group has lost 2.7 percentage points of its \nmarket share while GM's domestic brands have lost 4.9 percentage points \nand Ford has lost 7.4 percentage points.\n  It is time these companies recognize that they are not making enough \nof what consumers want and should start delivering what the consumers \nneed.\n  Finally, increasing fuel economy standards will help reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Every gallon of gasoline burned releases approximately 20 pounds of \ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\n  One-fifth of the greenhouse gas emissions are from the tailpipes of \nour cars.\n  Increasing CAFE standards will decrease emissions as we use less \ngasoline.\n  Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are extremely promising. Using \nenergy equivalents between gasoline and electricity, the Natural \nResources Defense Council calculated that a plug-in electric vehicle \nwould get the equivalent of 105 miles per gallon.\n  If we look at the oil savings we can expect to get from our bill, the \nalternative amendment and a strict 4 percent per year increase, we see \nthat these approaches have a dramatically different impact on the \namount of oil we use in our transportation sector.\n  If we increase fuel economy by 4 percent annually, we see the best \noil savings. Ironically, this is closest to what the President \nsuggested in his State of the Union Address this year.\n  Four percent per year would yield an oil savings of 5.5 million \nbarrels per day by 2030 if the auto manufacturers were not provided an \noff ramp.\n  The CAFE amendment that we have seen would make very small gains in \noil savings by 2020, we would be using less than one-half of a million \nbarrels of oil per day and by 2030 we would be using less than 2 \nmillion of barrels of oil per day than we otherwise would be.\n  Our proposal is the real compromise here, by getting to 35 mpg by \n2020, we would save 1.2 million barrels of oil per day. If fuel economy \nrises at 4 percent per year after the first 10 years, we would save \nalmost 4 million barrels of oil per day by 2030.\n  If we also look at the greenhouse gas emissions and fuel cost savings \nto consumers, we see more clearly how much more effective our bill is \nfor consumers and the environment.\n  The amount of oil savings that we would achieve by 2020 under our \nproposal is 1.2 million barrels per day.\n  The other proposal would only save 0.4 million of barrels of oil per \nday.\n  A 4 percent annual increase in fuel economy would achieve 1.7 million \nbarrels of oil per day savings.\n  Our bill would save 206 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from \nbeing emitted into the atmosphere every year.\n  The other CAFE proposal would cut greenhouse gas emissions by only 65 \nmillion metric tons per year.\n  Finally, our bill saves consumers more at the pump. We would save \nconsumers $25 billion by 2020 compared to only $8 billion in savings by \n2020 with the alternative CAFE proposal.\n  Our position is the compromise position--it has been worked out in a \nbipartisan fashion. We have worked hard to address the concerns of the \nauto industry and NHTSA. And still the auto manufacturers are unable to \ncome to the table to support a bill that makes any meaningful change \nthat would save millions of barrels of oil per day, using off the shelf \ntechnology.\n  I cannot for the life of me explain how a great industry such as the \nautomobile industry in the United States has fallen so far behind when \nit comes to new technology in fuel economy. Several years ago when \nToyota and other Japanese manufacturers came up with hybrid vehicles \nand hybrid engines, Detroit was dismissive: It is a fad; people don't \nreally want them. They have now sold their 1 millionth Toyota Prius in \nthe United States. There is a strong appetite for cars that get 40, 50, \n60 miles a gallon, serve our families, and serve the needs of our \neconomy. Detroit has not registered when it comes to this obvious \nreality.\n  My wife and I bought a Ford Escape hybrid, at the time the only \nhybrid offered by an American manufacturer. I am sorry to report to \nyou, unfortunately, that the hybrid technology in my Ford was made by \nToyota. Ford did not make it. They were not up to it. I hope they soon \nwill be when it comes to more fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  There are opportunities out there. I am afraid if we listen to the \nautomobile manufacturers and continue to wait, nothing will happen. \nFuel efficiency will continue to falter, will continue to be dependent \non countries that send their oil to the United States.\n  It is interesting, while we are in this CAFE debate in the United \nStates, other countries have already had their debate. The winners, \nwhen it comes to fuel economy, are Japan and the European Union, where \nautomobiles are now getting 40 to 46 miles per gallon. China--China, \nthis fledgling economy--has more fuel-efficient cars than we do, and \ntheir fleet is almost at 35 miles per gallon already, as we debate \nwhether the United States can reach that goal in 10 years.\n  There is a lot of reasons we have fallen so far behind. I will not \ntry to dwell on them, but clearly we have a chance to catch up.\n  The last point I would like to make is, this is a timely debate as \nwell when it comes to our environment. There are a few of my colleagues \non the Senate floor who don't believe in global warming and climate \nchange. They are entitled to their point of view. I happen to think \nthey are wrong. I am sure they believe they are correct. I happen to \nbelieve something is happening in this world today: The climate is \nchanging; storms are more violent; glaciers are melting. We are seeing \nchanges already that are going to have a long-term negative impact on \nthe world in which we live.\n  When I look at my grandchild, who is about 11 years old, and talk \nabout what the world will be like for him, I am sure the day is going \nto come when he is going to ask me: Did you do what you could to try to \navoid the environmental crisis that was looming when you saw it back in \nthe early 21st century?\n  It is a legitimate question. Each generation has to be able to answer \nthat question. We know now if we don't do something smart when it comes \nto energy and energy consumption, we are going to make this world less \ncomfortable for us to live in. That is a fact. I hope by moving toward \nfuel efficiency we can start doing the right thing.\n  And I will go a step further. If we fail on the fuel efficiency \nquestion, on the CAFE question when it comes to the cars and trucks \nthat we drive, then I believe we will have failed on one of the most \nfundamental issues in terms of the future of this planet and the future \nof the United States. I honestly believe we have an opportunity to move \nforward, and I hope we do it, and do it soon.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First of all, as chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, your words are really like music to my ears. I am so \ngrateful that you, Senator Durbin, are in the leadership because I \nthink you reflect the views of the vast majority of Americans who see \nthe challenges ahead and know we just can't do business as usual.\n  I think this bill is a very fair bill when it comes to fuel economy. \nThis bill went through the Commerce Committee, a committee on which I \nserve, and it was a bipartisan measure. Everyone voted for it. It was \nfair; it was good.\n  The question I have for my colleague is, I just wanted to make sure \nhe was aware of another provision in this bill, which is a good one, \ntoo, and that is to make sure the Federal Government is, in fact, the \nmodel of energy efficiency when it comes to the purchase of new cars. I \nwanted to make sure my friend was aware because it is tucked away in \nthis bill, a provision we got out of the Commerce Committee, that says \nfrom now on, when the Federal Government buys its 60,000 cars a year--\n60,000 cars a year for its Federal fleet--that it buy the most fuel-\nefficient car. Is my friend aware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware because I know the Senator from California has \nbeen working on this for quite some time. I might also add that I \nrecently met with the Postmaster General, and the U.S. Post Office has \nmany vehicles bought by the Federal Government. They are trying to \nfocus on how to reconfigure existing vehicles with diesel technology, \nfor example, which is less polluting and uses less fuel. And they need \nour help. So I hope this bill will be a breakthrough when it comes to \nFederal vehicles.\n  I might also add, I am aware the Senator from California has joined \nme and a few of our colleagues and invited the experts to come and take \na look at our office operations. Members of Congress, the Senate and \nthe House, have to lead by example, and I hope the small steps we have \nalready taken, and other steps we will take to have less of what we \ncall a carbon footprint from our operations, may point the way toward \nmore fuel efficiency and conserving electricity even in our own office \noperations.\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, absolutely, I say to my friend, and again I thank \nhim for yielding for another question.\n  Several of our offices are part of this model project to see how \nenergy efficient we can be. It is a pretty straightforward way for us \nto lead by example.\n  The other question I have for my colleague is this: The bill that is \non the Senate floor, which Senator Reid worked so hard to put together, \nalong with Senator Bingaman, myself, and Senator Inouye and others--\nSenator Kerry was involved, and I know my friend was involved as the \nassistant leader. There are other provisions in this bill--which is why \nI am so hopeful we will get this done--that take this notion of the \nFederal Government being a model to our buildings as well.\n  I am not sure my friend is aware of the exact number, but the Federal \nGovernment either runs or operates 8,000 buildings--8,000 buildings. \nWhen my friend talks about global warming, it is a fact that in America \n39 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions comes from buildings. So if \nwe can set the tone here, and we can move forward with a bipartisan \nvote--we were able to pass a lighting efficiency bill for the Federal \nGovernment, which is included. This also has a component where grants \nwill be given across this country to cities and counties to make their \nbuildings energy efficient in terms of lighting. It will save money, \nand it will reduce the carbon footprint.\n  Then, with the help of Senators Lautenberg and Warner, we got another \npiece of legislation included in this bill, which is called the green \nbuildings bill, which also impacts all new and existing Federal \nbuildings and also requires the EPA to come out with a model of green \nbuildings for schools. So we will help our schools because you are so \nright when you talked about your 11-year-old grandson. I have a 12-\nyear-old grandson, as you know. They are going to ask those tough \nquestions, and they may well ask it of the schools they are in too.\n  So I wanted to make sure my friend knew, since we really are talking \nmore with the leadership of Senator Bingaman, who has been working on \nthe most contentious amendments, that there is so much in the \nunderlying bill that came out of his committee, my committee, and other \ncommittees that is strong, and that is why we would hate to see this \nderailed. This would be an enormous setback.\n  The people want us to reach across party lines and take care of \nbusiness, and an energy policy is going to take care of business.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might just say to the Senator from California that it \nwasn't that long ago we used to hear about all the California laws, \nrules, and regulations. It was a source of amusement to many of us in \nthe Midwest that you had your own design in automobile engines, and we \nthought: What is going on with these crazy people in California? We \nlearned our lesson because in the period of time that you led the \nNation in thinking about these things, you proved something: that you \ncould keep economic growth moving forward in California and conserve \nenergy in the process.\n  That is a lesson the Nation needs to learn. We don't want to \nsacrifice jobs, business growth, or opportunity in America. Instead, we \nwant to create opportunity in a reasonable, wise, environmentally \nsensitive way.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8021-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8021-S8022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           VETO OF STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto \nmessage on S. 5 be considered as having been read and that it be \nprinted in the Record and spread in full upon the Journal. I further \nask unanimous consent that the message be held at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The veto message of the President is printed in today's Record under \n``Presidential Messages.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me briefly say I have had a conversation \nwith the distinguished Republican leader and this will be brought up at \na later time. We will fully consult with the distinguished Republican \nleader, and we will do it at a time that is more appropriate than \ntoday.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in 6\\1/2\\ years in office, President Bush \nhas picked up his veto pen only two times. Today he adds a third; and \nonce more, he is standing against hope for thousands of Americans \nafflicted with deadly diseases. His veto of the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act is a grave moral error.\n  Embryonic stem cell research may one day provide relief to more than \n100 million Americans suffering from Parkinson's, diabetes, spinal cord \ninjury, Lou Gehrig's disease, cancer, and many other devastating \nconditions for which there is still no cure. Today, Federal funds are \nonly allowed for work on 21 stem cell lines that existed as of August \n9, 2001, all of which are contaminated. Scientists understand that \naccess to more stem cell lines would significantly expand the scope and \npossibility of their research. That is why the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act expanded the number of embryonic stem cell lines \navailable for federally funded research by allowing the use of stem \ncells derived through embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics. Stem \ncell research turns embryos that would otherwise be discarded into the \nseeds of life-giving science.\n  Of course, the decision to dedicate embryos to research is a heavy \none. We have never argued otherwise. That is why the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act contained strict ethical requirements. Under this \nlegislation, the only embryonic stem cells that can be used for \nfederally funded research are those that were derived through embryos \ncreated for fertility treatment purposes and donated for research with \nthe written, informed consent of the individuals seeking that \ntreatment. Any financial or other inducements to make this donation are \nprohibited under this legislation. These ethical standards are stronger \nthan current law--possibly stronger, in fact, than the standards \nattending the creation of the 21 approved lines.\n  Stem cells from embryos have a unique potential to reduce human \nsuffering--and for precisely that reason, embryonic stem cell research \nis supported by a strong majority of Americans. Today, President Bush \nset himself against that potential, and against that majority; he set \nhimself in the way of our scientists, and our suffering patients. I \nhope that, when he has left office at last, he will come to regret his \nchoice. If not, history will regret it for him.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, once-terminal diseases such as leukemia, \naplastic anemia, cerebral palsy, and sickle-cell anemia are now \ntreatable, if not curable, by using stem cells derived from bone marrow \nand umbilical cord blood. Early this year, scientists at Wake Forest \nUniversity School of Medicine found stem cells in amniotic fluid. These \nstem cells are particularly exciting for their pluripotency--the \ncharacteristic that enables the stem cell to turn into multiple bodily \ntissues and thereby be useful in a variety of medical treatments.\n  In the last few weeks, just as the House was engaging in a partisan \neffort to pass this bill that the President rightly vetoed, scientists \ndiscovered that human skin could one day be used to create limitless \nlines of stem cells that are virtually indistinguishable from embryonic \nstem cells in their characteristics. Already such newspapers as the \nWashington Post are glowing with reports about how this discovery could \n``revolutionize stem cell research and quench one of the hottest \nbioethical controversies of the decade.'' At the same time, the highly \ntrumped benefits of stem cells derived from the destruction of a living \nembryo have yet to be demonstrated, despite considerable private and \npublic funding.\n  All members of this body share a desire to find cures or successful \ntreatments for horrible illnesses. Fortunately, such an opportunity has \nbeen presented in the way of adult stem cells. Even with all of the \ntremendous potential that adult stem cells hold for treating serious \nmedical conditions, some of my colleagues are unwilling to support \nlegislation that funds the development of ethically acceptable and \nmedically beneficial adult stem cell research. This body should \nrecognize the\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\nfundamental differences--not just between Senators--but among the \nAmerican people, over the appropriate use of taxpayer funding for stem \ncell research that destroys a living embryo. We may never move beyond \nthis impasse, but that should not stop us from encouraging non-\ncontroversial and highly productive medical treatments.\n  While S. 5 contains provisions which are morally unacceptable to many \npeople, S. 30, the ``Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem \nCell Research Act'' or the ``HOPE Act,'' which the Senate passed, is an \nopportunity for Congress to support highly-productive adult stem cell \nresearch free of ethical defects. S. 30 would specifically direct the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to seek alternative sources of \nstem cells and study the possibility of establishing an amniotic and \nplacental stem cell bank, similar to the bone marrow and cord blood \nstem cell bank, while reaffirming a policy that prohibits research that \ndestroys human life. This goes far beyond the current policy in the \nextent to which it supports adult stem cell research.\n  Right now, as Senators prepare to consider an override of the \nPresident's veto of S. 5, there are millions of Americans suffering \nfrom serious illnesses who are waiting for the potential treatments \noffered by adult stem cell research. Rather than wasting precious time \ndebating ethically divisive funding for stem cell research that \ndestroys living embryos, the House should take up and pass S. 30. It is \ndisappointing to see partisanship trump science and patients' hopes.\n  I applaud the President for issuing his Executive Order today, \nimplementing many, but not all, of the key provisions of S. 30. I urge \nmy colleagues to reaffirm opposition to S. 5 by upholding this \njustified veto, and to think twice about trying to add S. 5 or similar \nprovisions that would promote embryo-destructive research onto other \nbills, including annual appropriations bills. Such a move would justify \nthe veto of that legislation as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8022-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8022-S8051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CREATING LONG-TERM ENERGY ALTERNATIVES FOR THE NATION ACT OF 2007--\n                               Continued\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1658\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of an amendment I \nfiled at the desk some time ago, Vitter amendment No. 1658, and I would \nlike to briefly explain what that is.\n  At its core, this amendment would allow Louisiana to use more Federal \ncoastal impact assistance dollars, which are already going to the State \nunder preexisting law, a law we passed a couple of years ago, to be \nused specifically for one of our top priorities in the wake of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, and that is a hurricane protection effort.\n  By way of background, in 2005, we passed the Energy Policy Act, and \nthat did a very important thing for the State of Louisiana and other \nproducing States. It established a Coastal Impact Assistance Program \nfor the six States in the United States that produce offshore energy, \nparticularly oil and gas. Obviously, that includes Louisiana. Under \nthat 4-year Coastal Impact Assistance Program, certain Federal dollars \nflow to those producing States in light of the enormous work they do \nproducing energy for our country and the negative impact that activity \nhas in many cases on our coastline.\n  Back at that time, a provision was made to restrict the amount of \nthose funds that could go specifically to infrastructure projects, and \nthat cap was established, with the work of Senator Bingaman and others, \nat 23 percent. Back in 2005, I argued strongly and worked with Senator \nBingaman and others to say that cap should be lifted with regard to \nhurricane protection work, at least in Louisiana, because that work was \nabsolutely so vital, so essential for our very existence. \nUnfortunately, that argument did not hold the day. The cap was not \nlifted, and an exemption was not put in place for hurricane protection \nefforts.\n  I am trying to get that cap lifted for hurricane protection work in \nLouisiana now. My argument that we should do it comes down to two \nwords--two words that happened, that devastated our coastline between \nthen and now, and the two words are ``Katrina'' and ``Rita.'' Since \nthat original act in 2005, Katrina and Rita struck, and they struck \nliteral death blows to the Louisiana coast. If hurricane protection was \na big priority before that, it has only grown enormously with those two \nhurricanes coming upon our shores.\n  I think there is every rationale, every reason to allow us to use \nmore of that coastal impact assistance money for hurricane protection \nefforts and to lift that arbitrary ceiling of 23 percent for \ninfrastructure projects, specifically when we are talking about \nhurricane protection efforts.\n  I have been in contact with Senator Bingaman about this issue. We \nhave just discussed it on the Senate floor. I know he is considering \nthese arguments. Perhaps in wrapping up my discussion, I could invite \nthe Senator to engage in a brief colloquy and ask him again to focus on \nthe extreme needs of the Louisiana coast in the wake of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita and to continue consideration of lifting this cap in \nlight of those extreme needs and to see where we are in that \ndiscussion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond to the comments the \nSenator from Louisiana made.\n  Procedurally, we are not able to bring up or consider the amendment \nhe has talked about today. I have explained to him the reason for that \nis there is a Republican objection to us bringing up and considering a \ngreat many amendments that Democratic Members would like to bring up \nand consider at the same time. So I regret that.\n  On the substance, I am not in a position to indicate right now \nwhether this kind of change would take place. I would assume that to \nmake that judgment, we would have to know something about the hurricane \nassistance that has been provided and whether there are still adequate \nfunds available for some of this wetland assistance that was the \npurpose of the original legislation in 2005.\n  Obviously, I think the entire Senate has been anxious to be of \nassistance to all of the gulf coast. This legislation he is referring \nto, the wetlands protection part of the 2005 Energy bill, was part of \nthat. There have been several things that have been done since the \ndevastating hurricanes hit that region. But I do not know enough about \nthe specifics of those assistance programs to pass judgment on the \ncontents of his amendment. I commend him for offering it, but I am not \nin a position to support it or oppose it.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming the floor, I will put that down as an \n``undecided,'' and ``maybe.'' I want to continue these discussions with \nthe Senator from New Mexico. He is essentially the key to clearing this \namendment, probably without objection.\n  Again, I restate that because of the devastating impact of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, I think there is every reason in the world to lift \nthis arbitrary cap of 23 percent, specifically and only for hurricane \nprotection work on our coast. It is absolutely vital for our survival. \nIt will not mean we are not doing everything else we have been talking \nabout. That is moving forward for a number of reasons, including the \nrevenue sharing piece we were able to pass into law late last year. \nThat will give significant new revenue to our coastal restoration \nefforts and other things. I again urge the Senator to continue to look \nat this and hopefully clear this so it can be adopted without even the \nneed for a vote on the floor, adopted by unanimous consent.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1776\n\n  Now I wish to move to a second very important amendment I have at the \ndesk, which is amendment No. 1776. I just happened to get that number \nbut I think it is a very appropriate number for this amendment because \nthis goes to our very important, patriotic efforts to increase our \nenergy independence and to get away from our enormous reliance on the \nMiddle East, including very dangerous countries and regimes in the \nMiddle East that are clearly not friends of ours at all.\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\n  This amendment is straightforward. It would allow increased domestic \nproduction of minerals or renewable energy in Federal areas that are \nnot allowed now, if and only if all four of these things happen--really \nfive.\n  No. 1, the national average gasoline price would have to exceed $3.75 \na gallon at the pump.\n  No. 2, in addition, foreign imports of oil would have to exceed 65 \npercent of all oil use.\n  No. 3, in addition, the President would have to determine that an \nample supply of renewable fuels is insufficient to meet fuel demand \ndomestically at that time.\n  No. 4, in addition, the President would have to determine that \ncontinued and growing reliance on foreign oil imports is a threat to \nnational security.\n  If all of those four preconditions were met, then and only then, No. \n5, the Governor of a State, with the concurrence of the State \nlegislature, could petition the Secretary of the Interior to initiate \nleasing activities on specified Federal lands within the State or \nwithin the administrative boundaries of the Outer Continental Shelf \nrelated to that State for oil and gas or alternative energy production. \nSo if everything I mentioned happened, then and only then a State \nitself, through its Governor, through its State legislature, can say: \nYes, sir, Mr. President, we want to be part of the solution. This is a \ndire, extreme case. This is a real national security threat. We want to \nbe part of the solution by producing, safely and in an environmentally \nfriendly way, more oil and gas, more renewable energy for America.\n  I think this is an utterly commonsense and very much needed amendment \nto increase domestic production, decrease reliance on foreign sources. \nThat goes to energy security. As such, it goes to economic security. It \ngoes to national security.\n  Again, none of this would happen unless all of those things happened \nfirst: gasoline prices at $3.75 at the pump, foreign imports over 65 \npercent of everything we are using in this country, the President \nsaying renewables cannot make up the difference, the President saying \nthis is a real national security issue, the Governor of the State \nsaying we want to do this, it is our home, we can do it responsibly, \nand the State legislature of the State concurring. All of those things \nwould have to happen before opening up either land within the State or \npart of the Outer Continental Shelf off the State to leasing activity, \nin terms of Federal land.\n  It is very important that we do a balanced approach, all sorts of \nthings, to decrease our reliance on foreign sources. This is a very \ncommonsense part of that menu.\n  With that, I understand there may be objection, but I ask unanimous \nconsent to set aside the pending amendment so that this very \ncommonsense amendment, which goes to the heart of this debate and the \nheart of the bill, Vitter amendment No. 1776, can be called up and made \npending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I object.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask a question, through the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana, to the manager of the bill, the Senator from New \nMexico?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Would the distinguished chairman of the Energy Committee \ninform the Senate why there isn't more done on this bill? People have \nsaid to me we want to have it debated--and not just Democrats; \nRepublicans have asked me the same question--why aren't we able to move \non to get some of this done?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond to the majority leader by \nsaying there are a great many good amendments Republican Members would \nlike to offer, there are good amendments Democratic Members would like \nto offer. We are informed there is objection to us bringing up any of \nthese amendments and getting a vote on them at this time because of \nobjections from a Senator on the Republican side.\n  For that reason, we are somewhat unable to proceed with any of these \nlegislative matters. I know the time is running toward the vote on \ncloture--both on the tax package and on the bill itself. I know there \nis good faith on both sides in wanting to do some more business before \nthose cloture votes occur. But obviously, good faith on the part of \nmany Senators does not ensure we can make progress. We have to have \nunanimous consent and we cannot get that.\n  Mr. REID. I don't know if the Senator from Louisiana still wants the \nfloor?\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. REID. Would it be OK if I direct another question to the manager \nof the bill?\n  Mr. VITTER. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, I have worked for all the time I have been in the Senate, \nfor more than a dozen years, on a very close, intimate basis while we \nwere managing the Energy and Water appropriations bill, with the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. What is going on here, as \nthe comanager of this bill, is very unlike Senator Domenici. Senator \nDomenici likes things debated. He likes votes to take place. He likes \nmovement here in the Senate.\n  Senator Domenici is not part of holding this legislation up, is he?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond to the majority leader. I \nthink it is fair to say there is a good-faith effort on the part of \nboth managers to try to move forward with legislation in a way that is \nfair to both Republicans and Democrats, and allows consideration of \namendments on both sides. But we are being blocked by others.\n  Mr. REID. One last question, if the Senator will be patient, the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, the senior Senator from New Mexico, the \nmanager of the bill, has been in the Senate longer than I have, and he \nknows more about procedure than I do, but has the Senator tried, for \nexample, having 60-vote margins on some amendments that people may not \nwant, to see if there is any other way to move this along to get that \nobjection withdrawn?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Again, Mr. President, in response, let me say we have \ntried to get agreement that certain of the amendments that are \nobjectionable to some Members on the Republican side--we would agree \nthat we would be bound by a 60-vote threshold on those amendments. But \nat least at this point, my understanding is the objection is to any \nconsideration of the amendments, regardless of what the threshold is \ngoing to be. We are unable to proceed right now. I hope that changes. I \nhope we can dispose of some of the very meritorious amendments that \nboth Republican Senators and Democratic Senators wish to offer before \nwe get to cloture.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the record to reflect my appreciation \nfor the courtesy extended to me by the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I was happy to do that.\n  Reclaiming the floor, all of that is interesting. It is also what is \ncommonly referred to as ``inside baseball.'' For the sake of the \ninsiders here, let me translate for you what the American people just \nheard. To quote Charley Brown, ``Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.''\n  The fact is, what Americans are faced with is an energy crisis and we \nhave all this ``inside baseball'' tangling us up in the Senate, in the \nHouse, and we are not doing a darned thing about it.\n  The other fact is there is no objection on the Republican side to \ncalling this amendment up, No. 1776, to making it pending, to \nconsidering it. There are all sorts of debate and all sorts of \ndiscussions about other amendments. There is certainly no objection on \nour side to this amendment. Why should there be? Why shouldn't we allow \nindividual States to say: Yes, we want to be part of the solution, \nparticularly when all of the following events occur: average price of \ngasoline reaches $3.75 a gallon, foreign imports top 65 percent of \neverything used in the country, the President certifies that renewables \ncan't make up the gap, the President certifies there is a continuing \nreliance on foreign oil, which is a national security threat? If all of \nthose things happen, shouldn't we be allowing a State,\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\nthrough its Governor, through the State legislature, to be part of the \nsolution in a safe and environmentally sensitive way to produce more \nenergy in this country that doesn't take away the need for alternative \nfuels, that doesn't take away the need for conservation or everything \nelse?\n  But the clear and simple fact is, this problem is so big we need to \ndo all of the above. Certainly this commonsense approach should be on \nthat menu, should be among all of the above.\n  Let's get beyond the Washington insider ``Wah, wah, wah,'' all the \nrunning around, all the objections, all the being tied up in knots, and \npresent some reasonable, commonsense solutions to this growing national \nenergy crisis.\n  I hope those who control the floor and leave the floor, starting with \nthe distinguished majority leader, to whom I deferred a few minutes ago \non the floor, can be part of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the moment of truth is coming \non this Energy bill very shortly as to whether we will stick with the \nbill which requires the meeting of cars and light trucks to be 35 miles \nper gallon not for another 13 years, until 2020, and thereafter the \nmileage standards to improve by 4 percent a year. There is a great deal \nof consternation going on here, particularly by the automobile industry \nthat does not want to comply with these standards.\n  I was prepared to offer an amendment that I think 35 miles is too \nlow. We have the technology. The question is, Do we have the political \nwill? We have the technology to go to 40 miles per gallon. I have filed \nan amendment. But apparently, because of the dynamics of the Senate \ntaking up this issue, we are struggling to get the votes in order to \nkeep the 35-miles-per-gallon standard in the bill.\n  There are all kinds of side discussions going on in the corridors and \nanterooms of the Capitol as to whether there will be any offer, \nparticularly by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, as to reduced \nstandards. Originally, he was proposing a standard of 36 miles per \ngallon but not to be achieved until the year 2025, with other trucks \nexempted from that. So you see the battle, the choice that is basically \nset.\n  Why should we do this now? Let's look at history. I came into public \noffice in 1972, now 35 years ago. At the time in the early 1970s, we \nhad an embargo by the oil-producing countries, particularly in the \nPersian Gulf region. There was a panic. There were long lines at the \ngas stations. The price of oil shot up from a low price of something \nless than $10 a barrel back then, it shot up considerably and everybody \nwas concerned. Americans were impatient. The Persian Gulf region became \na target of our disaffection. Then the spigot was turned on. The oil \nbegan to flow again. The embargo was released. The price started to \nrecede. America went back to sleep.\n  It happened again in the late 1980s, about the time I was elected to \nCongress. Again, there were long gas lines, the cost of gasoline shot \nup, the enmity toward the Persian Gulf region nations, the double \nwhammy that interest rates soared upward of 15, 16 percent. All of that \nwas a real crunch on Americans. But the spigot was turned on again. The \noil flowed. The price receded a little bit--not nearly as much as it \nwas back in the early part of the decade of the 1970s--and America went \nback to sleep again.\n  All the time at each of these moments, the alarm was sounded that \nfrom a defense posture, the United States did not want to be dependent \non foreign oil. Yet each time dependence increased and the amount of \nforeign oil imported into the United States increased to the point that \ntoday we are importing 60 percent of our daily consumption of oil. \nWhere is it coming from? It is coming from places such as the Middle \nEast, the Persian Gulf, Nigeria, and Venezuela. I have mentioned four \nparts of the world that are relatively unstable. Yet this is what is \nsupplying us with 60 percent of our daily consumption of oil.\n  So we come to the moment of truth which may occur this afternoon, if \nan alternative amendment is offered to the miles per gallon required in \nthis Energy bill. The moment of truth is, is America ready to have the \npolitical will to change its gas-guzzling ways? We are talking about \nreasons of energy. We haven't even said anything about what the excess \ncarbon dioxide as a result of the burning fossil fuels is doing going \ninto the air, creating the greenhouse effect and heating up the Earth. \nThat is another complete story. But it is all as a result of this.\n  People say: Another part of this, we are going to talk about \nrenewable fuels for electric utilities. That is an important part too. \nBut when you look at where do we consume most of the oil, the petrol, \nit is in the sector of transportation. Within transportation, where is \nmost of the oil consumed? It is consumed in private vehicles. So we are \ncoming to the moment of truth. Are we going to finally require, without \nmany exceptions, the automobile industry to do what technology easily \nallows us to do--but not even do it tomorrow, phase it in over a 13-\nyear period to the year 2020, requiring that we have greater miles per \ngallon and, therefore, what does that mean? Less consumption of oil. \nThat means less dependence on foreign oil. This is where the greatest \nconsumption of oil is, our private vehicles. The moment of truth is \nhere.\n  There is clearly a defense reason we ought to explore as to why we \nought to do this as well. Can you imagine the different posture of the \nArmed Forces of the United States if we did not have to be the \nprotector, almost the sole protector, of the sealanes upon which the \ngreat supertankers of the world steam in order to satiate an oil-\nthirsty world? Thus, who do you think defends and protects the sealanes \ncoming out of the Persian Gulf, coming through one of those \nchokepoints, a military chokepoint called the Strait of Hormuz, 19 \nmiles wide, on one side Iran, on the other side of the 19 miles, Oman, \nthrough which narrow passage the supertankers of the world have to flow \nto get out into the Indian Ocean? Who protects that? The United States.\n  Wouldn't it be different from a defense posture with a Latin American \nPresident such as Hugo Chavez, who continues to thumb his nose at the \nUnited States because he can since he has petrol dollars, since he \nsupplies 12 to 14 percent of our daily consumption. And, by the way, \nhis company, which has been nationalized by the Government of \nVenezuela, the oil industry called PDVSA, did you know that they own \nall the Citgo stations in the United States? So his threat of cutting \noff is more hollow than real because he would be, to use the old \nexpression, ``cutting off his nose to spite his face''--if he were to \nsuddenly shut down the oil supply going into all of his gasoline \nstations around the United States. Nevertheless, he has made that \nthreat. In the process, with his oil wealth, because we do buy half of \nhis oil production, he can buy friends around the region. Happily, he \nhas not been totally successful. But he can buy friends and buy \ninfluence with his petrol dollars, either in the form of direct \nfinancial remuneration or in the form of oil and gasoline supplies to \noil- and gasoline-thirsty countries, such as the little countries in \nthe Caribbean, the little countries in Central America. That is another \nthing we are facing. The moment of truth has come.\n  I had an automobile dealer, one of the very best from my State of \nFlorida, sit with me yesterday and tell me the automobile industry \ncould not make this adjustment. But that is what the automobile \nindustry has been saying for the last 35 years, ever since we had that \nfirst major oil disruption in the early 1970s. In his particular case, \nhe has tried, within the industry, to get the industry to be willing to \nreform itself and use the technology we have to do much higher miles \nper gallon. I thanked him profusely and congratulated him on his \nefforts. But Mr. Automobile Industry, backed up by Mr. Oil Industry, \ndon't come tell me we don't\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\nhave the technical capability and the American people the capability of \nbuying automobiles that will take us from what is now, on the average, \nabout 22 miles per gallon on vehicles--they have a different standard; \nit is something like 27, but in reality it is only 22--don't tell me we \ndon't have the technology in 13 years to get us to 35 miles per gallon. \nI wish it were 40. But if we can get this, we are all the better off.\n  I wish to share one more thing, as we are coming to the moment of \ntruth.\n  Two weeks ago, during the break, I spent it going around on an \nintelligence mission in Africa, and it became quite apparent in one of \nthose countries, Nigeria--we get 12 to 14 percent of our daily supply \nand consumption of oil from that one country, Nigeria--it became very \napparent to me those facilities were defenseless.\n  At the same time, it was very apparent to me that al-Qaida is on the \nrise in Africa. They are coming out of Arabia, into the Horn of Africa, \nthere at Somalia, in all the midst of that chaos, and they are moving \nacross the Sahel and the Sahara of Africa. They have even changed some \nof the names of the terrorist groups there in Africa to be AQIM, al-\nQaida in the Islamic Maghreb. That is the group that just tried to \nassassinate the President of Algeria a couple months ago, and they got \nclose. They got a big truck bomb, suicide bomber, next to the \nPresidential palace. It killed a dozen people, but they did not get the \nPresident. But it is on the rise.\n  Guess what one of their targets is going to be. The oil facilities in \nNigeria. The only way we are going to stop that, since the Nigerian \nGovernment cannot protect them, is through the cooperative arrangement \nwe have with African nations' intelligence services cooperating with \nour intelligence services. That cooperation is going on and has saved \nsome of the terrorist strikes elsewhere in the world. That is the only \nway we are going to interdict--to find out ahead of time and stop it; \notherwise, it is going to happen. When that happens, right there, with \n14 percent of the daily supply suddenly cut off, we are going to rue \nthe day if, on this day, this moment of truth, we have not set \nourselves on a mandatory course of higher miles per gallon in order to \nforce less consumption of oil, particularly foreign oil.\n  That is the message. I do not see how any Senator can ignore this \nmessage. Yet we are scrambling for 60 votes to close off debate to get \nto the end of this bill because of that provision in it.\n  Senators, the moment of truth is coming, portending enormous \nconsequences for the future of our country and for the future of the \nfree world, and it is going to happen today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1800 To Amendment No. 1704\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1800 to amendment No. 1704.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To disallow the credit for renewable diesel for fuel that is \n                      coprocessed with petroleum)\n\n       On page 69, lines 17 to 20, strike ``to so much of the \n     renewable diesel produced at such facility and sold or used \n     during the taxable year in a qualified biodiesel mixture as \n     exceeds 60,000,000 gallons''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to ask the chairman of the committee, \nis it not correct that at this time there is agreement to have a \ndebate--40 minutes equally divided--on this particular amendment, and \nthe vote to be set at a later time, but we would try to conclude the \ndebate at this time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, that is my understanding, \nthat we will have 40 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on or in \nrelation to the amendment, and that vote may take place later in the \nafternoon.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to get back to the \noriginal intent with regard to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in \nrelation to a very specific, rather narrow provision, but an important \nprovision, that provided a $1 per gallon credit for renewable diesel. \nThe idea was to encourage the creation of new technologies for \nrenewable diesel. The idea was primarily to try to get products, such \nas cellulosic products, that could eventually be added to or be turned \ninto a fuel that could be burned as diesel fuel. As a result, that $1 \nper gallon credit was deemed an important way to create a new kind of \nproduct.\n  Well, as entrepreneurs will do, a couple of very bright people \nfigured out they could take an existing product, which is already \nused--namely, animal fat--and put that in with diesel fuel, in effect--\nI am simplifying the process--and, voila, it all burns the same, but it \nwould qualify as renewable diesel, biomass under the credit and, \ntherefore, they would get the $1 per gallon credit for doing something \nthat adds essentially nothing to the process and uses animal fat--\nprimarily, tallow--which is already used by the oleochemical industry, \nwhich is seeing the price skyrocket because of the interpretation these \noil companies have gotten IRS to agree to that they could actually use \nthis animal fat in their diesel and, therefore, get the credit for \nproducing a new kind of diesel.\n  That was never the intent. The intent was to find some new kinds of \nbiomass processes that could be converted to a diesel fuel and have it \nbe a renewable diesel fuel--something truly new--not to take existing \ndiesel and take an existing product that is already used by a very \ngreen industry.\n  By the way, the oleochemical industry is an industry that gets no \nsubsidy, and uses this animal fat--something that is good to dispose \nof--to make plastics, cleaning products, home cleaning products, some \nrubber kinds of products, and most especially soap. The basic \ningredient in soap is tallow. There is a finite market for that. The \nsoap people buy all the stuff that is on the market, but they found \nthat the cost has gone up 100 percent in the last 6 months because of \nthis interpretation that tallow could be bought up by, primarily, one \nbig oil company, Conoco oil company, which has figured out they can get \nthe advantage of this $1 per gallon subsidy.\n  That is wrong. It was never intended for that. If they want to go out \nand invent a new process with the big tax credit we have given them, \nthat is great, but not to use the tax credit to do something that can \nbe done anyway and which has the effect, the unintended consequence, of \nhurting an industry that employs at least 4,000 people. By the way, if \nthat industry is not able to buy the tallow--the animal fat that is \nbeing used here--then the only alternative is to produce things like \nsoap in foreign countries that have alternative supplies to what we \nhave in the United States.\n  So the unintended consequence of this is not just that somebody gets \nto take advantage of a $1 per gallon tax credit that is very generous--\nand not producing anything new--but they are also driving out of the \nUnited States an important industry which does use this waste animal \nfat, and uses its very productively, without any subsidy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the chief executive officer of the National Biodiesel \nBoard, who wrote to me on June 20.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Biodiesel Board,\n\n                                Jefferson City, MO, June 20, 2007.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: The National Biodiesel Board (NBB) \n     supports your efforts to promote sound energy policy by \n     ensuring that renewable diesel produced through petroleum co-\n     processing does not qualify for the $1.00 per gallon \n     renewable diesel excise tax credit.\n       In a time of budget deficits and rising fuel prices due in \n     large part to limited domestic refining capacity, the NBB \n     questions the wisdom of directing tax benefits and limited \n     feedstock to subsidize existing oil refining operations at \n     the expense of free-standing producers of biodiesel and \n     renewable diesel. Under your amendment, vegetable oils and \n     animal fats co-processed with petroleum would not qualify for \n     the $1.00 per gallon renewable diesel tax credit, but would \n     continue\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\n     to qualify for a 50 cents per gallon credit that is provided \n     under current law. The NBB believes that your amendment \n     represents balanced energy policy and is consistent with the \n     goals of the underlying legislation.\n       Again, the NBB thanks you for your efforts on this issue \n     and urges Senators to support passage of your amendment to \n     preclude petroleum co-processing from qualifying for the \n     $1.00 per gallon renewable diesel tax credit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Joe Jobe,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Here is what the letter says:\n\n       The National Biodiesel Board supports your efforts to \n     promote sound energy policy by ensuring that renewable diesel \n     produced through petroleum co-processing does not qualify for \n     the $1.00 per gallon renewable diesel excise tax credit.\n       In a time of budget deficits and rising fuel prices due in \n     large part to limited domestic refining capacity, the NBB \n     questions the wisdom of directing tax benefits and limited \n     feedstock--\n\n  That is the animal fat--\n\n     to subsidize existing oil refining operations at the expense \n     of free-standing producers of biodiesel and renewable diesel. \n     Under your amendment, vegetable oils and animal fats co-\n     processed with petroleum would not qualify for the $1.00 per \n     gallon renewable diesel tax credit, but would continue to \n     qualify for a 50 cents per gallon credit that is provided \n     under current law. The NBB believes that your amendment \n     represents balanced energy policy and is consistent with the \n     goals of the underlying legislation.\n\n  And so on.\n  We are not eliminating the tax credit. We are not eliminating this \nother credit. All we are doing is getting back to the original intent, \nwhich was not to provide this additional $1 per gallon credit for \nsomething that could be done anyway. We want you to go out and invent \nsomething new here using biomass for biodiesel, not using something \nthat can already be done.\n  According to the testimony of the company that is primarily going to \nbe doing this, this has not resulted in any major expenditure on their \npart. I will quote from ConocoPhillips' 2005 annual report. They have \n``conducted a successful test that converted vegetable oil into high-\nquality renewable diesel fuel . . . , and can be produced with existing \nrefinery equipment with minimal incremental capital investment.'' In \nother words, this is not something that requires some new investment \nthat requires the American taxpayers to subsidize it.\n  As I said, they are taking something they can do right now, and they \nare simply taking advantage of a tax break we did not intend to be used \nby a company like that.\n  Now, in anticipation of this boondoggle--and it has gotten quite a \nbit of press--there has been a suggestion: Well, we can limit it to \ntaxpayers with 60 million gallons of production. The problem is, in the \nFinance Committee mark that was changed from ``taxpayer'' to \n``facility.'' So now a company can have 20 different facilities, each \none producing 60 million gallons, and they are right back in business. \nIt is no limitation at all.\n  So my colleagues should not be hornswoggled--to use the old phrase my \ngrandfather used to use--that somehow there is some kind of limitation \non this. Very cleverly, the Conoco folks were able to get in this \nlegislation that it applies per facility; and by having multiple \nfacilities, there is, in effect, no limitation.\n  Mr. President, I will be happy to give those who want to speak in \nopposition to this amendment an opportunity to try to refute what I \nhave said, but I think this is very straightforward. There is no sense \nin rewarding what I would consider to be behavior that was never \nintended by this Congress in providing this kind of a tax credit.\n  When we are going to take a tax benefit--in effect, using taxpayer \ndollars--to promote something, we want to make sure we are promoting \nsomething that is in the best interest of the American taxpayer, not \njust a way for somebody who knows how to make a buck to use it to make \na buck, especially if it has a negative consequence on an existing \nindustry, the oleochemical industry, and, in particular, the soap \nmakers of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  Yesterday, the Finance Committee passed the Energy Advancement and \nInvestment Act. That measure passed by a vote of 15 to 5. That is a \nvery broad-based, bipartisan majority for the Finance Committee \namendment that is now pending on this energy bill.\n  It is a major amendment. The committee spent a lot of time trying to \nfigure out the best way for America to turn the corner, for the United \nStates to begin to wean ourselves away from OPEC, to wean ourselves \naway from our reliance upon foreign oil, to try to enhance our national \nsecurity, make the United States a little more able to determine its \nown destiny with respect to energy.\n  In doing so, we therefore also created lots of incentives for \nAmerican production of renewables, for renewable energy, conservation, \nhybrid automobiles, hybrid plug-ins, cellulosic ethanol--a whole \nmultitude of ways to help America become much more self-sufficient and, \nhopefully, therefore, be able to get our gasoline prices down a little \nbit because at the current time we very much are in the throes of big \noil's control as to what they charge at the gas pump. This is a very \nthoughtful amendment. We spent a lot of time trying to put all this \ntogether.\n  The Finance Committee amendment includes a compromise on the topic of \nSenator Kyl's amendment; that is, renewable diesel. There are a lot of \noffsetting interests here, to be honest about it, from different parts \nof the country. Some are more concerned about biodiesel produced from \nproducts such as soybeans; others are much more concerned about \nrenewable diesel produced by other products that could be organic \nproducts. In trying to get that balance put together, the goal is the \nsame, which is to displace foreign oil.\n  I hope, therefore, that the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona is not agreed to because the effect of it will be not to \ndisplace a good bit of foreign oil, which is contrary to the main point \nof the underlying legislation.\n  Under current law, there is a $1-a-gallon credit for renewable \ndiesel, including that produced with animal fats. There is also a $1-\nper-gallon credit for biodiesel, which is made from soybeans and other \nseeds. The committee amendment extends both of these credits for 2 \nyears, until 2010; otherwise, they will expire at the end of next year.\n  The Senator from Arizona appears to be concerned that renewable \ndiesel coprocessors--such as Conoco, for example--will increase the \ncost of consumer goods. He thinks consumer goods are going to go up as \na consequence of our assistance for renewable diesel. He argues that \nthe price of animal fats to be used in making renewable diesel, which \nare also used in making soap, will drive up the cost of those consumer \ngoods.\n  I might say that fancy term ``coprocessors'' includes companies such \nas ConocoPhillips, which will use some of its existing infrastructure \nto produce renewable diesel. That is true.\n  The Senator from Arizona also appears to be concerned about the size \nof the subsidy--$1 per gallon--for this fuel. I might say that this was \na question which members of the committee were concerned with. There \nare those who thought that biodiesel would be in competition with \nrenewable diesel, so we worked to find a way to work together to reach \na balance. This is a compromise we worked out: the dollar credit for \neach, but in addition, the committee capped the tax credit for \nrenewable diesel coprocessors at 60 million gallons per facility. We \nput a cap on it. Another way to say it is that once that cap is \nreached, then the $1-per-gallon credit will no longer be available. We \nhave a limit. We are cognizant of the points made by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  We also commissioned a study on the effects of energy tax incentives \non consumer goods. The 60-million limitation is the same as the \ndefinition used for a small producer of biodiesel or ethanol. Now, is \n60 million a magic number? No. But it is a standard used in current \nlaw. That is why we took it. It is not something pulled out of thin \nair. One might ask: Should the $1 subsidy remain current law for good? \nMy answer is, probably not. This is a bold step in the sense that we \nare trying to push-start and help kick-start renewables and alternative \nenergies. We don't know if these incentives are exactly\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\nright. They are probably not exactly right, but they are the best we \ncould come up with at this time, and we think that probably they will \nwork pretty well, but we will have to come back and revisit them. Some \nare not going to work very well, some will be increased and some will \nbe decreased.\n  I say all that because the committee amendment before us extends this \n$1 for each--that is, for biodiesel and renewable--for just 2 more \nyears. It is not a 5-year or a 10-year extension. It is not a permanent \nprovision. It is just for 2 years. It will sunset in 2 years. That is \ncontrary to most of the recommendations we have been getting from \nindustry across the board; namely, they like 5-year incentives toward \ncapital needs. A couple years, 3 years; 1 year is not enough, 2 years \nis not enough. We extended most of these credits on renewables and \nalternatives for 5 years. Section 485, which is renewable credits, is \nextended for 5 years, but we limited this to just 2 years as an \nextension because we are not as confident that is what the exact \nprovision should be.\n  So I hope this amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona is not \nagreed to. The underlying Finance Committee amendment, which is \npending, we thought it through the best we could. We think it is \nbalanced. We think it is fair. Therefore, we hope it is sustained. Let \nme restate that every gallon of renewable diesel produced is a gallon \nof foreign oil displaced, which I think is pretty important.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my good friend from Arizona, but I think \nby and large they are not well placed.\n  I understand there are a couple of others who wish to speak on our \nside. How many minutes would the Senator from Iowa like to speak? For 5 \nminutes. Senator Lincoln, about the same.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to each Senator who \nwants to speak, and I first yield to the Senator from Iowa, my good \nfriend, Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I am \nglad to come to the floor to speak about renewables. I am going to \nspeak against the Kyl amendment.\n  I think we ought to put things in perspective. For two decades, maybe \nlonger than that, this country has been seeking various approaches to \nalternative energy so that we are not dependent upon foreign sources \nand, more recently, violent and unpredictable sources of energy for the \nUnited States for reasons of national security, for reasons of our \neconomy. There are a lot of good reasons we shouldn't be so dependent \nupon fossil fuels and foreign sources of energy. So we have had two or \nthree decades, starting out with ethanol and now going into other \nthings such as biodiesel, wind, Sun, and things of that nature.\n  Now we are finding that the things this country was so united on, \nsuch as the need for renewables, the need for helping agriculture, the \nneed for lowering our trade deficit, the needs of national security, \nthe needs of a cleaner environment--everybody was united that we ought \nto be doing it, and now we are being somewhat successful. It used to be \nwe would have to listen to all of the excuses of big oil, fight big \noil, why we shouldn't have renewables. Now we are finding out about the \nhigh price of food, the high price of animal feed, just as if all of \nthe problems of our country are on the backs of the American farmers, \nwhich is very unfair. Now we are finding some dissension from other \nindustries being affected. We are still in the infancy of these \nindustries, whether it is ethanol after a couple of decades or whether \nit is biodiesel after 3 or 4 years. We are in a state of infancy yet in \nrenewables.\n  We ought to be as united today as we were over the past two decades \non what is right for this country, good for agriculture, good for the \nenvironment, good for our national defense, good for good-paying jobs \nin parts of rural America where it has never been before. Everything \nabout it is good, good, good. We better stick together because \notherwise we will continue to be dependent upon those violent regions \nof the world for energy; we are going to be dependent on something God \nmade a finite quantity of, such as fossil fuels. We need to move \nforward, united. This is the second amendment today and, who knows, we \nmay have 10 other amendments which are very detrimental to the causes \nof getting this infant industry of renewables off the ground.\n  Having said that as a backdrop, I wish to speak specifically about \nwhat is wrong with the amendment that is before us. I can't replace the \ngood things--or I can only add to the good things which the Senator \nfrom Montana has already spoken to. But there is no cap on any \nbiodiesel production. They may go forth and produce and meet their \nspecific chemical standards. They have the right to produce as many \ngallons of biodiesel as they like, and it will be qualified for the \nexcise tax credit through the end of 2010. Now, people will argue that \nit ought to be longer, but you have to fit things into what we have \noffsets for, so it is the year of 2010. If they are a small producer, \nthey will be able to receive the credit until December 2012. If you are \na noncoprocessing facility and do 100 percent biomass, not including \nchemicals, catalysts, and the like, they have the same rules as \nbiodiesel. If you coprocess at a facility, your total credit is limited \nto 60 million gallons. If you claim a renewable diesel credit, the 60 \nmillion gallons is the current definition of a small producer. So a \ncoprocessor facility will not be able to receive any more tax benefits \nthan the small producer. For example, if you have a 100-million-gallon \nfacility that you are concerned about, they have a built-in $40 million \nadvantage over any coprocessing facility. Obviously, a barrel of \nvegetable oil or animal oil is substantially more expensive than a \nbarrel of crude oil, and the credit by law is limited to only the \nvolumetric amount of the biomass.\n  I hope this makes it clear that we should not support the amendment \nof the Senator from Arizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, may I be informed as to how much time remains \non this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes for the Senator from Arizona \nand 6\\1/2\\ minutes for the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I take a little bit of time, then, before the other \nside speaks again on this issue?\n  I respect my colleagues who have spoken, but I have not really heard \nan argument that, to me, anyway, argues against the specific amendment \nI am offering. Remember, I am not doing away with the credit. The \narguments that have been raised here make it sound as if we are trying \nto do away with the credit. That is absolutely not true. The credit \nremains. What we are trying to do is essentially reverse an IRS ruling, \nwhich I submit was made in error, with respect to the application of \nthe tax credit. They said you could actually apply it to a process to \nwhich it was never intended to be applied.\n  A letter to the Secretary of Treasury at the time this legislation \nwas originally considered makes that crystal clear.\n  Congressman Blunt wrote:\n\n       It has been brought to my attention that some taxpayers are \n     suggesting to the Department of Treasury that section 1346 of \n     the Act, the renewable diesel provision, could be broadly \n     interpreted to include traditional processes. This is not \n     what we intended in the provision, and neither the statute \n     nor the associated JCT estimate of revenue implications in \n     any way support such a reading.\n\n  What he is saying is this: Two years ago when this tax credit was \ncreated, it was designed to incentivize the creation of a new product \nso that we didn't have to continue to explore for oil or export it from \nforeign sources; we could begin to make renewable diesel out of \nbiomass. That was the idea. We have all of this waste product of \nbiomass. We have cellulosic products we can create here, and that will \ncreate a new renewable fuel source.\n  Everybody said: That is a great idea. To get it promoted, let's have \na dollar-per-gallon tax credit for the production of that. It was not \nintended to apply, as the Congressman from Missouri pointed out, to \ninclude traditional processes for refining and producing fuel. In other \nwords, it was designed to promote something new.\n  So when these folks found that they could take animal fat, \nessentially, to greatly simplify it, and add it to their\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\nexisting stocks, voila: a biomass renewable fuel that qualified for a \ngenerous tax benefit, that was never intended. All my amendment does is \nto say that interpretation is not correct; you can't do that. The \nunderlying dollar-per-gallon credit exists. The other 50-cent-per-\ngallon credit exists. We don't take away any of that. All we do--and \nthe primary person or company that is affected by this, I acknowledge, \nis Conoco Oil Company. They have figured out, with minimal new \ninvestment, as they themselves wrote in their annual report, that they \ncould take advantage of this tax credit by using the animal fat.\n  Now, again, I suppose it wouldn't matter that much if a big oil \ncompany is taking undue advantage of a tax credit we create. That is \nprobably done all the time. I don't like it. That is why taxpayers are, \nfrankly, sometimes upset with Congress that we pass these great, \ngenerous subsidies and sometimes they are utilized by people who \nshouldn't be utilizing them, not to create a new kind of diesel fuel in \nthis case but to keep using the same old diesel fuel.\n\n  The other unintended consequence, though, is one that affects another \nindustry, a clean industry, an industry that is using the waste fat, \nthe vegetable oil and animal fat, the waste product of turkeys and \nchickens, for example. It is utilized today in a variety of these oleo \nchemical products which are products we use every day--house-cleaning \nproducts, soap, as I said.\n  The problem is that because these existing refineries are buying up \nthese waste products, they are driving up the cost. There is only so \nmuch of this animal fat around. It is a finite amount. When the demand \nis increased by having these oil refineries buy it all up so they can \nput it into their diesel fuel so they can get an extra credit, that is \ndriving up the price which, as I said, has gone up 100 percent in the \nlast 6 months.\n  If that continues, these soap companies are not going to be able to \nafford the primary feedstock for the soap, and they are going to have \nto produce it abroad, another great unintended consequence of what \nstarted out to be a good idea but didn't turn out to be such a hot \nidea.\n  This is a very parochial issue. I submit, except for the chairman and \nranking member of the committee, primarily the opponents of this are \nfrom places that take advantage of this provision. I cannot object to \ntheir fighting for their local industries, but I think it is important \nfor us to recognize that as a national energy policy and as a national \ntax policy, we have to look at it in nationwide terms. When we have \ncreated a credit to produce something new, and it ends up not being \nused to produce something new but to produce something that currently \nexists by existing refineries and uses up the feedstock of another \nimportant industry, driving the cost of that industry way up, we better \npay attention to that. The fix doesn't hurt anybody, except primarily, \nas I said, this one big oil company because it leaves the credit in \nplace, it leaves the 50-cent credit in place. It doesn't do anything \nwith those credits. It doesn't say they are not extended. All it does \nis say we go back to the way it was prior to this IRS ruling that said \nthey could take advantage of this provision for the existing refiners.\n  I will conclude. We don't need to subsidize existing oil-refining \noperations at the expense of freestanding producers of biodiesel and \nrenewable diesel. That is who this tax credit was designed to help, the \nfreestanding facilities, the ones that were actually producing \nsomething new.\n  A key component of rising fuel prices in this country is a lack of \nrefining capacity in the United States. We all know that. Freestanding \nbiodiesel and renewable diesel producers have both fuel and refining \ncapacity. We ought to be encouraging them, and that is what the $1-per-\ngallon credit was designed to do.\n  By contrast, coprocessed renewable diesel adds no new net fuel and no \nnew refining capacity to the diesel pool. This was not intended to help \nthe existing refiners. They are already in business, they are already \nmaking money, and we don't need to give them $1-a-gallon credit for \ndoing something we don't need to have them do.\n  Finally, as I said, the availability of feedstock, such as animal fat \nand vegetable oils, is essentially fixed, and this $1 renewable diesel \ncredit is the motivation for integrating the oil companies to engage in \ncoprocessing. This will clearly increase demand for the feedstock \nneeded to produce biodiesel and increase costs. It is not wise tax \npolicy to drive tax policies and limited feedstock to support existing \nrefinery operations at the expense of biodiesel and freestanding \nrenewable diesel production.\n  The economic benefits associated with freestanding biodiesel \nproduction could be lost if this $1-per-gallon renewable tax incentive \nis directed to support operations in existing oil refineries.\n  I ask my colleagues to please keep this in perspective and take into \naccount that those who say this amendment is bringing the end of the \nworld, no, it is not. It doesn't change existing law at all. All it \ndoes is say to go back to the original intent and apply this very \ngenerous tax credit for the purpose we originally intended: to produce \nsomething new, not to use existing refineries and give them a tax \ncredit for doing something they are already doing.\n  I hope when the amendment is called that my colleagues will see \nthrough some of the smokescreen that has been presented, not in the \nChamber but on the outside with regard to this amendment, and will \nagree that national policy dictates that we take care of taxpayers' \ndollars carefully, that we set our energy policy carefully, and that we \nnot let people take undue advantage of it in ways we did not intend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Arizona, before \nthe debate proceeds, we now have agreements with Senator Inhofe for two \nvotes. One is a vote in relation to amendment No. 1693 and then a vote \nin relation to amendment No. 1666. I was wondering if the Senator will \nagree that following the debate on those two amendments, which will \ntake an hour, if the Senator will be able to return to that point and \ndebate his second amendment and then we can have a stack of four votes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be happy to do this on my time because \nI am going to yield back my time on this amendment in any event. I am \nhappy to have the vote on this amendment stacked with the Inhofe \namendment at whatever time that will occur.\n  With regard to the second amendment, which I am going to propose, I \nam not at liberty to do that right now because there are numerous \npeople who wish to speak. I assure the chairman that as soon as I have \nthat list and know how much time it is, I will let him know that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the response.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I start first by thanking both the \nchairman and ranking member and their staff for some incredibly hard \nwork to get this legislation ready to come to the floor. It was \nabsolutely no small feat, but it is so very important that we bring \nthis portion of our objective in leading our Nation away from \ndependence on foreign oil and back to our ability to provide for \nourselves.\n  This energy tax package that Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley \nhave brought together is remarkable--remarkable in its balance, it is \nremarkable in the engine it provides to drive the incentives industry \nneeds to move us toward renewable fuels.\n  I wish to say how much I appreciate their effort. Throughout the \nhistory of our Nation, we have faced great technological challenges \nthat we have confronted and overcome. We didn't put a man on the Moon \nby talking about how important it was. We developed a plan, and we \ncommitted the resources necessary to achieve that plan. We are at that \njuncture now in this country in regard to renewable fuels and our \ndependence on foreign oil. I applaud their efforts in what they have \ndone and accomplished.\n  I also wish to point out, in terms of what the Senator from Arizona \nhas\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\nbrought up, he mentioned this is not a new product. I venture to say \nhow many people have heard of diesel made from animal fat, particularly \nchicken fat? This is a new product. It is a product that produces a \nrenewable diesel that is very clean burning and very positive for our \nenvironment and the overall objective of what we are trying to reach in \nthis underlying bill and that is reducing our CO2 emissions, \nreducing what is going into the environment, and reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  The Senator from Arizona mentions the original intent. The original \nintent was to promote renewable diesel. In fact, the renewable diesel \ncredit is drafted as technology neutral, regardless of the state of the \nart or process at the time of enactment. The EPAct statute simply \nprovides that renewable diesel fuel, in order to qualify for the \ncredit, must be produced using a thermal depolymerization process. We \nhave the history on that process. We know what the intent and the \npurpose of EPAct was and is, and we meet that intent. We meet that \nintent with the encouragement of making sure we are looking at all the \nrenewable feedstocks in this country to put into the mix to lessen our \ndependence on petroleum products and to create variety in what it is we \ngo to.\n  I know there are some in this body on both sides who think maybe this \nis an opportunity to get even with big oil. That is not the intent of \nthis bill, and I hope we would not stray to that. I hope we would not \nstray to the idea that we are here to get even with big oil but that we \nare here to encourage those in the oil industry to move into renewable \nfuels, to move into the opportunities that exist in technology, to push \nthem into an area where renewables make sense.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment does not solve the problem he raises \nregarding the increase in the price of fat. The credit that Senator Kyl \nseeks to strike is for a process that is in the very early stages of \nproduction. This process has not even been produced in terms of barrels \nof fuel in this country. So it is difficult to see how it could have \nhad the profound effect on the prices that Senator Kyl claims it has.\n  The fact is, the price of fat has been driven up in part due to its \nuse in the production of biodiesel. Senator Kyl said in our hearing \nyesterday that if he could, he would try to remove all credits he \nbelieves might distort existing markets.\n  If we think we are going to move ourselves as a nation and as a \npeople, with the culture and the amenities to which we have become \naccustomed, to a society that depends on renewable fuels without making \nat least some minor changes in the marketplaces of our existing \nfeedstocks, we might as well pack it up and go home right now.\n  If we are going to eliminate all the credits and all the \nopportunities that exist to go to renewable fuels, and we are going to \neliminate them because of some blip they may cause momentarily before \nwe begin to move into the decade where we can balance our needs for \nrenewable feeds with other items, we might as well go home because that \nis going to happen.\n  What we have done is crafted in this bill a very sensible solution. \nSenator Kyl mentions the stand-alone renewable diesel facilities need \nto be protected, they need to be maintained. They are. They have no cap \nwhatsoever in this bill, just as there is no cap on biodiesel. But \nwhere we have facilities that are taking the steps in the right \ndirection to coproduce, they are going to get a credit. They are going \nto get a credit up to the amount where they meet what the small \nproducers are doing, a 60-million-gallon-per-facility cap. It is very \nreasonable, and it certainly speaks to the efforts of what we are \ntrying to do in this underlying bill.\n  Today's amendment may only affect renewable diesel, but it is \nentirely possible that next year the target will be biodiesel or \nethanol or cellulosic ethanol, if what he wants to do is eliminate \ncredits that protect those underlying feedstocks.\n  While it may be good intention for something that is parochial for \nthe Senator from Arizona, I say let us all remember what the ultimate \nobjective of this bill is: to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, \nclean our environment, and make sure that we are moving to renewables. \nThat is exactly what the underlying bill does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has no time \nremaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I see no Senators on either side, so I \nwill propound a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander be recognized for 10 \nminutes, to be followed by 10 minutes for Senator Klobuchar, and \nfollowing that, the pending amendments be set aside so I may offer \namendment No. 1693 and that Senator Inhofe can then offer his first-\ndegree amendment No. 1666; that the two amendments be debated \nconcurrently for 1 hour, to be equally divided between Senator Inhofe \nand myself; that at the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate \nvote in relation to amendment No. 1693, to be followed by 2 minutes for \ndebate and a vote in relation to amendment No. 1666; that no amendments \nbe in order to either amendment prior to the votes in relation to the \namendments; and that upon the disposition of the Inhofe amendment, the \nSenate vote in relation to the Kyl amendment No. 1800, with 2 minutes \nof debate prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objections. We have worked together to \narrive at this schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for the courtesy \nof the next 10 minutes, and I would ask the Chair to let me know when 1 \nminute remains.\n  Mr. President, I compliment both Senators from New Mexico for their \nwork on energy. As they did 2 years ago, they have made some important \nproposals. The 2005 bill was a terrific step forward, and there are \nsome important suggestions in this bill. I want to especially say a few \nwords about the tax part of the bill that came out today, and I will \nhave more to say about that tomorrow and amendments to offer.\n  It is probably not the first time it has been said of the Senate that \nthere is too much wind here, but I would like to suggest there is too \nmuch of that in the tax bill that has been reported to the Senate. Here \nis the tax bill. As I read the figures: $28.5 billion more over the \nnext 10 years, $10 billion of it for wind. Almost all of it is for \nsubsidies to wind developers. 34 percent of the bill's total goes \ntoward this tax credit.\n  This isn't the first time the Senate has been generous to wind. In \nthe 2005 bill it was 19 percent. Why would I say that is a little too \nmuch wind? It is because in many parts of the country the wind doesn't \nblow sufficiently for us to rely on it for electricity.\n  We have had some debate about Senator Bingaman's proposal, which \nmight work very well in New Mexico or some other States to say that 15 \npercent of the electricity ought to be from renewable energy, mostly \nwind under this definition.\n  This map of the United States shows that much of the wind in the \nSoutheast and Eastern United States doesn't blow enough for that to \nhappen there. So under that proposal, the one we were debating earlier, \ncalled the renewable portfolio standard, I am afraid Tennesseans would \nhave to pay basically a tax of 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, which would \nbe $410 million a year.\n  We have one wind farm in the entire Southeast, and it is in Tennessee \non Buffalo Mountain. Last August, while we were all sweating and \nperspiring with our fans on the front porch, the wind farm operated for \n7 percent of the time. Most of us want our air conditioners when it's \nhot--not just when the wind blows enough to make electricity.\n  We are not the only ones who are beginning to see the limits of wind. \nYesterday, the President of Pacific Gas and Electric in California, \nwhich likes wind power and is using wind power, said, according to \nCalifornia Energy Markets, that they will not make substantial new \ninvestments in wind generation, and ``we think we are approaching in \nCalifornia itself the limit on wind.''\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\n  So why then if we are going to spend $28 billion for energy \nsufficiency--that would mean reliable, clean electricity for the \ncountry in the world that uses 25 percent of all the energy in the \nworld--why then would we develop a national wind turbine policy instead \nof a national energy policy? Isn't $10 billion more--which would make \nour total investment over the next 10 years more than $2 billion a year \nfor wind turbines--isn't that too much wind?\n  I am not even talking so much about the fact of what these look like. \nI think I have said many times on this floor that in Tennessee I don't \nlike the fact that these only work, when they work, on our most scenic \nridgetops. We would prefer not to have them. That is not the case with \neverybody, I understand that. But it is important for people to know \nthese aren't your grandmother's windmills.\n  These are twice as tall as the sky boxes at the football stadium, and \nthe rotor blades go from the 10-yard line to the 10-yard line. So there \nare limits as to where they should go.\n  Across the country, even when performing well, they only work a third \nof the time. They often blow at the wrong time--at night, when people \nare asleep and not using so much electricity. And you can't store the \nwind. Basically, a utility makes a big investment, paying somebody $20 \nmillion--in the TVA Buffalo Mountain case $60 million for 20 years--to \nbuy wind, whenever it comes, and if it comes at night when the lights \nare off, tough, they just lose it. If it comes 7 percent of the time in \nAugust, when everybody's air conditioners are up, it doesn't help very \nmuch. Of course, even if you had it, you still need nuclear or coal or \nsomething else because most people want their computers and their \nelectricity on when they want them on.\n  As I mentioned, it is very difficult to store. It only uses about 1 \npercent of our current electricity needs. It does little to clean the \nair because we already have caps on sulfur and nitrogen, which I would \nlike to accelerate, and it means lots of new power lines. So we have a \n400-percent increase in wind capacity that would produce no change in \nemissions of nitrogen, no change in sulfur, and very little in carbon.\n  My point is, I believe there are better ways to spend that $10 \nbillion of the $28 billion we propose to spend over the next 10 years, \nbetter ways to spend one-third of all this money than on a national \nwind policy, since it doesn't work very well, it is not very reliable, \nand much of the country can't use it at all.\n  For example, take fluorescent lighting. I know Senators Bingaman and \nDomenici have talked about this, but if we spent $2 billion a year just \nin tax credits for fluorescent lighting, we could save enough energy to \nequal eight 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactors, or 18,000 1.8-megawatt \nwind turbines.\n  Let's take another idea. What if we took the $2 billion a year and \ngave a credit for appliances, such as dishwashers, washing machines, \nand refrigerators. There is such a credit in the tax bill, and that is \ngood. It costs about $100 million a year to encourage that. Why don't \nwe extend that to 10 years? That would be $1 billion of the $10 billion \nwe are spending on wind. It would save more electricity than we would \nget building wind.\n  We talk about not just carbon but clean air. I know Vermont wants \nclean air. We want clean air in the mountains in Tennessee. For $2 \nbillion a year we could buy six new scrubbers a year at $300 million a \nscrubber. A scrubber takes the sulfur out of the air that contributes \nto the unhealthy aspects and to the soot and to the smog that is \nunhealthy for people and interferes with our view of the mountains.\n\n  Or take utility bills. The average utility bill for Tennesseans is \n$100 a month. This is $2 billion a year. We could just give the money \nto Tennesseans, 1.7 million households, for a full year. One month's \nelectric bill for 20 million households, that is what we could do for \n$2 billion.\n  If we were a little more creative, we might go to the metering that \nsome utilities are now putting in homes and say: If your electric bill \nis $100, and you reduce your use of electricity by $20, we will match \nit by $20 and we will collect all that information in the utility. And \nas a result, you will get a $60 bill instead of a $100 bill each \nmonth--instead of investing in more wind.\n  Or you could use that money for clean coal power plants. The 2005 \nbill that Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici worked on had a number \nof initiatives for nuclear, clean coal, IGCC, and a number of things \nthat are underfunded. We don't have enough money for them. Well, if we \ndon't have the money for those things--which we decided by consensus in \n2005 was the best way to create clean reliable electricity for a \ncountry that uses 25 percent of all the energy in the world--if we \ndidn't have the money in 2005, why don't we take this $28 billion over \nthe next 10 years, or at least some of this $10 billion for wind, and \nput it in clean coal or these other areas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute remains.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wanted the Senate to know that of the $28 billion, \none-third of it goes to wind turbines. We have a national wind policy \ninstead of a national energy policy.\n  We will be spending $2 billion a year on wind subsidies. And there \nare many other wind subsidies in the Federal Government. You get bonds \nto build them, you get accelerated depreciation, and then there are the \nState subsidies. So I am suggesting there is too much wind, and a wiser \nuse of at least half that $10 billion would be for conservation, \nefficiency, scrubbers, and other forms of energy that are reflected in \nthe 2005 Energy bill.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senator from New Mexico for the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate grant \nme 1 minute at this point to make a statement and ask the Senator a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, first of all, I listened. Some people might \nsay the Senator from New Mexico shouldn't listen again because I have \nlistened now at least twice to you on this subject matter.\n  To tell you the truth, your analysis of the situation becomes more \nrelevant every single month that passes in the Congress because today \nwe are about to decide what to do with $30 billion, more or less; that \nwe are going to levy a tax; and you have come before us and told us \nwhat you might do.\n  I might say, as chairman of the Energy Committee, I don't serve on \nthe Finance Committee. That is the breaks of the way things are done in \nthe Senate. I am not complaining, but I can guarantee you and the \nSenate that I, as one Senator, and as chairman of the Energy Committee \na year and a half ago--not now--I would never have voted to put that \nmuch money in wind and so little in other technologies and breakthrough \nscience items.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a statement from the Joint Tax Committee which does an \nestimate of the amount of the new tax package that would go to wind.\n  The estimate for a 5-year extension of section 45 credit is $10,292 \nmillion, and the amount attributed to wind is $7,846, in their \nestimation. The rest would be used for biomass and geothermal and other \nenergy sources.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1557\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here once again to address my \namendment for a national greenhouse gas registry. As you know, this is \nan amendment that I am cosponsoring with Senator Snowe and two other \nRepublicans, as well as Senator Bingaman.\n  This is an idea whose time has come. This is an amendment that \ndoesn't actually say what the policy will be with regard to greenhouse \ngases. It simply requires that on a national basis we collect accurate \ninformation so we can make smart policy decisions.\n  I am sorry to say the other side has not yet agreed to vote on this \namendment. It is looking a little bleak as time ticks on, but I am \nstill here. It puzzles me because the senior Senator from Oklahoma, in \na trade magazine--Environment and Energy Daily--was recently quoted in \na short interview, after repeatedly calling global warming a hoax, as \nsaying that he predicted this measure, this bill, would probably be \nadopted, if offered. And I think that may be accurate.\n  We know a number of Republicans are interested in this bill. We have \nworked very hard and we think it is important. That is why it is very \ndistressing to me that we are not even going to be allowed to have a \nvote on this.\n  It is distressing because one of the reasons Senator Snowe and I came \nup with this amendment is because we did hear what we considered \nsomething of an outcry from businesses across this country. As you \nknow, 31 States have come up with plans involving greenhouse gas \nemissions and climate change, and they are actually starting their own \nregistry out of complete and utter frustration with the Federal \nGovernment. It is absurd to think a majority of States is having to put \ntogether a greenhouse gas registry because our national Government is \nso complacent. Back in January we had a number of these companies that \ngathered together and came to us and said we want action on climate \nchange. We want to get this registry going. We want to have it done by \nthe end of the year.\n  I have been here long enough to know we are not going to get it done \nby the end of the year unless we vote on it now.\n  I want to mention some of the companies that expressed interest in \nthis: Alcan Inc., Alcoa, American International Group, Inc.--that is \nAIG, Boston Scientific Corporation, BP America Inc., Caterpillar Inc., \nConocoPhillips, Deere & Company, the Dow Chemical Company, Duke Energy, \nDuPont, Environmental Defense, FPL Group, Inc., General Electric, \nGeneral Motors Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Marsh, Inc. PepsiCo, Pew \nCenter on Global Climate Change, PG Corporation, PNM Resources, \nShell, Siemens Corporation. They all said they wanted us to get \nsomething done on climate change.\n  You can imagine my surprise when we found out that in fact the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce opposed this bill. They never talked to me about \nit; they just sent out a letter. In fact, they threatened this could be \none of the key votes for the chamber this year, depending on how people \nvoted on this little bill that simply asks that accurate data be \ncollected and be able to be posted on a Web site as they do in Canada \nand other places. But they said it might be a key vote, right up there \nwith the estate tax last year and some of the other votes that were \nnational issues.\n  There have been a lot of things said about this bill. The senior \nSenator from Oklahoma actually sent out a letter about it. He talked \nabout how it would apply to virtually every business in America in this \nletter.\n  The simple truth is we wrote this amendment with business in mind \nbecause we had the impression, from what we had heard, that business \nwants to work with us on this important issue of climate change. The \namendment contains explicit provisions excluding companies for which \nreporting was excessively burdensome or expensive. The new registry \nonly covers major emitting facilities and major sources of fossil \nfuels. Utilities already reporting under the Clean Air Act would not \nhave to report their data twice.\n  For facilities facing costs and purchasing advanced monitoring \nequipment, the EPA would accept basic information on the amount and \ntype of fossil fuels they consume, which is collected by businesses for \ngeneral accounting purposes. Section 165(b)(10)(c) of my amendment \nspecifies that confidential business information will not be published \nunder the National Greenhouse Gas Registry.\n  The legislation also has an exception for small businesses, the \nexception as defined by the Small Business Administration--businesses \nthat generate fewer than 10,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas \nemissions. And 10,000 metric tons is not an arbitrary number. The \nAmerican Chemical Society released a report in 2003 which talked about \nthis as a threshold, 10,000 metric tons, a threshold which\n\n     . . . effectively relieves the agriculture and commercial \n     building sectors from reporting, substantially reduces the \n     number of manufacturing facilities that would report while \n     continuing to capture 80 percent of emissions.\n\n  Clearly this is not true.\n  We also know the current status. We have some businesses, major \nemitters, reporting to the Department of Energy. Some report to the \nEPA. Some report every 3 years. Some report every week. Some report \nevery year. This is not the kind of information we expect to have in \norder to make policy decisions on climate change.\n  In his letter, the senior Senator from Oklahoma also said \norganizations such as the Sierra Club or the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil would be put in charge of third-party verification and have \naccess to confidential business information. This is so inaccurate I do \nnot even know where to begin. Under my amendment, the EPA Administrator \nmay ensure that reports are certified by a third-party entity, but as \nwith the California Climate Registry, third-party verifiers will have \nto be verified themselves as experienced firms in providing greenhouse \ngas emission certifications. These are engineering firms; they are not \npolitical interest groups.\n  Finally, they claim this amendment did not go through the committee \nprocess. That interests me because a little over 5 years ago, Senator \nBrownback, the Republican Senator, along with then-Senator Corzine of \nNew Jersey, passed an amendment in this Chamber creating a greenhouse \ngas registry. This registry would have been voluntary, but after 5 \nyears, if the registry contained less than 60 percent of the total \ngreenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.--that is clearly where it is now--\nmandatory reporting would have been triggered. Sadly, the bill didn't \nget ultimately through this Congress. But the point is, this Chamber \nhas already voted on this.\n\n  Here is a simple truth. This amendment seeks to create common \nstandards for measuring, tracking, verifying, and reporting greenhouse \ngas emissions by major industries. It requires the Environmental \nProtection Agency--not exactly an engine of radical reform at this \nmoment--to consider cost and coordinate with existing Federal and\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\nState programs to implement this registry.\n  This is an opportunity that the Senate should be willing to put its \nhead up and vote for. It is an opportunity to at least get the accurate \ndata so we can start talking about climate change reform.\n  I never knew I would end up here in the Senate. I grew up in a \nmiddle-class family. My grandpa was a miner and a logger. My dad was a \njournalist. My mom was an elementary schoolteacher. I worked jobs all \nmy life--as a pie cutter. I worked as a car hop. I worked as a \nsecretary. I went to public high school. I got a law degree. I went to \na law firm, and I ended up being privileged to be the district attorney \nfor the largest county in Minnesota. When Senator Dayton decided he \nwasn't going to run again for the Senate, I ran for the Senate.\n  It has been my belief throughout my life that you can get things done \nif you have right on your side, and if you are able to work with other \npeople, you can get things done and you can change things. It started \nin the fourth grade when I was the first girl to wear bell-bottom \npants, the first girl to wear pants in my public elementary school. I \nwas kicked out by Mrs. Quady, the principal, but I came back the next \nday and within a year the girls were allowed to wear pants.\n  In high school they said we couldn't raise enough money to have our \nhigh school prom, and we sold Life Saver lollipops and we got it done. \nIn DA, we had troubled crime in a lot of our neighborhoods and we \nreached out to these neighbors and organized, and they did a lot of \ngood work and we had some amazing examples of individual citizens \ngetting things done on the front end.\n  Now we are here. We have a major challenge confronting us. That is a \nchallenge of climate change. There are people out there waiting for us \nto do something about it. There is a scientist out there right now \nseeing how the sea level is going up. There is another scientist who \nmeasures the temperatures and sees how, since the ice age, we have only \nhad a 5-degree increase in temperature and just the last century we \nhave seen a 1-degree increase, with the EPA estimating a 3-degree \nincrease in the next hundred years. There are little kids out there \nwearing ``Save the Penguins'' buttons right now. There is a hunter in \nHinckley, MN, who sees changes in the wetlands. He is waiting for us to \nact. There is a ski resort on up in Grand Marais, MN, that had 30 \npercent less profits in this last year because of the decrease in snow. \nHe is waiting for us to act.\n  That is why I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nallow this important amendment to be heard. It doesn't dictate what the \npolicy will be. It simply asks that we collect accurate information.\n  I am an optimist. The seat I hold was once held by Hubert Humphrey. \nAt the end of his life, he said the words that are on his grave:\n\n       People consider me sentimental but to the end I remain an \n     optimist. I remain an optimist with joy and without apology \n     about this great American experiment in Democracy.\n\n  I remain an optimist too. I remain an optimist because I have seen \nthe great work the Senator from New Mexico and others have done in this \nenergy bill, and I believe more can be done. I remain an optimist that \nthis bill will ultimately pass. If not today, this amendment will \nultimately pass on another bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. For the information of Senators, we have now an hour \nequally divided, half of it under the control of Senator Inhofe and \nhalf of it under my control.

Madam President, let me take up to 5 minutes to speak \non amendment No. 1693 and then yield to my colleague Senator Boxer 10 \nminutes for her to speak on that same amendment.\n  This amendment addresses a number of important environmental issues \nassociated with renewable fuels. It contains four sections. The first \nsection makes an authorization for grants to encourage production of \nadvanced biofuels with the most favorable greenhouse gas emission \ncharacteristics.\n  The second section provides for a study by EPA of potential issues \nthat may arise as a result of increases in the renewable fuels \nstandard. That study will result in two reports to Congress, one in \n2010, the other in 2015.\n  The third part of the amendment allows the EPA to consider \ngroundwater impacts when regulating fuel additives under the Clean Air \nAct. One of the reasons we had a problem with MTBE as a fuel additive \nwas that we looked at it in a one-dimensional way. This section of our \namendment will allow a full look at all relevant impacts of fuel \nadditives going forward.\n  The final part of the amendment is a provision commonly known as \nantibacksliding. It basically allows EPA to address air quality issues \nthat might arise as a result of the increased volumes of renewable fuel \nmandated by the Energy bill. These changes have been developed by \nSenator Boxer and her staff, and myself and my staff, in a \ncollaborative manner. I thank her and her staff for the good work they \ndid on these provisions.\n  I also acknowledge the assistance and support we have received on \nthis amendment from the Renewable Fuels Association.\n  This is a consensus amendment on the part of those with interests in \nenhancing our energy security through increased use of renewable fuels \nin an environmentally responsible way.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I will now yield to the Senator from California for her comments on \nthis, and I will yield her up to 10 minutes, and I will then speak in \nopposition to the amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, thank you so much.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman very much for this amendment we have worked \nvery hard on for days now. I am delighted we are able to offer it.\n  I see my ranking member is here because he has an amendment that in \nconcept--I am going to look at the details--in concept makes a lot of \nsense. In terms of this amendment, I hope I will be able to support it \nbecause what we are trying to make sure of is that in the new fuels \nprogram, this bill, we do not lose any ground in terms of the Clean Air \nAct so we still are able to give EPA important authority under the \nClean Air Act to mitigate any adverse air quality impacts that might \nresult from the increased use of renewable fuels.\n  What we learned when we dealt with MTBE, which was an additive in \ngasoline, was we were not prepared for any adverse impacts from MTBE. \nWe thought it was going to be the answer. As you know, MTBE permeated \nthe water supplies in many States. We thought it was going to clean up \nthe air and, guess what, it did. But it created havoc with our water \nquality.\n  We want to make sure--we worked hard on this--that in this new fuels \nprogram, we do not backslide and that we are able to have all the \nprotections we need. So at first, we fixed the water problem and now \nthis is fixing the air quality problem.\n  What we do is, we give EPA authority under the Clean Air Act to \nconsider impact on water quality when regulating fuel. Such authority, \nas I say, will prevent future MTBE situations. We require EPA to \ncontract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a \ncomprehensive study of the environmental impact of increasing use of \nrenewable fuels.\n  The study will analyze impacts of renewable fuels on air quality, \nwater quality, land-use patterns, deforestation rates, greenhouse gas \nemissions, ecologically important areas, and the long-term ability to \nproduce biomass feedstocks.\n  Now, I wanted to say to my ranking member, Senator Inhofe, if I can \nhave his attention, that I know what he is trying to do in his \namendment in many ways parallels this. We, in this amendment, make sure \nthat EPA can look at the long-term to produce biomass feedstock because \nthat is a very important point.\n  I think the Senator and I both care about this. I think the Senator \nand I both care that the EPA is not going to lose jurisdiction over \nthis new fuels program.\n  The amendment to me is also exciting because it includes a grant \nprogram for biofuels that achieve at least a 50-percent reduction of \nlifecycle emissions of greenhouse gases. So what we are saying is, we \nwant innovation, and we are saying we will start a grant program so we \nget that technology that we all know is going to, in fact, step up and \nmeet the challenge of global warming.\n  There are so many ways we can meet the challenges of reducing our \ncarbon footprint. One way is to have fuels that have a 50-percent \nbetter carbon footprint. This amendment ensures that EPA will play a \ncritical role in protecting our environment from any adverse \nenvironmental impact that may be realized from an increase in the \nproduction and use of renewable fuels.\n  So it is pretty simple. The Senator from New Mexico and I have been \nin very close contact over these last several days. I have been helping \nhim to manage this bill, although I have to say, he is very competent \nat doing it himself.\n  But I have given him my advice and my help and the help of my good \nstaff. We did have a worry at the very beginning that we did not want \nto live to see another MTBE problem, that is, unintended consequences \nof a new fuels program and unintended consequence. So how we would \nprotect against is to be very vigilant, and we are very vigilant.\n  We say to the EPA: Make sure that whatever these fuels are, they are \nreal good for our people, good for our air, good for our water, good \nfor our land use, and also our long-term ability to produce biomass \nfeedstocks.\n  Again, we go a step further we set up a grant program for new fuels, \nbiofuels that achieve at least a 50-percent reduction in the lifecycle \nemissions of greenhouse gases. This particular program is authorized at \n$500 million. Of course, it is subject to appropriations. I do not have \nthe need to speak any longer on this amendment. I would retain the \nbalance of my time Senator Bingaman gave me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1666 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the unanimous \nconsent request was for the two amendments to be side by side.\n  At this point, I call up amendment 1666 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself, Mr. \n     Burr, and Mrs. Dole, proposes an amendment numbered 1666 to \n     amendment No. 1502.\n\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure agricultural equity with respect to the renewable \n                            fuels standard)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 113. AGRICULTURE EQUITY.\n\n       (a) Assessment of Food and Feed Availability.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Administrator'') shall conduct an assessment of the \n     availability of corn for food and feed uses by not later than \n     July 31 and November 30 of each calendar year after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Regional weather conditions.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than August 1, 2007, and \n     annually thereafter, the Administrator, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, and \n     the Association of American Feed Control Officials, shall \n     submit to Congress, and publish in the Federal Register, an \n     assessment of the Administrator regarding--\n       (i) regional weather conditions during the current crop \n     year; and\n       (ii) the impact of the conditions on projected local corn \n     supplies.\n       (B) Factors for consideration.--In conducting the \n     assessment under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall \n     take into consideration, as applicable--\n       (i) the impacts of drought, including reduced \n     precipitation;\n       (ii) the impacts of flooding, including increased \n     precipitation; and\n       (iii) projected local demand for corn during the following \n     crop year.\n       (3) Estimates.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than December 1, 2007, and \n     annually thereafter, the Administrator shall conduct an \n     assessment of the most current estimates of the ratio that, \n     with respect to the marketing year beginning in September of \n     the calendar year in which the assessment is conducted--\n       (i) United States domestic ending stocks of corn; bears to\n       (ii) total use of corn.\n       (B) Factors for consideration.--In conducting the \n     assessment under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall \n     take into consideration, and rely on, the data published by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture in the monthly report entitled \n     ``World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates'' (or \n     similar public and authoritative estimates provided by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture).\n       (b) Potential Economic and Consumer Harm Assessment.--\n       (1) Regional weather conditions.--If the Administrator \n     determines that an assessment of the Administrator under \n     subsection (a)(2) indicates that there is a reasonable \n     likelihood that the ratio described in subsection (a)(3)(A) \n     will be equal to or less than 0.10, the Administrator shall \n     publish the determination in the Federal Register by not \n     later than 14 days after the date on which the determination \n     is made.\n       (2) Estimates.--If the Administrator determines that an \n     assessment of the Administrator under subsection (a)(3) \n     indicates that there is a reasonable likelihood that the \n     ratio described in subsection (a)(3)(A) will be equal to or \n     less than 0.10, the Administrator, in consultation with the \n     Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall publish, by \n     not later than 14 days after the date on which the \n     determination is made, the intention of the Administrator to \n     request the President to modify a portion of the requirement \n     described in section 111(a)(2).\n       (3) Regional disruption.--If the Administrator determines \n     that an assessment of the Administrator under subsection \n     (a)(2) indicates that a regional disruption to the \n     availability of feed corn with respect to livestock producers \n     will occur, the Administrator, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, shall develop and implement a plan \n     to ensure that regional food and feed supplies are \n     maintained, to the maximum extent practicable, including \n     through adjustments to the applicable renewable fuels \n     standard under section 111(a) in the affected region.\n       (c) Actions To Prevent Economic and Consumer Harm.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the \n     Administrator may submit to the President a petition to \n     request a modification of a requirement under the renewable \n     fuels standard under section 111(a) in a quantity of gallons \n     sufficient to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that \n     the ratio described in subsection (a)(3)(A) will be at least \n     0.10.\n       (2) Limitation.--A requirement under the renewable fuels \n     standard under section 111(a) shall not be reduced by more \n     than 15 percent during any calendar year.\n       (3) Effective period.--A modification under paragraph (1) \n     shall be effective during the 1-year period beginning on the \n     effective date of the modification.\n       (d) Public Participation.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall--\n       (A) make each assessment conducted, and each modification \n     provided, pursuant to this section available to the public; \n     and\n       (B) provide an opportunity for public comment relating to \n     each assessment and modification for a period of not more \n     than 30 days.\n       (2) Modifications.--Not later than 14 days after the end of \n     the comment period described in paragraph (1)(B), the \n     President shall promulgate the modification that is the \n     subject to the comment period, unless the President, in \n     consultation with the Administrator, determines that clear \n     and compelling evidence demonstrates that the modification \n     would not have a material effect on the quantity of corn \n     available for food and feed use.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me first respond to something the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Boxer, had stated. I believe I agree \nthat our committee should have the jurisdiction. I do agree with her.\n  There are some other things. In fact, there is an easier way to do \nit, I would suggest to my chairman. That would be to strike the portion \nin the bill, the underlying bill, that talks about the President or the \nadministration and merely put in the EPA. If you do that, then, of \ncourse, you correct the jurisdictional problems. It is another way of \ndoing it.\n  My concern is that your amendment does get into some areas I do not \nfind I get quite as excited about as the chairman does, such as having \nus study land-use patterns, which I do not think is as appropriate for \nthe Federal Government to do as State and local government.\n  We had this debate in the past. But I would say I would like to \naccomplish some of the things that the chairman has tried to accomplish \nwith her amendments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask my friend to yield. It can come off my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, it can come off mine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much. Let me say to my ranking member I \nagree with him. We tried that approach. We were not able to gain \nground. So I am with you. But we were not able to do it in our \nnegotiation with the Energy Committee. So we went as far as we could \ngo, and I think we have made tremendous progress.\n  Again, it was give and take and it was tough and your staff was very \nhelpful as they were helping us get the best we could get. But I think \nafter this amendment, we can foresee a future where any President--this \none said he would not do it, but a future President could take the \nwhole fuels program and eliminate EPA. So I would hope my friend would \njoin me in this.\n  The other part, we are asking for reports from the EPA, we are not \ngiving them authority over these issues. We are going to get \ninformation from them. That information we can share with local and \nState.\n  So I know my friend is going to give it some real hard thought, as I \nam about his amendment. But perhaps we can wind up supporting each \nother's amendments. But we will see where we go from here. But I say to \nmy friend, he is absolutely right, striking the offending language \nwould have been great for me, but we were not able to achieve that with \nthe Energy Committee.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the comments of the chairman. I recognize \nher concern with MTBE contamination. I understand that. But getting the \nAdministrator authority to use the Clean Air Act to regulate water \nquality is something I would have to think about a little bit.\n  Let me go back and talk a little bit about the amendment we are \nrunning concurrently with the other amendments. This is amendment 1666. \nWe have a lot of cosponsors to this. I would invite more to come down. \nI think people would see this is a very rational way to address one of \nthe problems with the mandates that come with this bill.\n  We seek to ensure the bill does not pick winners and losers in \ndomestic agriculture. Although high corn prices might be good for corn \nfarmers, it is harmful for livestock and poultry industries.\n  Now, in my State of Oklahoma, I don't have a dog in this fight, or I \nguess I could say I have all the dogs in this fight, because we are a \ncorn State, we are a very large livestock State. I have heard from a \nlot of our people there expressing their concerns.\n  In fact, 15 industry groups have joined together and sent both Senate \nleaders a letter expressing their concern that the biofuels title in \nthis bill could harm their industries.\n  I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of my remarks to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of that letter.\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Unfortunately, the collective livestock and grocery \nproducers' concern continues. In fact, the earlier coalition has grown \nto 18 industry representatives, including cattle, poultry, swine \nproducers, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, even Cargill. In a letter to me, the \ncoalition writes:\n\n       We are asking Congress to provide those that utilize and \n     rely on corn and corn products a reasonable amount of \n     certainty that adequate supplies are available to all users \n     of this commodity.\n\n  We know right now the price of corn is very high. This obviously \nhas--it does not happen in a vacuum. Too often on the Senate floor we \nbelieve things can be done without affecting others. In this case, it \nis definitely affecting others, as indicated by these communications.\n  Now, with respect to our amendment, they state:\n\n       Your amendment would go a long way in ensuring a safety net \n     ensuring those of us that utilize corn and corn products will \n     have enough to go around should a drought or flood occur that \n     would limit the harvested amount that is available.\n\n  Now, our amendment seeks to provide some of the much needed equity in \nthe current system. This amendment simply requires that the USDA \nprovide information on projected corn harvests each year. Well, they do \nthat anyway. This is not going to incur anymore of a hardship on the \nUSDA; they have that capability; they are already doing it.\n  If the projected harvest is below a certain percentage, then the \nadministrator has the authority to modify the mandate for the next \nyear.\n  So that if it comes down and we see we are going to have a drought, \nwe are going to have some kind of a problem, we would be able to \naddress that by making a small adjustment to the mandate that is there.\n  Now, I would expect the ethanol industry to support our amendment, \nsince first they claim there is no food versus feed issue. Second, \nbecause they have stated repeatedly that corn farmers can grow much \nmore renewable--Fuels Association President Bob Dineen said--this is \nthe one who is very strong in the ethanol mandate the American farmer \nabsolutely has the ability to grow more corn to provide sufficient \nquantities of grain and food and feed for fuel usage and we are going \nto see that that happens.\n  Well, if that is the case, then there is not a problem. So I am not \nsuggesting or picking any favorites with this amendment. I am saying we \nought to be sure in the event that something that can be foreseen, and \nthese droughts can be foreseen--as I say, they are doing it right now. \nSo this amendment supports that concept.\n  Corn farmers have done a great job in increasing yield per acre in \nthe past and they will continue to do that. Our amendment simply \nprovides, as a collective food industry State, a reasonable amount of \ncertainty and a safety net, so that all the U.S. agriculture is able to \nprosper.\n  I know there are others who are on the floor who would disagree with \nmy amendment. I certainly wish to make sure they have time to express \nthemselves. So if the Senator from Iowa is prepared at this point to \nspeak, I would be glad to yield to him.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    June 20, 2007.\n     Sen. James Inhofe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Inhofe: We believe in the need to \n     advance renewable and alternative sources of energy. New fuel \n     sources offer the potential to eliminate our dependence on \n     foreign oil while contributing to the long-term stability of \n     our rural economies. But, as we seek to implement policy that \n     will move us toward accomplishing this objective, it is \n     essential that we carefully weigh the impacts of our actions \n     on other segments of the economy. Additionally, we would hope \n     that any policy that is agreed upon during this debate would \n     not overly tax one group in an effort to hopefully achieve \n     the objective of energy independence.\n       We are concerned that the very aggressive increase in \n     biofuels mandates proposed in S. 1419 raises fundamental \n     questions about the impact that an increased federal \n     government mandate for corn-based ethanol, in addition to new \n     state mandates, will have on the livestock, poultry and food \n     industry's ability to produce competitively available, \n     affordable food. It is vitally important that we fully \n     appreciate and understand the implications of quintupling the \n     Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate, and we would ask that \n     you use careful consideration and listen to the significant \n     issues being raised by those in the agriculture and food \n     products community.\n       Rapid development of the corn-based ethanol industry is \n     already having adverse impacts on food supplies and prices, a \n     major concern for us. Rising food prices, coupled with the \n     rising energy prices we are seeing throughout the country, \n     pose a threat to the health of our national economy. \n     According to a recent report by Merrill Lynch Chief \n     Investment Strategist Richard Bernstein, within the first \n     three months of the year, food prices rose at an annualized \n     rate of 7.3 percent. That is slightly higher than the \n     anticipated annual rise in healthcare costs over the next \n     decade, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services' National Health Statistics Group. In addition, the \n     continued aggressive expansion of corn ethanol production \n     diminishes the availability of soybeans and other crops. We \n     need a safety valve that ensures availability and that works.\n       We are asking Congress to provide those that utilize and \n     rely on corn and corn products a reasonable amount of \n     certainty that adequate supplies are available to all users \n     of this commodity. Your amendment to S. 1419, the Agriculture \n     Equity Adjustment Provision (#1666) would go a long way in \n     achieving a safety net ensuring those of us that utilize corn \n     and corn products will have enough to go around should a \n     drought or flood occur that would limit the harvested amount \n     that is available.\n       We look forward to working with you to achieve a balanced \n     approach between all competing uses of corn as we go forward \n     in this energy debate. We need an adequate contingency plan \n     in place, and this amendment achieves that goal.\n       Thanks again for your leadership and efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Feed Industry Association, American Meat \n           Institute, Cargill, The Coca Cola Company, ConAgra \n           Foods, General Mills, Grocery Manufacturers/Food \n           Products Association, Hormel Foods, National \n           Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Chicken Council, \n           National Pork Producers Council, National Restaurant \n           Association, National Turkey Federation, PepsiCo, Inc., \n           Seaboard Corporation, Tyson Foods, United Egg \n           Association, United Egg Producers.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield the Senator \nfrom Iowa up to 5 minutes to speak in opposition to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is the third amendment today that \nhas been very detrimental to the future of ethanol and other renewable \nfuels.\n  If we had had this attitude expressed 20 years ago when we started, \nin a very elementary way, down the road to a successful renewable fuels \nindustry that we are now developing, and it is still an infant \nindustry, we would never be here today, where we could say that we have \na strong opportunity of renewable fuels.\n  This is the third amendment that raises questions about whether we \nare going to continue to have investment in renewable fuel production \nand everything that is connected with it.\n  Something that bothers me more than anything else, and I have \nexpressed it on previous amendments today, is throughout the \ndevelopment of renewable fuels, and particularly agriculture being the \nproduction of the renewable feedstock, we have always had agriculture \nvery much united between renewable fuels.\n  Within the last 4 or 5 months, because corn has gone from $2 to $4 a \nbushel, we now have beef producers raising questions about whether we \nought to have an ethanol industry. You have the pork producers--and \nevidently we have the poultry people--raising the same question. If \nagriculture is not going to be united, if they had not been united, we \nwould never have gotten here. I do not know what happens in a matter of \n4 or 5 months, that after 20 years, all of a sudden things are bad \nabout renewable fuels, and the farmer is being blamed for everything, \n$4 corn, food going up, energy prices going up.\n  You know, food prices, a farmer gets a nickel out of a big box of \nCorn Flakes that is half full of air when you buy it for $4. The farmer \nis being blamed for $4 corn, raising the price of food, raising the \nprice of energy, causing livestock feed to go up.\n  You know, for the last 40 years, we have had a principle in \nagriculture that we call the hog-corn ratio. It was never felt, during \nthe corn-hog ratio, when you use that, that the high price of corn was \nbad for livestock because, you\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\nknow, livestock prices would soon rise, and it was considered good, \ngood, good. Everything about ethanol has been considered good, good, \ngood: Good for the farmers, good for the environment, good for high-\npaying jobs in the small towns of rural America, good for national \ndefense because of less dependence upon violent parts of the world for \npetroleum to be delivered, good for our balance of trade. Everything is \ngood, good, good about renewable energy.\n\n  Now, in the last 4 or 5 months--do you think the price of corn is \ngoing to be $3.50 or $4 forever? This fall at harvest time, we might \nfind corn at $2.50. We had 77 million acres of corn planted last year. \nWe have 91.5 million acres believed to be planted this year. When June \n30 comes and the USDA makes their next report, it may be 95 million \nacres of corn--the most acres planted since 1944. When you have that \nsupply of grain coming in, the fact that the price is going to be where \nit is today is a dream. In 1995, we had a drought. Corn got to $4 or \n$5. Everybody thought it was going to be $4 or $5 for the next 5 years. \nThe next harvest season, it was down to $1.60 a bushel. Here we have \npeople raising questions about the stock ratio, the stock on hand that \nwe have of grain, that when it gets down to a certain level, we are not \ngoing to use grain for renewable fuels. What are you going to do? Are \nyou going to go shut down every ethanol plant that is operating in the \nUnited States? What other amendment comes to the floor with the idea \nthat we are going to shut down an industry under certain circumstances? \nIt never happens.\n  This is not a very good approach, particularly the use of stock \nratios as proposed in this amendment. There are even questions about \nthe use of that among economists at this point.\n  This is a very bad amendment for renewable fuels, for agriculture. \nAll that is good about renewable fuels, and you shut down the whole \nindustry, it is for naught. You can't do that.\n  I ask Members to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 23 minutes and \nthe Senator from New Mexico has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak briefly in opposition to \nthe amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks a letter I received from the American Coalition \nfor Ethanol, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, the National Corn Growers Association, \nNational Farmers Union, the National Sorghum Producers, and the \nRenewable Fuels Association.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to briefly hit the high points of this \nletter and explain why they are so strongly in opposition to Inhofe \namendment No. 1666. I will read parts of the letter into the Record so \nMembers will be aware of their position. It says:\n\n       As the Senate continues to debate the energy bill . . . we \n     urge all Senators to vote against the amendment offered by \n     Senators [Inhofe, Burr, and Dole] when it is brought up for a \n     vote. We strongly oppose this amendment as it would \n     effectively gut the RFS and thwart the growth of the domestic \n     ethanol industry.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Senators Inhofe, Burr and Dole are proposing an amendment \n     to the energy bill that would put in place a stocks-to-use \n     mechanism that would suppress crop prices and be detrimental \n     to the American farmer and to domestic renewable fuels. \n     Stocks-to-use has limited value as an indicator of demand and \n     expected price. It is an oversimplified way to look at \n     supply/demand and pricing and does not often provide an \n     accurate picture of how markets would be impacted.\n\n  It goes on with various examples.\n  The Senator from Iowa pointed out that the price of corn is high \ntoday but may not be high indefinitely. It makes the same point here. \nIt says:\n\n       Most long-run economic models [from the] (U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture and Food and Agricultural Policy Research \n     Institute, and others) project stocks-to-use ratio slightly \n     under 10 percent for the next several years, with prices in \n     the $3.00-$3.50 range. Additionally, many economists have \n     stopped using the stocks-to-use ratio in their econometric \n     models as a tool to forecast price because of its obvious \n     limitations.\n\n  They go on and on along the same line, pointing out deficiencies in \nthe approach being taken by the Senator from Oklahoma in the amendment.\n  Let me conclude with their final statement:\n\n       Efforts to undermine the continued growth of the U.S. \n     ethanol industry should not be tolerated. A careful look at \n     the facts reveals that American farmers have met, can and \n     will continue to meet our domestic and international \n     commitments for food and feed while still making a \n     significant and growing contribution to lessening our \n     dependence on imported oil with homegrown, American-made \n     renewable fuels. We strongly urge you to oppose the Inhofe/\n     Burr/Dole amendment.\n\n  It is hard to know how to do better than that letter in pointing out \nthe deficiencies in the amendment. It is clearly an amendment we should \noppose.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    June 20, 2007.\n     Majority Leader Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Chairman Jeff Bingaman,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Ranking Member Pete Domenici,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators: As the Senate continues to debate the energy \n     bill, H.R. 6, we urge all Senators to vote against the \n     amendment offered by Senators James Inhofe (R-OK), Richard \n     Burr (R-NC), and Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) when it is brought up \n     for a vote. We strongly oppose this amendment as it would \n     effectively gut the RFS and thwart the growth of the domestic \n     ethanol industry.\n       Senators Inhofe, Burr, and Dole are proposing an amendment \n     to the energy bill that would put in place a stocks-to-use \n     mechanism that would suppress crop prices and be detrimental \n     to the American farmer and domestic renewable fuels. Stocks-\n     to-use has limited value as an indicator of demand and \n     expected price. It is an oversimplified way to look at \n     supply/demand and pricing and does not often provide an \n     accurate picture of how markets would be impacted. For \n     example, in 2003/04 the stocks-to-use ratio was one of the \n     lowest in the last 20 years at 9.4 percent, but prices \n     remained at $2.50 for a season average. Most long-run \n     economic models (U.S. Department of Agriculture and Food and \n     Agriculture Policy Research Institute, and others) project \n     stocks-to-use ratio slightly under 10 percent for next \n     several years, with prices in the $3.00-3.50 range. \n     Additionally, many economists have stopped using the stocks-\n     to-use ratio in their econometric models as a tool to \n     forecast price because of its obvious limitations. As corn \n     usage are likely to increase substantially to 13, 14, or even \n     15 billion bushels in the future, a 10 percent stocks-to-use \n     ratio could very well equate to carry-out of 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5 \n     billion bushels. So while the stocks-to-use ratio might seem \n     low in these cases, actual carry-out levels would be right in \n     line with the l2-year average (95/96 to 06/07) of 1.38 \n     billion bushels.\n       According a recent analysis from the University of \n     Illinois, ``the stocks-to-use ratio is generally used as a \n     `short cut' approximation for summarizing annual supply and \n     demand conditions. However, very different supply and demand \n     conditions in individual years can lead to similar ratios of \n     stocks-to-use, but very different prices. The most obvious \n     example is the contrast between a year of very small \n     production that results in a low stocks-to-use ratio, but \n     also requires very high prices to force a reduction in \n     consumption and a large crop year that results in a high \n     level of consumption, a low stocks-to-use ratio, but low \n     prices.''\n       Without the strong domestic market corn farmers won't have \n     the incentive to plant as many acres and take the risk that \n     large production will drive down corn prices. An arbitrary \n     stocks-to-use ratio trigger that restricts corn use for \n     ethanol would likely diminish overall demand and put downward \n     pressure on the price for corn. This would serve as a \n     disincentive to farmers and discourage them from planting \n     more corn at a time when more corn is what the feed and fuel \n     industries need. The food and feed industries have assumed \n     that farmers will continue to produce record crops regardless \n     of prices and profitability. If production declines, or even \n     grows more slowly, stocks could also fall, eventually driving \n     prices higher. In the long-term, America's farm sector is \n     better off maintaining a strong and growing domestic demand \n     base and adding value markets.\n       The corn industry will continue to strive to satisfy a \n     variety of important demands and maximize the utility of its \n     product. Seed technology developments, increasing \n     agricultural efficiency, innovation in biofuels production \n     processes and other breakthroughs will ensure that growers \n     will continue to meet the world's need for food, feed, fuel, \n     and other uses.\n       Efforts to undermine the continued growth of the U.S. \n     ethanol industry should not be tolerated. A careful look at \n     the facts reveals that American farmers have met, can and \n     will continue to meet our domestic and international \n     commitments for food and feed\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\n     while still making a significant and growing contribution to \n     lessening our dependence on imported oil with homegrown, \n     American-made renewable fuels. We strongly urge you to oppose \n     the Inhofe/Burr/Dole amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Coalition for Ethanol, American Farm Bureau \n           Federation, National Association of Wheat Growers, \n           National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers \n           Union, National Sorghum Producers, Renewable Fuels \n           Association.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I see the Senator from South Dakota here. I yield him 4 \nminutes to speak in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to this \namendment. I worked closely with my colleague from Oklahoma on a number \nof issues when I was a member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I worked with him last week on an amendment to expand \nrefinery capacity because we have a shortage of refinery capacity. It \nis something that needs to be addressed. Unfortunately, that amendment \nfailed. This amendment, however, is not necessary because we don't have \na shortage of corn. In fact, demand for corn has increased because of \nethanol production. It is expected to increase further thanks in part \nto the growth and expansion of renewable fuels. But to suggest for a \nminute that somehow we are going to run out of corn simply is not true. \nIn fact, one of the most respected economists in the agricultural \ncommunity, USDA's Dr. Keith Collins, has testified before the Senate \nAgriculture Committee about corn and ethanol production. I will \nhighlight some of the points he made.\n  First, since 1948, corn yields have increased fourfold--from 40 \nbushels per acre to 160 bushels per acre--due to fertilizer, better \nmanagement, technology, and improved crop genetics. Corn yields in the \npast couple of years have moved above the long-term trend and may \ncontinue to do so in coming years as well, helping to meet biofuel \ndemand and reduce pressure on corn prices and acreage. Over the past \nfew years, new-generation rootworm-resistant corn has been introduced \nand is showing strong yield increases in many areas.\n  As we look out over the next decade, USDA trend projections suggest \nthat U.S. corn yields per acre are going to rise to 168 bushels per \nacre by the year 2016, and some seed companies suggest they are going \nto go even higher, as much as 20 bushels per acre above that level. \nEvery 5-bushel increase in yield above the current trend level would be \nthe equivalent of adding around 2.5 million acres to corn plantings, \nenough to produce 1 billion gallons of ethanol each year.\n  If you look State by State, Arkansas growers are expected to plant \n560,000 acres of corn in 2007, up from 190,000 in 2006, a nearly 300 \npercent increase in corn acreage in 1 year. Louisiana farmers intend to \nplant 700,000 acres in 2007, up from 300,000 acres in 2006, a 233-\npercent increase in corn acreage. In Mississippi, corn producers are \nexpected to plant 950,000 acres in 2007, up from 340,000 acres in 2006, \na 280-percent increase in corn acreage.\n  My point is, in the underlying bill, basically, there is a \nstipulation that ethanol production can't exceed about 15 billion \ngallons. USDA's Dr. Keith Collins, who is an expert economist down \nthere, says we can get to 15 billion gallons of ethanol based on corn \nproduction. Today, we are producing about 6.5 billion gallons of \nethanol. So to get to 15 billion gallons, which is what the USDA's \nChief Economist says we can reach, we have a long way to go. There is a \nlot of headroom to 15 billion gallons. To suggest for a minute that \nsomehow we need this sort of an amendment that would put all these \nadditional restrictions on the renewable fuels standard, I submit is \nunnecessary.\n  The underlying bill has provisions already that address this issue \nand waivers in place for economic hardships experienced by certain \nregions or States. Specifically, the President can waive the RFS if one \nof the following conditions is met: implementation of the requirement \nwould severely harm the economy or environment of a State or region or \nthe United States; if extreme and unusual circumstances exist that \nprevent distribution of an adequate supply of domestically produced \nrenewable fuel to consumers.\n  I would also add that this particular amendment creates lots of \nproblems for areas of the country because it forces investors to make \ninvestment decisions based upon the weather. We all know we can't \nprotect the weather or predict the weather with certainty.\n  This amendment is misguided and unnecessary. I hope we will vote it \ndown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me inquire of the time remaining on \neach side, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 23 minutes for the Senator from \nOklahoma, and the Senator from New Mexico has 7\\3/4\\ minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, I may be yielding back some time. Let me respond \nto a couple assertions that have been made.\n  The Senator from Iowa was talking about in the event that livestock \nwould not be hurt because they would actually end up going up later in \nthe market and that will take care of that problem. I would suggest to \nyou that a lot of individuals don't agree with that. I have a letter I \nwill read a little bit out of. It is signed by the National Cattlemen's \nBeef Association, the Chicken Council, the Pork Producers Council, the \nRestaurant Association, and the Turkey Federation. All of them don't \nfeel this is going to be the market result.\n  Since the Senator from New Mexico read some excerpts of a letter \nsigned by a large number, we have many more who have signed this letter \nthan the letter which was submitted by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  One of the paragraphs in here says: We are concerned that the very \naggressive increase in biofuels mandates proposed in S. 1419 raises \nfundamental questions about the impact that an increased Federal \nGovernment mandate for corn-based ethanol, in addition to new State \nmandates, will have on the livestock, poultry, and food industry's \nability to produce competitively available, affordable food.\n  In other words, this is going to affect a lot of people in their \nestimation in terms of the cost of food, not just livestock, not just \nthe grain concern that is out there.\n  It continues: It is vitally important that we fully appreciate and \nunderstand the implications of quintupling the renewable fuels standard \nmandate, and we would ask that you use careful consideration and listen \nto the significant issues being raised by those in the agriculture and \nfood products community.\n  Let me mention, I know the Senator from South Dakota was not in the \nChamber when I made my remarks, but Oklahoma also is a corn State. I \nreally believe the excellent statement that was made by the Senator \nfrom South Dakota--who has been a real champion, maybe the No. 1 \nchampion, in this body of corn ethanol--really makes my case for me. If \nthese States are increasing their production the way they are, then \nthere is no problem. Nothing in this amendment is going to affect \nanything at all. In fact, the only concern we have is in the event \nthere is a year where this is not true.\n  Let me just go ahead and make sure everyone understands what this \namendment does and does not do. Quite often on the floor, we get people \nopposing something, and then you scratch your head and say: Wait a \nminute, is that my amendment they are talking about?\n  The amendment is a modification provision for food and animal feed \nbased on the ratio of cornstalks to projected demand. In the case of a \nshort- or low-corn crop year, there is currently no meaningful safety \nvalve that would address this situation. This amendment would provide a \nsmall level of confidence to producers as well as investors that corn \nwould be available to meet the needs of all uses. In other words, if \nthe production is up, there is not a problem. This addresses disasters \nand worst-case scenarios and assures the renewable fuels standard does \nnot lead to a shortage of corn for human or animal consumption.\n  It requires the USDA and the EPA to make a midyear-end determination \nof current weather conditions, followed by an end-of-the-year \ndetermination on the stalks-to-use ratio following harvest. If the \ndetermination estimates the stalks-to-use ratio is below 10 percent, it \nwould trigger a temporary adjustment in the RFS to account for the\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\nneed for increased availability of corn feed. The amendment would not \npermit the RFS to fall more than 15 percent in any given year.\n  Now, it has been said--I suspect there is a letter floating around \nsomewhere that says this would be the end of the world and it would \ncompletely destroy what they are trying to do. Let me just read the one \nlimitation that is in this amendment. It says:\n\n       A requirement under the renewable fuels standard under \n     section 111(a) shall not be reduced by more than 15 percent \n     during any calendar year.\n\n  That is, if there is some kind of a drought or some kind of a real \nserious problem--it can be too much water or not enough water--then it \nwould not affect it by more than 15 percent. Well, that is 15 percent. \nThat is not the end of the world. It means 85 percent of these mandates \nare still going to be there and still be in effect.\n  So I think it is a very modest approach. The list of people who share \nthis concern is a very long one. I mentioned some of the names--these \nindustries. I will go ahead and read them at this time: American Feed \nIndustry Association, American Meat Institute, Cargill, the Coca-Cola \nCompany, ConAgra Foods, General Mills, Grocery Manufacturers/Food \nProducts Association, Hormel Foods, the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, the National Chicken Council, National Pork Producers \nCouncil, the National Restaurant Association, National Turkey \nFederation, PepsiCo, Incorporated, Seaboard Corporation, Tyson Foods, \nUnited Egg Association, United Egg Producers--and the list goes on and \non. So there is this concern out there.\n  Again, my State is not dissimilar in any way to the State of New \nMexico. They are right next door. I would suggest we probably have \nabout the same size corn industry, as well as perhaps our cattle \nindustry is not quite as large as it is in New Mexico, but it certainly \nis not dissimilar. There is nothing I would do to be damaging to the \ncorn industry because that is a major industry, of course, in my State.\n  The Food Products Association--let me mention to you how they feel. \nIn a worst-case scenario, if you do not have some kind of a safety \nvalve, it could be damaging. They say: More and more pursuit of corn-\nbased ethanol is resulting in higher food and feed prices. The price of \ncorn has jumped 55 percent since September.\n  According to USDA's Chief Economist, the consequences of ethanol are \nthe biggest thing going on in agriculture today. An increase in ethanol \nproduction is already having a significant impact on food and feed \nsupplies, such as corn, soybeans, and wheat.\n  The U.S. Labor Department recently reported that February prices for \nfoodstuffs and feedstuffs were 18 percent above year-ago levels. That \nwas in the Wall Street Journal of March of this year. According to the \nWall Street Journal, the higher corn prices have raised costs for \nlivestock and poultry which are fed corn and for crops such as \nsoybeans, which farmers are replacing so they can grow more corn. The \ncorn companies are starting to pass those higher prices on to \nconsumers. Wholesale consumer food prices were 6.8 percent above year-\nago levels.\n  So this is not happening in a vacuum. Obviously, the mandates are \nthere for corn ethanol, and they will continue to be there. As we look \ndown the road, Oklahoma has been pretty active in the work they are \ndoing right now on the other types of cellulosic biomass. Right now, \none of our companies in Oklahoma has been very active in that. We are \nleading the field. We have Oklahoma State University and Oklahoma \nUniversity and the Noble Foundation leading the country in the pursuit \nof these technologies.\n  The coal-to-liquid technology is here. We are currently flying B-52s \nwith all eight engines running on this type of a fuel. So we know it is \ncoming. So it is not all just corn ethanol. Again, we are a corn State. \nWe are also a big livestock State. I think this is a middle-of-the-road \ntype of amendment.\n  Again, you have to respond to these statements that you are going to \ndestroy something, when the limitation by law would be 15 percent of \nthe current mandate in the event of some kind of a disaster. USDA is \nalready making these studies and doing it, and it is not really \nrequiring anything more.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will retain the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 7 minutes 45 \nseconds, and the Senator from Oklahoma has 13\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1510\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my intention to offer an amendment \nat the appropriate time to reduce the impact of future disruptions of \nour supplies by enlarging the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This \namendment, which is cosponsored by Senators Bayh, Lott, and Landrieu, \nwill expand the capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve from 1 \nbillion barrels to 1.5 billion barrels.\n  The economic security of the United States is threatened by our \nvulnerability to disruptions of the world oil supply and the volatile \nprices of energy. Whether we like it or not, our Nation's \ntransportation sector, our major industries, and our military forces \nare all dependent upon petroleum. We must protect ourselves from the \ninstability and the uncertainty of the international oil market.\n  The existing inventory in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve represents \nonly 56 days of net petroleum imports. Our obligation to the member \ncountries of the International Energy Agency requires us to maintain \nthe equivalent of 90 days of net petroleum imports. Increasing the \nauthorized capacity of our reserves will help ensure that we meet our \ninternational obligations.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, for a question.\n  It is my understanding that the time you are taking right now will be \ntaken off of our time equally, and since we are under a UC for a time-\ncertain for a vote, I know that would not be the Senator's intention.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. No, it would not. I will be happy to put these remarks \nin the Record.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well, I think that is probably a good idea.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. No one was speaking when I asked for recognition. I have \na statement that lasts maybe 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Go ahead.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. All day long, I have been trying to get an opportunity \nto make this statement.\n  Last December, the Department of Energy identified the salt domes \nnear Richton, MS, as a preferred site for a new Strategic Petroleum \nReserve storage facility. My State welcomes the opportunity to help \nmeet our Nation's energy needs. Other sites in Texas and Louisiana will \nalso gain additional reserves under the plan being developed by the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's energy security and stability depend on a \ncombination of efforts to increase domestic supplies of oil, gas, and \npetroleum, as well as the development and promotion of new renewable \nenergy technologies. The combination of these efforts will make it \npossible for us to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil and provide \nfor a bright economic future for all Americans.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the \namendment printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On page 314, after line 2, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 708. INCREASE IN CAPACITY OF STRATEGIC PETROLEUM \n                   RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Strategic Petroleum Reserve.--\n       (1) Policy.--Section 151(b) of the Energy Policy and \n     Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6231(b)) is amended by striking \n     ``1 billion'' and inserting ``1,500,000,000''.\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\n       (2) Creation.--Section 154(a) of the Energy Policy and \n     Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6234(a)) is amended by striking \n     ``1 billion'' and inserting ``1,500,000,000''.\n       (b) Filling Strategic Petroleum Reserve to Capacity.--\n     Section 301(e) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. \n     6240 note; Public Law 109-58) is amended by striking \n     ``1,000,000,000-barrel'' and inserting ``1,500,000,000-\n     barrel''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me once again ask how much time \nremains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is approximately 12\\1/2\\ minutes for the \nSenator from Oklahoma. The Senator from New Mexico has approximately 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in light of that, since there is 12 \nminutes still remaining for the Senator from Oklahoma--I do not know \nhow much of that time he wants to use. Once he has used his time, I was \ngoing to take a couple minutes to sum up my position in favor of the \nfirst amendment that is being offered and we are voting on, and then I \nwould yield that time. But I defer to the Senator from Oklahoma to make \nany statement he has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I do not \nthink adequate time has been given to the amendment you want to \naddress, the Boxer amendment, and if you would want some of my time to \ndo that, I would be willing to give it up. I am really prepared to \nyield back at the appropriate time on this amendment.\n  Let me make this comment. If people are concerned my amendment is \ngoing to be devastating, just keep in mind we have this limitation. \nThere is a very sizable mandate that is out there. The very maximum \nthat would be used would be to reduce that mandate--in a year when a \ndisaster occurs--by only 15 percent. In other words, 85 percent of that \nmandate would still be in effect. I think that is a very reasonable \napproach to it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1693\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me sum up my argument in favor of \nthe first amendment we are going to be voting on in this sequence of \nthree amendments; that is, amendment No. 1693 that I have cosponsored \nwith Senator Boxer.\n  The amendment does address a number of important environmental issues \nassociated with renewable fuels. It is an amendment that contains four \nsections.\n  The first makes an authorization for grants to encourage production \nof advanced biofuels with the most favorable greenhouse gas \ncharacteristics.\n  Second, we have a study by the EPA of potential issues that may arise \nas a result of increases in the renewable fuels standards. That study \nwill result in two reports to Congress, both in 2010 and 2015.\n  The third part allows the EPA to consider groundwater impacts when \nregulating fuel additives under the Clean Air Act, which is a good \nprovision.\n  The final part is a provision commonly known as an anti-backsliding \nprovision, basically allowing EPA to address air quality issues that \nmight arise as a result of the increased volumes of renewable fuel \nmandated in this Energy bill.\n  Mr. President, let me at this time conclude my remarks and ask the \nSenator from California if she wishes to make any concluding remarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, if you could yield \nme about 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has asked if he could have a \nminute and a half. If there is no objection, I suggest we allow that to \nhappen at this time, and I will then follow him with 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1666\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the pending amendments we will \nconsider very shortly is by Senator Inhofe, and this would create an \nadditional mechanism that would interrupt the bill's renewable fuels \nstandard depending on the ratio of stocks of corn to total corn use, \nknown as the stocks-to-use ratio.\n  Statistics show that stocks-to-use does not correlate to price and \nsupply information. In addition, there is already a waiver provision in \nthe bill that offers protection to consumers if corn prices or \navailability becomes unsustainable.\n  According to one economic analysis, the 10-percent stocks-to-use \ntrigger required by this amendment would suppress corn prices to $2.50 \nto $2.60 a bushel. In the current farm bill, the target price is $2.63. \nSo by artificially suppressing the price of corn from $2.50 to $2.60, \nthe Inhofe amendment would put downward pressure on prices and cause \nthe triggering of loan deficiency payments. As a result, this amendment \nwould cost the Government more in farm payments.\n\n  I am going to urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I \nunderstand there is a budget point of order. I have notified Senator \nInhofe that I will raise that point of order at the appropriate time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1693\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just wanted to say I hope amendment No. \n1693 that has been offered by Senator Bingaman and myself will be \noverwhelmingly supported by both sides. We know what happens when we \nignore unintended consequences. I think this amendment makes sure we \ndon't experience another MTBE; that, in fact, we are careful, \nregardless of what the fuels turn out to be, because we are not picking \nwinners and losers. We are saying: Let technology go.\n  As a matter of fact, in this program we have to assist in the \ndevelopment and production of biofuels, cellulosic. So what we don't \nknow is when these fuels come, what are they going to do to the \nenvironment? We all want to be free of foreign oil. Every one of us. \nBut we don't want to make mistakes.\n  So I hope this amendment No. 1693 will be strongly supported. It \nensures that the EPA stays involved. It doesn't give away all the \npowers of EPA to the Department of Energy. We just need to make sure \nwhat we are doing in the future is sound.\n  I think Senator Inhofe has made a very important point about corn. \nThere are wonderful things about corn, but there are some negatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think this first amendment can protect against these \nproblems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. On my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On your side.\n  Mr. INHOFE. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include Senator \nPryor as a cosponsor of amendment No. 1666.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add to \namendment No. 1693 Senators Dodd, Cardin, and Sanders as cosponsors, to \nthe amendment we are about to vote on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to add \nSenator Gregg as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Gregg would be a \ncosponsor to amendment No. 1666?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, at this point I ask for the yeas and \nnays on amendment No. 1693.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1666 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this Inhofe amendment is one I am \nopposing, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. There is already a \nwaiver provision in the bill that offers protection to consumers if \ncorn prices or availability become unsustainable.\n  Unfortunately, the language of the Inhofe amendment could trigger a \ndramatic decrease in income of farmers and a dramatic increase in \nGovernment costs. As a result, I raise a point of order that the \npending amendment violates section 201 of Senate Concurrent Resolution \n21, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order must be made after time has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there have been some misconceptions about \nthis amendment. First, my State of Oklahoma is a corn State. It is a \nlivestock State. If my colleagues will look at the groups of people \nthat have joined in and said we need to have this safety valve, it is \nvirtually everyone: the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the \nChicken Council, port producers, Restaurant Association--all of these \nrecognizing that in the event something should happen with a severe \ndrought--and these are easy to predict--we should have some kind of a \ntrigger that would allow the mandate to be reduced.\n  All this does is simply provide that if the USDA determines because \nof weather patterns there is going to be a real problem in the crop of \ncorn, the mandated limit can be reduced by as much as 15 percent. In \nother words, we are still going to have an 85-percent mandate.\n  I suggest my colleagues look very carefully at this amendment. This \nis going to offer some assistance in the event of a serious drought or \nsomething that will affect the corn crop in America.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining for debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has half a minute remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter in opposition to the Inhofe amendment \nfrom the American Coalition for Ethanol, the American Farm Bureau \nAssociation, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National \nAssociation of Corn Growers, National Farmers Union, National Sorghum \nProducers, and the Renewable Fuels Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    June 20, 2007.\n     Majority Leader Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Chairman Jeff Bingaman,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Ranking Member Pete Domenici,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators: As the Senate continues to debate the energy \n     bill, H.R. 6, we urge all Senators to vote against the \n     amendment offered by Senators James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Richard \n     Burr (R-N.C.) and Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) when it is brought \n     up for a vote. We strongly oppose this amendment as it would \n     effectively gut the RFS and thwart the growth of the domestic \n     ethanol industry.\n       Senators Inhofe, Burr and Dole are proposing an amendment \n     to the energy bill that would put in place a stocks-to-use \n     mechanism that would suppress crop prices and be detrimental \n     to the American farmer and domestic renewable fuels. Stocks-\n     to-use has limited value as an indicator of demand and \n     expected price. It is an oversimplified way to look at \n     supply/demand and pricing and does not often provide an \n     accurate picture of how markets would be impacted. For \n     example, in 2003/04 the stocks-to-use ratio was one of the \n     lowest in the last 20 years at 9.4 percent, but prices \n     remained at $2.50 for a season average. Most long-run \n     economic models (U.S. Department of Agriculture and Food and \n     Agriculture Policy Research Institute, and others) project \n     stocks-to-use ratio slightly under 10 percent for next \n     several years, with prices in the $3.00-3.50 range. \n     Additionally, many economists have stopped using the stocks-\n     to-use ratio in their econometric models as a tool to \n     forecast price because of its obvious limitations. As corn \n     usage are likely to increase substantially to 13, 14, or even \n     15 billion bushels in the future, a 10 percent stocks-to-use \n     ratio could very well equate to carry-out of 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5 \n     billion bushels. So while the stocks-to-use ratio might seem \n     low in these cases, actual carry-out levels would be right in \n     line with the 12-year average (95/96 to 06/07) of 1.38 \n     billion bushels.\n       According to a recent analysis from the University of \n     Illinois, ``the stocks-to-use ratio is generally used as a \n     ``short cut'' approximation for summarizing annual supply and \n     demand conditions. However, very different supply and demand \n     conditions in individual years can lead to similar ratios of \n     stocks-to-use, but very different prices. The most obvious \n     example is the contrast between a year of very small \n     production that results in a low stocks-to-use ratio, but \n     also requires very high prices to force a reduction in \n     consumption and a large crop year that results in a high \n     level of consumption, a low stocks-to-use ratio, but low \n     prices.''\n       Without the strong domestic market corn farmers won't have \n     the incentive to plant as many acres and take the risk that \n     large production will drive down corn prices. An arbitrary \n     stocks-to-use ratio trigger that restricts corn use for \n     ethanol would likely diminish overall demand and put downward \n     pressure on the price for corn. This would serve as a \n     disincentive to farmers and discourage them from planting \n     more corn at a time when more corn is what the feed and fuel \n     industries need. The food and feed industries have assumed \n     that farmers will continue to produce record crops regardless \n     of prices and profitability. If production declines, or even \n     grows more slowly, stocks could also fall, eventually driving \n     prices higher. In the long-term, America's farm sector is \n     better off maintaining a strong and growing domestic demand \n     base and adding value markets.\n       The corn industry will continue to strive to satisfy a \n     variety of important demands and maximize the utility of its \n     product. Seed technology developments, increasing \n     agricultural efficiency, innovation in biofuels production \n     processes and other breakthroughs will ensure that growers \n     will continue to meet the world's need for food, feed, fuel \n     and other uses.\n       Efforts to undermine the continued growth of the U.S. \n     ethanol industry should not be tolerated. A careful look at \n     the facts reveals that American farmers have met, can and \n     will continue to meet our domestic and international \n     commitments for food and feed while still making a \n     significant and growing contribution to lessening our \n     dependence on imported oil with homegrown, American- made \n     renewable fuels.

I make the point again that there is already a waiver \nprovision in this bill. The Inhofe amendment goes too far in that \nregard.\n  If it is the appropriate time, I will raise my point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may make the point of order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 201 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2007.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable points of \norder against my amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this amendment very simply changes an IRS \ninterpretation of the 2005 Energy bill that provides a $1-per-gallon \ntax credit for creation of biodiesel. An interpretation by IRS said \nthat if you take animal fat and add it to the biodiesel--or add it to \ndiesel, you have biodiesel and then get the $1-per-gallon credit. That \nwas not what was intended when this was created.\n  What has happened is all of the animal fat used to do this was \nalready being used by the oleo chemical industry. Folks, for example, \nwho make soap and detergents and the like, are finding the cost of the \nanimal fat, their feed stock, has skyrocketed 100 percent this past \nyear because of the way this has been done. As a result, we are simply \nchanging the interpretation IRS put on it that big oil companies can \ntake advantage of what was not intended to be a tax credit for them, \npeople who are already refining diesel fuel. But rather, those who \nwould create legitimate new diesel fuel from legitimate biomass, the \ncredit remains; nothing changes for that. It simply means the oil \ncompanies taking advantage of the credit in an improper way would no \nlonger be able to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Senator from Arizona seeks to strike \nthe provision of the underlying Finance Committee amendment--frankly, \nthe amendment package which the committee voted to report by a vote of \n15 to 5. The underlying amendment before us extends for 2 years the $1-\nper-gallon credit for renewable diesel, including diesel produced from \nanimal fats. That credit is in current law. It is only 2 years old. We \nshould give it time to work.\n  Under the language in the underlying Finance Committee amendment, we \nwill revisit subsidies for most fuels, including this one, in the year \n2010. The bottom line is we want to displace foreign oil imports--that \nis the goal--and every gallon of renewable diesel produced is a gallon \nof foreign imports displaced.\n  I urge my colleagues to help decrease foreign oil imports and oppose \nthe Kyl amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the Kyl \namendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide a condition precedent for the effective date of \n                          the revenue raises)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title VIII add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. CONDITION PRECEDENT FOR THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF \n                   REVENUE RAISERS.\n\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of this subtitle, the \n     amendments made by this subtitle shall not take effect unless \n     the Secretary of Energy certifies that such amendments shall \n     not increase gasoline retail prices and the reliance of the \n     United States on foreign sources of energy.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will speak for one minute and then yield \nabout 10 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky who will begin the \ndiscussion. Actually, I would like to read the entirety of this \namendment. It will take me about 10 seconds. It explains what the \namendment does.\n\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of this subtitle, the \n     amendments made by this subtitle shall not take effect unless \n     the Secretary of Energy certifies that such amendments shall \n     not increase gasoline retail prices and reliance of the \n     United States on foreign sources of energy.\n\n  What this amendment does very simply is to say that the $28.6 billion \nin tax increases called for by this bill will be allowed to go into \neffect as long as the Secretary of Energy can certify that it would not \nraise gas prices or cause further dependence on foreign oil. The reason \nfor the amendment, obviously, is to make a point. It is going to be \nvery difficult to have $28.6 billion in tax increases on oil producers \nnot reflected on our gasoline cost at the pump. I predict Americans \nwill pay more for their gasoline because of the tax increases in this \nlegislation.\n  I will have more to say about the three different kinds of tax \nincreases, why I believe that is the case, why I think it is a bad idea \nfor us to increase our dependence on foreign oil and increase the cost \nof gasoline to consumers as a result of the tax increases embodied in \nthis bill.\n  At this time, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I thank Senator Kyl for yielding. I \nrise in support of amendment No. 1733 that would prevent the tax \nincreases in this bill from going into effect if the tax provisions \nraise gasoline prices or increase our dependency on foreign oil. I \nvoted against these tax increases in the Finance Committee, and I \nstrongly oppose all the tax increases in this bill. But there is one \nprovision I oppose in particular. I am referring to the 13-percent \nseverance tax on oil and gas leases.\n  There are several reasons why the Federal Government will never see \nthe $10.6 billion allegedly raised by this provision and why we should \nnot, under the banner of tax law, confiscate property. Very simply, the \nUnited States should not break its contracts. A deal is a deal. The \nClinton administration bid out these lease contracts in the Gulf of \nMexico in 1998 and 1999, more than 1,000 of them. Now, with the benefit \nof hindsight, the small number of performing leases--about 20 of them--\nlook like a bad deal for the Government. That may be true. Some leases \nnegotiated before and after the period in question have 12.5 percent \nroyalty rates. These leases have a zero rate.\n  On the other hand, the favorable terms that Senator Bingaman \ncomplains about encourage the oil companies to pay more at the outset \nto drill in deeper waters. Senator Bingaman knows he cannot tear up the \ncontracts he does not like, so he has proposed an unprecedented and \nunusual targeted severance tax that falls almost exclusively on the \ncurrent holders of these leases. This tax is so unusual, the Federal \nGovernment has never imposed a severance tax on resources, and we never \nhave enacted a tax that can be offset by royalty payments.\n  If there is any doubt about the purpose of this tax, Senator Bingaman \ncleared that up earlier today when he explained the tax will not impact \nfuture leaseholders. The only people who actually pay this 13 percent \ntax are the holders of the leases Senator Bingaman thinks are a bad \ndeal. As Senator Bingaman explained, future leases are expected to have \na royalty rate higher than the tax, and royalties can be used to offset \nthe tax under Senator Bingaman's scheme. The problem with this is \nCongress cannot reverse contracts legislatively without paying \ncompensation. The Supreme Court has said as much in two recent cases: \nWinstar and Mobil Oil. What is more, the Federal courts have said \nCongress cannot use its taxing power to break or modify a Government \ncontract.\n  But that is precisely what this measure aims to do. If we enact this \nlegislation, we will cast a small degree of doubt on every contract the \nFederal Government ever writes. We will raise the cost of Government \ntoday and for generations because every contractor will wonder whether \ntheir Congress might step in to claw back the benefits of the deal.\n  Here is a true story. During the savings and loan crisis, Federal \nregulators tried to encourage healthy thrifts to buy up failing thrifts \nto stabilize the savings and loan industry. They agreed to more lenient \nregulatory standards and tax benefits that would be available to the \nhealthy thrifts. Later, when the cost of the savings and loan bailout \nbecame a concern, Congress enacted laws that took back some of these \nbenefits. One of these laws was the Guarini amendment, a targeted tax \nprovision. Similar to the Bingaman severance tax, the law seemed to \nraise revenue on paper. But in the end, the Federal courts reversed \nthemselves, and the Federal Government paid out millions in damages for \nbreach of contract. The same Federal court that decided these cases has \nexclusive jurisdiction to decide whether the 13-percent severance tax \nis legal. I am not optimistic.\n  We should make sure this provision never becomes law by voting for \nthe Kyl amendment. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It will \nraise gasoline prices across the board, not lower them, by imposing \nadditional costs on the American oil and gas companies. Most of them \nare small companies that risk capital to search for oil in the Gulf of \nMexico.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, unless the chairman of the committee would \nlike to speak next, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Arizona for yielding me the time \nto speak on his amendment which basically requires a certification from \nthe Secretary of Energy that these taxes will not increase retail \ngasoline prices or the reliance of the United States on foreign sources \nof energy. I think it is a good amendment. Here is why. The current \nbill, as I see it, does nothing to produce more energy. It doesn't do \nanything to make energy less expensive. It makes us more dependent on\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\nforeign oil from my perspective. This amendment helps remediate the \nprovisions of the current Energy bill before us.\n  I think back to the previous Energy bill passed in the fall of 2005, \nin which we accomplished a lot. We did a lot to increase the supply of \nenergy through incentives and to hold down costs because we were \nincreasing supply. It made us less dependent on foreign oil.\n  In that particular legislation, we took nothing off the table. We \nkept traditional fuels out there. Many of those were the petroleum \nproducts, but included hydroelectric plants. We also had incentives in \nthere for nuclear fuels. We did a lot to encourage renewable fuels. We \nhad provisions to encourage production of solar energy, production of \nwind-generated energy, geothermal energy, probably one of the more \npractical and efficient ways of generating energy, with some of the \nlocal governments in the State of Colorado taking advantage of the \nsource. Hydrogen was a source, cellulosic sources of alcohol and energy \nfuels, corn ethanol. We even had conservation provisions in there, for \nexample, provisions which would allow tax credits for housing and \nconstruction projects that produced buildings that conserved energy. It \nwas a good, well-balanced bill, and it didn't have many mandates in it.\n  One of the concerns I have is the huge amount of mandates and tax \nincreases we have in this bill which will make it more difficult to \ngenerate energy. Not only will it make it more difficult to generate \nenergy, but it will also make it more expensive. When you make anything \nmore expensive, consumer demand will go down, but also production will \ngo down because what you are implementing is taxes that are directed to \nthe producer.\n  As Senator Bunning commented, there is going to be an injustice. It \nwouldn't surprise me if we have court action and if it doesn't turn \naway some of the revenue-producing provisions of this bill.\n  I am not in support of the bill as it stands now. With the adoption \nof the Kyl amendment, I think it remediates many of the provisions in \nthis bill that I have an objection to. These provisions undo a lot of \nwhat we did in the big Energy bill in 2005.\n  I am urging my colleagues to join me in supporting the Kyl amendment. \nIt simply states that the amendments shall not take effect unless the \nSecretary of Energy certifies that such amendments shall not increase \ngasoline retail prices and the reliance of the United States on foreign \nsources of oil. It is very simple, straightforward. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment I \nhave offered, No. 1733, be modified to reflect that it is a second-\ndegree amendment to the Baucus amendment No. 1704.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, let me begin by reminding the Senate why we are here today. We \nwant a strong energy policy. I think most Senators agree that the \nunderlying bill, plus the Finance Committee bill, moves this country \nvery much in the right direction, making us less dependent upon OPEC. \nIt enhances national security. It will move us more toward alternative \nand renewable fuels, conservation, cellulosic ethanol, and also clean \ncoal technology. This is a very good bill.\n  It is important to remind ourselves why we have these provisions that \nare the subject of the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. \nWe have to pay for what we do here. It is something called pay-go. \nEssentially, whenever we decrease taxes--and that is what the \nunderlying Finance Committee bill does, it decreases taxes; it gives \nincentives to lots of different organizations to help develop new \ntechnologies, this is a tax-decrease bill--we also, under our rules, \nhave to raise revenue the same amount that we decrease revenue.\n  We are here today to debate the offsetting amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arizona. Basically, should we pay for what we are doing? \nThat is the basic question.\n  I say that is the basic question because it is one that offers no \nalternative. He just wants to strike the provisions that raise revenue \nin this bill to pay for other things, to pay for the tax decreases. So \non a net basis, it is zero. Some like to say this is a tax increase \nbill. It is not. It is a net zero--zero-zero.\n  So the Senator from Arizona is not suggesting any alternative. He \njust says, no, we do not pay for what we are trying to do here. I think \nthis body all agrees we need to pay and should pay for what we do. The \nquestion is whether this is a proper pay-for. I remind my colleagues \nthat this full committee amendment, which includes the provisions which \nare the subject of the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, passed \nthe committee by a vote of 15 to 5--a very strong, bipartisan vote. \nMany Senators believed--15 Senators believed--this is proper. It is \nright to have these provisions in this legislation.\n  We clearly do not want to increase the deficit. If the Senator's \namendment passes, and these incentives for clean energy remain, it will \nhave an effect of increasing the deficit.\n  Let's go in a little more detail about these offsets. The first is \nthe section 199. What is that? I think all of our colleagues remember \nthat several years ago--basically prior to 2004--the United States had \na program called FSC-ETI. That was a program placed to give incentives \nfor companies to manufacture products that are shipped to foreign \ncountries. It was an incentive for domestic manufacturers to ship \nproducts overseas. The World Trade Organization ruled that this \nincentive violated WTO rules. The Europeans have something similar. \nThey just constitute it a little differently, so they are able to have \ntheir stimulus for their exports that go overseas. But ours was ruled \nillegal by the WTO.\n  So what did we do about that in the Congress? We decided we were \ngoing to enact this section 199. What is that? Basically, it gives a \ndeduction for domestic manufacturers, and it is phased in. When fully \nphased in in 2010, it will allow 9 percent of qualified production \nactivities income to be deducted.\n  Well, here we are today saying: Well, for the five major oil \ncompanies, that 199 deduction for their production is no longer \navailable to them. Some here suggest: Well, that is going to have the \neffect of increasing prices at the pump and it will maybe discourage \ndomestic production in the United States.\n  Look at the record. Look at the facts. The facts are basically these. \nSince this provision went into effect--section 199--what has happened \ndomestically in the United States? The major oil companies have gotten \na significant break. It comes down to approximately $10 billion over 10 \nyears. Domestic production by the five major oil companies has actually \ndeclined, even though they had this break, they got this additional \nincentive. Did it increase production in the United States? No, it did \nnot increase production in the United States. It decreased production. \nRemember, this is a provision which applies to domestic production. It \ndid not increase domestic production. Domestic production by oil \ncompanies actually decreased over this period of time.\n  I might also say that the Joint Committee on Taxation has done an \nanalysis on this issue, and they demonstrated many of the points I am \nmaking.\n  So if you look at all the various factors that bear on this issue, \nyou reach the conclusion that domestic production has gone down. So the \nargument that this one bill, this one portion will be responsible for \ndecreasing domestic production is a specious argument. The facts show \nthe opposite.\n  What determines gasoline prices charged at the pump? The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation looked at this question, and it is their \ndetermination that--and it is obvious--the price at the pump is \ndetermined by an awful lot of complex factors. It is global demand. It \nis a lot of supply factors. I could go on as to all the factors the \nJoint Committee on Taxation believes contributes to this issue. To say \nthere is a direct link that this provision is actually going to \nincrease prices is just not accurate. It is just not going to happen.\n\n[[Page S8044]]\n\nIt is a fallacious argument to try to discourage and confuse people \ninto saying, therefore, this is not a good pay-for.\n  What are the other oil provisions? There are three of them. I already \nmentioned one. The second one is a loophole-closer.\n  Basically, this is a loophole identified by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. In short, it has to do with credit American companies get for \ntaxes paid overseas. For oil and gas production, there are two specific \nprovisions relating to foreign taxes. One provision, called foreign oil \nand gas extraction income, or FOGEI, applies to extraction costs of oil \nand gas. The other, foreign oil related income, or FORI, applies to \ndownstream distribution costs.\n  The long and short of it is that the Joint Committee on Taxation \nrecommended changes to the system of credits against foreign taxes, a \nstreamlining of FOGEI and FORI. And that's what the Finance Committee \nhas done.\n  We closed this loophole, and it happens to raise over $3 billion \ndollars. This is a loophole closer. That is what this is. I cannot see \nany reason why anyone would have any problem with that.\n  In fact, the oil company people tell us it is probably a good thing \nto close this loophole. Why? Because it is so complicated to comply \nwith.\n  Now, let's go to the third provision in this bill. This is the \nprovision with respect to Outer Continental Shelf severance taxes. \nClearly, constitutionally, the Congress always has the power to enact a \ntax. This is a 13-percent tax on production in the gulf. That is what \nit is. Producers can offset that tax with royalties they otherwise \nwould pay for those leases in the gulf.\n\n  Now, the provision applies not just to the so-called years in \nquestion--1998 and 1999. It applies to a much broader range of leases \nin the gulf. This is not targeted to those 2 years people discuss. This \nis a severance tax that Congress has the power to levy in this area.\n  A couple points: The President himself enacted a higher level of \nroyalties for all new leases at 16\\2/3\\ percent. On his own, he raised \nthe royalty rate to 16\\2/3\\ percent for most new offshore deepwater \nfederal oil and gas leases.\n  In this amendment, we are talking about a 13-percent severance tax. \nIs this a breach of contract? No. We have asked the American Law \nDivision of the Congressional Research Service to research this point \nfor us because we do not want to do anything that is going to be \nunconstitutional and wrong. They say no, that basically Congress has \nthe power to enact this provision. Under the broad public purposes, \nwhich is the basic standard, which is utilized here in the courts, \nCongress does have the power to do this. The question is, Is this a \ntaking or confiscatory? No. This is not confiscatory. Nobody can make \nan argument this is confiscatory. So there is no takings, fifth \namendment question here. Someone can raise it, but I think any \nreasonable person looking at this issue would say it is not a taking, \nit is not confiscatory, and second, this is not a breach of contract \nbecause we are saying: Hey, Congress has the power to enact the tax and \ncredit royalties against it.\n  Do not forget, the President already said those folks, those \ncompanies are not paying enough. So he raised the royalty rate to 16\\2/\n3\\. We are saying 13 percent, in the form of a tax. We are trying to be \nreasonable. We are trying to do what is right. We came up with that 13 \npercent.\n  Another point that is kind of tricky about this amendment--it is kind \nof interesting about this amendment--essentially, it is delegating to \nthe Secretary whether or not the oil companies are going to pay taxes. \nThat is basically what the amendment says: Congress, you cannot decide; \nit is not your prerogative; it is up to the Secretary. Because he has \nthis little clause in there that says: Unless the Secretary certifies, \nit is not going to increase prices. Come on. The Secretary can say \nanything he wants to say in this area because it is so complicated. It \nis so complicated. We should not be giving such broad authority to the \nSecretary for him to determine whether this offset should be enacted. \nBut that is what the Kyl amendment does. I think any reasonable person \nwould say: Hey, that is not the right thing to do. We do not want to \ngive the Secretary this authority. You guys--men and women in \nCongress--we elected you to do what is right. Basically, what is right \nis to enact these provisions.\n  So I, therefore, urge all of us--the body--let's keep our heads on \nstraight. Let's keep our feet on the ground. This is common sense. \nLet's oppose this thing that does not make any sense.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 16\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from Arizona has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have not spoken on this energy \nlegislation. There is no question in my mind that we need a national \nenergy policy. I do not think this bill, in its current form, does what \nwe need to do. I have always believed what we need to do in America is \nproduce more energy here at home. More supply--that is the answer--not \ntry to do with less, try to shrink what we have in terms of energy or \nconserve ourselves into an energy policy. I want more. This is America.\n  We can produce more of everything. More oil? Yes. More natural gas? \nAbsolutely, and do a lot of innovative things with it. More coal? I am \nfor clean coal technology. I am for changing coal to liquids. I am for \ndoing whatever we can with coal. I am for hydro. We should have more \nhydroplants, but we have people who have reservations about that. It \nhas environmental or conservation problems. And more nuclear. It is \nclean. It is safe. But what are we doing to get more of them on line? \nNothing.\n  This bill has turned out to be really about alternative fuels, \nconservation, and green policies.\n  Now, for years, I have said I do not want any of that. I want \nproduction. By the way, in my State, we can do it. We can have more of \neverything: oil, gas, coal to liquid, lignite coal, ethanol. We are \ntrying to do it all. We are going to be energy independent. In fact, we \nare going to wield our power to other parts of the country. So that is \nwhat I wanted, but I am over that. I want a national energy policy. I \nam prepared to accept alternative fuels, some renewables if they make \nsense, if they are justified in the market but not paid for by \noutrageous tax credits that don't produce anything. I am for \nconservation. We should encourage that. Get different light fixtures, \nlook at the utilities we have in our houses, the appliances, are they \nusing too much electricity; insulation, I am for all of that.\n\n  So let's have the grand compromise on energy. Let's do it all. This \nbill doesn't do it. To my colleagues, I want to say I believe America \nis in great danger because of our inability to come together and do it \nall.\n  I was in Russia 3 or 4 weeks ago. I had a chance to see their \ntransmission network of gas and to look at their fields in Siberia, the \noil and natural gas. I met with the leadership of Gazprom, the Russian \nGovernment-controlled energy company. It was scary. I have no doubt in \nmy mind they intend to use gas as a weapon. They are going to be \nshipping natural gas that provides the power to all of Europe, Eastern \nEurope, Western Europe, all the way to Ireland. By the way, if they \ndon't get what they want, they will cut it off.\n  Here we are in America. We are dependent for our energy sources, 80 \npercent on foreign oil. Is that good? No, that is bad. Look at whom we \nare depending on: Russia, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Venezuela, and then some \nwho I guess are more stable for now: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait. Is that what \nwe want? No, we don't want that. This is a dangerous situation.\n  So we should encourage and facilitate the whole package. Flexible \nfuels, I am for that. We should try to see what we can do with \nrenewables. I don't believe for a minute we are going to get 15 percent \nof our energy needs from wind. Come on now. Wind and solar. There are \npeople who think we are going to heat, power, and supply all our energy \nneeds in the future from wind and solar. For heaven's sake, get real. \nWe have already sunk billions of dollars into some of these ideas that \nmight work or might not. I am willing to try them. I will buy the deal, \nbut\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\nthis is not the deal. This is another tax increase: $28.6 billion. I \nthought it would be $15 billion.\n  By the way, let me make it clear. There is some good stuff in here. \nSome of it I supported, some of it I voted for. But overall, what we \nhave is an energy bill that came out of the Energy Committee that now \ndoesn't amount to very much; it is all about renewables and green \npolicy. It is not going to produce another drop of oil, 1 cubic foot of \nnatural gas. In fact, now, we are going to discourage oil and gas \nexploration in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  By the way, I should be able to talk about this because this is in my \nneck of the woods. I have lived in the shadow of oil and gas rigs for \nyears in the gulf. The best fishing in the gulf is around the rigs. We \nhave oil and gas out there. Our policy in America is we don't want to \ndrill where it is. We don't want to drill in the gulf, we don't want to \ndrill on the west coast, we don't want to drill on the east coast, we \ndon't want to drill in ANWR. I have a novel idea of where we ought to \ndrill: Drill where it is, and do it safely. We can do that. Finally, \nafter a lot of huffing and puffing and stroking and scratching last \nyear, we finally said: Yes, we are going to have more oil and gas \nexploration in the Gulf of Mexico. It is going to be in a defined area. \nIt is not going to be close to the shore, which I think it should be, \nmuch closer to the Florida coast, for instance--and my coast, too, for \nthat matter--but we did it for control in a responsible, acceptable \nway. The States, by the way, are going to get some royalties out of it \nfor the first time ever, or for the first time in many years. We came \nup with a good deal.\n  Now, in this bill, we are going to go back, and we are going to levy \na 13-percent tax on oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico that \nwill cost $10.6 billion on the oil companies. Now, look, I am not going \nto cry any tears for oil companies. I have a populist streak in me. I \ndon't like gasoline prices. But, buddy, let me tell you, this bill is \nnot going to reduce anybody's gasoline prices. This bill is not a \nnational energy policy.\n  This bill will lead to less American production in the critical areas \nwhere we could do something quickly. By the way, we are going to tax \nthem. Are we never going to learn when you tax something, you get less? \nIf you get less, what do you think it is going to do to the price of \ngasoline? By the way, we are going to ride these cats--these \ncompanies--offshore. They are not going to put up with all these taxes. \nThey are going to go get it somewhere else. They can do business \ninternationally. The biggest company in the world, ExxonMobil--they are \nnot the biggest company in terms of oil or gasoline in America, no; \nthere are other companies that fit that role--much of their business is \noverseas.\n  So there is about $21 billion more on the oil companies, and I think \nit is being done in the wrong way. But we can't come out and talk about \nhow we are going to make such great changes and that we are going to do \nsomething about energy prices and the price of gasoline, when the \nreverse is true. This bill would say that--exactly, it would \neffectively strike all the tax increases unless and until such time as \nthe Energy Secretary can certify they will not result in increased gas \nprices or increased dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  You are right, you know, they would not be able to certify that. This \nwould not be good for the country.\n  Yes, again, I wish to say the Wyden amendment is in there. I support \nit. I voted against the amendment awhile ago that Senator Kyl had. I am \nnot pure either. I am over trying to be pure. But I do expect us to not \ndo the wrong things on energy policy--don't do the bad things, even if \nwe can't do the right things.\n  I am extremely upset about what we have come up with out of the \nFinance Committee and on the energy package as a whole. This is not \ngoing to do the job. It is not going to become law.\n  So here again, the Senate is spinning its wheels. Yes, well, we are \nmaking a statement. Maybe we will feel better. But in terms of \naddressing an energy policy, this will not do it.\n  I yield the floor. Thank you for the extra time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork, but I don't see him yet. So I yield the balance--11 minutes plus \n5 is 16--so I yield 11 minutes to the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, \nand the remaining 5 to the Senator from New York when he appears on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to pick up on the comments of my \nfriend from Arizona and my friend from Mississippi, two Senators whom I \nhave worked with on many issues and must unfortunately disagree with \nthem on this one. I want the Senate to understand exactly what the \nimplications would be if the Kyl amendment were to pass.\n  If the Kyl amendment were to pass, the major oil companies would \nreceive billions and billions of dollars of subsidies that President \nBush says the major oil companies do not need. I wish to be specific on \nthis as we go to the debate with the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  The President of the United States has said that when the price of \noil is over $55 a barrel, the oil companies do not need incentives to \ndevelop and explore. Let me repeat that. President Bush has said when \nthe price of oil is over $55 a barrel, the oil companies do not need \nincentives to explore and search for oil. The price of oil at this time \nis substantially over $55 a barrel. So if the Kyl amendment passes and \nwe refuse to strip these incentives the President says aren't needed, \nwe are going to continue business as usual.\n  The Kyl amendment says, essentially: Let us continue these practices \nwe have had for the last few years that have done nothing--nothing--to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  What we have had in the past are billions of dollars of subsidies. \nFor example, in section 199 of the Tax Code, not for investing in \nrefinery capacity, not for investing in new production, not for \ninvesting in renewable fuels but essentially continuing the practices \nthat have nothing--done nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil. I have always said we ought to target tax breaks and incentives \nwhere there is an opportunity for new production. That is why I have \nalways favored looking at potential incentives for small companies.\n  But that is not what this amendment is all about. This amendment is \nabout continuing the giveaways for the big companies, the giveaways the \nPresident of the United States says are not needed.\n  So where we are is oil is at almost $70 a barrel, gas is over $3, \nmore imports than ever, and it seems to me continuing business as usual \nas the Kyl amendment would do is not a case you can make. The Finance \nCommittee amendment changes our course. It ends the section 199 tax \nbreaks for the major oil companies. It takes steps to end our addiction \nto oil. It takes steps to end our addiction to continuing billions of \ndollars of subsidies that the President says are not needed.\n  Let us not continue these billions and billions of dollars in the \nname of a modern energy policy. It is not. The idea that shoveling all \nthese breaks, these billions of dollars of breaks at the oil industry \nis somehow going to be good for America is not borne out by the record. \nIt is not borne out by the record, and in my view, until we take these \nsteps to protect taxpayers and protect consumers and protect the \nsecurity of the country, I think what will happen is we will continue \nto increase our addiction to foreign oil, we will continue to have \nthese prices, these staggeringly high prices of $70 a barrel and \nconsumers will still get clobbered at the pump.\n  I am going to have more to say about this in the course of tomorrow, \nbut I would say in closing--and I see my good friend from Arizona on \nthe floor of the Senate--that if the Senate supports this particular \namendment, the Kyl amendment, what it will be doing is it will be \ncontinuing billions of dollars in tax breaks that if you use the test \napplied by the President of the United States, those major companies do \nnot need. No one has been able to make a case, it seems to me, that the \nPresident of the United States is wrong. In fact, every time this topic \nhas come up, I have said I think the discussion ought to begin with the \ncomment of the President. I credit the President for his statement \nbecause I think it reflects modern reality. The President knows a lot \nabout the oil\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\nbusiness, and the President says you don't need these subsidies when \nthe price is over $55 a barrel.\n  But along comes the Kyl amendment, and the Kyl amendment says: No, I \npretty much don't see it the way the President of the United States \nsees it. I am going to continue the billions and billions of dollars of \nsubsidies when it is not needed.\n  The last point I would like to make very quickly deals with the \nBingaman language. We have heard again and again that this somehow \nretroactively sweeps in and unravels previous agreements. That is \nuntrue. Yesterday, I asked in the Senate Finance Committee the counsel \nabout this. The counsel was very clear it applies prospectively, it \ndoes not apply retroactively, and it applies to all of the activity \ngoing on in the gulf.\n  The Government Accountability Office has said that in terms of our \nposition in the world, we stand almost alone in terms of our position \nrelative to getting a fair shake on revenue and protecting taxpayers. \nThe reality--and the Bingaman amendment picks up on this--is taxpayers \nare getting fleeced by major oil companies when they drill on public \nland.\n  We are talking about our land, the people's land. We are not talking \nabout private lands. We are talking about our lands. And the Bingaman \namendment takes steps to correct that situation.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona. If I have made one point tonight, I want it understood, if the \nKyl amendment is adopted, major oil companies would continue to receive \nbillions of dollars of subsidies that the President of the United \nStates has said they do not need.\n  Mr. President, I note that my colleague from New York has not \narrived. The Senator from Arizona, I am sure, wants to respond. I \nreserve the time that was propounded in the request by Senator Baucus \nfor Senator Schumer when he arrives. Since he is not here, and Senator \nKyl is, I yield the floor to him with the reservation for Senator \nSchumer when he arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to respond to some of the comments my \ncolleagues made to remind everyone many of the dire predictions, \nincluding the ones of my good friend from Oregon, are a little beside \nthe point.\n  If you look at the actual wording of my amendment, it does not say \nanything about subsidies to big oil companies or anything of the like. \nMaybe I better read it again:\n\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of this subtitle--\n\n  And those are the tax increases on oil companies, as well as the \nother tax increases in the legislation--\n\n     the amendments made by this subtitle shall not take effect \n     unless the Secretary of Energy certifies that such amendments \n     shall not increase gasoline retail prices and the reliance of \n     the United States on foreign sources of energy.\n\n  That is all it says. There isn't any more. There isn't anything about \nsubsidies to oil companies or anything of the like.\n  What the Senator from Oregon might be saying is that the provisions \nof the bill are not going to go into effect because it is true that the \ntax increases will, in fact, raise prices for American gasoline \nconsumers and will increase our dependency on foreign oil. If, as the \nchairman of the committee said, that is not true, there is no \nrelationship--in fact, his exact words were: It is fallacious to argue \nthat these new taxes in the bill will raise fuel costs. If that is \ntrue, then there would not be any effect. The argument of the Senator \nfrom Oregon then falls. But if it is true the taxes in this legislation \nwill raise prices for oil consumers or gasoline consumers and will \nfurther our dependence on foreign oil, then the Senator from Oregon at \nleast has a point to argue because one provision out of the three major \ntax provisions relates to the general subject that he and I have worked \non in the past and that he was talking about, which is the royalties \nthat should be paid by offshore oil companies.\n  One of two things is true, but they can't both be true. It might be \ntrue the tax increases in this legislation are going to raise the cost \nof gasoline to American consumers and increase our dependency on \nforeign oil, and then at least one of the things the Senator from \nOregon talked about would at least come into play.\n  Or it could be, as the Senator from Montana said, there would not be \nany effect because this would not raise gasoline prices, in which case \nthe Senator from Oregon is simply incorrect when he says that the \neffect of my amendment is to provide subsidies for oil companies. They \ncan't both be true.\n  What is the probability? I think the probability is that the tax \nincreases in this legislation will raise prices for American consumers \nand will increase our dependency on foreign oil. And that is just not \nmy guess, although it is fairly intuitive if you understand anything \nabout economics. If you tax something, more generally the producer of \nthat product is going to reflect the prices in what he charges to \nconsumers, and the price, therefore, paid at the pump, in the case of \ngasoline, goes up.\n  A recent study by the Heritage Foundation found that the tax \nprovisions alone in this legislation, setting aside the other mandates \nin the Energy bill, will likely increase gas prices by 21 cents per \ngallon over the next 8 years. Taking all of the provisions together, \nthe Energy bill could increase the price of regular unleaded gasoline \nfrom $3.14 a gallon to $6.40 a gallon by the year 2016, a 104-percent \nincrease.\n  For comparison, current policies will lead to gas prices climbing \nfrom $3.14 to $3.67 in the year 2016. And in just the next year alone, \nconsumers can expect to pay between $3.16 to $3.79 due to the impact of \nthis bill.\n  During the next decade, between now and the year 2016, due to this \nbill alone, consumers can expect to spend an average of $1,445 more per \nyear on gasoline. Again, that is not just speculation. It is obviously \nthe law of supply and demand. It is the law of economics. If you are \ngoing to impose this tax, it is going to be passed on by the people who \npay the tax. So American consumers can expect to pay a lot more for \ngasoline at the pump.\n  I don't think anybody would argue that our dependence on foreign oil \nis going to decrease. In fact, because of one of the three provisions \nof this bill, the foreign tax credit tax increase, it is obvious our \noil producers are going to be put at an economic disadvantage vis-a-vis \nthose abroad, and it is obvious we are going to have to be more \ndependent on foreign oil, not less.\n  It was interesting that the Senator from Montana started out his \nargument saying the purpose of this bill is to get more energy, \nespecially from renewable fuels. It is true the purpose of a good \nenergy bill should be to get more energy. The problem is, this bill \ndoesn't provide any more energy. It does focus some subsidies on \nrenewable fuels, and the only way we are going to get more renewable \nfuel energy, obviously, is by subsidizing those particular energy \nsources. But the bill itself provides not a drop of new oil. Yet \nsomehow or another it costs $28.5 billion, and that gets to the second \npoint the Senator from Montana made.\n  He said this is not a tax-increase bill; this is a tax-decrease bill. \nBut then he lets the cat out of the bag by saying: Of course, we must \nstill pay for what we are doing. Well, indeed. We do have to pay for \nwhat we are doing, and what we are doing is spending $28.5 billion. So \nthe bill raises taxes by $28.6 billion. That is the estimate the \nCongress must use. That is what the Finance Committee is required to \nuse, $28.6 billion in new taxes. The reason: to pay for what we are \ndoing, for what the bill spends.\n  Granted, some of the spending in the bill is in the form of tax \nbreaks, such as the last tax break we talked about. Unfortunately, my \namendment was not adopted, so a tax break is going to be misused, and \nwe are going to be paying billions of dollars because of that misuse. \nBut I think there is no question that the tax increases that are \nprovided for in this bill will be seen as tax increases.\n  Mr. President, has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. KYL. That is the end of my time. I will resume this argument \ntomorrow morning and remind my colleagues why it is that I think we \ndon't want to pass the tax increases in the bill.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S8047]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe I have a couple of minutes, and \nthen Senator Schumer has time reserved. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Klobuchar follow Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. The Senator from \nArizona makes the point that he always does eloquently about markets, \nand I come back to the fact that President Bush has said you don't need \nsubsidies when the marketplace price is over $55 a barrel. So what we \nwant to do is cut back on the subsidies and begin to create the kind of \nmarket that I know the Senator from Arizona favors.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nGovernment Accountability Office report of May 1, 2007, which makes it \nvery clear that taxpayers are being ripped off for the drilling by \nmajor companies on public lands.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          United States Government\n\n\n                                        Accountability Office,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2007.\n     Subject: Oil and Gas Royalties: A Comparison of the Share of \n         Revenue Received from Oil and Gas Production by the \n         Federal Government and Other Resource Owners\n\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Nick J. Rahall II,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Stevan Pearce,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, \n         Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Amid rising oil and gas prices and reports of record oil \n     industry profits, a number of governments have taken steps to \n     reevaluate and, in some cases, increase the share of oil and \n     gas revenues they receive for the rights to develop oil and \n     gas on their lands and waters. For example, the State of \n     Alaska has recently passed new oil and gas legislation that \n     will increase the state's share of revenue received from oil \n     and gas companies operating state leases. In January 2007, \n     the Department of the Interior announced an increase in the \n     royalty rate for future leases granted in the deepwater \n     region of the Gulf of Mexico. Companies engaged in \n     exploration and development of oil and gas resources do so \n     under terms of concessions, leases, or contracts granted by \n     governments or other resource owners. The terms and \n     conditions of such arrangements are established by law or \n     negotiated on a case-by-case basis. One important aspect of \n     the arrangements is the applicable payments from the \n     companies to the resource owners--in the United States, these \n     include bonuses, rentals, royalties, corporate income taxes, \n     and special fees or taxes. The precise mix and total amount \n     of these payments, referred to as the ``fiscal system'' \n     varies widely across different resource owners. The total \n     revenue, as a percentage of the value of the oil and natural \n     gas produced, received by government resource owners, such \n     as U.S. federal or state governments is commonly referred \n     to as the ``government take.'' For example, a government \n     take of 50 percent means that the government receives 50 \n     percent of the cash flow produced from an oil or gas \n     field.\n       In fiscal year 2006, oil and gas companies received over \n     $77 billion from the sale of oil and gas produced from \n     federal lands and waters, and the Department of the \n     Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) reported that \n     these companies paid the federal government about $10 billion \n     in oil and gas royalties. Clearly, such large and financially \n     significant resources must be carefully developed and managed \n     so that our nation's rising energy needs are met while at the \n     same time the American people are ensured of receiving a fair \n     rate of return on publicly owned resources, especially in \n     light of the nation's daunting current and long-range fiscal \n     challenges.\n       As requested, this report documents the information \n     provided to your staffs in March 2007 on the U.S. \n     government's take and implications associated with increasing \n     royalty rates. Specifically, this report discusses (1) the \n     United States' government take relative to that of other \n     government resource owners and (2) the potential revenue \n     implications of raising royalty rates on federal oil and gas \n     leases going forward. To address the government take, our \n     work included reviewing results of studies done by oil \n     companies and industry consultants. We also collected and \n     analyzed various studies generated by MMS, the agency \n     responsible for collecting oil and gas royalties from federal \n     lands and waters. In addition, we reviewed results of studies \n     prepared over the last 13 years by various private and \n     government sources on government take and interviewed Alaskan \n     state and private consulting firm officials. In evaluating \n     the study results we conducted interviews with study authors \n     and an industry expert to discuss the study methodologies and \n     the appropriate interpretation of the results. Based on these \n     interviews and our review of study results, we believe the \n     general approach that these study authors took was reasonable \n     and that the study authors are credible. However, we did not \n     fully evaluate each study's methodology or the underlying \n     data used to make the government take estimates. Overall, \n     because all the studies came to similar conclusions with \n     regard to the relative government-take ranking of the U.S. \n     federal government and because such studies are used by oil \n     and gas industry companies and governments alike for the \n     purposes of evaluating the relative competitiveness of \n     specific fiscal systems, we are confident that the broad \n     conclusions of the studies are valid. To address the revenue \n     implications of raising royalty rates, we gathered \n     information from reports, studies, and government documents, \n     and drew from past GAO reports related to oil and gas \n     royalties. We also discussed the material in this report with \n     MMS officials and they made helpful suggestions about the \n     factors affecting the revenue implications of raising royalty \n     rates. Our work was done from January 2007 through March 2007 \n     in accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n\n\n                               In Summary\n\n       Based on results of a number of studies, the U.S. federal \n     government receives one of the lowest government takes in the \n     world. Collectively, the results of five studies presented in \n     2006 by various private sector entities show that the United \n     States receives a lower government take from the production \n     of oil in the Gulf of Mexico than do states--such as \n     Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, California, and \n     Louisiana--and many foreign governments. Other government-\n     take studies issued in 2006 and prior years similarly show \n     that the United States has consistently ranked low in \n     government take compared to other governments. For \n     example, a study completed in 2006 for MMS showed that the \n     U.S. federal government take in the Gulf of Mexico \n     deepwater and shallow water was lower than 29 and 26, \n     respectively, of the 31 fiscal systems analyzed. In \n     deciding where and when to invest oil and gas development \n     dollars, companies consider the government take as well as \n     other factors, including the size an availability of the \n     oil and gas resources in the ground; the costs of finding \n     and developing these resources, including labor costs and \n     the costs of compliance with environmental regulations; \n     and the stability of the fiscal system and the country in \n     general. All else held equal, more investment dollars will \n     flow to regions in which the government take is relatively \n     low, where there are large oil and gas deposits that can \n     be developed at relatively low cost, and where the fiscal \n     system and government are deemed to be relatively more \n     stable. Regarding the deepwater areas of the U.S. Gulf of \n     Mexico, the current size of the government take, the \n     relatively large estimated amounts of oil and gas in the \n     ground, and the proximity to the large U.S. market for oil \n     and gas make this region a favorable place to invest. \n     However, the high costs of operating in deepwater may \n     deter some investment.\n       Increasing royalty rates on future federal oil and gas \n     leases would likely increase the federal government take but \n     by less than the percentage increase in the royalty rate \n     because higher royalty rates would likely reduce some taxes \n     and other fees and may also discourage some development and \n     production. For example, the recently announced increase in \n     royalty rates from 12.5 percent to 16.67 percent on future \n     leases sold in the deepwater regions of the Gulf of Mexico \n     will, according to MMS, increase overall federal revenues but \n     will also cause reductions in some fees and in oil and gas \n     production. Specifically, MMS estimates that the new royalty \n     rate of 16.67 percent will increase revenue by $4.5 billion \n     over 20 years. MMS also estimates that, by 2017, this \n     increased revenue will be partially offset by revenue losses \n     of $820 million over 20 years as a result of reduced rental \n     fees as well as a decline in production of 5 percent. A lower \n     royalty rate can encourage oil companies to pursue oil \n     exploration and production and thereby provide an economic \n     stimulus to oil producing regions. For example, according to \n     a MMS study issued in 2006, as the industry expands output in \n     the Gulf of Mexico, employment levels in all Gulf Coast \n     states-including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas-\n     tend to rise to meet industry needs. As part of an energy \n     strategy to meet the nation's energy needs and balance the \n     impacts of energy use on the environment and climate, a \n     healthy domestic oil and natural gas industry is essential, \n     and that means that the United States must continue to create \n     a market that is competitive in attracting investment in oil \n     and natural gas development. Such development, however, \n     should not mean that the American people forgo a competitive \n     and fair rate of return for the extraction and sale of these \n     natural resources, especially in light of the current and \n     long-range fiscal challenges facing our nation. The potential \n     trade-offs between higher revenue collections and higher oil \n     production highlight the broader challenge of striking a \n     balance between meeting the nation's increasing energy needs \n     and ensuring a fair rate of return for the American people \n     from oil production on federally leased lands and waters.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The Department of the Interior, created by the Congress in \n     1849, oversees and manages the nation's publicly owned \n     natural resources, including parks, wildlife habitat,\n\n[[Page S8048]]\n\n     and crude oil and natural gas resources on over 500 million \n     acres onshore and in the waters of the Outer Continental \n     Shelf. In this capacity, the Department of the Interior is \n     authorized to lease federal oil and gas resources and to \n     collect the royalties associated with their production. The \n     Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management is \n     responsible for leasing federal oil and natural gas resources \n     on land, whereas, offshore, MMS has the leasing authority. To \n     lease lands or waters for oil and gas exploration, companies \n     generally must first pay the federal government a sum of \n     money that is determined through a competitive auction. This \n     money is called a bonus bid. After the lease is awarded and \n     production begins, the companies must also pay royalties to \n     MMS based on a percentage of the cash value of the oil and \n     gas produced and sold. Royalty rates for onshore leases are \n     generally 12 and a half percent whereas offshore, they range \n     from 12 and a half percent for water depths of 400 meters or \n     deeper (referred to as deepwater) to 16 and two-thirds \n     percent for water depths less than 400 meters (referred to as \n     shallow). However, the Secretary of the Interior recently \n     announced plans to raise the royalty rate to 16 and two-\n     thirds percent for most future leases issued in waters 400 \n     meters or deeper. MMS also has the option of taking a \n     percentage of the actual oil and natural gas produced, \n     referred to as ``taking royalties in kind,'' and selling this \n     energy itself or using it for other purposes, such as filling \n     the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In addition to \n     bonus bids and royalties, companies pay taxes on corporate \n     profits. The sum of all these and other payments comprises \n     the government take. Because different governments set \n     different levels of taxes, fees, and royalties, the relative \n     size of any one component of government take generally varies \n     across different fiscal systems.\n\n\n study results indicate that the federal government receives among the \n                  lowest government takes in the world\n\n       Results of five studies presented in reports or testimony \n     to the Alaskan state legislature in 2006 indicate that the \n     federal government receives one of the lowest government \n     takes among the jurisdictions evaluated. The hearing was held \n     to discuss a proposed new state tax on oil company profits. \n     This proposal eventually was adopted and, in 2006, the State \n     of Alaska enacted a new oil and gas production tax law which \n     imposed a 22.5 percent tax on oil company profits. Two of the \n     studies presented were from major oil companies, and three \n     were from private consulting firms. The five studies had \n     differing scopes and somewhat different estimates of \n     government take. For example, one study focused primarily on \n     comparing U.S. federal, state, and Canadian fiscal systems, \n     while other studies focused on international comparisons. The \n     results of the five studies are summarized below and in \n     more detail in enclosure I.\n       BP (formerly British Petroleum), one of the world's largest \n     oil companies. testified that the federal government's take \n     for leases in the Gulf of Mexico (45 percent) was lower than \n     9 out of 10 other fiscal systems presented, including \n     Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, California, and Louisiana \n     (between 51 percent and 57 percent).\n       ConocoPhillips, Alaska's number-one oil producer in 2005, \n     testified that the federal government's take for leases in \n     the Gulf of Mexico (43 percent) was lower than all 8 other \n     fiscal systems presented, including the United Kingdom (52 \n     percent) and Norway (76 percent).\n       CRA International (formerly Charles River Associates), a \n     global firm specializing in business consultancy and \n     economics, testified that the federal government's take in \n     the Gulf of Mexico--both deepwater (42 percent) and shallow \n     water (50 percent)--was lower than the 6 other fiscal systems \n     it evaluated, including Australia (61 percent).\n       Daniel Johnston and Company, an independent petroleum \n     advisory firm providing services to the oil and gas industry, \n     testified that the federal government's take in the Gulf of \n     Mexico for deepwater (between 37 and 41 percent) was 4th \n     lowest and for shallow water (between 48 and 51 percent) was \n     8th lowest among 50 fiscal systems it evaluated.\n       Van Meurs Corporation--a company which provides \n     international consulting services in several areas including \n     petroleum legislation, contracts, and negotiations--reported \n     that the federal government's take in the Gulf of Mexico (40 \n     percent) was the lowest among 10 fiscal systems it evaluated, \n     including Alaska (53 percent) and Angola (64 percent).\n       It should be recognized that the studies presented in this \n     testimony were done before the recent increase in the royalty \n     rate for future deepwater leases in the Gulf of Mexico. This \n     action will, as new leases are added to the mix over time, \n     cause the average government take in the Gulf of Mexico to \n     rise somewhat. In addition, 4 of the 5 studies compared \n     government take based on 11 fiscal systems or fewer. A \n     comparison of a much larger number of fiscal systems provides \n     more comprehensive information. In this regard, we found that \n     other expanded government-take studies have been issued. \n     These are summarized below and more details are presented in \n     enclosure II.\n       A study issued in 2006 and done under contract with MMS by \n     the Coastal Marine Institute of the Louisiana State \n     University reported on 31 fiscal systems in 25 countries. The \n     study showed, out of the 31 fiscal systems, Gulf of Mexico \n     deepwater, at between 38 and 42 percent, was lower than 29 \n     other systems and Gulf of Mexico shallow water, at between 48 \n     percent and 51 percent, was lower than 26 systems. Three \n     other offshore fiscal systems were also shown. This included \n     Trinidad & Tobago offshore with a government take between 48 \n     percent and 50 percent, Australia offshore with a government \n     take of between 53 percent and 56 percent, and Egypt offshore \n     with a government take of between 79 percent and 82 percent. \n     Of the 31 fiscal systems presented, Mexico had the lowest \n     government take at between 30 percent and 32 percent, and, at \n     the other end of the spectrum, Venezuela had the highest \n     government take at between 88 percent and 93 percent.\n       A second study, issued in 2002 by Wood MacKenzie, a private \n     consulting firm, analyzed 61 fiscal systems within 50 \n     countries. The study showed that, out of 61 fiscal systems, \n     Gulf of Mexico deepwater ranked lower than 54 other systems \n     with a federal government take of about 42 percent, while \n     Alaska's government take was about 64 percent. Of the 61 \n     fiscal systems analyzed, Cameroon had the lowest government \n     take at about 11 percent, and at the other end of the \n     spectrum, Iran had the highest government take at about 93 \n     percent.\n       A third study, issued by Van Meurs Corporation in 1997, \n     analyzed 324 fiscal systems in 159 countries. The study \n     showed that, out of 324 fiscal systems, Gulf of Mexico water \n     greater than 800 meters ranked lower than 298 other systems \n     with a federal government take of about 41 percent and Gulf \n     of Mexico water between 200 and 400 meters ranked lower than \n     276 systems with a federal government take of about 47 \n     percent. The study also indicated that governments tend to \n     compete regionally and that the regional average government \n     take for countries within North America was about 57 percent.\n       Finally, one of the first expanded, or comprehensive, \n     studies was completed by Van Meurs Corporation in 1994 for \n     the World Bank. That study showed that the government take \n     from federal onshore lands, Gulf of Mexico deepwater, and \n     Gulf of Mexico shallow, ranked lower than 194, 191, and 180 \n     out of 226 fiscal systems in 144 countries, territories, and \n     joint development zones analyzed.\n       The last few years of high oil and gas prices and record \n     industry profits have been a factor in causing a number of \n     resource owners to reevaluate their fiscal systems. For \n     example, and as already discussed, the State of Alaska \n     enacted in 2006, a new oil and gas production tax law which, \n     among other things, imposed a 22.5 percent tax on oil company \n     profits. In addition, at least five states--including New \n     Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin--\n     and Alberta Province in Canada are considering new oil and \n     gas tax legislative proposals.\n       The level of government take can influence investment in \n     oil and gas development and production. Resource owners are \n     competing to some extent for finite private investment in oil \n     and gas development, and in considering the ideal \n     government take, the resource owners must consider that \n     there may be a trade-off between the magnitude of \n     government take and the level of investment. From the oil \n     and gas industry's perspective, government take represents \n     one of the costs of doing business. As with any industry, \n     if the costs in one geographic area increase, industry may \n     pursue locations elsewhere.\n       In addition to the overall government take, the mix of \n     taxes, fees, and royalty rates that comprise the government \n     take may also be important in determining the level of \n     investment. For example, in commenting on Alaska's then-\n     proposed revisions to its oil and gas tax law, a BP official \n     testified that a fiscal system should be equitable to \n     investors and the government alike and should be profit-\n     related, that is, with a tax levied on profits not revenues. \n     Similarly a ConocoPhillips official testified that a balanced \n     fiscal system is critical for future oil and gas investment \n     in Alaska and that Alaska must maintain its fiscal system \n     competitiveness on a global basis.\n       Further, the size of oil and gas reserves, the costs of \n     exploration and development, and the stability of the \n     government and regulatory environment play a role in \n     companies' investment decisions. In many regards, the United \n     States is a desirable place to invest in oil and gas \n     development and production. For example, of non-OPEC \n     countries, the United States held almost 10 percent of oil \n     reserves as of 2006. In addition, including the existence of \n     a nearby market for all that is produced, the United States \n     is generally considered a stable place to invest, especially \n     when compared to many countries, such as Venezuela and \n     Nigeria, that have large oil and gas reserves. For example, \n     in Venezuela, it was reported last year that the government \n     had taken a series of steps to increase the government take \n     as well as take greater control over oil operations in that \n     country, and in Nigeria, it was recently reported that there \n     have been repeated instances of oil company employees being \n     kidnapped or attacked. However, much of the estimated oil \n     reserves in the United States, such as those in the deepwater \n     areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and the smaller pockets of oil \n     remaining in mature oil fields will be more costly to develop \n     than oil in some other regions, and these higher costs are a \n     deterrent for investment. In addition, to the extent that \n     environmental regulations in the United States are stricter \n     than in some other oil producing countries, this could \n     increase compliance costs and necessitate to some extent a \n     lower government take in the\n\n[[Page S8049]]\n\n     United States. Further, to the extent that labor costs are a \n     factor in determining the profitability of oil development \n     projects, the United States may have higher labor costs than \n     some other oil producing countries, and this would also \n     necessitate, to some extent, a lower government take.\n\n\n  increasing royalty rates on future federal oil and gas leases would \n              likely increase the federal government take\n\n       Increasing royalty rates on future federal oil and gas \n     leases would likely increase the federal government take but \n     by less than the percentage increase in the royalty rate \n     itself because higher royalty rates will likely reduce some \n     taxes and other fees and may also discourage some development \n     and production compared to what it would be under lower \n     government take conditions. For example, because the federal \n     government assesses taxes on corporate profits, an increase \n     in royalty rates would raise oil and gas company costs, \n     thereby reducing their profits and, consequently, \n     the corporate income taxes they pay. In addition, an \n     increase in royalty rates may reduce the amount, in fees \n     or bonuses, oil and gas companies are willing to pay for \n     the rights to develop individual leases. Because such fees \n     or bonuses are determined competitively, this may lead to \n     lower government revenue. Finally, higher royalty rates \n     may deter some development or production of oil and gas if \n     companies can find more profitable investment \n     opportunities elsewhere and for which other factors, such \n     as stability and the amount of oil and gas reserves are \n     comparable.\n       MMS' analysis that accompanied a recently announced \n     increase in the royalty rate for new federal deepwater \n     offshore Gulf of Mexico leases illustrates how the increase \n     in royalty rates can be offset somewhat by reduced fees and \n     production. MMS estimates that the increased royalty rate of \n     16.67 percent--from 12.5 percent--will increase revenue from \n     royalty payments by $4.5 billion over 20 years. However, MMS \n     also recognized that this royalty rate increase will likely \n     cause declines in bonus and rental revenues as well as reduce \n     oil and gas production compared to what it would have been \n     under the lower royalty rate. Specifically, MMS estimated a \n     decline of bonus and rental revenues amounting to $820 \n     million over 20 years and a decline in production of 5 \n     percent, or 110 million barrels of oil equivalent, over 20 \n     years compared to what production would have been at the \n     lower rate. Nonetheless, MMS estimates that by 2017, the net \n     increase in total revenue will still be substantial.\n       In addition to revenue considerations, there are a number \n     of other considerations that could be considered when \n     establishing a royalty rate or the overall government take. \n     These include environmental issues and socioeconomic effects. \n     Royalties or other fees or taxes may reduce the amount of \n     investment in oil and gas development and production and, \n     therefore, to the extent that higher royalty rates reduce oil \n     and gas development and production in the United States, \n     could be used as a policy tool to reduce the domestic \n     environmental impacts of oil and gas development. Regarding \n     socioeconomic effects of oil and gas development and \n     production, a 2006 study done under contract for MMS noted \n     that as the oil and gas industry expands output in the Gulf \n     of Mexico, employment levels in all Gulf Coast states--\n     including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas--tend to \n     rise to meet industry needs.\n       As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce \n     the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further \n     distribution until 30 days from the date of this report.

Gaffigan,\n\n                                Acting Director, Natural Resources\n                                                  and Environment.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this General Accounting Office report makes \nit very clear that relative to all the other countries in the world, \nour taxpayers are not getting a fair shake. So this is ultimately about \ncutting back on subsidies the President says are not needed in order to \ncreate markets and to prevent the taxpayers of this country from being \nfleeced.\n  I thank my colleague. I know Senator Schumer has been patient.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcConnell be added as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: Do I have 5 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is my lucky day, Mr. President.\n  I rise to speak against the amendment offered by my good friend from \nArizona which will restore many of the tax breaks for big oil we voted \nto eliminate in the Finance Committee just yesterday.\n  After a wave of mergers in the industry over the past two decades, we \nnow have an elite group of five very large integrated oil companies \ndominating our domestic petroleum market. These companies are price \nleadership. They all seem to set the same price. They don't get in a \nroom and do it. One leads and the others follow. They wink at each \nother. It shouldn't be legal, but it is.\n  They have the power to block alternative fuels, such as E85, at their \nbranded stations and, as we all know, they have the political power to \nsecure billions of dollars in tax breaks they don't need and we can \nill-afford.\n  It is time to get serious about our energy policy and stop giving \naway taxpayers' dollars that just end up in the pockets of big oil \nrather than going to renewable energy alternatives or curbing the cost \nof gasoline at the pump.\n  On the surface, it seems that big oil is pumping cash rather than \npumping petrol. They don't try to find much new oil, and ExxonMobile \nalone bought back $29 billion of its stock in the last year. The bottom \nline is, if they have all this extra money to buy back their stock, why \nare we giving them tax breaks?\n  When the head of ExxonMobile, one of the big oil companies, came to \nus in the Judiciary Committee, he said he didn't believe in alternative \nfuels. I wouldn't either if I were the head of one of the five big oil \ncompanies that had an oligopolistic stranglehold on the market. I \nwouldn't want an alternative. So they are not going to do what most \nother businesses, where there was a semblance of competition, would do: \nfind a new product because they know their old product is getting \nexpensive and may run out someday.\n  So that is our job. We are taking back these taxes. We are not just \nputting them into the Treasury. It is not taxing for taxing sake. We \nare putting them into tax breaks for alternative fuels. Since the oil \ncompanies would not look at alternatives, we are going to take the \nmoney that we have given them in taxes, and never should have, and give \nit to other companies that will invest in alternative fuels.\n  This is a mature industry by any standard and no longer does it need \ntax breaks. I have actually introduced a bill to repeal every special \ntax break received by the major oil and gas companies.\n  The policy of giving them breaks has failed. Despite ever-increasing \npetroleum products and general Federal tax giveaways, the oil companies \ndon't believe they need to compete. The oil companies believe they \ndon't need to compete to create new domestic gasoline supply. We \nhaven't had a new refinery built in 30 years. When they have merged, \nthey have closed refineries. So it hasn't worked.\n  While ExxonMobile doled out $29 billion, or 60 percent of its \ncashflow, on stock buyback alone, their overall production has barely \nbudged since the 1999 merger. Exxon never should have been allowed to \nmerge with Mobile. On the Joint Economic Committee, we are looking it \nover, seeing if we can look into undoing some of those unfortunate \nmergers, which occurred, by the way, under both Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents. But at the same time, we have to get moving on \nalternative fuels.\n  The Finance Committee chairman and ranking member--bipartisan--were \nright to scale back the tax breaks that go to this very profitable \nindustry and instead target them to renewable energy in a way that \nensures technology will succeed.\n  The finance amendment extends tax breaks for alternative fuels by \nseveral additional years. When we were at our issues conference in New \nYork City, DPC, Democratic Policy Committee, we heard a brilliant \npresentation by an investment banker from Goldman Sachs who said we are \ngreat at developing new technologies, but we are not very good at \ncommercializing them, implementing them. That is because the tax breaks \nwe give go for a year, 2\n\n[[Page S8050]]\n\nyears, and no business wants to invest when they are not sure these \nbreaks will continue.\n  The proposal in the bill, which I was proud to cosponsor, says the \ntax breaks will be extended for 5 years and longer so that companies \nwill know they do keep those tax breaks and have an incentive to \ninvest. So it makes eminent sense. Take the money away from taxes for \nthe oil companies which refuse to engage in finding alternatives and \ngive them to new companies that will. It is a policy that makes sense \nfor the good of the consumer because, in the long run, it will lower \nprices; for the good of our foreign policy because it will decrease our \ndependence on dictators and potentates we don't like, such as the heads \nof Iran and Venezuela; and it is good for our climate because as we \nmove to alternative fuels, less CO2 will be put in the \natmosphere.\n  For the first time in 6 years, this Congress is willing to stand up \nto the oil companies. I know many on the other side of the aisle \naren't. The previous energy bills reflect what the Bush administration \nbelieves: What is good for the oil companies is good for our energy \npolicy is good for America. They are wrong, as the price at the pump, \nas the increase of CO2 in our air reveals, and as our \nincreasing imports of oil show. We are changing that policy.\n  I know others on the other side of the aisle are blocking us because \nof obeisance to big oil, but we will succeed because the American \npeople are behind us, and our country needs no less.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I was unable to be present during the vote \non the Gregg amendment due to a previously scheduled conflict. But had \nI been present, I would have voted against waiving the Budget Act in \nrelation to the Gregg amendment to eliminate the 54-cents-per-gallon \ntariff on imported ethanol.\n  This amendment to lift the tariff against Brazilian ethanol would \nmerely replace our dependence on foreign oil with a new dependence on \nforeign ethanol. If we are serious about addressing national and \neconomic security, we need to develop a robust renewable fuels industry \nin this country. This amendment would frustrate that goal.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the two amendments \nproposed yesterday, which invest in coal particularly as a \ntransportation fuel and which threaten to increase the dangers of \nclimate change rather than lessening them. These two amendments offer \nthe Senate false choice: either to reduce our dependence on foreign oil \nor to worsen the rise of global climate change. But the truth is, we \ndon't have to choose between our security at home and the security of \nour planet.\n  Energy policy today is more critical than ever because it touches on \nnot one but two of our most vital national interests: namely, energy \nsecurity and climate change. We cannot afford to sacrifice our fight \nagainst climate change at the altar of energy independence. Promoting \nthe conversion of domestic coal to liquefied fuel will dramatically \nincrease CO2 emissions and that is no better than robbing \nPeter to pay Paul.\n  The truth is, we can break the stranglehold of foreign oil, we can \ncreate new jobs in energy, and we can strengthen our hand addressing \nglobal climate change and we shouldn't settle for approaches that don't \nhelp us achieve all three of these national imperatives.\n  Here's what scientists are telling us: On nearly a weekly basis, we \nsee mounting scientific evidence highlighting the need to act. The most \nrecent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nwritten by more than 600 scientists, reviewed by another 600 experts, \nand edited by officials from 154 governments has confirmed the threat \nand the need for urgent action.\n  Because it will set back the fight against climate change, coal to \nliquids offers us--at best--a Pyrrhic victory in our struggle to create \na sensible, sustainable energy policy. Study after study has shown that \nliquid fuels derived from coal produce significantly higher \nCO2 emissions than traditional fuels. Transforming coal into \nliquid fuel involves heating it to 1,000 degrees and mixing it with \nwater to create a gas, which is then converted into fuel usable in cars \nand jets. If that sounds like an energy-intensive process, it is. And \nenergy-intensive processes generate a lot of CO2 emissions. \nEvery gallon of liquid fuels derived from coal produces up to 2.5 times \nmore well-to-wheels global warming emissions than gasoline or diesel \nfuel from crude oil. That means that even with 85 percent capture of \nCO2 during production, well-to-wheels Coal to Liquid \nemissions are 19-25 percent higher than conventional gasoline or \ndiesel.\n  I understand that all coal-to-liquids amendments are not created \nequal my Democratic coal State colleagues have attempted to build \nenvironmental safeguards into their amendments. And I thank them for \nthat. The Bunning amendment, by contrast, is full of loopholes and \nhollow environmental mandates that crumble under scrutiny, leaving only \nbig subsidies for big coal. But ultimately neither should pass. This is \na question of priorities, and with limited Federal dollars available, \nwe need to support those technologies that promise the greatest oil \nsavings and the greatest emissions reductions.\n  We should be turning to increased fuel economy standards, increased \nenergy efficiency standards for commercial and residential buildings, \nstrong renewable electricity standards, and incentives for biofuels and \nadvanced vehicles.\n  Let me repeat--this is a question of priorities.\n  I would like to briefly address several of the arguments that are \nbeing made by coal-to-liquids industry supporters. These arguments are \nintended to confuse what is a very complicated process. I will do my \nbest to unmask their arguments and make the reality as clear as \npossible.\n  First, many proponents cite the emissions reductions associated with \ncoprocessing coal and biomass at coal-to-liquids production facilities. \nHowever, these benefits simply come from using a promising new clean \ntechnology to mask the flaws of coal. These coprocessing facilities, \nwhen equipped with carbon capture, may indeed result in lower emissions \nthan traditional fuels, but this has nothing to do with the coal and \neverything to do with the biomass. We should be having a serious \nconversation about biomass and how it can be best integrated into our \nenergy supply, which is a matter of some large debate, rather than \nblindly buying into the coal industry's assumption that coprocessing \nbiomass and coal is the most direct road to a clean energy future.\n  Second, proponents focus on tailpipe emissions and argue that diesel \nfuel produced from coal-to-liquids has fewer emissions than traditional \ngasoline.\n  Again, we need to make sure we are comparing apples to apples. The \ntremendous increase in well-to-wheels CO2 emissions comes \nduring the production process, not at the point of tailpipe emissions. \nIn fact, tailpipe emissions from diesel generated from crude oil and \ndiesel generated from coal are roughly the same. Same story with \ngasoline generated from crude oil and gasoline generated from coal. \nComparing diesel to gasoline is just a distraction diesel engines are \nmore efficient than gasoline engines and therefore emit less \nCO2, regardless of whether you are talking about traditional \nfuels or coal-to-liquids\n  Third, proponents talk about the environmental benefits associated \nwith coal-to-liquids. This is frankly laughable.\n  I have spoken about the doubling of emissions associated with the \ncoal-to-liquids production process. But if we are talking about the \nenvironmental impacts of coal mining, we have to look even beyond the \nemissions and consider the severe impacts to water quality. In \nAppalachia alone, mountaintop removal has destroyed more than 2,500 \nmountain peaks and leveled more than 1 million acres. This waste is \ndumped into river valleys and contaminates over 1,200 rivers and \nstreams throughout the region. That waste, combined with acidic mine \nrunoff, destroys habitat for fish and wildlife everywhere that coal is \nmined today. Before we jump-start a new industry in this country and \nramp up coal production, we need to have a serious conversation about \nthese and other impacts.\n  There are too many unknowns associated with coal-to-liquids \ntechnology, but here is what we do know: well-to-wheel emissions are \ntwo and a half\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\ntimes those of traditional fuels, and even when carbon capture is \napplied which has not yet been demonstrated on a commercial scale \nemissions are 19-25 percent greater than traditional fuels.\n  The cost of these plants is exorbitant MIT estimates that the cost of \nconstructing a coal-to-liquids plant is four times that of a \ntraditional refinery. The same study estimated that it would cost $70 \nbillion to build enough plants to replace 10 percent of American \ngasoline consumption.\n  Finally, I would like to close by saying a few words on another issue \nthat will be coming to a vote later this afternoon. Senators Cardin and \nMikulski have introduced an amendment addressing the siting of \nliquefied natural gas terminals. This is an important amendment, and I \nam proud to support and cosponsor it. This is a contentious issue in \nFall River, MA, where powerful interests are fighting to construct a \nLNG terminal far too close to a major population center. This proposal \nis strongly opposed by Governor Patrick and numerous State and Federal \nrepresentatives. I strongly support Senators Cardin and Mikulski's \namendment, which would require state approval of LNG siting decisions. \nWhile LNG is an important part of our clean energy mix, it is essential \nthat these facilities be sited in safe and appropriate locations. This \namendment guarantees the state its appropriate and necessary role in \napproving these decisions. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the important \nlegislation under consideration. Like many of the bills the Senate has \ntaken up this year, it is the product of Democrats and Republicans \nworking together, and I commend its authors for their hard work.\n  The bill before us does the things the Nation must do to become more \nenergy self-reliant, starting with raising fuel economy standards for \ncars and trucks. Over 30 years ago I cosponsored Scoop Jackson's \nlegislation which first established fuel economy standards to improve \nthe fuel efficiency of automobiles. Unfortunately, very little progress \nhas been made since then.\n  There is no silver bullet for ending our dependence on foreign oil or \nslowing the rate of greenhouse gas emissions, but raising CAFE \nstandards is the single most important step we can take to make \npositive changes in this area. Increasing the average efficiency of \npassenger cars by just over 5 miles per gallon would eliminate the need \nfor American oil imports from the Persian Gulf. The CAFE provision the \nCommerce Committee reported will increase fuel economy in cars from \n27.5 miles a gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. It is the best \nchance this Congress will have to raise fuel economy standards, and I \nhope that the Senate will preserve the Commerce Committee's strong \nprovisions.\n  The bill will make more cars capable of running on biofuels. Ethanol, \nin particular, has incredible promise as a biofuel, and it will emit \nfar less carbon dioxide than conventional oil. The bill will ramp up \nproduction of biofuels over the next 15 years and mandate that a \ngrowing number of new vehicles be able to run on these kinds of fuels. \nIt also provides funding to ensure that these new biofuels can reach \nfuel stations across the country. This provision is particularly \nimportant to New England, which has just one E85 pump located in \nChelsea, MA. Brazil has shown us the way by producing ethanol from \nsugarcane in amounts equivalent to 300,000 barrels of oil each day. The \nUnited States must invest in biofuels, so that we too can reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  The bill also reauthorizes the Weatherization Assistance Program, \nwhich is especially important for low-income families struggling with \nhigh energy costs throughout the Nation. In Massachusetts, energy costs \nare among the highest in the Nation, but this program has weatherized \nmore than 10,000 homes in the last decade. Vulnerable families can't \nafford to make these expensive improvements themselves, so these wise \ninvestments by the government will help families save on energy and \nreduce the Nation's fossil fuel emissions.\n  Another critical issue is the inclusion of a strong renewable \nelectricity standard. The RES will provide the certainty the renewable \nenergy market needs to invest in innovative technologies. In April, \nSenators Durbin, Snowe, and Reid led a bipartisan letter expressing \nsupport for mandating that major utilities generate a percentage of \ntheir electricity from renewable sources. I was one of the 50 Senators \nwho signed the letter, and I commend Chairman Bingaman for his work on \na renewable electricity standard.\n  I also commend the Finance Committee for its work to provide tax \nincentives for renewable energy technology, and repealing tax breaks \nfor oil and gas companies. While most Americans are seeing less and \nless in their paychecks, the Big Oil companies are making money hand \nover fist. During the first quarter of this year, Big Oil reaped $29.5 \nbillion in profits. Repealing these tax breaks will save taxpayers \nbillions of dollars in subsidies to Big Oil and allow the Nation to \ninvest in clean energy technologies.\n  Last week, I joined Senator Salazar, Senator Smith and several other \nSenators in urging the Finance Committee to extend tax incentives for \nfuel cell technology. Hydrogen fuel cells are an energy storage \ntechnology, like batteries, that can deliver clean and reliable power. \nThey have a broad range of uses for vehicles, auxiliary power units, \nand electronic devices, and they are helping us diversify our fuel \nsupply and find better ways to deliver clean energy. Massachusetts is \namong the world's major centers of this technology, with more than 60 \ncompanies involved in fuel cell and hydrogen technologies. I commend \nChairman Baucus and the Finance Committee for allowing tax credits for \nthis important technology.\n  Overall, this bill brings us closer to a cleaner and more secure \nenergy future for our nation, and I look forward to its enactment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8051-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8051-S8052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here to speak for a few minutes in \nsupport of the Employee Free Choice Act, which the Senate will be \nvoting on, we hope, this week. I listened to Senator Schumer talk about \nevening the playing field in the area of energy, where the oil \ncompanies have long dominated, and now it is time to give some \nrenewable companies a chance so we can actually have an even playing \nfield for energy, and so we can stop depending on these foreign oil \ncompanies and stop spending $200,000 a minute on foreign oil. I am here \ntoday to talk about evening the playing field in another way, and that \nis with the Employee Free Choice Act.\n  I support this act because I believe we need to level the playing \nfield for working people in this country, and this bill will do that by \nprotecting the workers and by creating a fair and a smooth process for \norganizers.\n  It is getting harder and harder for working families in America to \nget by. Millions of workers have been left behind in this economy. With \nonly a very small number of people doing incredibly well, millions of \nworkers have been left behind. They are struggling to make ends meet \nwith stagnant wages and declining benefits.\n  I see this in my State. I go to small towns, and about 100 people \nwill show up in a cafe, and I think, why are all these people here? I \nrealize that when the cost of college has gone up 100 percent in 10 \nyears, as it has in our State, when you are a middle-class person and \nyou can hardly make it day to day, you feel it first. When you have gas \nat $3 a gallon, you feel it in your pocketbook. When health care costs \ngo up 100 percent, as they have in our State, you feel it first when \nyou are a middle-class person. That is what we are seeing all over this \ncountry.\n  Unions help all workers, not just those that are in a union. Unions \nhelped build this country and have lifted millions of Americans out of \npoverty. As we go forward as a nation, unions will continue to be the \nfriend of working men and women everywhere.\n  But for too many workers, forming unions at their workplace simply is \nnot an option. Approximately 60 million workers--that is 60 million--\nsay they\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\nwant to join a union right now, and the reasons why are clear: Union \nworkers earn 30 percent more than nonunion workers; union workers are \n62 percent more likely to have employer-provided health coverage; and \nunion workers are 400 percent more likely to have access to pension \nplans.\n  For millions of workers, access to fair wages and decent benefits is \nbeing denied because the current process for forming unions has become \nflawed. In my State, we are lucky to have some great companies and \nhonest employers that, to a large extent, treat their workers with the \nrespect and dignity they deserve. But there are those companies across \nthis country that don't play by the rules, where workers considering \nunionization face intimidation and termination from employers.\n  According to national labor data, workers are illegally fired in one-\nquarter of all union organizing campaigns, including one in five active \nunion supporters. When workers are systematically denied rights to fair \nwages and benefits, we all lose, and we need to take action.\n  In my last job, I was a county attorney in the largest county in \nMinnesota. For 8 years, I managed an office of nearly 400 unionized \nemployees. I always believed they should be treated with the same level \nof respect they showed the people we represented, the victims of crime, \nthe people who needed someone there to stand up for them. This bill \ncreates that kind of respect.\n  This bill will create a process that will be fair and will even the \nplaying field. This bill will help workers. The Employee Free Choice \nAct places the decision to form a union where it belongs--it places it \nin the hands of America's workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, today is West Virginia's birthday. \nEstablished on June 20, 1863, West Virginia became the 35th star in our \nnational constellation, taking her place between Kansas, which joined \nthe Union on January 29, 1861, and Nevada, which joined on October 31, \n1864. I am pleased to offer West Virginia happy birthday wishes and to \ntake the opportunity to share a bit about my State with the rest of the \ncountry.\n  I urge anyone who has not visited West Virginia to do so, to see and \nexperience for themselves the great natural beauty, the friendly \npeople, the exquisite art, recreation, and cultural sites and events \nthat fill our mountain home.\n  As a State, West Virginia is a youthful 144 years old. As a unique \npiece of geography, of course, West Virginia is, of course, much older. \nThe Appalachian Mountains that define West Virginia's geography today \nare but the worn remains of a once-high alpine plateau similar to \nTibet, rising some 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, flanked on the south and \non the east by the Allegheny Mountain Range, which may have once \nexceeded today's Himalaya Mountains in height.\n  Of course, that was a long time ago, perhaps 250 million years ago, \nwhen the great wedge of coastal sediments deposited during the earlier \nDevonian and Carboniferous periods were thrust up toward the heavens.\n  Today, a bit of that alpine experience can be found in Tucker County \nand in Randolph County, in an area known as Dolly Sods. Filled with \nupland bogs, beaver ponds, and flat rocky plains, Dolly Sods is a bit \nof northern Canada transplanted into West Virginia, complete with \nbeautiful fall color and harsh winter weather.\n  The rock that forms West Virginia's mountains, that is seamed with \nthe State's famous coal deposits, was laid down some 320 to 286 million \nyears ago, when West Virginia was part of a vast complex of coastal \nswamplands. In this endless tropical forest of primitive ferns and \ntowering, primitive trees formed layer after layer of peat, compressed \ninto coal seams that average 3 feet thick but which can reach 25 feet \nin thickness.\n  When one learns that 12 inches of coal requires approximately 10,000 \nyears of continuous peat accumulation to form, one sees a very \ndifferent picture of West Virginia. The reminders of this different \nworld can still be found in the coal, in the form of lacy, ferny fossil \nleaves and stems, the last farewell of a lost world.\n  In other rock layers, there is evidence of West Virginia's earlier \ndays as well, in the sea creatures forever preserved and now exposed \nfar inland and at elevations well above the sea level that they knew in \nlife.\n  In the New River Gorge, visitors have the opportunity to view rock \nsequences from those early years, 320 to 330 million years ago. \nVisitors can also see a more recent phenomenon in the form of the New \nRiver Gorge Bridge, the longest single-arch steel bridge in the world, \nrising some 876 feet above the water below. Beautiful natural stone \nworks of art may also be seen in the Smoke Hole area and Seneca Rocks \nin Grant and Pendleton Counties and in many other locations around the \nState.\n  West Virginia's natural beauty, as well as its wonderful outdoor \nactivities, can be found in each of West Virginia's 55 counties. From \nhot air ballooning or soaring to spelunking, from rock climbing to \nkayaking, hiking, horseback riding, or off-roading, one can be as \nenergetic as one likes. You can also fish, ride a tube down a river, \nsit around a campfire, or sip lemonade in a rocking chair while you \nrest and recharge.\n  West Virginia is not simply for nature lovers, however. The State is \nfull of festivals that celebrate virtually every foodstuff, musical \nform, and artistic discipline known to mankind. Musical events that \nrange from bluegrass music to symphonies to garage bands, and shopping \nand sightseeing to please all tastes and interests.\n  West Virginia is famous, famous for her quilts, pottery, and handmade \ncrafts, but there is also plenty of modern work alongside the homespun \nfavorites.\n  From rustic campsites to the luxury of the Greenbrier, West Virginia \nhas something for everybody, something for everyone. It could easily \ntake a lifetime to experience everything there is to see and to do. By \nthen, of course, time and nature will have changed a few more things \nand created new things to see and do.\n  So as West Virginia celebrates, I hope that you may be inspired to \npay a visit. I hope all Senators may be inspired to pay a visit. You \n``ain't'' seen nothing yet like it. The daylilies are blooming in great \norange rafts of blossoms above the waves of green leaves, welcoming the \nday. Butterflies and songbirds delight the eye with color like the \nribbons on a birthday present. Cool breezes are blowing, the mocking \nbird is singing, rivers are tumbling between the mountains, singing \nbirthday songs. And tonight the stars will dance for you as West \nVirginia celebrates.\n  I close with a poem about West Virginia, by West Virginian Louise \nMcNeill, from her book titled, ``Hill Daughter: New and Selected \nPoems.'' Louise McNeill was born in 1911 in Pocahontas County and \nbecame West Virginia's Poet Laureate in 1979.\n\n                             West Virginia\n\n       Where the mountain river flows\n       And the rhododendron grows\n       Is the land of all the lands\n       That I touch with tender hands;\n\n       Loved and treasured, earth and star,\n       By my father's father far--\n       Deep-earth, black-earth, of-the-lime\n       From the ancient oceans' time.\n\n       Plow-land, fern-land, woodland, shade,\n       Grave-land where my kin are laid,\n       West Virginia's hills to bless--\n       Leafy songs of wilderness;\n\n       Dear land, near land, here at home--\n       Where the rocks are honeycomb,\n       And the rhododendrons . . .\n       Where the mountain river runs.\n\n\n                      HONORING CHARLESTON'S HEROES\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about some real \nheroes\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\nand their real sacrifices this week. Late Monday, a horrible blaze in \nCharleston, SC, claimed the lives of nine local firefighters. Details \nare still being investigated, but what we know now is these heroes died \ntrying to save lives. We fear most were caught under a collapsed roof \nin the quick-spreading flames.\n  My heart goes out to the families, friends, and coworkers of these \nfirefighters. These were courageous public servants. We will miss them \ndearly. They paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. In the \naftermath, our State's low country must deal with the shock and sorrow \nof these losses. Our job as citizens is to never forget what they did \nand to try to turn the shock and sorrow into solemn remembrance and a \ncommitment to help their families.\n  I also want to mention two other Charleston leaders who are \nstruggling with this situation on the ground: Fire Chief Rusty Thomas, \nand city of Charleston Mayor Joe Riley. According to news reports, \nChief Thomas stayed up Monday night meeting with many of the families \nof the victims. He was on the scene all night.\n  The police chief, Greg Mullen, said:\n\n  Chief Thomas is a true leader.\n\n  I could not agree more. Mayor Riley is no stranger when it comes to \ndealing with disaster. His leadership during the trying aftermath of \nHurricane Hugo was instrumental in our quick recovery. His leadership \nwill greatly aid the Charleston Fire Department now as they attempt to \nmove forward.\n  Firefighters represent the best our country has to offer. I will \nnever forget these hometown heroes and the tremendous sacrifice they \nmade this week. For the families of those who lost loved ones in \nCharleston, our words are feeble comfort for them, but we will always \nhonor the memory and sacrifice of these heroic public servants of South \nCarolina.\n\n       For the families and friends of firefighters who remain on \n     the job today, we pray for them as the Psalmist did, that God \n     would be their ``refuge and strength, a very present help in \n     time of trouble.''\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today is a special day: one which is \nspecial to me and the nearly 2 million residents of the State of West \nVirginia. On this day in 1863 West Virginia entered the Union as the \n35th State.\n  West Virginia is America. West Virginia is a place where people are \nproud of who they are and not what they have. It is a place where \nneighbor helping neighbor means something. Where community, faith, and \nfamily are not taken for granted.\n  The area now known as West Virginia was originally settled thousands \nof years ago by Native Americans. The 17th and 18th centuries saw the \nfirst pioneering European settlers who came across the Appalachians \nlooking for an expansive new homestead. The 19th century saw America's \ndarkest hour in the Civil War. But, it was in this conflict that \nWestern Virginia separated from Virginia standing on its own, faithful \nthe Union, and earning statehood. From that day to today, West Virginia \nhas been an important part of America.\n  Our coal powers America. Our steel built America's cities from the \nground up. Our timber built America's homes. Our chemical industry has \nimproved the quality of life for all Americans. And yet today, it is \nanother resource, West Virginia's most precious one, this is driving a \nnew generation of West Virginians. West Virginia is home to some of the \nmost pristine natural beauty in our Nation. Visitors from around the \ncountry--around the world--come to take in the majestic mountain \nvistas, explore our forests, celebrate our Appalachian heritage, fish, \nski, and hit the links, and most importantly spread time with our \npeople.\n  So, just who are these people? They have stout hearts, courage, and \nan unfaltering determination. These qualities are particularly evident \nin West Virginia veterans like Chester Merriman, the youngest person to \nserve in World War I at just 14 years of age, or Hershel ``Woody'' \nWilliams, who received a Congressional Medal of Honor in World War II \nfor his heroism during the Battle for Iwo Jima, epitomize how West \nVirginians have proudly served their country no matter when--from the \nCivil War to today's conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, there \nare more than 200,000 veterans living in the State giving West Virginia \nthe highest per capita of any State in the country.\n  I could go on and on and say the same thing about West Virginia's \ncoal miners, steel workers, loggers, and chemical plant workers all of \nwhom are truly the hardest working, finest people you ever spend time \nwith. I know because I have.\n  West Virginia is my home and I am proud of that. I feel genuinely \nblessed to have been able to serve the people of West Virginia for as \nlong as I have. West Virginia Day has always been a day resonating \ndeeply inside of me and my fellow West Virginians. Happy 144th Birthday \nWest Virginia! I ask that you, my distinguished colleagues join us in \nour celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8053-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8053-S8054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Employee Free \nChoice Act sponsored by Senator Kennedy. Unions helped build our \ncountry. They have led the fight for critical worker safety and worker \nrights protections that all Americans now enjoy. They help raise wages \nfor low- and middle-wage workers and can help close the gap from rising \nincome inequalities.\n  Being a part of a union pays off for workers. For example, union \ncashiers earn 46 percent more than nonunion cashiers. Union food \npreparation workers earn 50 percent more than nonunion food preparation \nworkers. And union maids and housekeepers earn 31 percent more than \nnonunion maids and housekeepers. Overall, median weekly earnings for \nunion workers are $191 higher than those of nonunion workers, and this \ndifference is even more significant for minority groups.\n  Union workers are also almost twice as likely to receive employer-\nsponsored health benefits and more than four times more likely to have \na secure, defined-benefit pension plan than nonunion workers.\n  The rate of unionization in America is declining and with it workers' \nincome. In 1973, 42.4 percent of workers in Michigan were in unions. By \n2006, that number had fallen to just 19.7 percent of workers. As union \nmembership declines, so has Michigan's real median household income, \nwhich fell 14.9 percent between 1999 and 2005.\n  The problem is not a lack of interest from workers. Fifty-three \npercent of U.S. workers state they would join a union if they could and \n62 percent believe they would be worse off if unions did not exist.\n  The problem is the difficulties that are presented to those who seek \nto unionize a shop or industry. The current system does not adequately \nprotect the workers that unionization campaigns are supposed to help \nand support. Workers are fired in 25 percent of private-sector union \norganizing campaigns. Seventy-eight percent of employers require that \nsupervisors deliver antiunion messages to their employees. One-third of \nworkers who unionize their workplace never even get a contract.\n  We have a duty to make sure that workers who want to join unions and \nunionize their workplace can do so, and that's what the Employee Free \nChoice Act will do.\n  The most significant provision in the bill allows for a union shop to \nbe created through a process called a majority sign-up. Majority sign-\nup has been used for at least the past 70 years. In 2004, for example, \nabout five times as many workers joined the AFL-CIO through a majority \nsign-up than those who were able to unionize through the National Labor \nRelations Board process. A majority sign up process results in less \nemployer pressure and fewer delays than NLRB elections.\n  Currently, however, employers do not have to recognize employees that \nhave a majority sign-up as a union, although many responsible \ncompanies, including Cingular and Kaiser Permanente, do. This bill \nwould change that--if a majority of workers signs authorizations \ndesignating a union as their bargaining representative, then that union \nwould be recognized as such.\n  Opponents of this bill have spread a great deal of misinformation \nabout this provision. Many people believe the bill would take away an \nemployee's right to a ``secret ballot'' union election. That is not \ntrue. This bill would still allow individuals the right to an NLRB\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\nsupervised election if at least 30 percent of employees want it. This \nbill also allows employees to form unions using another method as well.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act would also establish penalties for \ncompanies that coerce or intimidate employees and would provide for \nmediation and binding arbitration when the employer and workers cannot \nagree on a first contract. In short, it makes needed updates to our \nlabor laws to better protect workers.\n  By allowing employees to form unions through a majority sign-up, we \nare supporting a worker's freedom to form a union and to bargain for \nbetter pay and better benefits. Experience has shown that this will be \na good deal for the worker and a boost for America.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, since joining this body in 1993, I have \nsupported a number of initiatives to help the hard working men and \nwomen of this country, including increasing the minimum wage, \nsupporting equal pay for America's workers, and promoting better trade \npolicies. One piece of legislation that would help American workers is \nthe Employee Free Choice Act, EFCA, and I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of EFCA again this Congress. I commend my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for his hard work \non this legislation, as well as his longstanding dedication to \nimproving the quality of life for America's working people.\n  One of the best things we can do for American workers is to remove \nobstacles that make it harder for them to form and join unions. As many \nof my colleagues will likely point out in the course of this debate, \nmore than 60 million U.S. workers say they would join a union today if \nthey could. Further, workers who belong to unions earn 30 percent more \nthan nonunion workers, are 62 percent more likely to have employer-\nprovided health care, and are four times more likely to have a pension. \nBetter wages and better benefits help lift Americans out of poverty and \ninto the middle class. Far too many Americans are working for wages \nthat keep them at or below the Federal poverty line with little, if \nany, opportunity to bargain for better wages and benefits or advance to \na better-paying position.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act would address some of the inequities in \nthe current system of collective bargaining in the U.S. Many critics of \nthis legislation focus on the card check provision, but there is much \nmore to this legislation than just the method of voting. This bill \nprovides for first-contract mediation and arbitration. Importantly, if \nan agreement has not been reached after 90 days of negotiations, either \nthe employer or the employees can refer the dispute to the Federal \nMediation and Conciliation Service for mediation. Clearly, under the \nideal negotiation this would not be necessary, but it is an important \noption for employees to have in the collective bargaining process. The \nbill also provides for stronger penalties for employer violations while \nemployees are attempting to form a union. Employers who intimidate \nworkers attempting to unionize should face appropriate consequences.\n  While I understand that the vote on cloture on the motion to proceed \nto the Employee Free Choice Act may not be successful this week, this \nfight is far from over. Over the last 2 years, I have received over \n1,500 letters, calls, and e-mails in support of this legislation from \nmy constituents, and their voices mean a great deal. I support passage \nof this legislation for the hard-working Wisconsinites who deserve \nbetter from us. I am disappointed that more of my colleagues have not \njoined in supporting this bill, and I hope that they will rethink their \nopposition to this bill. I will continue working to pass this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8054-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRANS-ALASKA PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on June 20, 1977--30 years ago to this \nday--oil began flowing through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. This \nevent represents an important milestone in Alaska's history and a \nwatershed moment in our struggle to secure America's energy \nindependence.\n  My distinguished colleague from Alaska, Senator Lisa Murkowski, spoke \nat length about the history of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline before we \nadjourned last night. As she so vividly illustrated, its creation was a \nmonumental undertaking which required the hard work of countless \nindividuals.\n  During the long political fight to allow this important project to \nproceed, members of the environmental lobby claimed the pipeline would \ndevastate Alaska. History has proven these critics wrong--responsible \ndevelopment and attentive stewardship have ensured the continued \nprotection of our State's wildlife and lands.\n  Even after the Arab oil embargo in 1973, the Senate remained closely \ndivided on this matter. In fact, a tie vote on the authorizing \nlegislation was not broken until Vice President Spiro Agnew cast the \ndecisive vote in its favor. My own vote on that bill still ranks as one \nof the most memorable I have ever cast.\n  When construction began in 1974, this project was the largest ever \nfinanced by private capital. Engineers faced staggering challenges as \nthey plotted a route across 800 miles of rugged terrain and three major \nmountain ranges. Various geographic hurdles also necessitated the \nconstruction of seven airfields, dozens of bridges, and a 360-mile-long \nroad to connect Prudhoe Bay to Fairbanks.\n  Just more than 3 years after construction started, however, the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline was ready to operate. Since then, more than 15.5 \nbillion barrels of crude oil have been sent from Alaska's North Slope, \nthrough the pipeline to Valdez, and on to refineries throughout the \ncountry.\n  The revenues generated by this production have had a tremendous \nimpact in Alaska and throughout the United States. Over the past 30 \nyears, North Slope oil production has added more than $300 billion to \nthe U.S. economy and reduced domestic oil imports by more than $200 \nbillion. Energy will always cost money, but instead of sending our \ndollars overseas, North Slope oil production--made possible by the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline--has greatly contributed to economic growth here \nat home.\n  In Alaska, the economic effects of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline are even \nmore apparent. Last year, revenues from oil production and \ntransportation accounted for nearly 90 percent of the State \ngovernment's total income--funds which were then used to help pay for \nour schools, our roads, and other important projects. North Slope oil \nrevenue also provides the foundation for the permanent fund dividend, \nwhich will help assure the well-being of future generations of \nAlaskans.\n  When oil began to flow through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in 1977, \ngasoline cost a mere 38 cents per gallon. Today, the nationwide average \nhas soared to $3.00 per gallon, and many experts predict this price \nwill reach $4.00 by the end of summer.\n  As those of us in the Senate continue to debate a comprehensive \nenergy policy for our Nation, we must take note of the consequences of \n30 years of oil production in Alaska. Instead of the ecological \ndisaster many predicted, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline has been an economic \nlifeline for our Nation. It continues to prove we can balance \nenvironmental concerns with the production of our natural resources. I \nurge my colleagues to heed this lesson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8054-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8054-S8055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRAVEL PROMOTION ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of the \nTravel Promotion Act of 2007, which I introduced late yesterday with \nSenator Inouye and Senator Dorgan.\n  Our legislation has a simple purpose: To increase the number of \nforeign tourists who visit the United States.\n  To accomplish this goal, two complementary strategies must be \nundertaken: existing travel problems must be resolved, and fundamental \nimprovements must be made to the manner in which we market our country \nto prospective tourists.\n  First, the efficiency of our border entry and screening processes \nmust be improved. The Commerce Committee recently held two hearings on \nthis issue, and industry leaders testified about the adverse effect \nSeptember 11, 2001, has had on travel to the United States.\n  Heightened security measures implemented after 9/11, while necessary, \ncontinue to inconvenience many travelers. We heard witnesses describe \nthe aforementioned difficulties international\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\nvisitors face with regard to our Nation's entry and screening \nprocesses, including the issuance of visas.\n  To address these problems, the Senate has already passed legislation \nthat establishes a ``Model Ports'' program at the 20 busiest \ninternational airports in the United States. This program should reduce \nbottlenecks to safely and efficiently move travelers through the \nscreening process.\n  The legislation we introduced yesterday, the Travel Promotion Act, \nwould establish a nonprofit corporation to promote travel to the United \nStates. This entity would not use one cent of taxpayer funds.\n  Instead, this corporation will be funded by fees paid by travelers \nwho enter our country and matching contributions from members of the \ntravel and tourism industry.\n  The corporation would be led by experts in the travel and tourism \nindustry, appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, and held accountable \nby Congress. This essential step will let foreign visitors know that \nour country is open to tourists.\n  The travel and tourism industry plays an important role in every \nState. Those of us in Congress should take steps to resolve these \npressing issues and encourage tourists to visit America.\n  In my home State of Alaska, the travel and tourism industry is the \nsecond largest private sector employer. More than 24,000 Alaskans hold \ntourism-related jobs, and the industry contributes more than $2 billion \nto our State's economy each year.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8055-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Technical Sergeant Ryan A. Balmer\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay humble tribute to TSgt \nRyan A Balmer, who died of injuries sustained after the denotation of \nan improvised explosive device in Kirkuk, Iraq. A native of Mishawaka, \nIN, Sergeant Balmer was a member of the Air Force Office of Special \nInvestigations and assigned to Hill Air Force Base, UT.\n  Sergeant Balmer was truly a special man. He was an individual deeply \nloved by all who knew him for his kindness, his positive outlook on \nlife, and his infectious smile. Friends close to Special Agent Balmer \nsay he was someone you always wanted to be around. They remembered a \nman who possessed the unique gift of being able to bring out the best \nin everyone and at 6 feet 2 inches tall he commanded respect wherever \nhe went.\n  I understand that Sergeant Balmer was scheduled to come home only \ndays after his passing. I would like to take this opportunity to extend \nmy most heartfelt condolences to his wife Danielle and to his three \nchildren. I want to reiterate what they already know, that he saved \nlives and by his sacrifice that we, as a Nation, enjoy the great \nblessings of freedom so often take for granted. TSgt Ryan A. Balmer is \nan American hero in every sense of the word.\n  The sergeant and his family will be in my prayers forever.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Jesse A. Blamires\n\n  Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one Nation's fallen \nsons, SGT Jesse A. Blamires. Sergeant Blamires was a native of Sandy, \nUT, and a member of the 82nd Airborne Division. He was killed in a \nhelicopter crash in Afghanistan.\n  Sergeant Blamires had a lifelong connection to our Nation's military. \nHis father Craig Blamires, with whom the sergeant enjoyed camping, also \nserved his country in the Army. Eager to pursue his dreams of service, \nSergeant Blamires followed his father's footsteps and joined the U.S. \nArmy.\n  The sergeant was known as a man dedicated to reaching his goals. This \nwas reflected by his recent promotion to crew chief. One day he hoped \nto become a helicopter pilot, a goal I am certain he would have \naccomplished.\n  His service in Afghanistan was not the first time Sergeant Blamires \nhad been in harm's way. In 2005, he served a tour in Iraq. Well-\nrespected by his commanders and fellow soldiers, Sergeant Blamires was \nknown for his ability to make others laugh and his willingness to help \nothers in need.\n  However, undoubtedly, his most important life's work was as a family \nman. In addition to two caring parents and five supportive brothers and \nsisters, Sergeant Blamires is survived by his wife, Kim and their two \nyoung daughters.\n  Sergeant Blamires was a man who truly lived an abundant life. \nAlthough his calls to service often required him to be away from the \nfamily he loved, there was nothing Sergeant Blamires desired more than \nto be with his family. Fellow serviceman, SSG Ronald Walton recalls \nthat Sergeant Blamires, ``dreamt of being a better husband and father \nto his two girls and he talked of it often.''\n  What a fine man.\n  What an extraordinary life.\n  We will always remember his dedicated service to our Nation, and it \nis my fervent hope that he and his family remain in our prayers.\n\n\n                   staff sergeant virgil c. martinez\n\n  Mr. President, I stand here today to pay tribute to a hero, SSG \nVirgil C. ``Chance'' Martinez. Sergeant Martinez was a member of the \n1st Infantry Division's 1st Battalion, 7th Field Artillery Regiment and \nrecently gave his life while serving his country in Iraq.\n  From the time Sergeant Martinez was a 5-year-old boy, he felt a duty-\nbound responsibility to follow in the footsteps of his stepfather and \nanswer his country's call to service. His sister Kim Austin-Oliver said \nof her brother ``We knew at a very young age that he was going to be a \nsoldier. It is who he has always been.''\n  As a teenager, Sergeant Martinez enjoyed playing on his high school \nski and football teams. Shortly after graduating from high school in \n1992, he would achieve his life long ambition and join the U.S. Army.\n  I understand that Sergeant Martinez was a man deeply devoted not only \nto his country but also to his family. When speaking of his lost \nstepson, Daniel Oliver noted, ``Chance would do anything and everything \nfor his children and for his mother . . . he was like the Disneyland \nfather--wanted to show his children everything.'' Sergeant Martinez was \nthe husband to wife Mandy and father of five beautiful children.\n  I would like to close my remarks by highlighting an observation made \nby Sergeant Martinez's sister. Kim Austin-Oliver commented that \nSergeant Martinez died doing what he had always wanted to do, and that \nis, serve his country.\n  I can think of no truer definition of a hero. Sergeant Martinez and \nthe family he has left behind will forever remain in my memory and in \nmy prayers for his selfless service to our Nation.\n\n\n                       corporal michael a. pursel\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of Utah's fallen sons, \nCPL Michael A. Pursel. Corporal Pursel, a member of the 2nd Infantry \nDivision, recently lost his life in Baqubah, Iraq. He was 19 years old.\n  Corporal Pursel is actually a two-time volunteer. His service began \nwhen he joined the Army and he then volunteered to replace other \nsoldiers from the 2nd Infantry Division. In fact, Corporal Pursel not \nonly answered that call, but was one of the first to offer his service.\n  I have been informed that Corporal Pursel belonged to a family of \ngreat patriots, many of whom have served in the military themselves. \nThis includes both of Corporal Pursel's parents. His mother Terry \nDutcher, who is a Captain in the Air Force Reserve, said of her son, \n``Michael was doing what he always wanted to do . . . he died living \nhis dream.''\n  In memory of the life of this great soldier would submit to you that \nthe dream of serving one's country--the dream that CPL Michael A. \nPursel achieved--is a dream that more Americans must embrace. Although \nyoung in years, Corporal Pursel understood the premise that to serve \none's country extends far beyond the notion of being active in one's \nmilitary duty. To serve one's country enables the rest of us to enjoy \nour Nation's greatest gift: freedom. This was at the very core of his \nservice and how Corporal Pursel lived his life, the life of a hero, the \nlife of one who will forever be remembered in my prayers.\n  This country owes CPL Michael A. Pursel a great debt of gratitude. He \nshall forever be remembered and honored for his service to our Nation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8056-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n                             JUNETEENTH DAY\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Juneteenth Day, a yearly \ncommemoration of the abolition of slavery in our country.\n  As a nation we value and appreciate the freedom and independence \nJuneteenth Day represents. Historically, Juneteenth Day has been a \ncelebration of our country's rich African-American heritage and has \npromoted awareness about the history of African American sacrifice.\n  A great celebration took place on June 19, 1865, when slavery was \nfinally abolished 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Fishing, \nfestivals, barbecuing and baseball are just a few of the typical \nJuneteenth activities people enjoy today. Juneteenth has long been a \nday of education and enlightenment and often includes guest speakers \nand prayer services.\n  I believe that observing Juneteeth Day is necessary to truly embrace \nthe equality and freedom our country represents. We live in a \nculturally diverse nation and celebrations like Juneteenth Day \nencourage us to understand and respect the differences that make our \ncountry great.\n  It is imperative that we continue the work of achieving racial and \nethnic harmony and I am honored to acknowledge this important day. I \ncommend the tremendous dedication of the people who participate in the \nannual Juneteenth Day celebrations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8056-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8056-S8057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Head Start \nfor School Readiness Act of 2007. This legislation is a bipartisan \neffort by the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to \nreauthorize the Head Start Act.\n  The Head Start Program was established in 1965 as part of the war on \npoverty by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The purpose of the program was, \nand remains, to provide educational and other developmental services to \nchildren in very low-income families. Since its creation, Head Start \nhas been a comprehensive early childhood development program that \nprovides educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services \nto low-income preschool-aged children and their families. Head Start \ncurrently provides services to over 900,000 children and their families \nthrough a network of over 1,600 public and private agencies.\n  The legislation before us today builds on work started last Congress \nby the HELP Committee under my leadership. The Head Start for School \nReadiness Act ensures that low-income children receive the educational \nand developmental services they need to be ready to learn and be \nsuccessful in school.\n  I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his ongoing commitment to working \non a bipartisan basis, which has resulted in legislation that meets the \nneeds of children and families who participate in the Head Start \nProgram throughout our Nation. I would also like to thank our \ncolleagues, Senators Alexander and Dodd, for their fine work and \ndedication to this important program.\n  Head Start was created to level the playing field for low-income \nchildren by providing them with education and development activities. \nThis program recognizes that children do not start school with the same \nset of experiences and knowledge and helps provide low-income children \nwith some of the experiences and knowledge their more affluent peers \nhave as they start their elementary school experience. The Head Start \nProgram also recognizes the important role that families play in a \nchild's development and encourages their regular participation in the \nprogram.\n  This legislation helps ensure that children in the Head Start Program \nwill be better prepared to enter school with the skills necessary to \nsucceed. It is well documented in early childhood education research \nthat students who are not reading at grade level by the third grade \nwill struggle with reading the rest of their lives. Head Start provides \nearly education for over 900,000 children each year, most of whom would \nnot have the opportunity to attend preschool programs elsewhere. The \nfuture of these children is why we have all worked so hard to improve \nand strengthen this act. The legislation before us today will help Head \nStart Programs provide children with the early learning skills and \nearly childhood development activities they need to be successful. Head \nStart introduces many of these children to books, the alphabet, \nnumbers, as well as how to play and share with their classmates. Head \nStart provides the building blocks children need for success later in \nlife.\n  The Head Start for School Readiness Act builds on what many great \nHead Start providers are already doing. Working from recommendations \nfrom the National Academy of Sciences, this bill adds educational \nstandards related to language skills, literacy and numeracy skills, as \nwell as cognitive, emotional, and physical development. Steps are also \ntaken to ensure that limited English proficient children are provided \nassistance in acquiring the English language.\n  I am particularly pleased with the accountability provisions put \nforth in this legislation. The legislation before us today includes \nimportant changes to the Head Start Program related to the evaluation \nand review of grantees. The timeframe for Head Start grantees to appeal \ndecisions made by the Secretary to terminate grants is now limited. In \nsome instances, Head Start grantees have been found to be operating \nprograms that are unsafe or misusing Federal funds--and are often \ncontinuing those bad practices for months--as long as 600 days in some \ncases--during the termination process. This equates to children not \nreceiving quality services, and instead of being prepared for success, \nthey fall further behind.\n  Additional steps have been taken in this legislation to increase the \nquality of Head Start Programs, including providing the Secretary the \nauthority to terminate a grantee that has multiple and recurring \ndeficiencies that has not made significant and substantial progress \ntoward correcting those deficiencies. This legislation provides greater \nclarity for grantees as to what constitutes a program deficiency. Many \nof us have heard from grantees across the country who expressed \nfrustration with the lack of consistency with which the provisions of \nthe Head Start Program is enforced. For that reason this legislation \nincludes provisions related to interrator reliability--this will help \nensure consistency in the review of Head Start Programs across the \ncountry.\n  Changes were made to the distribution of grant funds to ensure that \nprograms maintain their funded levels of enrollment. We understand that \nfamilies served by the Head Start Program tend to be more migratory and \nthat full enrollment at Centers is often difficult to maintain. \nHowever, we also know that many programs have waiting lists and that \nthousands of eligible children are not currently being served. This \nlegislation balances those needs by providing flexibility in meeting \nfull enrollment, but also requiring funds to be moved from chronically \nunder-enrolled programs.\n\n  Senator Dodd has provided valuable leadership as we worked to develop \na clear policy on the roles and responsibilities of the governing \nbodies and policy councils. We have worked together to clarify and \nstrengthen the roles of the governing body and policy councils while \npreserving the important role of parents. After careful review, the \ncommittee found that many of the important fiscal and legal \nresponsibilities of Head Start grantees were not explicitly assigned.\n  Unfortunately there have been too many examples of programs that have \nfailed the children, families, and community they were funded to serve \ndue to appalling financial mismanagement. Cases were brought to the \ncommittee that detailed excessive and inappropriate expenditures, lost \nfunds, and reduced services to children because proper financial \nmanagement techniques were not in place. Too often the truth was hidden \nfrom governing bodies and policy councils alike.\n  The bill clarifies those responsibilities leading to more consistent, \nhigh-quality fiscal and legal management, which will ensure these \nprograms are serving children in the best possible way. Changes in this \nlegislation address the concerning situations mentioned earlier by \nplacing fiscal responsibility with the governing body. It is absolutely \nnecessary and vital that one entity maintain fiscal and legal control \nof the Federal grant dollars. That\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\nsaid, we maintain the equally vital and necessary role of the policy \ncouncils in setting program priorities, classroom activities, and \npersonnel changes. We believe this careful balance will help ensure the \ncontinued integrity of the Head Start Program for years to come.\n  We recognize that a vast majority of the Head Start agencies provide \nhigh quality, comprehensive services for children in the Head Start \nPrograms. However, the provisions in this bill will create an important \nincentive for programs to operate at their best and in the best \ninterest of the children they serve.\n  I want to particularly note emphasis we have placed on the role of \nparents in Head Start Programs. It is vital to remember that this \nprogram provides services to children and their families. Parents \nprovide valuable insight and experience as to what a Head Start Program \nshould do for children. In fact, this legislation increases the \npresence of parents in Head Start Programs, strengthens services for \nfamilies, and provides training and development opportunities for \nparents that do serve on the policy councils and governing bodies.\n  This legislation also increases the coordination, collaboration, and \nexcellence of early childhood education and care programs. It enhances \nthe role of the State director of Head Start collaboration to ensure \nthat Head Start Programs are maximizing their potential by stretching \ndollars, promoting partnerships to meet State and local needs, and \ndeveloping strategic plans to meet future and current goals. This \nlegislation also allows each State to apply for funds to support a \nState advisory council on early care and education to conduct a \nstatewide needs assessment, identify collaboration opportunities, and \nsupport additional data collection. Additional encouragement of \ncoordination and collaboration will stretch Federal, State and local \nresources to provide additional resources to disadvantaged children \nacross the country.\n  Finally, this legislation requires the Department of Health and Human \nServices to cease any further development or implementation of the \nNational Reporting System. While I believe that the assessment of \nchildren in the Head Start Program is important, I believe that the \nassessment must be both age and developmentally appropriate. This \nlegislation requires a review and update of the assessments, standards, \nand measures used in Head Start Programs by the Panel on Developmental \nOutcomes and Assessments for Young Children of the National Academy of \nSciences. Once the panel completes its recommendations, the Secretary \nis then allowed to revisit the issue of assessment in Head Start \nPrograms.\n  The members of the HELP Committee, and in particular Senators \nAlexander, Kennedy, and Dodd, have worked tirelessly on this \nlegislation. The final product before us today is a comprehensive and \nbipartisan reauthorization of the Head Start Program. I wish to thank \nSenators Kennedy, Alexander, and Dodd and the other members of the \ncommittee for their assistance in moving this legislation to the floor. \nPassage of this legislation will ensure that low-income children are \nprepared not only for success in school but for later success in life.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the staff of members of the HELP \nCommittee who have spent countless hours preparing this legislation for \npassage by the Senate. In particular I would like to thank Roberto \nRodriguez with Senator Kennedy, Catherine Hildum and Sharon Lewis with \nSenator Dodd, David Cleary and Sarah Rittling with Senator Alexander, \nand Beth Buehlmann and Lindsay Hunsicker of my staff.\n  It is my hope that our bipartisan efforts will continue to produce \nresults as we move to final passage of this legislation and on to a \nconference committee with the House of Representatives. We must all \nwork together to get a bipartisan product to President Bush for his \nsignature as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8057-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                DYSTONIA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to call attention to \na very serious, painful neurological disorder, dystonia, that affects \nmany muscle groups simultaneously. We recently commemorated Dystonia \nAwareness Week and I would like to call further attention to this \nserious disorder.\n  Dystonia is a painful disorder characterized by powerful involuntary \nmuscle spasms. The spasms cause twisting, repetitive muscle movements, \nsustained postural deformities, and debilitating physical ailments. \nAlthough most forms of dystonia cause no mental damage, people living \nwith dystonia are often prisoners in their own bodies. Currently, no \ncure is known and available medical therapies can only superficially \naddress the symptoms.\n  Approximately 50 percent of people with dystonia have a genetically \ninherited form whereas birth injury, physical trauma, exposure to \ncertain medications, surgery, or stroke is the cause for the other 50 \npercent. Dystonia is not selective, occurring in all racial, ethnic, \nand age groups. It is significantly more common than Huntington's \ndisease, muscular dystrophy, and Lou Gehrig's disease. Given the \nprevalence and dystonia's impact on so many Americans as well as the \nlimited treatment options available, I am pleased to support the goals \nof Dystonia Awareness Week. The Dystonia Advocacy Coalition through the \ncommemoration of Dystonia Awareness Week and several other outreach \nactivities seeks to raise awareness of dystonia's impact on the quality \nof life of 300,000 people in North America.\n  I call on my colleagues to support increased funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health to support needed advances in dystonia research. \nResearch is needed to develop reliable tests to diagnose dystonia as \nwell as access to new treatment options to improve the lives of people \nliving with this terrible chronic disease. Until we can find a cure for \ndystonia, I respectfully ask my colleagues to make a prolonged \ncommitment to the dystonia community that goes well beyond Dystonia \nAwareness Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8057-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8057-S8058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ROBERT STURM\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nhonest, humble and dedicated servant of the United States Senate who \nhas decided to turn in his Senate badge and enter retirement. For over \n33 years, Robert E. Sturm, has selflessly served the Senate in various \npositions. His humble beginnings can be traced to his first Senate \nposition as a mail clerk for Senator Birch Bayh in 1974. Bob \nundoubtedly performed his duties in an exemplary fashion, for his \nSenate career continued in the offices of Senators Dick Clark, Donald \nStewart and Russell B. Long. He eventually rose to the respected \nposition of chief clerk of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry, and has served in that capacity for five \ncurrent U.S. Senators including Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator Richard \nLugar, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Thad Cochran, and myself. After \nenjoying a 33-year career in the United States Senate, I speak on \nbehalf of all of those who have had the pleasure of serving with Bob \nwhen I say; your retirement is well deserved.\n  I would like to share with you all the uniqueness of Bob's character, \nkind spirit and devotion to his position as chief clerk. Whether \naddressing an intern or chairman of a Senate committee, Bob always \ndisplayed the same measured approach, graciousness, patience and \nunderstanding. Bob never hesitates to place the needs of others before \nhis own. It is commonplace for Bob to spend late nights at work in \npreparation for farm bill mark ups, accommodate last minute travel \nrequests from impatient Senators and staff alike, fly to the furthest \nreaches of our great Nation to set up hearings, or answer any \nprocedural question with the temperance of a man who has not answered \nthe question a thousand times before. Robert Sturm is that \nindispensable part of your staff upon whom you grow so reliant, you \nwonder how you will function in his absence.\n  Bob, while a patient and understanding man, is not shy about \nenforcing the rules of the Senate Agriculture Committee which he loves. \nAny visitor to a Senate hearing who attempted to open a newspaper \nduring the hearing, spoke too loudly from the audience or attempted to \npass out materials not reviewed and approved by Bob, knows how quick \nthe wrath of Bob Sturm can be meted out. Similarly, Bob guarded\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\nthe Senate Agriculture Committee hearing room with diligence and \ninsisted that its appearance always reflected the high esteem in which \nhe held the committee and this august body.\n  During my first hearing as chairman, I remember reaching for the \ngavel to call the hearing to order. As I looked down at the gavel, I \nwas shocked to find that someone had placed my name on it. Humbled by \nthis kind act, I turned to my staff and quietly asked, ``Who did \nthis?'' The answer was of course Bob Sturm. During my chairmanship, I \ncould always depend on Bob to place a few bags of my beloved Georgia \npeanuts at the seat of each Senator attending the hearings. It is the \nlittle things like this that exemplify Bob's attention to detail and \nwillingness to serve. I also remember when the Agriculture Committee \ntraveled around the country in the summer of 2006 to eight different \nfarm bill field hearings. Bob was on the front lines of every hearing--\nfrom educating staff on how to select an appropriate hearing site, \ntraveling in advance to prepare for the hearing, arranging all the \nnecessary travel, hotel accommodations and food, to running the actual \nhearing--Bob was in control. Even after being exhausted from continuous \ntravel, Bob was always the first one to arrive and the last one to \nleave each hearing and I never heard one word of complaint. Bob, as in \nthe performance of all his duties, was meticulous and saw things \nthrough to the end. I will always be grateful for his devotion.\n  Let me finish by saying, Bob, that the Senate will sincerely miss you \nand most of all we thank you for your loyalty and the model of service \nyou leave behind. Best of wishes on a healthy and happy retirement with \nyour family. It is certainly well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8058-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8058-S8059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO CLAY PARK\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I have often said that one of my \nroles as a Senator is to reflect Hawaii, and show people the meaning of \naloha through my own actions. Aloha is not passive, it is not easy, but \nit can make a difference in people's lives. I am reminded of just how \ninspiring and effective aloha can be by one of my constituents, William \nClay Park. I remember seeing Clay at a Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs hearing on the island of Oahu last year. I was impressed by how \nhe exemplified the spirit of aloha. More recently, Clay was featured in \nHawaii Business Magazine for his personal story, and his professional \nwork for Hawaii's veterans. I will ask to have the text of this article \nin Hawaii Business Magazine printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  Clay was born and raised in Hawaii, rooted in the Native Hawaiian \nvalues of his ``ohana,'' or family. As a young man he joined the Army, \nand served in the Vietnam war. The war took a toll on Clay, but after \nleaving the Army he joined the National Guard, and started what would \nbecome a 30-year career with VA as a dental lab technician.\n  In 2003, Clay had retired from VA and the National Guard, and that \ncould have been the end of his career of serving his country and his \nfellow veterans. Instead, he answered a call from a friend and learned \nthat Helping Hands Hawaii, a nonprofit social services organization, \nwas in need of help. Once at Helping Hands Hawaii, he realized that \nHawaii veterans needed someone like himself to help them through the \nbureaucratic maze of VA benefits. They also needed someone with his \nkind of aloha.\n  Although he has only been with Helping Hands Hawaii for a few years, \nClay's colleagues can already tell scores of stories about the length \nhe will go to in order to reach veterans and help them. Those stories \ninclude hiking through Hawaii's dense forests in search of disconnected \nveterans who have taken to the bush. While many people pass by homeless \nveterans on their city streets, Clay makes it his responsibility to \nreach out to them, and get them the help they need.\n  The greatest price of war are its human costs, and many veterans pay \nthat price long after they have returned from service. Our Nation needs \nmore people like Clay Park, to show veterans that a grateful Nation is \nnot willing to let them be forgotten, and will provide a helping hand \nwhen they need one.\n  Mahalo Clay, for being an example of the resilience and power of \naloha.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the aforementioned \narticle from Hawaii Business Magazine printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Hawaii Business, May 2007]\n\n                           Casualties of War\n\n                           (By David K. Chao)\n\n       Clay Park joined the Army on a whim. Fresh out of Waialua \n     High School, the 17-year-old was trying to support a friend, \n     who didn't want to go to the recruitment office by himself. \n     The friend wound up failing the physical, but Park passed. In \n     1966, after being trained as a combat medic and dental \n     technician, he was shipped off to Vietnam, where he saw some \n     of the heaviest fighting of the war, including the Tet \n     Offensive in January 1968.\n       Park left the Army later that year and went on to a nearly \n     30-year career as a dental lab technician for the Veterans' \n     Administration (VA). He also served as a National Guardsman \n     for 24 years, retiring as a master sergeant in 2000.\n       Today, Park is a case manager for Helping Hands Hawaii, a \n     nonprofit social services organization with a wide-ranging \n     mission, which includes helping veterans in need of physical \n     and mental health assistance. Earlier this year he was \n     honored by Helping Hands Hawaii as one of the individuals \n     ``for whom service is as much a part of life as breathing . . \n     . .''\n       Park took some time off from his busy schedule to talk with \n     Hawaii Business about veterans in need. Post Traumatic Stress \n     Disorder and the coming mental health crisis that may \n     overwhelm Hawaii and the rest of the country.\n       Tell me about how you started at Helping Hands and what it \n     is you do there?\n       I retired from the VA in 2003 and shortly after Dr. Luke \n     [Helping Hands Hawaii senior program director Dr. Stanley \n     Luke] called me and told me he needed some help. I used to \n     work with him at the VA. I didn't have any training in social \n     work or mental health, but he thought that I could help with \n     cultural competency [assisting with the Native Hawaiian \n     clients]. I was only supposed to work for six months, but \n     that was three years ago and now I help all veterans and \n     their families.\n       As a case manager, I walk a veteran through the system--how \n     to apply for VA benefits. I find them housing and food. I \n     always carry canned goods in the back of my truck, just in \n     case. For me, it's about being an advocate for vets, who \n     really don't want to go through the system, but they need to \n     talk to someone. I've gotten a few calls from wives, who say, \n     ``I want my husband back. This is not the man I married.''\n       You've gone to some unusual lengths to find veterans and \n     get them help. Can you tell me about that?\n       The last vet that I found was on the side of the Pali. He \n     wasn't very high up, somewhere between Pali Highway and \n     Kamehameha Highway, but in the deep, thick stuff. I'm an avid \n     pig hunter, so it wasn't very hard tracking him down. I found \n     a guy on Diamond Head once and I only had a brief \n     description: Caucasian male, who lives under a blue tarp. \n     That wasn't very hard either, once the police told me where \n     the homeless are. Most of the time, they aren't in the \n     mountains. They're in the city or on the beach. But I find \n     them, and we talk and I bring them in.\n       What has happened to these veterans?\n       No one walks away from war unaffected. Everyone is wounded. \n     You may not be hurt physically, but you are definitely \n     affected mentally. Why is that? Why is it that a guy comes \n     back and gets married and lives the Great American Dream--the \n     house, the dog, the kids. But then, in his 50s or 60s, he \n     takes a shotgun and blows his brains out. Why is that? It is \n     because, when you are young, you stay busy. But as you get \n     older, your body slows down, but your mind doesn't. And you \n     can't cope. The ghost is always there and he comes to bite \n     you every once in a while. Sometimes you just can't keep him \n     in the closet.\n       Look what's happening now. The American forces are low, so \n     they are sending these guys on two or three tours of duty. \n     They come back with PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), \n     and they think they have fixed them up. And then they send \n     them on their second tour. And they come back and they are \n     worse, and they send them out for a third time.\n       Are you seeing a lot of Afghanistan and Iraq veterans?\n       I've seen a few, guys from my National Guard unit. But it's \n     really too soon. But we'll see them, and it's going to get \n     nasty.\n       How so?\n       The problem is that they activated units that have soldiers \n     in their 40s and 50s. They are married and have children and \n     jobs. When we went, we were full of piss and vinegar. We were \n     wet behind the ears and we didn't give a damn about anything. \n     When you go to war when you're older, your body isn't as \n     strong as the young guys and your thinking is much different. \n     It [your mind] can be damaged more easily and more deeply. \n     They are saving limbs and putting in\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\n     glass eyes, but what are they doing for these soldiers' \n     mental instabilities? They are trying, but there isn't \n     enough. They can't keep up. It is ugly. An ugly picture.\n       Do you have a ghost?\n       Big time. But it is how you deal with it. And what you do \n     with it. When that ghost comes out, do you let it drag you \n     down, or do you put it back? When I came back [from Vietnam] \n     I was angry. I was angry at the world. People were protesting \n     the war, but they didn't know what war was really like. All \n     they knew was what they saw on TV. Eventually, I got busy, \n     very busy. I learned how to drive all kinds of things, big \n     trucks, planes, so I could be in control. I looked for \n     natural highs, like flying. Helping people is another high.\n       When I'm with a vet on the beach or in a park, I'll ask \n     him: ``What do you see?'' They don't know what I'm talking \n     about. I tell them: ``I see life. I see birds, trees and the \n     sun. Today is today. Tomorrow may never come and yesterday is \n     gone.''\n       You're just one person. What you're describing is a \n     potential mental health crisis of epic proportions. Won't you \n     be overwhelmed?\n       I may be one guy from Helping Hands but, I've got ``the \n     Uncles,'' Victor Opiopio, Sam Stone, Charles Kanehailua, \n     James Opiana and all their wives. These are all guys who are \n     part of my core group of veterans, who are willing to sit \n     down and talk to these guys [fellow veterans in need]. They \n     [the Uncles] aren't getting paid. They are a network of \n     people out there, who are willing to take a guy by the hand \n     and walk them through the system. I've also got a gal at the \n     VA who wants to help our group, as well as a VA doctor. We're \n     a small group but we're thinking about the big picture. Are \n     we prepared for what is going to happen? No. But if you can \n     help one vet at a time, you're doing something. We can't just \n     sit back and do nothing. I don't have time to do nothing. I \n     don't.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8059-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING DR.

The Jefferson Award is a prestigious award \nrecognizing and honoring individuals for their contributions to \ncommunity and public service. Dr. Sy, through his Aloha Medical \nMission, has helped to provide medical treatment to thousands of \nindividuals in the Pacific and Asia, who are unable to access modern \nmedical care due to cost or availability.\n  A native of the Philippines, Dr. Sy and seven other members of the \nPhilippine Medical Association of Hawaii established the Aloha Medical \nMission in 1983. The Aloha Medical Mission provides voluntary medical, \nsurgical, and other health-related services, which include the donation \nof supplies and equipment, to medically indigent areas of Southeast \nAsia and the Pacific. In addition to providing access to health \nservices, the Aloha Medical Mission also provides training to \nphysicians overseas and through an exchange fellowship program in \nHonolulu, HI.\n  Dr. Sy is responsible for furthering the development of the Aloha \nMedical Mission from a small group of doctors to an organization well \nknown within the international community. Since the establishment of \nthe Aloha Medical Mission, Dr. Sy and his colleagues have served in 11 \ncountries, treated 200,000 patients, and performed over 9,000 \noperations. His commitment to ensuring that medical care is accessible \nin both Hawaii and abroad demonstrates his compassion and undying \nconcern for others. He is an inspiration to all because of his \nwillingness to embrace the problems of those less fortunate. I hope \nthat many will aspire to follow Dr. Sy's example by making a commitment \nto making a difference.\n  I thank Dr. Sy for his dedication and quality efforts and extend the \nsame gratitude to all the members of the Aloha Medical Mission.

Mr. President, I would like to honor and give \nspecial attention to the 100th anniversary of the establishment of Gila \nCliff Dwellings National Monument in my home State of New Mexico. On \nNovember 16, 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the proclamation \nthat recognized the Gila Cliff Dwellings and 533 surrounding acres as a \nnational monument being what he called, ``of exceptional scientific and \neducational interest . . . as the best representative of the cliff-\ndwellers' remains of that region.'' This unique monument, nestled among \nthe spectacular scenery of the Gila National Forest, was once the home \nto the people of the Mogollon, who lived along the East fork of the \nGila River during the late 13th and early 14th century. It is at that \nplace where these impressive builders constructed a 42-room collection \nof homes in 5 spacious sandstone caves high along the face of a small \ncreek-canyon. Today, this monument gives Americans a glimpse of the \ngreat cultures and societies that once occupied the North American \nContinent prior to the arrival of European settlers.\n  This year-long centennial celebration is more than just an \nappreciation for the unique beauty that is defined by the many special \nplaces like this in New Mexico. In commemoration of this special \ncentennial event, an unexcavated surface site referred to as the TJ \nRuin will be open for a limited number of guided tours. Over the next \nfew weeks other exciting events such as Stories in the Stars, Stories \nin the Shards, Rock Art and Storytelling will be taking place. There \nwill be a number of other events, including an exhibit opening at the \nSilver City Museum, cowboy poetry, music, Dutch oven cooking, and \nChiricahua Apache Culture Days that will be held throughout the \nremainder of the year to entertain those visiting the area and to \ncelebrate the 100th anniversary.\n  The attractive weather and abundance of forest and desert flora and \nfauna in the Gila region of southwest New Mexico attracts over 60,000 \nvisitors every year who contribute to the economies of southwestern New \nMexico cities and towns such as Silver City, Cliff, Deming, Bayard, and \nLordsburg. With over 1,500 miles of trails, the opportunities for \nmountain biking, hiking, and horseback riding are endless. There is \nalso a great abundance of wildlife that roam the Gila region. For the \nfisherman, there is over 360 miles of mountain streams, creeks, rivers, \nand lakes that are a precious resource in the Southwest.\n  The outdoors reminds us all of the things we hold so dear. Public \nlands make up over one-third of the United States, most of which is in \nthe West. Those of us from the State of New Mexico cherish the open \nspaces afforded by the West. Like the Mogollon, we are reminded daily \nof our dependence on the land and therefore take a devout interest in \nits health and management. The Gila Cliff Dwellings and the Gila \nNational Forest remain much the same as so many years ago, and I am \nglad this will be the case for generations to come.\n  The next time you happen to be in New Mexico, I encourage you to come \nvisit and take some time to enjoy all New Mexico has to offer. From the \nmany beautiful mountains, to the rivers, the canyons, the wildlife, the \nculture and the history--the marvelous place we call the Gila has it \nall. New Mexico is a great place, and the Gila Cliff Dwellings help \nmake it so. To all, past and present, who have worked hard to preserve \nthe Gila Cliff Dwellings, I extend a heartfelt thank you and honor you \nthis centennial year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8059-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8059-S8060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING B. BENEDICT GLAZER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this \nopportunity to commemorate the 40th anniversary of B. Benedict Glazer \nElementary School and to congratulate the principal of Glazer \nElementary, Florene McMurtry, on her retirement after 20 years of \ndedicated service and leadership. B. Benedict Glazer Elementary School \ncelebrates this milestone today as a part of its annual 5th Grade Class \nDay.\n  On May 5, 1967, the Michigan House of Representatives passed \nResolution No. 99 in honor of Dr. B. Benedict Glazer, Rabbi of Temple \nBeth El in Detroit, to formally recognize his 11 years of outstanding \nservice to the congregation of Temple Beth El and to the State of \nMichigan. The resolution also paid tribute to the decision to name an \nelementary school in his honor. Dr. Glazer was nationally recognized as \nan exceptional scholar, teacher, and leader, and was well known as an \nadvocate for uniting people of different faiths. Dr. Glazer was also at \nthe forefront of many struggles for basic human rights, fighting for \nimproved conditions in Michigan's mental health facilities and against \nvarious forms of racial and religious discrimination, among other noble \ncauses.\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\n  I am proud to also recognize the many accomplishments of Glazer \nelementary students, which is undoubtedly the direct result of the hard \nwork and dedication of its students, faculty and staff. Glazer was \nrecently selected as a Leadership School by the Schools of the 21st \nCentury and enjoys the distinction of being awarded the $100,000 \nSkillman Improvement Grant, the highest award among six elementary \nschools included in the 2007 high performing category out of 300 \nDetroit elementary schools. This grant is expected to help fund several \nworthwhile initiatives, including a GED certificate program and the \npurchase of additional computers to assist parents of Glazer students \nwho have not completed high school.\n  The principal of B. Benedict Glazer Elementary School, Florene \nMcMurtry, has served the Detroit Public School system in various \npositions for 35 years. Her passion for education is illustrated by the \nmany notable successes she has enjoyed throughout her career as an \neducator. An example of her innovative approach to education was the \npartnership she helped form between Glazer Elementary School and Temple \nBeth El in 1998 to provide financial resources and tutors for students \nthrough the Glazer Elementary Ada S. and Rabbi B. Benedict Glazer \nMemorial Fund. Mrs. McMurtry also established the tradition of \npresenting dictionaries as the Glazer Memorial Prize to honor the most \noutstanding boy and girl student for Class Day. In 2001, Mrs. McMurtry \nestablished the InsideOut Literary Arts Project at Glazer with a \nwriter-in-residence who integrates creative writing and drama in the \nschool curriculum and publishes the students' work. To date, seven \npoetry books have been written and published.\n  Mrs. McMurtry has proven herself to be a devoted educator. Through \nher dedicated leadership and the many programs she has initiated and \nled, she has managed to increase parental involvement in school, \nstudent access to resources, and has served as a liaison between the \nstudents and the community. In addition, Mrs. McMurtry has received \nmany accolades over the years in recognition of her outstanding \nservice, including the Principal of the Year Art Award in 1996 and \n2001, the Distinguished Service Award, City of Detroit in 1985 and she \nwas a finalist for Michigan Teacher of the Year in 1984-1985.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in recognizing B. Benedict \nGlazer Elementary School on its 40th anniversary and its principal, \nFlorene McMurtry, on her impressive record of service to the Detroit \nPublic School system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8060-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING GEIGER BROTHERS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize an outstanding, \nfamily-owned small business from my home State of Maine that recently \nreceived the Gannett Family Business of the Year Award from the \nUniversity of Southern Maine's Institute for Family-Owned Business. A \npromotional products distributor, Geiger Brothers of Lewiston has been \nin operation since 1878. Incredibly, the Geiger family has been in \ncharge of the business for the entire time--a total of four generation.\n  Geiger Brothers was originally founded in Newark, NJ, with a staff of \nfour, two of whom were Geiger brothers. Since then, Geiger Brothers has \nundergone dramatic transformations, moving to Maine over half a century \nago, and expanding to 500 employees between the Lewiston office and \nseveral field offices. While the Geiger name may not jump out at people \nfrom outside of Maine, the name ``Farmers' Almanac'' is universally \nknown. Published yearly, the ``Farmers' Almanac'' is famous for its \nweather forecasts, gardening tips, and recipe suggestions. It is a \nsource of great pride for my home State of Maine that Geiger Brothers \npublishes the ``Farmers' Almanac.''\n  It is no surprise that Geiger Brothers has won the Gannett Family \nBusiness of the Year Award. In fact, there is no lack of accomplishment \nor recognition in Geiger's history. The recipient of the Margaret Chase \nSmith Maine Quality Award, the FedEx Gold Level Supplier, and the Maine \nState Chamber of Commerce Maine Investors Award, Geiger's list of \ncommendations recently grew to include the Advertising Specialty \nInstitute's Family Business of the Year and a 2006 Best Places To Work \nIn Maine award.\n  In addition to publishing the world-renowned ``Farmers' Almanac,'' \nGeiger Brothers has consistently lived by a philosophy of community \nservice. When, in 1988, the company ``adopted'' the Montello Elementary \nSchool in Lewiston, then-President George H.W. Bush awarded them with a \n``Point of Light'' in celebration of their service and volunteerism. \nSince then, Geiger Brothers has continued to organize similar \npartnerships across Maine, and the company's employees have donated \ntheir time to worthwhile causes all across the Lewiston-Auburn area. In \naddition, employees live by ``The Geiger Way,'' a set of values focused \non respect for all involved in the business, from employees to clients \nand everyone in between. The generous and benevolent spirit of Geiger \nBrothers is assuredly a shining example to all small businesses.\n  Congratulations to Gene Geiger, CEO and president; to Peter Geiger, \nexecutive vice president; and to all of Geiger Brothers' accomplished \nemployees on their most recent honor, and all of the awards they have \nreceived. It is no wonder that Geiger Brothers has been recognized so \nconsistently throughout the years with their dedication and willingness \nto serve. I wish them continued success and many more editions of the \n``Farmers' Almanac.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8060-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8060-S8061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE VETO OF S. 5, THE STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF \n                              2007--PM 18\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was ordered to be held at the desk:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval S. 5, the ``Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act of 2007.''\n  Once again, the Congress has sent me legislation that would compel \nAmerican taxpayers, for the first time in our history, to support the \ndeliberate destruction of human embryos.\n  In 2001, I announced a policy to advance stem cell research in a way \nthat is ambitious, ethical, and effective. I became the first President \nto make Federal funds available for embryonic stem cell research, and \nmy policy did this in ways that would not encourage the destruction of \nembryos. Since then, my Administration has made more than $130 million \navailable for research on stem cell lines derived from embryos that had \nalready been destroyed. We have also provided more than $3 billion for \nresearch on all forms of stem cells, including those from adult and \nother non-embryonic sources.\n  This careful approach is producing results. It has contributed to \nproven therapeutic treatments in thousands of patients with many \ndifferent diseases. And it is opening the prospect of new discoveries \nthat could transform lives. Researchers are now developing promising \nnew techniques that offer the potential to produce pluripotent stem \ncells, without having to destroy human life--for example, by \nreprogramming adult cells to make them function like stem cells.\n  Technical innovation in this difficult area is opening up new \npossibilities for progress without conflict or ethical controversy. \nResearchers pursuing these kinds of ethically responsible advances \ndeserve support, and there is legislation in the Congress to give them \nthat support. Bills supporting alternative research methods achieved \nmajority support last year in both the House and the Senate. Earlier \nthis spring another bill supporting alternative research won \noverwhelming majority support in the Senate, and I call on House \nleaders to pass similar legislation that would authorize additional \nfunds for ethical stem cell research. We cannot lose the opportunity to \nconduct research that would give hope to those suffering from terrible \ndiseases and help move our Nation beyond the controversies over embryo \ndestruction. I invite policymakers and scientists to come together to \nsolve medical problems without compromising either the high aims of \nscience or the sanctity of human life.\n  S. 5, like the bill I vetoed last year, would overturn today's \ncarefully balanced policy on stem cell research.\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\nCompelling American taxpayers to support the deliberate destruction of \nhuman embryos would be a grave mistake. I will not allow our Nation to \ncross this moral line. For that reason, I must veto this bill.\n                                                      George W.

    \n\n[Pages S8064-S8088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1666. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the process for congressional consideration of international \nsocial security agreements; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of my bill to \nimprove the process for congressional consideration of International \nSocial Security Agreements.\n  International Social Security Agreements eliminate dual Social \nSecurity taxes when Americans work overseas for U.S. companies, and \nprotect benefits for workers who divide their careers between two \ncountries. As a result, American workers and their companies save \napproximately $800 million annually in foreign social security taxes.\n  The current process for congressional disapproval of these agreements \nis invalid because it involves the unconstitutional use of a \nlegislative veto. This fact has not been a problem, however, because \nCongress has never desired to reject an International Social Security \nAgreement. Indeed, we currently have 21 agreements with most of our top \ntrading partners, such as Canada, Germany, and Japan. However, Congress \nneeds to establish a constitutionally valid process for congressional \nconsideration and either approval or rejection of International Social \nSecurity Agreements, similar to the process used for other agreements \nand treaties.\n  The bill I am introducing today establishes such a process so that \nthese important agreements can receive full consideration in the \nCongress. If either the House or the Senate determines that a \nparticular agreement is a bad deal for U.S. workers or will harm the \nU.S. Social Security system, this bill will allow Congress to reject \nthat agreement. Right now, that option does not exist under current \nlaw. This bill would fix that problem.\n  The bill would require that an ``approval resolution'' be introduced \nin both the House and the Senate once an agreement is submitted to \nCongress by the administration. The resolution will need to be approved \nby both Houses of Congress before an agreement can take effect. Of \ncourse, either House can also reject the approval resolution to prevent \nan agreement from taking effect.\n  The bill is cosponsored by Senator Grassley, ranking member of the \nFinance Committee. I appreciate the assistance that he and his staff \nprovided in developing this legislation.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this bill to establish a \nconstitutionally valid process for Congress to consider and either \napprove or reject International Social Security Agreements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1668. A bill to assist in providing affordable housing to those \naffected by the 2005 hurricanes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, Senator Landrieu and I come to the \nfloor to introduce the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act of 2007. This \nbill will help jump-start economic development in the communities \ndevastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It will also help bring \npeople home so they can resume their lives.\n  At the outset, let me recognize Senator Landrieu for all of her \nefforts to secure assistance for the people of Louisiana, who suffered \nthe lion's share of damage from the 2005 hurricanes. She has worked \ntirelessly, every day since the storms, to ensure that Louisianans and \nothers in the gulf coast can return to vibrant towns and cities. I also \nwant to recognize the work of Congresswoman Waters and Financial \nServices Chairman Frank, who laid the groundwork for this legislation \nin the House. They did an outstanding job of ushering a housing \nrecovery bill through the House.\n  The bill we are introducing today does the following: it authorizes \nadditional funding to help rebuild the gulf coast; it requires the \nFederal, state and local governments to take additional actions to \nbring people home; and it requires accountability on the part of FEMA, \nHUD, and the states and cities receiving Federal funds.\n  Almost 2 years after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, hundreds \nof thousands of people remain in limbo, wondering if they will be able \nto return home. The population in New Orleans remains at about half of \npre-Katrina levels, though local groups and residents have made clear \nthat many more want to return. Unfortunately, many of these families \nhave no home to return to, and there is great uncertainty about whether \nadequate services will be available if they do return. As of April of \nthis year, less than half of New Orleans' public schools, a third of \nits child care centers, and half of its hospitals were open.\n  Over 82,000 families from across the devastated region are still \nliving in FEMA trailers, which were recently found to contain toxic \nchemicals. Over 32,000 families are receiving temporary rental \nassistance through HUD, and over 11,000 others are receiving temporary \nrental assistance through HUD. Tens of thousands of other families are \nbeing assisted by cities, counties and individuals throughout the gulf \nregion and our country.\n\n[[Page S8065]]\n\n  Much has already been done to help restore the gulf coast. Billions \nof dollars have been spent to house evacuees and clean up areas of \nTexas, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. In addition, emergency CDBG \nfunds have been appropriated to help families start to rebuild their \nhomes and their lives. While these funds are finally getting to people \nin need, the reach of these funds is limited, to a great extent, to \nthose who owned homes prior to the storms. Both Louisiana and \nMississippi have understandably focused their efforts on getting homes \nrebuilt, and I support their efforts to help people whose largest asset \nwas washed away. However, we must not forget the large number of \nresidents who were renters at the time of the storms, many of whom held \njobs that were critical to the economy and the culture of the gulf \ncoast, including jobs necessary for the tourism and fishing industries.\n\n  In New Orleans, over half of the rental housing was flooded. We have \nan obligation, as a fair society, to ensure that all of our citizens in \nthe gulf coast, including renters, are given the opportunity to return \nhome, and the bill that Senator Landrieu and I are introducing today \nwill do that.\n  This bill helps to do six key things that are necessary to help those \ndisplaced as a result of the hurricanes return to thriving cities and \ntowns: it helps to bring people home; it replaces lost housing; it \ncreates homeownership opportunities; it spurs economic and community \ndevelopment; it provides continued assistance to evacuees; and it \nrequires accountability so that funds are properly used.\n  There are numerous provisions in our bill that will help families of \nall income levels return to a stronger gulf coast. I want to highlight \na few of these provisions.\n  While most of the funds already provided to individuals for \nrebuilding efforts have gone to homeowners, even those funds have \nproven to be insufficient. The Louisiana Road Home program has pledged \nall of its funds, leaving many eligible homeowners without any \nassistance. This bill authorizes funding necessary to make this program \nwhole so long as the State of Louisiana puts up $1 billion of its own \nfunds towards this shortfall. I will be working with Senator Landrieu \nover the coming weeks to get a better sense of the exact amount needed \nin this program, why a shortfall of this amount exists, and to \ndetermine the legitimate uses of these funds.\n  Prior to the storm, there were over 5,200 families living in public \nhousing in New Orleans, and thousands of others throughout the Gulf \nStates. Many of these families include people with disabilities, \nseniors, and children. We cannot turn our backs on them.\n  HUD is currently running the Housing Authority of New Orleans, HANO, \nand it plans to demolish much of the public housing without replacing \nmany of the affordable units. I believe this is shortsighted. I \nunderstand that in rebuilding New Orleans, there are many who advocate \ndeconcentrating poverty, and I believe we can achieve this goal without \nsacrificing needed affordable housing. Under the bill we are \nintroducing today, every unit of public housing that was occupied prior \nto the storm must be replaced, but not necessarily with a traditional \npublic housing unit, nor in a traditional public housing setting.\n  In order to facilitate the replacement of public housing in New \nOrleans, this bill takes HANO out of HUD's hands, and puts it into \njudicial receivership. HANO has been a troubled agency for many years, \nand HUD control has not led to enough improvement. We need significant \nchange at this agency.\n  This bill helps to spur much-needed development. It requires $55 \nmillion from funds previously given to the State of Louisiana to be \nused to help finance community development pilot programs in the State \nso that land can be acquired, bundled sold for redevelopment. In \naddition, the bill establishes an innovative program, the FHA-New \nOrleans Homeownership Opportunities Initiative, under which HUD will \ntransfer to the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority properties which \nare under HUD control to be used for homeownership opportunities for \nlow-income families.\n  While providing large amounts of Federal funds to the disaster area, \nit is important to ensure that funds are used correctly and are not \nsubject to waste, fraud and abuse. This bill has stringent monitoring \nand reporting requirements that apply to FEMA, HUD, and the States \nreceiving emergency funds so that the Congress can keep tabs on the \ndisaster spending and ensure funds are being used efficiently and \neffectively to help rebuild and strengthen the gulf coast.\n  The Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act of 2007 is a critical step \ntowards rebuilding the gulf coast. It is supported by a broad coalition \nof national organizations, including the AARP, ACORN, Enterprise \nCommunity Partners, Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the \nMortgage Bankers Association, the National Alliance to End \nHomelessness, the NAACP, the National Association of Homebuilders, the \nNational Association of Realtors, the National Fair Housing Alliance, \nthe National Low Income Housing Coalition, US Jesuit Conference, \nVolunteers of America, as well as Gulf Coast organizations such as \nAlabama Arise, Catholic Charities of New Orleans, Greater New Orleans \nFair Housing Action Center, the Louisiana Association of Nonprofit \nOrganizations, and Providence Community Housing.\n  Again, I would like to thank my colleague Senator Landrieu for her \nwork to restore the lives of so many of her constituents and others in \nthe gulf coast region. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so \nthat needed housing and community development activities can be \nundertaken in the gulf coast.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1668\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Landrieu and Dodd: Enterprise Community \n     Partners strongly supports your bill, the Gulf Coast \n     Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007. We appreciate that \n     this legislation takes a holistic approach to redeveloping \n     affordable housing in the impacted Gulf Coast region.\n       Enterprise is one of the nation's leading providers of \n     development capital and expertise for decent, affordable \n     homes in thriving communities. For more than two decades, \n     Enterprise has pioneered neighborhood solutions through \n     private-public partnerships\n\n[[Page S8074]]\n\n     with financial institutions, governments, community \n     organizations and other stakeholders.\n       We are bringing our resources to bear across the Gulf \n     Coast, helping nonprofit and faith-based organizations \n     serving low-income people and seniors; ensuring sustainable \n     development that saves energy and natural resources; and \n     advising state and local government on policies and programs \n     to create communities of choice. Through partnerships with \n     local and national partners, we have committed to invest $200 \n     million in grants, loans and equity investment toward the \n     development of 10,000 affordable, healthy and sustainable \n     homes in the Gulf Coast region. Enterprise has designed, \n     implemented, and is currently managing the $47 million \n     Louisiana Loan Fund with other partners to provide local \n     developers access to low-cost predevelopment and acquisition \n     capital.\n       This legislation provides much-needed flexibility while \n     insisting upon the essential principles necessary to \n     comprehensively and equitably redevelop the Gulf Coast. \n     Enterprise commends you for providing displaced families with \n     a range of options, including providing additional vouchers \n     and extending temporary housing assistance.\n       Enterprise and our local partner, Providence Community \n     Housing, are working with former residents and the local, \n     state and federal governments to redevelop the Lafitte public \n     housing site as part of a broader strategy to revitalize the \n     neighborhood of Treme in New Orleans. This bill creates the \n     policy framework for rebuilding a vibrant, sustainable \n     community of choice for families of all incomes.\n       The bill's provision for the New Orleans Redevelopment \n     Authority's disposition pilot will help developers acquire \n     off-site properties as replacement homes to reduce density in \n     public housing. This innovative approach will help to ensure \n     that rebuilding public housing in the Gulf Coast does not \n     result in concentrating poverty in isolation from jobs, \n     transportation and services.\n       Enterprise commends you and the members of the Senate \n     Banking Committee for your leadership on this and other \n     housing issues and urges Congress to expedite the passage of \n     this critical legislation. Please call upon us if we can \n     provide additional information or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Doris W.

Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and Landrieu, We write in support of the \n     bill you will introduce shortly to address the housing needs \n     of low income people affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \n     that remain largely unmet these 21 months after the disaster. \n     While everyone has suffered with the slow pace of recovery, \n     it is the people who had the fewest resources before the \n     storms for whom rebuilding their lives and reestablishing \n     permanent homes has been the most difficult. In particular, \n     repair and replacement of rental housing affordable to low \n     income people has received insufficient attention in the \n     rebuilding plans to date.\n       Your bill will go a long way towards addressing these \n     concerns. Among its many important provisions is a plan for \n     the repair and redevelopment of public and assisted housing. \n     This provision will ensure that communities will not lose \n     desperately needed federally assisted housing units and that \n     all residents in good standing prior to the storms will have \n     the right to return, while also providing residents with a \n     broader range of housing choices than previously available. \n     Displaced public and assisted housing residents who are \n     trying to rebuild their lives in new communities will also be \n     able to do so without threat of losing housing assistance \n     that makes their new homes affordable. The mobility section \n     is a welcome addition to the House bill.\n       The tens of thousands more displaced low income people who \n     were living in private housing before the storms, whose homes \n     are gone, and whose temporary housing has been sustained via \n     the chaotic FEMA rent assistance program will finally be able \n     to rely on Section 8 housing vouchers, with its established \n     rules and local administration. We are also in favor of the \n     requirement in the bill for a GAO study to determine how the \n     number of households whose assistance was wrongfully \n     terminated by FEMA.\n       The pilot program of the New Orleans Redevelopment \n     Authority, coupled with the FHA-New Orleans Disaster Housing \n     Initiative, offer an innovative approach to focus resources \n     for low income housing development in New Orleans, which \n     sustained the greatest loss of affordable rental housing in \n     the affected areas.\n       We offer the following suggestions for consideration before \n     the bill is introduced or at mark-up. We recommend that the \n     ongoing and desperate housing needs of low income people in \n     Alabama and Texas be addressed in this bill. While the scale \n     of destruction was less in these states, the distribution of \n     resources by HUD shortchanged both states. We urge additional \n     appropriations for Alabama and Texas, allocated through the \n     HOME program.\n       Second, we ask that you consider expanding the number of \n     new project-based vouchers from 4,500 as is in the draft bill \n     to 25,000.\n       Attached is a list of organizations that are members of the \n     Katrina Housing Group whose representatives thank you for \n     your work on behalf of low income people displaced by the \n     2005 Gulf Coast Hurricanes and pledge to work with you to \n     move your important legislation forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        The Katrina Housing Group,\n     c/o National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 14, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and Landrieu: The undersigned civil \n     rights organizations are writing to express our support for \n     the Senate version of the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act of \n     2007, soon to be introduced. This bill will address many of \n     the pressing housing issues on the Coast and will assist with \n     civil rights and fair housing enforcement. Because the \n     situation on the Coast continues to be so precarious, we \n     believe this legislation needs to move forward quickly.\n       In particular, we appreciate the fair housing enforcement \n     and the fair housing reporting mechanisms in the bill. Title \n     VI authorizes funds for vital civil rights enforcement by \n     fair housing centers on the Coast. Title I specifically \n     mentions that every state has to report quarterly on its \n     programs, including how the programs are affirmatively \n     furthering fair housing. In addition, the states must report \n     whom they are serving by race, ethnicity, income, disability, \n     family size, and family status.\n       In addition, the provisions for housing mobility, public \n     housing replacement, and a new FHA multifamily loan program \n     will provide much needed housing as well as the opportunity \n     for racial and socioeconomic integration.\n       Thank you again for your efforts to support civil rights \n     and fair housing.\n           Sincerely,\n       Center for Responsible Lending.\n       Greater Houston Fair Housing Center.\n       Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center.\n       Gulf Coast Fair Housing Center (Biloxi, MS).\n       Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n       Mobile Fair Housing Center.\n       National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     (NAACP).\n       National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community \n     Development (National CAPACD).\n       National Fair Housing Alliance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Volunteers of America,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of Volunteers of America, a \n     national, nonprofit, faith-based organization dedicated to \n     helping those in need rebuild their lives and reach their \n     full potential, I am writing to express our strong support \n     for the Dodd/Landrieu Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery \n     Act of 2007. This measure will assist in the rebuilding \n     process in the region and provide the requisite long term \n     housing relief for many poor and low income individuals.\n       Volunteers of America helps more than 2 million people in \n     over 400 communities. Since 1896, our ministry of service has \n     supported and empowered America's most vulnerable groups, \n     including at-risk youth, the frail elderly, men and women \n     returning from prison, homeless individuals and families, \n     people with disabilities, and those recovering from \n     addictions. Our work touches the mind, body, heart--and \n     ultimately the spirit--of those we serve, integrating our \n     deep compassion with highly effective programs and services.\n       Volunteers of America has served New Orleans and the Gulf \n     Region for over a century. Prior to Hurricane Katrina we had \n     a diverse portfolio of over 1,000 housing units in and around \n     New Orleans. Included in this total was senior housing, \n     family housing, housing for persons with disabilities, and \n     housing for people leaving homelessness. All of these \n     properties were rendered uninhabitable by the storm, as were \n     our offices and many of our other program sites. We continue \n     to work in partnership with state and local governments, \n     other non-profit agencies and with businesses, to rebuild \n     communities along the Gulf Coast. Under our ``Coming Back \n     Home'' Initiative, we have pledged to restore the 1,000 \n     affordable housing units we provided in New Orleans prior to \n     Katrina, and to seek every opportunity to build additional \n     units. Our goal is to continue providing housing and \n     supportive services to vulnerable populations, and offer \n     workforce housing to people who need an affordable place to \n     live as they strive to rebuild New Orleans. We are also \n     providing home ownership opportunities for low income \n     families in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n       To this end, the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act \n     of 2007, represents an excellent opportunity for the Senate \n     to address the on going housing and rebuilding needs of this \n     region. Thank you for your leadership in introducing this \n     important measure and we look forward to working with you and \n     all the members in the Senate\n\n[[Page S8075]]\n\n     to ensure final passage of this landmark legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles W. Gould,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                    City View,\n\n                                   San Antonio, TX, June 18, 2007.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Senate Rayburn Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Landrieu and Dodd: As a member of Enterprise \n     Community Partners' Real Estate Leadership Council, thank you \n     for introducing the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act \n     of 2007. This legislation takes a critically needed holistic \n     approach to both immediate and long-term housing needs in the \n     impacted Gulf Coast region, which I have seen firsthand.\n       Taking a comprehensive but flexible approach to rebuilding \n     in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is essential. I \n     believe this bill will ensure that public housing is \n     redeveloped equitably and sustainably, ensuring that there \n     will be no net loss of federally assisted units in the area \n     and that former residents will have access to services and \n     the opportunity to return. The many displaced low-income \n     families who were not previously public housing residents now \n     will have access to the known and reliable Section 8 housing \n     voucher program rather than the often confusing FEMA rental \n     assistance program.\n       Additionally, the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority \n     disposition pilot program to help developers acquire \n     properties for replacement housing takes an innovative \n     approach. This program will go far to ensuring that New \n     Orleans retains affordable housing options while rebuilding \n     mixed-income communities of choice.\n       Through partnerships with local and national partners, \n     Enterprise has committed to invest $200 million in loans, \n     grants and tax credit equity toward the development of 10,000 \n     affordable, healthy and sustainable homes in the Gulf Coast \n     region. I would also like to commend you for your critical \n     role in extending the placed-in-service date for the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone low income housing tax credits. This was an \n     important step in ensuring that the GO-Zone tax credits will \n     be able to be used to rebuild affordable housing for low-\n     income families in the region.\n           Sincerely,\n       Member, Real Estate Leadership Council, Enterprise \n     Community Partners, Inc.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nan important issue that will determine the success of long-term \nrecovery efforts in the gulf coast. As you know, the gulf coast was \ndevastated in 2005 by two of the most powerful storms to ever hit the \nUnited States in recorded history--Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We also \nexperienced the unprecedented disaster of having a major metropolitan \ncity--the city of New Orleans--under up to 20 feet of water for 2 weeks \nwhen there were 28 separate levee failures which flooded 12,000 acres, \nor 80 percent of New Orleans, following Katrina.\n  I strongly believe that the Congress can provide vast amounts of tax \ncredits, grants, loans, and waivers, but all these benefits will not \nspur recovery if we cannot get people back into their homes. That is \nwhere recovery must start and end. In Louisiana alone, for example, we \nhad over 20,000 businesses destroyed. However, businesses cannot open \ntheir doors if their workers have nowhere to live. Louisiana also had \n875 schools destroyed. Again, teachers cannot come back to school and \nteach our children if they do not have a roof over their heads. So a \nfundamental piece of recovery in the gulf coast is to allow disaster \nvictims to return home and rebuild.\n  Given the ongoing needs in the southern part of my State in regard to \ndamaged housing, as well as all across the gulf coast, I was pleased \nthat H.R. 1227, the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act, passed \nthe House of Representatives on March 21, 2007. This legislation, \nintroduced by Representative Maxine Waters and Representative Barney \nFrank, addresses many of the major housing-related problems in my \nState, in particular issues with the Louisiana Road Home Program and \npublic housing. Since this legislation was received in the Senate, I \nhave been working closely with Senator Chris Dodd, chairman of the \nSenate Banking Committee, to review H.R. 1227 for ways to strengthen \nthis important legislation. To further this goal, we have consulted \nresidents, community leaders, nonprofits, State/local officials, and \nother relevant stakeholders on areas where H.R. 1227 might require \nimprovements.\n  Today, along with Chairman Dodd, I am proud to introduce legislation \nwhich is the product of these months of intensive consultations. This \nlegislation, a Senate companion bill to H.R. 1227, is identical to the \nHouse bill in many places, and in others it really improves upon what \nwas included in the House bill. For example, H.R. 1227 included $15 \nmillion for the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority, NORA, to carry out \na pilot program to purchase and bundle properties, then sell for \nredevelopment. These funds would allow NORA to initially acquire and \nredevelop properties in the New Orleans area. While I support this \npilot program, which was included by my colleague from Louisiana, \nRepresentative Richard Baker, I believe that some additional funds were \nnecessary to truly allow NORA to ``hit the ground running'' with this \nprogram. That is why our bill includes $25 million for NORA. \nFurthermore, before Hurricane Katrina, at approximately 40 percent, New \nOrleans had one of the lowest home ownership levels of any metropolitan \narea in the country. As we rebuild this vibrant city, increasing home \nownership should be one of the tenets of the redevelopment process. \nWith this in mind, our bill does its part to increase home ownership \nopportunities for low-income renters and public housing residents by \nincluding an additional $5 million for NORA to provide soft second \nmortgages. The bill also directs the Federal Housing Administration to \nconvey properties to NORA for affordable resale to these residents.\n\n  In regard to the Louisiana Road Home Program, following passage of \nthe House bill, we learned that the Road Home is facing a shortfall of \nbillions of dollars due to various reasons. There is certainly more \nthan enough blame to go around for the mistakes in the creation and \nmanagement of the Road Home Program, and fixing them will be a shared \nresponsibility. But a significant initial flaw can be found in the \ninadequate and unfairly distributed funding which represented all the \nadministration was willing to commit toward Louisiana recovery. At this \nstage, the funding shortfall threatens to stall recovery in Louisiana \nand leave homeowners without the vital funds they need to rebuild their \nhomes. To address this important issue, our bill includes an \nauthorization of funds so that if the State of Louisiana puts up $1 \nbillion toward the Road Home shortfall, additional funds necessary to \nshore up the program would be available.\n  The Louisiana Recovery Authority, LRA, and the State legislature \napproved a plan that allocates $1.175 billion dollars to be included in \nthe Road Home Program and $217 million for traditional Hazard \nMitigation Projects for use by local parishes and municipalities. In \nparticular, the money allocated for use by local parishes and \nmunicipalities can be used for retrofitting structures, such as flood-\nproofing and elevating homes, acquisition and relocation of residential \nhomes from disaster-prone areas. For the $1.175 billion, the State is \nseeking to use these funds for the Road Home Program, and HUD has \napproved it for these uses, but FEMA has so far refused to allow this \nchange. For more than a year, the State of Louisiana and FEMA have met \nand attempted to work out the issues for applying the funds for the \nRoad Home with no significant progress.\n  To address this issue, the House bill requires FEMA to accept the \nState's program structure for the Road Home, which provides incentives \nto people who choose to remain in the State. These provisions are \nhelpful, but maximum flexibility for using HMGP funds must be provided, \nso that is why our Senate companion would allow Louisiana to use this \nmore than $1 billion for mitigation activities in the Road Home Program \naccording to more flexible HUD Community Development Block Grant \nProgram rules. The bill also requires FEMA to send these funds to the \nState within 90 days so that they can quickly be utilized for the Road \nHome. Lastly, and most important for our impacted parishes in \nLouisiana, the Dodd-Landrieu bill requires Louisiana to send any future \nKatrina/Rita HMGP funds directly to the parishes and localities where \nthese funds are badly needed. I believe this is a commonsense approach \nas we need to make fixing the Road Home a priority but also should \nrecognize that the parishes certainly deserve additional funds which \nshould become available in the coming months.\n\n[[Page S8076]]\n\n  I am also aware that many Louisiana Road Home recipients have seen \ntheir housing recovery grants reduced by Federal agencies, citing \n``duplication of benefits'' regulations. While I understand the need to \nensure fiscal responsibility on Federal recovery spending, in addition \nto make sure that residents are not benefiting from these disasters, \nthese Federal regulations are in many ways stifling recovery rather \nthan discouraging fraud and abuse. This is because Louisiana homeowners \nin many cases had to wait months upon months for U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, disaster assistance, Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, assistance, and many are unfortunately still waiting to \nsee resolution on their insurance claims. The delay in delivery of this \nvital recovery capital, along with the immense damage in the region, \nhas left many homeowners scrambling to cobble together enough funds for \nfully rebuilding their damaged homes. The Louisiana Road Home Program \nwas created to further these ends but cannot allow residents to return \nhome and rebuild if Federal regulations are requiring recovery funds to \ncome back to Washington, not stay in Louisiana where they are needed. \nLet me clarify, though, residents should not benefit from these storms, \nbut the Federal Government should ensure that they have the necessary \nresources to responsibly rebuild their lives. To these ends, H.R. 1227 \nincluded a provision to waive these ``duplication of benefits'' \nregulations for insurance and FEMA assistance so long as the household \ndid not receive a windfall gain. While our bill includes a similar \nprovision, we clarified that SBA disaster assistance is also included \nand that the regulation is waived so long as the household does not \nreceive more funds than is necessary to repair/rebuild their home.\n\n  Following Katrina and Rita, there has been a great deal of emphasis \nplaced on rebuilding gulf coast rental housing and owner-occupied \nhousing, as there should be. The recovery of public housing, however, \nis one area that has not received much national press even though, \nprior to Hurricane Katrina, the Housing Authority of New Orleans, HANO, \noperated 7,379 public housing units, 5,146 of which were occupied in \nthe New Orleans area alone. These residents, just like renters and \nhomeowners, have a right to return home, so we must provide them the \nmeans and opportunity to do so. H.R. 1227 provides a process for \nreturning these New Orleans public housing residents home. It includes \na resident study to find out which residents want to stay where they \nare, which residents want to come back to public housing in New \nOrleans, and which residents would like to return to New Orleans with \nrental or section 8 voucher assistance. This study would guide \nredevelopment of public housing units in New Orleans. The House bill \nalso specifies that HANO shall not demolish the 7,379 public housing \nunits unless there is a plan in place to provide one-for-one \nreplacement for the units. This particular provision ensures that all \npublic housing residents who want to return home can return to \naffordable public housing units.\n  The Dodd-Landrieu Senate companion retains these provisions but \nstrengthens them in a few ways. For example, just as in H.R. 1227, our \nbill sets out that all 5,146 pre-Katrina occupied units shall be \nreplaced with 5,146 hard units. However, unlike the House bill, for the \nremaining units, this bill allows HANO to replace these with hard units \nor with project-based vouchers tied to units in low-income \nneighborhoods/areas undergoing revitalization. This is because some \nresidents want to return to public housing units, but there are others \nwho would like to transition to other types of units. This bill would \nallow them the choice.\n  Furthermore, in another improvement from the House version, our bill \nties the dates for the survey and resident return to the enactment of \nthe bill, to ensure residents have sufficient time to make decisions \nand to return home. Before the storms, almost 85 percent of these \npublic housing residents were employed, and many are now employed in \nother cities, some with children in schools there. Although I know they \nwant to come home as soon as possible, it would be somewhat \nunreasonable to require them to pull their children out of schools and \nleave their current jobs in such a short timeframe. The Senate bill \ngives these residents the time necessary to make relevant arrangements \nand move back within 120 days of enactment.\n  Another issue that was not addressed in the House bill is in regard \nto residents who were on a waiting list to get into public housing. \nWith a shortage of affordable housing in the New Orleans area, these \nalmost 6,000 residents are left without many options in pursuing \nsuitable housing. Our bill also requires HANO, as part of its \nreplacement plans, to contact individuals on the pre-Katrina waiting \nlist and to give these residents consideration for any units not needed \nfor returning residents.\n  As you may know, HANO has been a troubled agency long before \nHurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. It has been plagued by mismanagement \nand financial problems for years and is currently administered by HUD. \nUnder normal circumstances, this may not warrant much congressional \nattention as HUD has taken over countless housing authorities \nnationwide to steer them in the right direction. However, at this \nimportant stage in rebuilding public housing in New Orleans, many in \nthe city believe we need an independent partner overseeing the process. \nAlthough there may be the best intentions from administration officials \nrunning HANO, it is still HUD in Washington calling the shots, not \nlocal officials, residents, and other groups. There are also new and \ninnovative public housing administration models from other cities, \nwhich incorporate both resident input and public-private partnerships.\n  Now, I realize that Rome was not built in a day and that it will take \nyears, not months, to fully rebuild New Orleans. Along these same \nlines, no one expects HANO to be completely reformed overnight, \nespecially given its years of problems and the need to not jeopardize \nongoing development in any way. But there is a general consensus that \nthe status quo for HANO must not continue. To these ends, our bill \nrequires HUD to put HANO into judicial receivership within 30 days, \nwhich would start the process of turning HANO over to local control. We \nbelieve it is important to start this dialogue on the next steps for \nHANO, given how important its role will be in rebuilding public housing \nin the region.\n  In closing, let me reiterate that this bill addresses one of the most \nfundamental needs following a disaster: the need to return home. \nWhether residents live in million-dollar mansions, rental housing, or \npublic housing, they all share a desire to return to their communities \nand, in particular, their homes. The House has done its part to help \nthese residents, so I urge my colleagues to support this comprehensive \nrecovery legislation as now these disaster victims are counting on the \nSenate for action.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport for the legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Trammell Crow Residential,\n\n                                       Atlanta, GA, June 15, 2007.\n     Hon.

I \n     believe this bill will ensure that public housing is \n     redeveloped equitably and sustainably, ensuring that there \n     will be no net loss of federally assisted units in the area \n     and that former residents will have access to services and \n     the opportunity to return. The many displaced low-income \n     families who were not previously public housing residents now \n     will have access to the known and reliable Section 8 housing \n     voucher program rather than the often confusing FEMA rental \n     assistance program.\n       Additionally, the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority \n     disposition pilot program to help developers acquire \n     properties for replacement housing takes an innovative \n     approach. This program will go far to ensuring that New \n     Orleans retains affordable housing\n\n[[Page S8077]]\n\n     options while rebuilding mixed-income communities of choice.\n       Through partnerships with local and national partners, \n     Enterprise has committed to invest $200 million in loans, \n     grants and tax credit equity toward the development of 10,000 \n     affordable, healthy and sustainable homes in the Gulf Coast \n     region.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve the \nmanagement of medical care for members of the Armed Forces, to improve \nthe speed and efficiency of the physical disability evaluation system \nof the Department of Defense, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to proudly join my friend and \ncolleague Senator Blanche Lincoln in the introduction of the \nServicemembers' Healthcare Benefits and Rehabilitation Enhancement Act \nof 2007.\n  In March, I was able to visit one of Maine's returning soldiers who \nhas been assigned outpatient care at the Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter. We spoke about the many issues and obstacles faced by our \nwounded troops as they struggle not only to recover from their \ninjuries, but to prepare themselves for their future. During our \nmeeting, this soldier covered many of the pitfalls faced by troops as \nthey confront the bewildering processes of medical and physical \nevaluation boards without the benefit of anyone to advocate on their \nbehalf. In fact, he aptly described the process as an ``adversarial'' \nsystem that onerously demands wounded soldiers to provide the ``burden \nof proof '' for their claims.\n  In response, we have crafted this legislation in order to remedy a \nvariety of flaws that currently plague the military health care system, \nincluding: Inequitable disability ratings, a lack of advocacy within \nmilitary outpatient facilities, inadequate mental health treatment, and \ninefficient transition from the DOD to the VA.\n  First off, our bill would address the concerns I have heard from a \nnumber of returning troops from my home State of Maine and across this \nNation who have gone without the proper advocacy and case management \nfor medical benefits during their stay at military outpatient \nfacilities. It is inexcusable that our returning heroes are often \nforced to navigate the esoteric physical disability evaluation system, \nPDES, within an adversarial atmosphere.\n  The measure we are proposing would require the Secretary of Defense \nto provide each recovering servicemember in a military medical \ntreatment facility with a medical care manager who will assist him or \nher with all matters regarding their medical status, along with a \ncaseworker who will assist each servicemember and his or her family in \nobtaining all the information necessary for transition, recovery, and \nbenefits collection. Further, provisions we included will create a DOD-\nwide ombudsmen office to provide policy guidance to, and oversight of, \nombudsman offices in all military departments and the medical system of \nthe DOD. Only then, will our returning servicemembers recover within an \natmosphere that is based upon advocacy.\n  Additionally, recent news reports and independent analysis have \nrevealed troubling statistics regarding rampant inaccuracies within the \nmilitary disability ratings system. According to Pentagon data analyzed \nby the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission, since 2000, 92.7 \npercent of all disability ratings handed out by physical evaluation \nboards, PEBs, have been 20 percent or lower. Under the current policy, \nthose who receive disability ratings under 30 percent and have served \nless than 20 years of military service are discharged with only a \nseverance check, deprived of full military retirement pay, life \ninsurance, health insurance, and access to military commissaries.\n  Further evidence of a troubled disability ratings system shows that \nsince America went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, fewer veterans have \nreceived disability ratings of 30 percent or more, inferring that the \nDOD may have lowered the ratings for injured troops who would have \notherwise received a host of lifelong benefits. On top of that, it \ncurrently takes an average of 209 days for troops to complete the PDES \nprocess by receiving notification of potential discharge and a \nsubsequent disability rating.\n  As a means of fixing these blatant flaws within the military \ndisability ratings system, this legislation consolidates the physical \nevaluation system by placing the informal and formal physical \nevaluation boards under one command, as a method of streamlining and \nexpediting the process. Our troops deserve timely care and efficient \ntreatment upon their return home, and therefore, no recovering \nservicemember should be forced to endure lengthy delays in a medical \nhold or holdover status due to bureaucratic inefficiencies.\n  The bill also requires that physicians preparing each individual \nmedical case for all physical evaluation boards report multiple \ndiagnosed medical impairments that, in concert, may deem a \nservicemember to be unfit for duty. Under the current system, the U.S. \nArmy, for example, only rates physical impairments that individually, \ncause a servicemember to be deemed unfit for duty, ultimately \ndismissing ailments that may significantly hinder a servicemember's \nability to continue his or her service in the military or find gainful \nemployment in the civilian sector.\n  Over the past year, the American public has also become acutely aware \nof the effects of traumatic brain injury, TBI, which has become the \nsignature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, affecting \nthousands of returning servicemembers. Therefore, it is now more \nimperative than ever for both the DOD and the VA to implement mental \nhealth treatment policies that accurately diagnose and adequately treat \ndebilitating mental health injuries among our injured troops.\n  Our bill addresses these issues by including a provision that \nrequires all servicemembers who are expected to deploy to a combat \ntheater to receive a mental health assessment that tests their \ncognitive functioning within 120\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\ndays before deployment, a mental health assessment within 60 days after \ndeployment, to include a comprehensive screening for mild, moderate, \nand severe cases of TBI. Additionally, all servicemembers will receive \na third mental health assessment at the time of their predischarge \nphysical.\n  The measure we are putting forward today also aims to update the \ncurrent disability ratings system used by the military and the VA to \ninclude the effects of TBI and posttraumatic stress disorder, along \nwith any other mental health disorders that may affect our Nation's \nreturning warriors. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs would be required \nto issue a report to Congress detailing a plan to update the Veteran's \nAdministration Schedule for Ratings Disabilities, VASRD, to align its \ndisability ratings to more closely reflect the effects of mental health \ndisorders, including TBI and PTSD on the modern workforce.\n  The Servicemembers' Healthcare Benefits and Rehabilitation \nEnhancement Act of 2007 also calls on the Secretaries of Defense and \nVeterans Affairs to provide Congress with a report detailing plans to \nincrease the role of eligible private sector rehabilitation providers \nfor assisting the VA in providing comprehensive post acute inpatient \nand outpatient rehabilitation for TBI and PTSD, if in certain \ninstances, the VA is unable to provide such services.\n  The Veterans Health Administration is, unequivocally, the foremost \nexpert in providing mental health treatment for our recovering \nservicemembers, yet in varying circumstances, the VA may require \nadditional health care coverage in remote areas. All of our returning \nheroes, despite the severity of their mental health ailments, or their \nlocation geographically, deserve every available option for \nrehabilitative services, to ensure that they never go untreated.\n  Additionally, to help ease the transition from the military health \ncare system to the VA system, both the DOD and the VA must adopt and \nimplement a unified electronic medical database. Interagency database \ncompatibility would not only increase medical efficiency, but it would \nsignificantly ease the transition into civilian life for injured or \nretiring servicemembers who deserve timely and effective health care. \nTherefore, our legislation establishes and implements a single \nelectronic military and medical record database within the DOD that \nwill be used to track and record the medical status of each member of \nthe Armed Forces in theater and throughout the military health care \nprocess, and will be accessible to the VA through the joint patient \ntracking application, JPTA. This electronic records system will be \nidentical to the VistA system, currently used by the VA, which has \nserved as a model of excellence for electronic medical databases among \nour Nation's health community.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those brave Americans who \nserved in uniform with honor, courage, and distinction. The obligation \nour Nation holds for its servicemembers and veterans is enormous, and \nit is an obligation that must be fulfilled every day. We must always \nremain cognizant of the wisdom laid forth by President George \nWashington, when he stated, ``The willingness with which our young \npeople are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall \nbe directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of \nearlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country.''\n  At a time when over 600,000 courageous men and women have returned \nfrom combat in both Iraq and Afghanistan, I believe it is now up to \nCongress to do everything in its power to answer the call of our men \nand women who have nobly served our Nation in uniform, to ensure that \nthey receive the heroes treatment they rightly earned and rightly \ndeserve. Again, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, for her \nassistance in making this a stronger bill and bringing it before the \nSenate. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1671. A bill to reauthorize and improve the entrepreneurial \ndevelopment programs of the Small Business Administration, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepeneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to introduce today with \nRanking Member Senator Snowe the Entrepreneurial Development Act of \n2007. As always, I appreciate the opportunity to work with my colleague \nfrom Maine on the issues facing the Nation's small businesses, and I \nbelieve that we have taken another step in the right direction with \nthis bill.\n  The Entrepreneurial Development Act reauthorizes and expands the \nSmall Business Administration's entrepreneurial development programs. \nIn particular, it supports women and minority small business ownership \nopportunities by boosting Small Business Development Centers, Women's \nBusiness Centers, SCORE, and other counseling and assistance programs. \nInvesting in these core small business assistance programs is critical \nto creating jobs and boosting our economy. In Massachusetts alone, \nSBDCs served over 8,500 entrepreneurs last year and our Center for \nWomen and Enterprise has generated 15,000 jobs over the last 10 years. \nThese programs will not only help our entrepreneurs succeed today, but \nthey will build the next generation of small business owners too.\n  We have long supported these kinds of improvements and many of the \nprovisions in the bill unanimously passed the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship last Congress.\n  The bill takes a number of steps to improve the Women's Business \nCenter grant program through streamlining paperwork and increased \noversight, and also promoting greater consultation between the National \nWomen's Business Council, the Interagency Committee on Women's Business \nEnterprise and Women's Business Centers. This increased communication \nbetween the different groups will help them provide the most effective \nand efficient assistance to women-owned small businesses.\n  The bill also creates a Native American small business development \nprogram, an Office of Native American Affairs within the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, and a Native American grant pilot program to \nfoster increased employment and expansion of small businesses in Indian \nCountry through business counseling services. According to the SBA's \nOffice of Advocacy, the American Indian and Alaska Native community is \none of the fastest growing business groups in the country. Yet nearly \n25 percent of the country's American Indian and Alaska Native \npopulations live in poverty. There are huge small business \nopportunities just waiting to be tapped in Indian Country. We should be \nbuilding on the energy and excitement among Native American \nentrepreneurs with more support from the federal government, and that's \nexactly what we intend to do.\n  In addition, the bill creates several pilot programs that will help \nto deal with some of the most important issues facing small businesses.\n  First, the bill establishes a pilot program to assist small \nbusinesses in complying with Federal and State laws and regulations. \nReducing redtape for small businesses has always been one of my top \npriorities for the committee. We must help small firms navigate the \nlabyrinthine regulatory system because compliance is critical to their \nsuccess and their continued contribution to our economy. I'm committed \nto seeing that small businesses have every tool available--from guides \nto direct compliance assistance and counseling to assist them along the \nway.\n  In addition, this bill seeks to address the small business health \ninsurance crisis through a competitive, pilot grant program for SBDCs \nto provide counseling and resources to small businesses about health \ninsurance options in their communities. I have heard time and time \nagain from small business owners that their number one concern is the \nhigh cost of health insurance. At least 27 million Americans working \nfor small businesses don't have health insurance. That means that 27 \nmillion Americans are one slip, illness or emergency room visit away \nfrom disaster. We must do everything we can to help them.\n  Finally, the bill creates a Minority Entrepreneurship and Innovation \npilot program to provide competitive grants to Historically Black \nColleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Alaska Native \nand Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, and Tribal\n\n[[Page S8079]]\n\nColleges to create a curricula focused on entrepreneurship. The goal of \nthis program is to target students in highly skilled fields such as \nengineering, manufacturing, science and technology, and guide them \ntowards entrepreneurship as a career option. Traditionally, minority-\nowned businesses are disproportionately represented in the service \nsectors. Promoting entrepreneurial education to undergraduate students \nwill help expand business ownership beyond the service sectors to \nhigher growth technical and financial sectors. One of our Nation's \ngreatest assets is our diversity and investing in minority businesses \nonly helps to increase the value of that asset. Unfortunately, \ninvestment in our minority business community has been sorely lacking. \nFor example, in Massachusetts, minorities make up about 15 percent of \nour population, but they own only about 5 percent of the businesses and \naccount for just 1.4 percent of sales. These statistics demonstrate why \nprograms like the Minority Entrepreneurship and Innovation pilot \nprogram are so important to the future minority business leaders of \ntomorrow. Making this investment will ensure that we will have enough \nentrepreneurs from all sectors of our Nation to keep our economy \ncompetitive and strong.\n  I thank Senator Snowe for joining me in introducing this important \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to support it when it comes before the \nfull Senate for consideration. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1671\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to join with \nChairman Kerry in introducing the Entrepreneurial Development Act of \n2007, a bill to reauthorize and improve the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's--SBA--Entrepreneurial Development Programs. I have \nlong fought to expand the power and reach of the SBA's entrepreneurial \ndevelopment tools, which are used by millions of aspiring entrepreneurs \nand small businesses across the United States. These programs \ndemonstrate how Congress can play a positive role in enhancing private-\nsector financing for start-up companies. We must continue to strengthen \nthese core SBA programs because they have proven invaluable in aiding \nthe efforts and dreams of America's entrepreneurs.\n  The bill which I am cosponsoring today is the product of the type of \nbipartisan work the Small Business Committee has come to be known for. \nThe provisions contained in this legislation are a compilation of ideas \nand initiatives put forward by myself, Chairman Kerry, and other \nCommittee members. Much of the language in the Entrepreneurial \nDevelopment Act of 2007 was contained in my SBA Reauthorization and \nImprovements Act passed unanimously by the Small Business Committee \nduring the 109th Congress. Unfortunately, this bipartisan bill never \npassed the Senate.\n  Since 1980, Small Business Development Centers--SBDCs--have been \nessential in the delivery of management and technical counseling \nassistance and educational programs to prospective and existing small \nbusiness owners. Since its inception, the SBDC program has served over \n11 million clients with new business starts, sustainability programs \nfor struggling firms, and expansion plans for growth firms. For every \ndollar spent on the SBDC program, approximately $2.66 in tax revenue is \ngenerated.\n  An example of the local value of the SBDC program is found in my home \nState of Maine, where SBDCs invested more than 10,000 hours in \ncounseling to 3,000 clients in 2005. The economic benefits of these \nservices on the economy in Maine was demonstrated by a recent study of \nthe Maine SBDCs that showed: No. 1, long-term clients of the Maine SBDC \ngenerated $44 million in incremental sales and 908 new jobs because of \nSBDC counseling assistance; and No. 2, the total amount of tax revenue \ngenerated as a result of counseling 5 or more hours is approximately \n$3.0 million in State taxes and $1.58 million in Federal tax revenues.\n  The Women's Business Center--WBC--program, established by Congress in \n1988, promotes the growth of women-owned businesses through business \ntraining and technical assistance, and provides access to credit and \ncapital, Federal contracts, and international trade opportunities. The \nWBC program served more than 144,000 clients across the country last \nyear, providing help with financial management, procurement training, \nmarketing and technical assistance. WBCs also provide specialized \nprograms that include mentoring in various languages, Internet \ntraining, issues facing displaced workers, and rural home-based \nentrepreneurs. According to the SBA's 2008 budget submission, WBCs were \nresponsible for creating or retaining over 6,800 jobs nationwide. I \ntake great pride in the fact that my own State of Maine leads the way \nfor women-owned businesses. Today, there are more than 63,000 women-\nowned firms in Maine, employing over 75,000 Mainers and generating more \nthan $9 billion in sales. We must all be committed to multiplying that \nstory of success in every State in America.\n  Service Corps of Retired Executives--SCORE--is a nonprofit \nassociation that matches business-management counselors with small \nbusiness clients. SCORE volunteer counselors share their management and \ntechnical expertise with both existing and prospective small business \nowners. With its 10,500 member volunteer association sponsored by the \nSBA, and more than 389 service delivery points and a Web site, SCORE \nprovides counseling to small businesses nationwide. The National SCORE \norganization delivers its services of business and technical assistance \nthrough a national network of chapters, an Internet counseling site, \npartnerships with SBA, the SBDCs and WBCs, and with the public/private \nsector. In 2006, SCORE counseled and trained over 300,000 clients.\n  The bill being introduced today builds upon the aforementioned \nsuccesses of SBA's Entrepreneurial Development programs, which counsels \nover 1.2 million small businesses and entrepreneurs each year through \nthe expertise of the trained resource partners located across America.\n  In addition to reauthorizing SBA's Entrepreneurial Development \nprograms and increasing funding levels, this bill also addresses the \ncrisis small businesses face when it comes to securing quality, \naffordable health insurance. In 4 of the past 5 years, health insurance \ncosts have increased by double-digit percentage levels. This has led to \na disturbing trend of fewer and fewer small businesses being able to \noffer health insurance to their employees. The Kaiser Family Foundation \nrecently reported that only 47 percent of our Nation's smallest \nbusinesses--with less than 10 employees--are able to\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\noffer health insurance as a workplace benefit. In stark contrast, \nhealth insurance is nearly universally offered at larger businesses.\n  A key provision in this bill would establish a 4-year, pilot grant \nprogram to provide information, counseling, and educational materials \nto small businesses, through the well-established national framework of \nSBDCs. Recent research conducted by the non-partisan Healthcare \nLeadership Council found that with a short educational and counseling \nsession, small businesses were up to 33 percent more likely to offer \nhealth insurance to their employees. My proposal is based on the Small \nBusiness Health Education and Awareness Act, which I introduced in the \n109th Congress with Senator Bennett, and plan to reintroduce this \nsession with Senators Kerry and Bennett.\n  Most American workers are employed by small and medium sized \nenterprises. It is these businesses that account for nearly 98 percent \nof the growth in exporter population--and are among the major \nbeneficiaries when foreign barriers are reduced. Additionally, 97 \npercent of exporters are small businesses. Over the last decade, the \nnumber of exports from small businesses increased by more than 250 \npercent. Small businesses account for almost $300 billion of yearly \nexport sales--nearly one-third of total U.S. exports.\n  This bill establishes an Associate Administrator for International \nTrade, and expands the trade distribution network to include the United \nStates Export Assistance Centers USEACs. In addition, this section \nensures that all our Nation's small exporters have access to export \nfinancing. This provision establishes a floor of international finance \nspecialists at level SBA had in January 2003. Finally, this provision \nincreases the maximum loan guarantee amount to $2.75 million and \nspecifies that the loan cap for international trade loans--ITLs--is \n$3.67 million, as well as sets out that working capital is an eligible \nuse for loan proceeds. The bill also makes ITLs consistent with regular \nSBA 7(a) loans in terms of allowing the same collateral and refinancing \nterms as with regular 7(a) loans.\n  The SBA's entrepreneurial development programs provide tremendous \nvalue for a relatively small investment. I am committed to ensuring \nthat Americans have the necessary resources to start, grow, and develop \na business. I believe that it is our duty to do everything possible to \nsustain prosperity and job creation throughout the United States. I \nurge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8088-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 240--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 21 THROUGH OCTOBER 27, 2007, \n                AS ``NATIONAL SAVE FOR RETIREMENT WEEK''\n\n  Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Conrad) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 240\n\n       Whereas the cost of retirement continues to rise, in part, \n     because people in the United States are living longer than \n     ever before, the number of employers providing retiree health \n     coverage continues to decline, and retiree health care costs \n     continue to increase at a rapid pace;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States, but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than \\2/\n     3\\ of workers or their spouses are currently saving for \n     retirement and that the actual amount of retirement savings \n     of workers lags far behind the amount that is realistically \n     needed to adequately fund retirement;\n       Whereas many employees have available to them through their \n     employers access to defined benefit and defined contribution \n     plans to assist them in preparing for retirement;\n       Whereas many employees may not be aware of their retirement \n     savings options and may not have focused on the importance of \n     and need for saving for their own retirement;\n       Whereas many employees may not be taking advantage of \n     workplace defined contribution plans at all or to the full \n     extent allowed by the plans or under Federal law; and\n       Whereas all workers, including public- and private-sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from increased awareness of \n     the need to save for retirement and the availability of tax-\n     advantaged retirement savings vehicles to assist them in \n     saving for retirement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 21 through October 27, 2007, as \n     ``National Save for Retirement Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Save for \n     Retirement Week, including raising public awareness about the \n     importance of adequate retirement savings and the \n     availability of employer-sponsored retirement plans;

which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n       Whereas the World Trade Organization (WTO) administers and \n     enforces the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \n     Intellectual Property Rights (in this preamble referred to as \n     ``the TRIPS Agreement'') to safeguard access to essential \n     drugs;\n       Whereas, in 1999, the World Health Assembly, by consensus \n     including the United States, adopted Resolution 52.19 on the \n     World Health Organization's Revised Drug Strategy, which \n     expressed concern ``about the situation in which one third of \n     the world's population has no guaranteed access to essential \n     drugs, [and] in which new world trade agreements may have a \n     negative impact on local manufacturing capacity and the \n     access to and prices of pharmaceuticals in developing \n     countries,'' and urged member states to ``ensure that public \n     health rather than commercial interests have primacy in \n     pharmaceutical and health policies and to review their \n     options under'' the TRIPS Agreement;\n       Whereas, in 2001, the member states of the WTO, by \n     consensus including the United States, adopted the Doha \n     Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, in \n     which member states agreed that ``intellectual property \n     protection is important for the development of new \n     medicines'', but also expressed ``concerns about its effects \n     on prices'';\n       Whereas the Doha Declaration further states that the TRIPS \n     Agreement ``can and should be interpreted and implemented in \n     a manner supportive of WTO Members' right to protect public \n     health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for \n     all'';\n       Whereas Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement allows each \n     member state the flexibility to issue compulsory licences \n     which permit the use of the subject matter of a patent, and \n     gives member states broad latitude for such use;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization's 2006 Report of the \n     Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and \n     Public Health emphasized the need for innovation in medical \n     technologies and access to such innovation, and the report \n     also--\n       (1) states that the Doha Declaration clarifies the right of \n     governments to use compulsory licensing as a means of \n     resolving tensions that may arise between public health and \n     the protection of intellectual property rights, and to \n     determine the grounds for using compulsory licensing;\n       (2) recommends that developing countries provide for the \n     use of compulsory licensing provisions in legislation as one \n     means to facilitate access to affordable medicines through \n     import or local production;\n       (3) recommends that bilateral trade agreements not seek to \n     impose obligations to protect intellectual property rights \n     that are greater than those required under the TRIPS \n     Agreement, because such obligations could potentially reduce \n     access to medicines in developing countries; and\n       (4) recommends that developing countries should not impose \n     restrictions for the use of,\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\n     or reliance on, data from pharmaceutical development tests in \n     ways that would exclude fair competition or impede the use of \n     flexibilities built into the TRIPS Agreement, unless such a \n     restriction is required for public health reasons;\n       Whereas the Governments of Thailand and Brazil have issued \n     compulsory licenses to gain access to less expensive versions \n     of second-generation anti-retroviral drugs in order to treat \n     a much larger number of HIV/AIDS patients;\n       Whereas the Government of the United States has recognized \n     the right of the Government of Thailand to issue compulsory \n     licenses in accordance with the laws of Thailand and the \n     obligations of the Government of Thailand as a member of the \n     WTO;\n       Whereas the 2007 ``Special 301'' Report, the annual review \n     of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement \n     conducted by the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, elevated Thailand to the Priority Watch List, \n     pursuant to section 182 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2242), for reasons including ``indications of a weakening of \n     respect for patents, as the Thai Government announced \n     decisions to issue compulsory licenses for several patented \n     pharmaceutical products'';\n       Whereas the 2007 ``Special 301'' Report singled out Brazil \n     for having ``at times indicated consideration of the use of \n     compulsory licensing on patented pharmaceutical products'';\n       Whereas the 2007 ``Special 301'' Report cited 21 developing \n     countries for ``inadequate'' intellectual property rights \n     protections on pharmaceutical test data;\n       Whereas the United States Trade Representative has \n     negotiated or is seeking to complete several bilateral or \n     regional trade agreements with developing countries that \n     contain further obligations to protect intellectual property \n     rights, including--\n       (1) limitations on the grounds for issuing compulsory \n     licenses;\n       (2) requirements that countries adopt periods of data \n     exclusivity on the scientific evidence used to determine that \n     drugs are safe and effective, which either delays the timely \n     entry of generic drugs into the market or forces competitors \n     producing generic drugs to invest in costly, time-consuming, \n     and redundant clinical trials, including trials that violate \n     ethical rules concerning the repetition of experiments on \n     humans;\n       (3) extensions of patent terms beyond 20 years;\n       (4) linkage between drug registration and assertions of \n     patent protection, so that agencies responsible for the \n     regulation of drugs are prohibited from granting marketing \n     approval to a generic version of a medicine if the product is \n     covered by a patent;

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RETAIL FUEL FAIRNESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consumer protection is a priority for the United States \n     Government. Consumers are entitled to the full benefit of \n     every purchase.\n       (2) As atmospheric temperature rises, so does the \n     temperature of motor fuel (gasoline and diesel fuel) in \n     filling station tanks. Motor fuel expands as it gets warmer \n     so it takes more fluid to contain the same content of energy \n     (or BTUs) it had when it was at a cooler temperature, \n     resulting in a decrease in energy content of 1 gallon of \n     motor fuel.\n       (3) The expansion of liquid motor fuel due to increases in \n     temperature is commonly referred to as ``hot fuel''.\n       (4) During the purchase and sale of motor fuel between \n     wholesalers and retailers, the motor fuel volume is \n     temperature compensated to a 60 degree Fahrenheit reference \n     volume.\n       (5) During the purchase and sale of motor fuel between \n     retailers and consumers the temperature of the fuel is not \n     considered.\n       (6) The lack of temperature compensation at the retail pump \n     costs consumers $2,740,000,000 annually.\n       (7) An excise tax on the sale of motor fuel is imposed on \n     entities at points in the chain of distribution above the \n     retail level. Taxes are remitted based on temperature-\n     compensated gallons of motor fuel.\n       (8) Taxes are recouped from retail consumers on a non-\n     temperature-compensated basis. As a result, when retailers \n     sell to consumers motor fuel that is at a temperature greater \n     than 60 degrees Fahrenheit, the retailers recoup more from \n     consumers as ``taxes'' than the actual amount of Federal and \n     State excise taxes paid by the retailers.\n       (9) At the time of purchase, a consumer is entitled to the \n     same BTU content contained in a gallon of motor fuel at the \n     retail pump as the retailer receives when the retailer \n     purchases a gallon of motor fuel from the wholesaler.\n       (10) The most equitable method to address the disparity of \n     the BTU content at the retail pump is by installing \n     temperature compensating retrofit kits to retail fuel pump. \n     This equipment is currently being used in Canada to \n     compensate for the colder motor fuel temperatures they \n     experience.\n       (11) The National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. \n     creates the uniform commercial transaction standards to \n     ensure consumers receive the full benefit of their purchases.\n       (12) The National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. \n     has the authority to adopt standards that would address the \n     concerns behind hot fuel.\n       (13) The National Institute of Standards and Technology \n     (NIST) provides technical guidance to the National Conference \n     on Weights and Measures, Inc. (NCWM). NIST officials serve as \n     technical advisors to NCWM committees, including the Law and \n     Regulations Committee.\n       (14) In January 2007, the Law and Regulations Committee of \n     the National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. voted \n     to adopt a standard that will facilitate the implementation \n     of a permissive approach to the use of temperature \n     compensation in the marketplace.\n       (15) In June, 2007, in testimony before a subcommittee of \n     the House of Representatives, a NIST weights and measure \n     official supported the adoption of temperature compensation \n     for the sale of motor fuel at retail pumps.\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\n       (16) Despite over 30 years of debate, the National \n     Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. has not yet \n     addressed consumer concerns over hot fuel and its hidden \n     costs to consumers.\n       (17) The National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. \n     will hold its annual meeting on July 8-12, 2007 in Salt Lake \n     City, Utah.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress should adopt sound policies that protect \n     consumers from fraud or unfairness in connection with the \n     purchase or sale of motor fuel;\n       (2) consumers should receive the full benefit of their \n     purchase;\n       (3) in order for consumers to receive the full benefit of a \n     gallon of motor fuel, the temperature disparity created by \n     hot fuel must be resolved;\n       (4) the National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. \n     has the authority to adopt standards that would resolve the \n     United States Governments concerns surrounding hot fuel;\n       (5) during the annual meeting of the National Conference on \n     Weights and Measures, Inc. in July 2007, standards for the \n     hot fuel issue should be promulgated;\n       (6) in promulgating standards to address the hot fuel \n     issue, the National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. \n     should consider the $2,740,000,000 loss to consumers;\n       (7) in promulgating standards to address the hot fuel \n     issue, the National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. \n     should consider the fact that consumers are paying more in \n     Federal and State excise motor fuel taxes than motor fuel \n     retailers are remitting; and\n       (8) in promulgating standards to address the hot fuel \n     issue, the National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. \n     should consider the methods, standards and procedures Canada \n     is currently using to regulate motor fuel temperature.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1781.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ADDRESSING THE RISKS POSED \n                   BY GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) There is a scientific consensus, as established by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed by \n     the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued buildup \n     of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threatens \n     the stability of the global climate.\n       (2) There are significant long-term risks to the economy \n     and the environment of the United States from the temperature \n     increases and climatic disruptions that are projected to \n     result from increased greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (3) The potential impacts of global climate change, \n     including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and \n     abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions \n     and instability in regions affected and, therefore, have \n     implications for the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (4) The United States has the largest economy in the world \n     and is also the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\n       (5) The greenhouse gas emissions of the United States are \n     projected to continue to rise.\n       (6) The greenhouse gas emissions of developing countries \n     are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the United \n     States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas emissions of \n     the United States and other developed countries.\n       (7) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels \n     necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the \n     introduction of new energy technologies and other climate-\n     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no \n     emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage \n     of greenhouse gases.\n       (8) The development and sale of climate-friendly \n     technologies in the United States and internationally present \n     economic opportunities for workers and businesses in the \n     United States.\n       (9) Climate-friendly technologies can improve air quality \n     by reducing harmful pollutants from stationary and mobile \n     sources and can enhance energy security by reducing reliance \n     on imported oil, diversifying energy sources, and reducing \n     the vulnerability of energy delivery infrastructure.\n       (10) Other industrialized countries are undertaking \n     measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which provide \n     the industries in those countries with a competitive \n     advantage in the growing global market for climate-friendly \n     technologies.\n       (11) Efforts to limit emissions growth in developing \n     countries in a manner that is consistent with the development \n     needs of those countries could establish significant markets \n     for climate-friendly technologies and contribute to \n     international efforts to address climate change.\n       (12) The United States Climate Change Science Program \n     launched by President George W. Bush concluded in April 2006 \n     that there is no longer a discrepancy between the rates of \n     global average temperature increase observed at the Earth's \n     surface and in the atmosphere, strengthening the scientific \n     evidence that human activity contributes significantly to \n     global temperature increases.\n       (13) President Bush, in the State of the Union Address \n     given in January 2006, called on the United States to reduce \n     its ``addiction'' to oil and focus its attention on \n     developing cleaner, renewable, and sustainable energy \n     sources.\n       (14) President Bush has launched the Asia-Pacific \n     Partnership on Clean Development and Climate to cooperatively \n     develop new and cleaner energy technologies and promote their \n     use in fast-developing nations like India and China.\n       (15) The national security of the United States will \n     increasingly depend on the deployment of diplomatic, \n     military, scientific, and economic resources toward solving \n     the problem of the overreliance of the United States and the \n     world on high-carbon energy.\n       (16) As documented in recent studies, a failure to \n     recognize, plan for, and mitigate the strategic, social, \n     political, and economic effects of a changing climate will \n     have an adverse impact on the national security interests of \n     the United States.\n       (17) The United States is a party to the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994 (hereinafter referred \n     to as the ``Convention'').\n       (18) At the December 2005 United Nations Climate Change \n     Conference in Montreal, Canada, parties to the Convention, \n     with the concurrence of the United States, initiated a new \n     dialogue on long-term cooperative action to address climate \n     change.\n       (19) The Convention sets a long-term objective of \n     stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate system.\n       (20) The Convention establishes that parties bear common \n     but differentiated responsibilities for efforts to achieve \n     the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (21) An effective global effort to address climate change \n     must provide for commitments and action by all countries that \n     are major emitters of greenhouse gases, developed and \n     developing alike, and the widely varying circumstances among \n     the developed and developing countries may require that such \n     commitments and action vary.\n       (22) The United States has the capability to lead the \n     effort to counter global climate change.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should act to reduce the health, \n     environmental, economic, and national security risks posed by \n     global climate change and foster sustained economic growth \n     through a new generation of technologies, by--\n       (1) participating in negotiations under the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994, and leading efforts \n     in other international fora, with the objective of securing \n     United States participation in binding agreements that--\n       (A) advance and protect the economic and national security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (B) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n     are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n     principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n       (C) establish flexible international mechanisms to minimize \n     the cost of efforts by participating countries; and\n       (D) achieve a significant long-term reduction in global \n     greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (2) establishing a bipartisan Senate observer group, the \n     members of which shall be designated by the Majority Leader \n     and the Minority Leader of the Senate and shall represent the \n     appropriate congressional committees of oversight, to--\n       (A) monitor any international negotiations on climate \n     change; and\n       (B) ensure that the advice and consent function of the \n     Senate is exercised in a manner to facilitate timely \n     consideration of any applicable treaty submitted to the \n     Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1787. Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Lugar) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed to amendment SA 1502 proposed by Mr. Reid to \nthe bill H.R. 6, to reduce our Nation's dependency on foreign oil by \ninvesting in clean, renewable, and alternative energy resources, \npromoting new emerging energy technologies, developing greater \nefficiency, and creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables \nReserve to invest in alternative energy, and for other purposes; which \nwas ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                       TITLE VIII--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 801. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ADDRESSING THE RISKS POSED \n                   BY GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) There is a scientific consensus, as established by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed by \n     the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued buildup \n     of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threatens \n     the stability of the global climate.\n       (2) There are significant long-term risks to the economy \n     and the environment of the United States from the temperature \n     increases and climatic disruptions that are projected to \n     result from increased greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (3) The potential impacts of global climate change, \n     including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and \n     abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions \n     and instability in regions affected and, therefore, have \n     implications for the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\n       (4) The United States has the largest economy in the world \n     and is also the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\n       (5) The greenhouse gas emissions of the United States are \n     projected to continue to rise.\n       (6) The greenhouse gas emissions of developing countries \n     are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the United \n     States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas emissions of \n     the United States and other developed countries.\n       (7) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels \n     necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the \n     introduction of new energy technologies and other climate-\n     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no \n     emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage \n     of greenhouse gases.\n       (8) The development and sale of climate-friendly \n     technologies in the United States and internationally present \n     economic opportunities for workers and businesses in the \n     United States.\n       (9) Climate-friendly technologies can improve air quality \n     by reducing harmful pollutants from stationary and mobile \n     sources and can enhance energy security by reducing reliance \n     on imported oil, diversifying energy sources, and reducing \n     the vulnerability of energy delivery infrastructure.\n       (10) Other industrialized countries are undertaking \n     measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which provide \n     the industries in those countries with a competitive \n     advantage in the growing global market for climate-friendly \n     technologies.\n       (11) Efforts to limit emissions growth in developing \n     countries in a manner that is consistent with the development \n     needs of those countries could establish significant markets \n     for climate-friendly technologies and contribute to \n     international efforts to address climate change.\n       (12) The United States Climate Change Science Program \n     launched by President George W. Bush concluded in April 2006 \n     that there is no longer a discrepancy between the rates of \n     global average temperature increase observed at the Earth's \n     surface and in the atmosphere, strengthening the scientific \n     evidence that human activity contributes significantly to \n     global temperature increases.\n       (13) President Bush, in the State of the Union Address \n     given in January 2006, called on the United States to reduce \n     its ``addiction'' to oil and focus its attention on \n     developing cleaner, renewable, and sustainable energy \n     sources.\n       (14) President Bush has launched the Asia-Pacific \n     Partnership on Clean Development and Climate to cooperatively \n     develop new and cleaner energy technologies and promote their \n     use in fast-developing nations like India and China.\n       (15) The national security of the United States will \n     increasingly depend on the deployment of diplomatic, \n     military, scientific, and economic resources toward solving \n     the problem of the overreliance of the United States and the \n     world on high-carbon energy.\n       (16) The United States is a party to the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994 (hereinafter referred \n     to as the ``Convention'').\n       (17) At the December 2005 United Nations Climate Change \n     Conference in Montreal, Canada, parties to the Convention, \n     with the concurrence of the United States, initiated a new \n     dialogue on long-term cooperative action to address climate \n     change.\n       (18) The Convention sets a long-term objective of \n     stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate system.\n       (19) The Convention establishes that parties bear common \n     but differentiated responsibilities for efforts to achieve \n     the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (20) An effective global effort to address climate change \n     must provide for commitments and action by all countries that \n     are major emitters of greenhouse gases, developed and \n     developing alike, and the widely varying circumstances among \n     the developed and developing countries may require that such \n     commitments and action vary.\n       (21) The United States has the capability to lead the \n     effort to counter global climate change.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should act to reduce the health, \n     environmental, economic, and national security risks posed by \n     global climate change and foster sustained economic growth \n     through a new generation of technologies, by--\n       (1) participating in negotiations under the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994, and leading efforts \n     in other international fora, with the objective of securing \n     United States participation in binding agreements that--\n       (A) advance and protect the economic and national security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (B) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n     are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n     principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n       (C) establish flexible international mechanisms to minimize \n     the cost of efforts by participating countries; and\n       (D) achieve a significant long-term reduction in global \n     greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (2) establishing a bipartisan Senate observer group, the \n     members of which shall be designated by the Majority Leader \n     and the Minority Leader of the Senate and shall represent the \n     appropriate congressional committees of oversight, to--\n       (A) monitor any international negotiations on climate \n     change; and\n       (B) ensure that the advice and consent function of the \n     Senate is exercised in a manner to facilitate timely \n     consideration of any applicable treaty submitted to the \n     Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1788.

On 4 occasions Fox faced \nthe best pitcher in the country, Tennessee's Monica Abbott. Second \nbaseman Chelsie Mesa can take credit for hitting a 3-run home run off \nAbbott to break open the game and send the Wildcats to victory. Taryne \nMowatt, Kristie Fox, Jenae Leles, and Caitlin Lowe were selected to be \non the all-tournament team because of the skill they demonstrated \nduring the tournament.

The preamble was agreed \nto.\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 76\n\n       Whereas the year 2007-2008 is the 50th anniversary of the \n     International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-1958;\n       Whereas the IGY initiated the Space Age with the successful \n     launch of the first artificial satellites, Sputnik by the \n     former Soviet Union, and Explorer I by the United States;\n       Whereas the interdisciplinary approach of IGY and the use \n     of new space-based platforms enabled fundamental changes in \n     the conduct of research concerning the Earth and its \n     surrounding space environment;\n       Whereas the interdisciplinary approach of IGY enabled \n     coordinated, synchronous, global observations and \n     measurements of the Earth, oceans, atmosphere, ice, and near-\n     Earth space environment;\n       Whereas the IGY increased our understanding of the causes \n     of magnetic storms, ionospheric disturbances, and the origins \n     of cosmic rays;\n       Whereas the use of new space-based platforms enabled the \n     discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts, which are \n     trapped, charged particles in the Earth's upper atmosphere, \n     showed that those particles form belts of energy around the \n     Earth, and contributed to the understanding of the Northern \n     Lights;\n       Whereas the IGY, involved thousands of scientists from 67 \n     nations;\n       Whereas the IGY, which occurred during the height of Cold \n     War tensions, facilitated international cooperation in \n     science and helped lead to the Antarctic Treaty, which \n     established the use of Antarctica for peaceful purposes and \n     promoted continued, cooperative scientific investigations on \n     the continent;\n       Whereas the IGY led to the creation of institutional \n     structures that continue to promote and enable the \n     international exchange of scientific research related to the \n     Earth and space, including the International Council on \n     Science's Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), Scientific \n     Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and Scientific \n     Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR); and\n       Whereas this 50th anniversary celebration offers as an \n     opportunity to inspire our public and youth to build on the \n     legacy of success of the IGY, recognizing that a coordinated, \n     international approach to interdisciplinary scientific \n     challenges such as climate change, high energy physics, and \n     space exploration contributes to the advancement of knowledge \n     and sustains the cooperative spirit and\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\n     goodwill among nations set forth in the IGY: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring),  That the Congress--\n       (1) honors the 50th anniversary of the International \n     Geophysical Year (IGY) and its contributions to the \n     scientific investigations of the Earth and outer space; and\n       (2) encourages the public, and especially American youth, \n     to attend IGY celebrations and seminars, such as those being \n     planned at locations around the United States by the National \n     Academy of Sciences and other organizations, and participate \n     in discussions about the future of space science and Earth \n     science.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8157-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 82) designating August 16, 2007 as ``National \nAirborne Day,'' was considered and agreed to. The preamble was agreed \nto.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 82\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed Forces have a long \n     and honorable history as units of adventuresome, hardy, and \n     fierce warriors who, for the national security of the United \n     States and the defense of freedom and peace, project the \n     effective ground combat power of the United States by Air \n     Force air transport to the far reaches of the battle area \n     and, indeed, to the far corners of the world;\n       Whereas August 16, 2007 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, an event \n     that validated the innovative concept of inserting United \n     States ground combat forces behind the battle line by means \n     of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, and \n     was launched when 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that have served with distinction and have \n     had repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those airborne units are the former 11th, \n     13th, and 17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Battalions, and the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II prompted the evolution of those forces into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment;\n       Whereas those units, together with additional units, \n     comprise the quick reaction force of the Army's XVIII \n     Airborne Corps when not operating separately under a regional \n     combatant commander;\n       Whereas that modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and \n     Air Force combat control teams, all or most of which comprise \n     the forces of the United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), \n     and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, together with other units of \n     the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war against \n     terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting civil \n     affair missions, and assisting in establishing democracy in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are and will continue to be at \n     the ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism \n     is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction \n     by earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operation forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops; and\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the American people as the airborne community celebrates \n     August 16, 2007 as the 67th anniversary of the first official \n     jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2007 as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to

Mr. President, today we have been discussing in the halls \nand corridors and rooms not far from where I many speaking what changes \nwe should make with respect to fuel efficiency standards for cars, \ntrucks, and vans. There are a lot of aspects of this bill that are \nimportant. Few are as important as what we are going to do with respect \nto fuel efficiency standards for cars, trucks, and vans, not just for \nthe next couple of years but probably for the next 15 years or so.\n  I want to begin my remarks by saying how important I believe \nmanufacturing is. We are neighbors. Both Delaware and Pennsylvania have \na rich tradition of manufacturing. It is an important part of our \neconomy and continues to be. If we are going to be successful as a \nnation in the 21st century, it will be because we have retained a \nvibrant manufacturing base, and we are in danger of seeing that slip \naway. Part of the manufacturing base in my State has been, for 60 years \nor so, a vibrant automobile manufacturing base. We have two auto \nassembly plants in northern Delaware. Outside of Wilmington is a GM \nplant where we manufacture the Pontiac Solstices and Saturn Sky. We \nactually export some of those Saturn Skys to Europe, and we are about \nto start exporting Saturn Skys to South Korea, something we are excited \nabout.\n  In Newcastle County south of Newark along the Maryland line is a \nChrysler assembly plant where they used to make tanks during World War \nII. Today they make all the Dodge Durangos and all the Chrysler Aspens \nin the world.\n  On a per capita basis, we build probably as many cars trucks, and \nvans per capita in Delaware as any other State. We are not a big State, \nbut auto manufacturing remains an important part of our economic base.\n  With that as a background, I want to mention the approaching debate \non CAFE, fuel efficiency standards for our vehicular fleet. There are \nthree goals I see. The first goal for me--and I hope for us--is to \nreduce the growth of our dependence on foreign oil, then stop the \ngrowth of our dependence on foreign oil, and then reduce our dependence \non foreign oil. Over 60 percent of the oil we use comes from sources \nbeyond our borders. We have a trade deficit of about $650 billion. \nFully one-third of that is attributable to our dependence on foreign \noil. We need to reduce that dependence.\n  I was in Iraq the last weekend. We have over 150,000 troops there \nexposed and in danger as I speak. Every time I fill up the tank of my \ncar with gas, I am convinced some of the money I spend in buying that \ngas goes to other parts around the world where people take our money, \nand I fear they use it to hurt us. We ought to be smarter than that. \nOne of the things we clearly need to do is to reduce our growing \nreliance on foreign oil and eventually, sooner than later, reduce that \nreliance.\n  The second goal for me is to reduce harmful emissions, the stuff we \nput up in the air. Whether it is nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, \ncarbon dioxide, which is the greenhouse gas that leads to global \nwarming, those emissions come out of cars, trucks, and vans. For me, \ngoal No. 2 is to reduce the incidence of those emissions. It will \nimprove our health and reduce the threat we face from climate change \nfrom greenhouse gases.\n  The third goal for me and in the context of this legislation is to \naccomplish goal No. 1, reduce our reliance on foreign oil; accomplish \ngoal No. 2, reduce the emission of bad stuff into the air; and to do \nthat by not further disadvantaging the domestic auto industry in our \nState. So those are the three goals I have for us.\n  I want to take a moment and look back to 1975. In 1975, the average \nmileage for cars, trucks, and vans was about 14 miles per gallon. For \nseveral years leading up to 1975, there was a prolonged debate on \nwhether we should require more fuel-efficient vehicles. I have asked my \nstaff to see if we can find a little bit of what was being said back in \nthe mid-1970s as we debated whether to raise over a 10-year period fuel \nefficiency standards from 14 miles per gallon to 27.5 miles per gallon \nfor cars and roughly 20 miles per gallon for light trucks and SUVs.\n  This is a comment from one of the senior officials at General Motors:\n\n       If this proposal becomes law--\n\n  The increase over 10 years of CAFE standards to 27.5 miles per \ngallon--\n\n       the largest car the industry will be selling in any volume \n     at all will probably be smaller, lighter, and less powerful \n     than today's compact Chevy Nova.\n\n  The Presiding Officer and I are old enough to remember what a Chevy \nNova looked like. I want to tell you, when we were driving around the \nstreets of Washington, DC, or Delaware or Colorado, most of the \nvehicles out there were a lot bigger than a compact Chevy Nova, and \nthey were in 1975 as well.\n  Here is another comment from the debate of the mid-1970s on raising \nCAFE standards. This is from a senior official at Chrysler in 1974.\n\n       In effect this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines \n     and car models, including most full size sedans and station \n     wagons. It would restrict the industry to producing \n     subcompact-size cars, or even smaller ones, within 5 years.\n\n  Five years from this was 1979. In 1979, we were still making full \nsize sedans and station wagons. We were still making them in 1985. We \nare still making them today. The idea that we would be producing \nsubcompact-size cars within 5 years or even 25 years, it never \nhappened. Those are a couple of comments that were made in 1974 and \n1975, as we took up the debate.\n  The Congress decided in 1975 to go ahead and pass more stringent fuel \nefficiency standards for cars, trucks, and vans. Over a 10-year period \nwe ramped up so that by 1985, the car fleet was expected to achieve on \nbalance 27.5 miles per gallon, and for light trucks and SUVs about 20 \nmiles per gallon.\n  I put up these quotes because a good deal of what we have heard from \nthe auto industry in recent years, as we have debated whether to return \nto raising fuel efficiency standards, actually sounds a lot like what \nwe heard in 1974 and 1975. You could almost take away the years that \nare at the bottom of each of these quotes, and it would be deja vu all \nover again.\n  For the past 22 years since we raised CAFE standards, what we have \nheard mostly from the domestic auto industry is, if you raise fuel \nefficiency standards further, four things will happen: One, the big \nthree--GM, Chrysler, Ford--will lose market share, will lose money. \nThey will close plants. They will cut or eliminate jobs. We have heard \nthat for pretty much the last 22 years, and for the last 22 years we \nhave not raised fuel efficiency standards.\n  This is a chart where we can see the market share for each company. \nThe orange share is Chrysler. The green is Ford. The blue is GM. This \nis 1985. Here we have 20 years later, 2005. Let me just read it. From \nChrysler to Diamler-Chrysler, when you put that together, you get about \n13.5 percent market share. In effect, Chrysler's market share has \nactually dropped without any change in fuel efficiency standards since \n1985. Their market share has dropped from 1985, if we actually backed \nout Diamler.\n  From 1985 to 2005, Ford's market share dropped from 22 percent of \nsales to almost 17 percent. That is without any change in CAFE. Over at \nGM, we see market share dropped most precipitously from about 41.5 \npercent of the market in 1958 to 26 percent in 2005.\n  I would say these numbers are actually lower now. Ford is no longer \nat 17 percent of market share. Regrettably, GM is not at 26 percent \nmarket share. The market share didn't drop because of increases in \nCAFE.\n  The plants were not closed because of increases in CAFE. Hundreds of \nthousands of people did not lose their jobs\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\nbecause of increases in CAFE. These companies, last year, collectively, \nlost in the North American automotive operations--Chrysler, GM, Ford--\nlost probably, collectively, about $15 billion. That was not because of \nincreases in CAFE, because we have not increased fuel-efficient \nstandards for 22 years.\n  We have had a lot of visits in my office in the last several weeks. I \nam sure the Presiding Officer has had folks come to see him from the \nauto manufacturers, probably domestic and foreign. One CEO said to me, \nin a visit last week, his company would have to--if we adopted the \nmeasure that has been reported out of the Commerce Committee, which is \nthe underlying language on CAFE in the bill before us this week--but if \nwe adopted that, his company would have to produce cars that got 50, 52 \nmiles per gallon.\n  I said: Well, let's think about that. Let's talk about that. You will \nrecall the measure before us today says that by 2020, overall, NHTSA--\nan arm of the Department of Transportation--would have to have overseen \nan increase in the fuel efficiency standards of cars, trucks, and vans; \nthat, overall, cars, trucks, and vans put together would, beginning by \nthe year 2020, have 35 miles per gallon.\n  What most people do not understand is that trucks, light trucks, and \nSUVs do not have to get 35 miles per gallon under the language in the \nbill by 2020. But overall, when you combine cars, trucks, vans, and \nSUVs from the different companies that sell cars in this country, they \nhave to get 35 miles per gallon.\n  Now, let's take a look at a chart that lists a bunch of auto \ncompanies. It is a little hard to follow, but I ask you all to bear \nwith me. The effect of the legislation that is before us, the \nunderlying bill, would mean--DaimlerChrysler builds more light trucks, \nSUVs. They are a truck-heavy company, as opposed to, we will say, \nVolkswagen. Volkswagen builds mostly cars. They do not build much in \nthe way of light trucks or SUVs and sell that in this country.\n  But the car companies, the truck companies that tend to build the \ntrucks, light trucks, and SUVs, they would end up with a requirement--\nbetween now and 2020--a requirement by NHTSA to have a fuel economy of \nsomething less than 35 miles per gallon. For the vehicle makers that \nare more heavily on the car side, as opposed to the light trucks and \nSUVs, they are going to expect to have a fuel efficiency standard north \nof, higher than 35 miles per gallon.\n  In this case, Volkswagen, if they continue to have the mix they have \nof vehicles in 2005, they would have to have in their mix of product \nabout 38, 39 miles per gallon. So this is not a monolithic number. It \nis not 35 miles per gallon for trucks, 35 miles per gallon for cars. It \nis not 35 miles per gallon for each of these auto manufacturers.\n  But the idea is, when you put them all together, at the end of the \nday, we want, in 2020, for NHTSA to have presided over a process that \ngets our fleet of vehicles sold in this country, in 2020, to 35 miles \nper gallon.\n  Now, for years we have heard our friends from Detroit say: Protect us \nin this way. Protect us so we don't have foreign competitors--who build \na lot of energy-efficient cars--don't let them use the high miles per \ngallon they get from their fuel-efficient cars to allow them to come in \nand sell a whole bunch of trucks, light trucks, SUVs, and minivans that \nare not energy efficient.\n  Meanwhile, companies such as DaimlerChrysler and GM and Ford, which \nare selling a lot of trucks, if we are not careful, will end up with a \nsituation where other companies that are listed on this chart would be \nable to sell a whole lot of trucks, a whole lot of minivans, a whole \nlot of SUVs that are energy inefficient. Our automakers could not sell \nanymore. They would be constrained because of the requirements in \nlegislation.\n  So here is what we have tried to come up with in response to the \nconcerns by our automakers. We have come up with a plan that says to \nNHTSA: We do not care who is making real small cars, but we want you to \nset the same fuel efficiency standards for real small cars, regardless \nof who is making them. For midsized cars, we want you to set the same \nfuel efficiency standard targets for midsized cars, regardless of what \ncompanies make them. For larger cars, heavier cars, bigger cars, the \nsame fuel efficiency standard would apply for that category of \nvehicles.\n  For pickup trucks, regardless of who is making them, light trucks, \nthe same standard would have to apply, whether it is Nissan that is \nmaking them, Honda, or DaimlerChrysler. For a small truck, they all \nhave to be producing vehicles that get the same fuel economy standards. \nFor larger SUVs, the largest SUVs, whoever is making them--I don't care \nif it is Toyota, Nissan, Chrysler, GM--NHTSA would be promulgating a \nfuel efficiency standard that would be the same for all manufacturers.\n  Now, not everybody likes that. I suspect some of the folks who have \nbeen making energy-efficient cars for some time believe they are not \ngetting the kind of credit they should get for their early work. But \nthis is a proposal that is in the underlying bill, and it is in \nresponse to the domestic auto manufacturers who have said: Do not put \nus in a situation where the only folks who can sell light trucks and \nSUVs of any size are folks who happen to be building vehicles in other \ncountries. So we tried to be responsive to their proposal.\n\n  Let's go back to this chart I have in the Chamber, if we could. I \nwish to return to the conversation I had with the CEO of one of the \ncompanies who came to see us. We will call it company X. Company X \nplans, in about 5 years, to be selling in this country a mix of \nproducts that would be 60 percent truck, that would be 40 percent cars. \nBy trucks, I mean light trucks, SUVs, minivans. But that is their goal \nin 5 years: 40 percent cars, 60 percent trucks.\n  If we assume for a moment that the fuel average requirement, the \nminimum average requirement for light trucks and SUVs is going to be 30 \nmiles per gallon--that is probably pretty close to what it is going to \nbe; it may be about what is doable--at the 60-percent market \nconcentration for the trucks: 60 percent times 30 miles per gallon adds \nup to 18 miles per gallon.\n  If another 40 percent of what they build and sell is cars, the \nquestion is: What miles per gallon would they have to achieve for their \ncar fleet, collectively--small, mid, large--what would they have to \nachieve to roughly get to 35 miles per gallon overall for their fleet \naverage? The answer is: 42--not 52, not 62 miles per gallon. But this \nis what they would have to be able to deliver in mileage per gallon in \n2020 from their car fleet in order to come up with an overall fleet \naverage for this company of about 35 miles per gallon.\n  Now the question is, is it realistic in 13 years for a company to be \nmaking cars that get 42 miles per gallon?\n  Well, I was at the Detroit Auto Show back in January. One of the \ncoolest cars I saw was a Chevrolet. It was a Chevrolet Volt, a flex-\nfuel, plug-in hybrid vehicle that, hopefully, Chevrolet is going to be \nmaking by the early part of the next decade. You plug it in, charge the \nbattery, and you are off.\n  Let me say, the leader is on the floor. I say to the leader, I do not \nwish to get in your way, but if you want to jump in here, jump in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been listening to the Senator speak. \nI wish to say one thing. I participated in an event today where we had \na car there that was a hybrid. Gee, it was fun. There were two vehicles \nthere, a Prius and a Ford. One of those--they would both get basically \nthe same mileage--but the man there who was promoting these batteries, \nthis past week, drove 177 miles on 1 gallon of gasoline. That is the \nfuture. That is the future of our country, that we will be able to have \nthese hybrids driving across the country, pulling into a motel and \nplugging it in. There will just be a cord, like an extension cord.\n\n  I wanted to say one thing. I want to comment on the Senator's \nadvocacy. The people of Delaware--I say this without any hype at all--\nare so fortunate to have someone who is so into legislation. I don't \nknow of another Senator, in looking at an issue, who understands it so \nthoroughly. I say that sometimes I wish you didn't know it so \nthoroughly, because it doesn't allow me to have any wiggle room at all. \nBut I say that without any reservation. I am so admiring of the \nSenator's talents to legislate. I am very partial to you because you \nand I came here together in 1982 as freshmen Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. But the\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\npeople of Delaware got a well-trained legislator when you came to the \nSenate. Your experience in the State, as a Statewide officeholder, a \nMember of the House of Representatives, a Governor, a Senator--you have \nnot only had the experience, but you still have the tenacity and the \nwill to be a good legislator, and the people of Delaware are very \nfortunate, but so are we as a country.\n  I would ask my distinguished friend, there are a few closing matters. \nCould you do those when you complete your statement?\n  Mr. CARPER. I will.\n  Mr. President, I was talking about the visit of last week with the \nCEO of one of our major three automakers. The point I was trying to \nmake is the automakers don't have to come up with cars that get 52 \nmiles per gallon or 50 miles per gallon, but if they have a fleet of 60 \npercent trucks and 40 percent cars in 2020, they are going to have to \ndo better, and better is 42 miles per gallon.\n  Our leader, Senator Reid, was talking about an event here today where \nsome vehicles were on display. I think they were jerry rigged--maybe it \nwas Ford Escape and some other vehicles, maybe Priuses--in order to get \nvery high mileage, I think he said 170 miles per gallon. We don't need \ncars that get 170 miles per gallon by 2020 to make this standard of \nroughly 35 miles per gallon for the fleet. We don't need cars that get \n50 miles per gallon.\n  But in this case, Company X--which is a real company, it turns out--\nis working toward 42 miles per gallon and they would meet the expected \nrequirements that would be set for them.\n  I said to my visitor last week, the CEO who was visiting me, You have \nan obligation to your shareholders and you have an obligation to your \nemployees to try to get the best deal out of this that you guys can be \nproud of and maximize your profits.\n  I said: As a Senator who cares about the economic development and job \ncreation in my State, I want you to be profitable. I want you to be \nsuccessful.\n  So I feel some obligation too. But I went on to add that we have an \nobligation here, as does the Presiding Officer, my friend from \nPennsylvania, who is going to speak in a minute, we have an obligation \nthat goes beyond that which our CEO feels, or other CEOs feel. We have \nan obligation to make sure we do reduce our reliance on foreign oil. \nThe car companies, in all honesty, don't have that obligation. We have \nan obligation to make sure the air we breathe is cleaner. We have an \nobligation to make sure the threat of global warming is diminished, not \nincreased. They don't have that requirement, as we do. That is our job.\n  It is not enough for us, though, to say to the car companies: You \nhave to eat your spinach. You have to go out there and make the tough \ndecisions all by yourself to raise fuel efficiency standards. I think \nwe have an obligation in the Federal Government and in other levels of \nGovernment as well to help them. It shouldn't be them doing this all by \nthemselves; we have an obligation to help them. I mention maybe four \nways where we are trying to help them in the legislation that is before \nus today and that we will be voting on tomorrow and during the next \ncouple of days.\n  With respect to making more energy efficient cars, here are some ways \nwe can help the industry. One is through basic research and development \ninvestments. If we go back a few years, we have invested a lot of money \nin fuel cell technologies, as my colleagues know. In the legislation \nbefore us, the underlying bill on CAFE standards, we authorized the \nexpenditure of $50 million a year over the next 5 years for new battery \ntechnology, for a new generation of lithium batteries, so the kind of \ncars the majority leader was talking about a few minutes ago, so we can \nactually build them, actually build the Chevrolet Volt. The Chevrolet \nVolt, the car I was talking about earlier, the coolest car at the auto \nshow, a flex-fuel, plug-in hybrid, you plug it in, charge the battery \nat night from your house, go out the next day, drive maybe 30, 40 miles \nbefore you have to recharge again. If you get to work before that time, \nplug it in at work. In the meantime, when you put on your brakes, it is \na traditional hybrid. You put on your brakes and recharge the battery.\n  But in the Chevrolet Volt, it actually carries with it an auxiliary \npower unit. The auxiliary power unit doesn't run the car, it charges \nthe battery. It can be fuel cell powered, it could be biofuels diesel, \nit could be an ethanol internal combustion engine recharging the \nbattery, and the battery running the wheels.\n  I saw a headline in the local paper in my State a month ago. It was a \npicture of one of the top folks at GM standing alongside the Chevrolet \nVolt and talking about this vehicle, which they hope to have on the \nroad by the early part of the next decade, to get over 100 miles per \ngallon. That is not the entire fleet, it is one vehicle, but that is \n100 miles per gallon. If we can do that, 100 miles per gallon or even \n80 or 90 or 70 for the Chevrolet Volt and the kind of things our \nmajority leader saw today, the fuel efficiencies there, if it is even a \nhalf or a third of what he saw, the idea of getting 35 miles per gallon \nfor a total fleet in 2020 is not a pipedream, it is realistic. I am \nconvinced that to the extent our auto manufacturers are positioned to \nbuild more energy efficient cars, to at least have some of them, they \nmake themselves more competitive in the world environment.\n  But I was talking about the ways we can help, the Federal Government \ncan help our industry to meet these higher standards. One, Federal \ninvestments in basic R Whether it is for fuel cells several years \nago or whether it is new battery technology, we are putting in about \n$40 million this year. I hope next year it will be 50 and the next 5 \nyears after that at $50 million a year.\n  Second, another way we can help is to use the Federal Government's \npurchasing power to help commercialize these new technologies. We are \ngoing to be building and putting out on the road a new generation, \nnext-generation hybrid Durango and a next-generation hybrid Chrysler \nAspen. Currently they are internal combustion engines. They don't get \n20 miles per gallon. They are high teens for fuel economy. But starting \nsometime by the middle of next year we will have on the road hybrid \nDurangos and hybrid Chrysler Aspens, the fuel economy of which will be \nincreased by 40 percent over current levels--a 40-percent increase. I \nwant to see--and I know others of my colleagues want to see--when the \nFederal Government goes out and buys--and we buy a lot of vehicles \nevery year on the civilian side and on the defense side--I want to have \nincluded in the legislation we pass something that says some small \npercentage, some modest percentage of the vehicles we are going to be \nbuying, anyway, should be invested in highly energy efficient new \ntechnology cars or trucks or vans, and their reaction to have the \nopportunity to do that in the context of the underlying legislation.\n  We are going to take up the Defense authorization bill in a couple of \nweeks and we will have an opportunity to do the same thing in terms of \nusing the Government's purchasing power on the military side to \ncommercialize these more energy efficient technologies in the cars, \ntrucks, and vans that the military buys.\n  A third way the Federal Government can help the auto companies meet \nthese more stringent standards, in addition to investments in R, in \naddition to the vehicular purchases of the Government to commercialize \ntechnologies, is with respect to tax credits. In the Energy bill \nadopted in 2005, we have energy tax credits that say if you buy a \nhighly energy-efficient hybrid vehicle, you get a tax credit of $300 to \nalmost $3,500 for your purchase. There is a similar provision in the \nsame bill that says to folks who buy highly energy-efficient, diesel-\npowered vehicles with very low emissions that they can get the same \nkind of tax breaks, $300 to roughly $3,500.\n  As it turns out, almost all of the hybrids, incentivized by those tax \ncredits, are made in other countries. So we have tax incentives to \nencourage people to buy hybrids from other countries. Shame on us. \nHopefully, in the next couple years we will put American hybrids on the \nroad and incentivize people to buy American-made hybrids, such as the \nDurango and the Chrysler Aspen that will be produced less than a year \nfrom now. No American manufacturer is making today, nor will they next \nyear, diesel-powered vehicles with emission levels low enough to \nqualify under the 2005 legislation.\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\n  One of the changes that has been agreed to and is in the Finance \nCommittee's package, Mr. President--and you are a member of the Finance \nCommittee--one of the provisions the committee adopted in the finance \nlanguage that accompanies the Energy bill allows the low-emission, \nhighly energy-efficient Chrysler products that are being manufactured \nand sold in this country this year, for 1 year--that will be next \nyear--their products will qualify not for the full tax credit but for \nabout three-quarters of the tax credit just for 1 year. After that, \nthey have to be very low emissions starting in 2009, which is as it \nshould be.\n  That is something we can do to incentivize folks to buy vehicles made \nin this country that have low emissions and are highly efficient. The \nmore energy efficient, the bigger the tax credit.\n  The fourth and last point we can do in the way of helping the \nindustry is, there is a flex-fuel mandate that says some of the \nvehicles we build in this country have to be capable of running on \nethanol or some kind of fuel other than traditional petroleum. However, \nas my colleagues know, today, if you drive around this country and have \none of these vehicles that can run on ethanol, it is hard to find a \npump. It is hard to find a pump in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Delaware, or \nany other State, except Minnesota where I think they have 400 gas \nstations that actually have ethanol. But it is hard to find a fueling \nstation where we can actually fill up with something other than \ngasoline.\n  There needs to be included in this legislation something that \nmandates the oil companies, just as we did 20, 25, 30 years ago on \nunleaded gas, so the people who have vehicles that are capable of \nrunning on renewable fuel can actually find a place to fill up.\n  Similarly with hydrogen, as we move to the point of building more \nhydrogen-powered vehicles. It doesn't do us any good if we don't have \nhydrogen fueling stations in this country. The Federal Government has \nan obligation to make sure that fuel is available too.\n  Those are four actions the Government can do, and I hope will do, in \nthe context of this legislation before us: One, investments in R, in \nthis case new battery technology; two, use Federal Government \npurchasing power to help companies to commercialize this new \ntechnology; three, use tax credits to incentivize people to buy the \nvehicles once they are produced, more energy-efficient vehicles \nproduced; and, finally, hydrogen infrastructure so people who buy flex-\nfuel vehicles can find the product, the stations where they can fill \nup.\n  The last point I want to make, and it goes back to my conversation \nwith my friend who is a CEO of one of these domestic auto companies. I \nmentioned he has an obligation to his shareholders and employees. I am \nsure he cares about the quality of air. I am sure he cares about our \ndependence on foreign oil. That is not his day job. That is our day \njob, so we should focus on it as we debate these issues.\n  My colleague from Colorado who is presiding, and my colleague from \nPennsylvania who is waiting patiently for me to wrap up--and I have \nbeen to funerals for people from our State who have died in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. We have tried to console family members. I was in Iraq \nover the weekend. We have 160,000 men and women there today. They are \nin harm's way as I speak. We are so dependent on troubled parts of the \nworld for oil, unstable parts of the world for oil, where we have men \nand women at risk, where we lost lives yesterday and probably lost \nlives today and probably will tomorrow.\n  I think of a member of my staff, Sean Barney, who worked with me \nsince 2000 when I ran for the Senate. Sean decided he wanted to go into \nthe Marines. He joined the Marines and went through basic training. \nThis is a guy with an undergraduate degree from Swarthmore and a \ngraduate degree from Columbia who decided he wanted to be a marine.\n\n  A couple years ago, he went to basic training and became a PFC and \nended up in Anbar Province, in the streets of Falluja, shot by a sniper \nin the neck which severed his carotid artery. He, by all rights, should \nbe dead. He lived, miraculously. He has some degree of disability in \nhis right arm, right shoulder, right hand, but he is alive.\n  When I have visited in Iraq, I had a chance to visit with a bunch of \nNational Guard troops. We have them over there from Colorado and \nPennsylvania too--folks from the 198th Signal Battalion. I was their \ncommander in chief when I was Governor for 8 years. I have a special \naffection and devotion to them. I wanted to make sure they come home \nsafely.\n  When I got home early Monday morning, I went to a sendoff for 150 \nmembers of one of our military police units. They were heading on to \nFort Dix. They are at Fort Dix today and then on to Iraq.\n  I guess the point I am making is, while we want to make sure our \ndomestic auto industry is successful and is profitable, and we have a \ngood, strong auto manufacturing base, I want to make sure we stop \nsending men and women around the world to these troubled spots that \nhave large amounts of oil deposits. And we are concerned about that \nsituation. That is something of which we need to be mindful. For me, it \nfigures into this equation and this debate.\n  I close by saying, we will have a chance to debate these issues \ntomorrow morning, and we will have a chance to vote on the language in \nthe underlying bill, maybe with a change from an amendment Senator \nStevens and I have offered and maybe will be adopted, or maybe with the \nmore far-reaching change negotiated and developed by our colleagues, \nSenators Pryor, Levin, Stabenow, and Bond. At the end of the day, \nthough, when we pass this legislation and send it on to the House, it \nis so important that it moves in a meaningful way toward reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil; that in a meaningful way it reduces the \nemissions of harmful matter into our air; and in a real way it also \nenhances and doesn't undermine the competitiveness of our domestic auto \nindustry.\n  It is not easy to do all three of those goals, but those are the \nthree things we need to do. If we can send from the Senate to the House \nat the end of this week or early next week legislation that is actually \nfaithful to those three goals, we will have done our work and done good \nwork.\n  Tomorrow and the next day will be the test to see if we can measure \nup to those standards. I hope we can.\n  I apologize to my colleague from Pennsylvania for going on as long as \nI have. I thank him for his patience.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8162-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8162-S8163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ENERGY EFFICIENT APPLIANCES\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Carper for \nhis presentation and his wisdom. I appreciate that.\n  I rise tonight very briefly to express hope that is contained in an \namendment I have. I know we have an agreement in place, and this is for \nthe purpose of talking about this amendment as opposed to formally \nspeaking on it.\n  This is a very simple amendment I have. It is an idea I had based on \nsome of my work in State government. It is simply to do this, to offer \na proposal that allows low-income families to purchase home appliances \nwhich are energy efficient and that will allow them to not only heat \ntheir homes or wash their clothes or use other appliances but to do it \nin an energy-efficient way.\n  It is based upon my experience in State government, as a State \ntreasurer, where we started a program in Pennsylvania called Keystone \nHelp, back in the last couple of years. Right now, that program has \nhelped people in 60 out of our 67 counties. It is simple.\n  What the Federal version of this would do is to dedicate $4 million \nover 5 years. It is not a lot of money, and it is paid for by the \ncurrent $750-million-per-year authorization for weatherization programs \nin the Federal Government. So it is just $4 million out of the $750 \nmillion that is already in the bill and already paid for.\n  These funds would be used to help low-income families purchase Energy \nStar certified appliances. This means they have been certified by the \nDepartment of Energy for their energy-efficient qualities.\n  Here is what the appliances are that would be allowed to be paid for \nout of the money applied in this program: refrigerators, water heaters, \nwashers and dryers, home heating systems and air-conditioning--basic \nnecessities of life in America today.\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n  The amendment would also require that the families who receive these \ngrants out of the $4 million of grant money over 5 years provide a 5-\npercent match that they would have to come up with. I recognize for a \nlot of families even a 5-percent match is a lot of money. An extra $50 \nor so, depending on the amount of money, would be significant. But I \nthink it is important that families have that requirement.\n  There are some families who will not be able to meet that, so we \nallow charitable assistance or State and local initiatives to come up \nwith the 5 percent.\n  But I wish to make one point among several. First of all, this is not \na new program in the sense that it requires a big expenditure of money \nor requires administrative work that cannot already be done within the \nexisting weatherization program. The grants in this amendment are \nintended to work as a complement to and work within the current \nweatherization program. The amendment will not increase administrative \ncosts and it will not require new expenditures of dollars. It is within \nthe $750 million already allocated for weatherization.\n  I believe this amendment, and the features of this program called for \nby this amendment, helps families. It helps our low-income families pay \nfor Energy Star certified appliances for their homes. It helps the \nenvironment. It is good all around.\n  We already have a program that helps these same families properly \ninsulate and weatherize their homes. What this does is take the next \nstep. We should take that next step to help low-income families use \nless energy for the basic necessities of heating and cooling their \nhomes as well as laundry and some other basic necessities.\n  I hope the managers on both sides of the aisle, I hope both parties, \ncan agree to adopt this. It may not happen, but I am hopeful that will \nhappen tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/20/senate-section/article/S8163-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 21, 2007\n\n  Mr. CASEY.
