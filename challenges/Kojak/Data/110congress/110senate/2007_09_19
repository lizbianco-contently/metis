Mr. President, this morning, following any time used by me \nor Senator McConnell, the Senate will resume debate on the Department \nof Defense authorization measure and then have a period of 1 hour to \ndiscuss the Specter-Leahy habeas corpus amendment prior to a vote to \ninvoke cloture on that amendment. Members have until 10 o'clock this \nmorning to file any germane second-degree amendments to this pending \namendment.\n  Yesterday, there were discussions with respect to restructuring--I \nshould not say restructuring, structuring the debate format for these \nIraq amendments and the Defense authorization bill. Our staffs have \nbeen working. We hope something can be worked out.\n  Additionally, other Members have amendments on various topics dealing \nwith the Defense authorization bill. We hope we can get a process going \nwhere we can move through these as rapidly as possible. I announced \nyesterday we would vote no later than 10:30 a.m. this Friday because of \nthe Jewish holiday which begins at sundown, and some Members need that \ntime to fly to their homes to be ready for Yom Kippur, which starts, as \nI indicated, at sundown. We also are going to have a vote at noon on \nMonday. Everyone should be aware of that. It is not going to be a \njudge's vote, it is going to be an important vote. I am well aware of \nthe many scheduling issues facing Senators, but we have much work to do \nprior to the scheduled Columbus Day recess. We have to extend a number \nof bills because of the fiscal year ending, so I encourage Members to \nbe mindful of the schedule and need for flexibility.\n  I ask unanimous consent the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma be \nallowed to speak for up to 7 minutes on an issue dealing with the war \nin Iraq, a fallen soldier, and that time not be taken away from the \ndebate on the habeas corpus amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I last week talked to a grandmother whose \n19-year-old grandson committed suicide a week after he went back for \nhis second tour of duty. He killed himself in Iraq. These are real \ndifficult situations. I know how strongly Members feel. So I certainly \nappreciate the feeling of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I thank the majority leader for his \ncomments.

Allbaugh\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I rise to remember the life of one \nof America's heroes, Marine CPL Jeremy David Allbaugh. Corporal \nAllbaugh came from Luther, OK, and graduated from nearby Harrah High \nSchool. Before graduating, he was chosen to be a U.S. marine, becoming \na member in the 1st Battalion, 4th Marines. Tragically, Jeremy died on \nJuly 5, while conducting combat operations in Al Anbar Province near \nthe city of al-Qa'im, when his humvee was struck by an improvised \nexplosive device.\n  There are no words that can truly express the dedication and \nselflessness of this young marine. There are no words that can \nadequately convey our thoughts for their loss to his family, who are \nhere with us today. They have given everything to our country, \nsomething many find it difficult to comprehend and a sacrifice fewer \nwill ever face. But I will say these words so as to honor Jeremy's last \nrequest, a request which America will always oblige her heroes, which \nwas: ``Remember me.''\n  Before deploying to Iraq with his Marine unit, Jeremy had a \nconversation with his brother, Army 2LT Jason Allbaugh, in which Jeremy \nmade two simple requests. He said: If something happens to me, do me a \nfavor. Jeremy said: Do two things for me. Take care of mom and dad, and \nremember me.\n  Jeremy, today we do that. We remember your life of service and thank \nyou for giving the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Nation.\n  Growing up, Jeremy seemed destined to become a marine. His brother \nJason--and I visited with him--said as far back as he could remember, \nJeremy wanted to be a marine. Most kids had the conventional costumes \non Halloween but not Jeremy. He wore fatigues. Jeremy also wore a \ncamouflage backpack to school. His dream became reality 3 years ago \nwhen, 2 months shy of his 18th birthday and prior to graduating from \nhigh school, Jeremy joined the Marine Corps. His father Jon and his \nmother Jenifer, seeing how much Jeremy loved his country and his desire \nto serve, supported his decision and gave their permission.\n  That decision could not have been an easy one. All parents can \nunderstand their concern, especially parents of our servicemembers who \nface the possibility that their son or daughter could see combat in \nIraq, Afghanistan or anyplace else in the world. Although their concern \nwas great, I am sure it was surpassed only by the enormous pride they \nfelt for their son Jeremy.\n  Jeremy, driven by a sense of duty, was willing to leave the comfort \nof his family and friends and the life he knew and answer the call for \nhis country. Jeremy arrived in Iraq this past April. Jenifer said in \nJeremy's weekly phone calls he gave the family a much different picture \nof what was going on in Iraq compared to what was being reported in the \nmedia. There were a lot of good things being done there, Jeremy told \nhis family. There were Neighborhood Watch programs, new schools, \nhospitals, clinics being built in the area where he was assigned. I \nknow this is true because I was there when Jeremy was there, and I saw \nthis for myself in some 15 trips to the area of operation in Iraq.\n  When asked how the local Iraqi people treated the marines, Jeremy was \nupbeat. ``They appreciate what we do,'' he said. Jeremy believed in the \npositive changes he saw happening in Iraq, and he loved being a part of \nit.\n  Jenifer wishes so desperately that the American people knew and \nunderstood the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform. She hopes \nthat more people will start to talk firsthand to our troops who are \nover there, not only to politicians in Washington. I, too, wish more \npeople would talk to our troops who are over there and see their pride, \ntheir courage, their sense of honor and duty. Jeremy exemplified these \nqualities.\n  Maybe that is why Jenifer wishes people would talk to the troops, \nbecause she knows they would be talking to men and women similar to her \nown son.\n  Similar to so many of America's fallen heroes, Jeremy was young, only \n21-years-old, when an IED took his life. Jeremy joined the Marine Corps \nafter\n9/11 and after the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He knew what \nit meant to serve. He knew what it meant to be a marine. He knew what \nchances he was taking. Jeremy's courage and selflessness are common for \nsomeone of his young age serving over there. Perhaps Jeremy's last \nwish, the wish that he be remembered, was his most selfless act.\n  When we remember Jeremy, we remember that which is great about our \ncountry, and his death will force us to remember the sacrifices of \nthose throughout our history who have given their lives in defense of \nthe Nation. We remember; we will always remember.\n  Rev. Jeff Koch, Pastor of the First Christian Church of Blackwell, \nOK, where Jeremy was honored before being laid to rest, said Jeremy \n``paid the ultimate sacrifice so tonight we can sleep easy.''\n  I, too, believe this. Because of Jeremy's sacrifice, America can \nsleep easier. But I will rest easier knowing Jeremy lived and that, \nthough they are rare, men and women similar to Jeremy are out there \nright now, protecting our lives and freedoms and our liberties. In this \nlong war against terrorism and tyranny, America will continue to rely \non men and women such as Jeremy, men and women who have been called to \nduty, men and women willing to put service before self.\n  We remember the life of Jeremy David Allbaugh, a marine, a friend, a \nbrother, a grandson, and a son. We remember and pray for his family, \nfather Jon; mother Jenifer; brothers Jason and Bryan; sister Alicia; \nand his grandparents, John, Dorothy, and Peggy.\n  Today, on the floor of this great deliberative body and in the annals \nof our Record, we mourn Jeremy's passing and forever honor and remember \nhis life. Jeremy Allbaugh is a living memory to us, of what is great \nabout America.\n  So we say: Rest easy, Jeremy. Semper Fidelis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11688-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Inhofe in that moving \ntribute to a fallen marine.\n  The issue we have before the Senate is one of great importance to the \ncountry. It will affect the future of this bill. It will affect the \nnational security needs of our Nation for a long time to come. It is a \nbit complicated, but at the end of the day, I don't think it is that \ndifficult to get your hands around.\n\n[[Page S11689]]\n\n  We are talking about a habeas corpus amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill that will confer upon any combatants housed at \nGuantanamo Bay, and maybe other places, the ability, as an enemy \nprisoner, to go to a Federal court of their choosing to bring lawsuits \nagainst the Government, against the military--something never granted \nto any other prisoner in any other war.\n  We had thousands of Japanese and German prisoners housed on American \nterritory during World War II and not one of those Germans or Japanese \nprisoners were allowed to go to Federal court to sue the troops who had \ncaught them on the battlefield or the Government holding them in \ndetention as a prisoner of war.\n  To start that process now would be an absolute disaster for this \ncountry and has never been done before and should not be done now.\n  Now, the history of this issue: Guantanamo Bay is the place where \ninternational terrorists are sent, people suspected of being involved \nin the war on terror. Shaikh Mohammed is there, some very high-value \ntargets are there, bin Ladin's driver. People who have been involved \nwith al-Qaida activity and other terrorist groups are housed at \nGuantanamo Bay under the theory that they are unlawful enemy \ncombatants. They do not wear a uniform as did the Germans and the \nJapanese, but they are very much at war with this country. They attack \ncivilians randomly. Nothing is out of bounds in terms of their conduct. \nSo they fit the definition, if there ever was one, of an unlawful enemy \ncombatant. What they do in the law of war is unlawful. They certainly \nare enemies of this country. Shaikh Mohammed's transcript regarding his \nCombatant Status Review Tribunal--take time to read it. I can assure \nyou he is at war with us. We need to be at war with him.\n  The basic premise I have been pushing now for years is that the \nattacks of 9/11 against the World Trade Center, against the Pentagon, \nthe hijacking of the airplanes were an act of war. It would be a huge \nmistake for this country to look at the attacks of 9/11 as criminal \nactivity. We are at war, and we should be applying the law of armed \nconflict.\n  The people whom we are fighting very much fall into the category of \n``warriors'' based on their actions and their own words. What is the \nlaw of armed conflict? The law of armed conflict is governed by a lot \nof international treaties, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and \nAmerican case law.\n  What rights does an unlawful enemy combatant have? Well, our court \nlooked at Guantanamo Bay. Habeas petitions were filed by detainees at \nGuantanamo Bay alleging that they were improperly held. The U.S. \nSupreme Court in the Rasul v. Bush decision in 2004 said: There is a \ncongressional statute, 2241, that deals with habeas rights created by \nstatute.\n  The Government argued that Guantanamo Bay was outside the \njurisdiction of Federal courts; it was not part of the United States. \nThe Supreme Court said: No, wait a minute. Guantanamo Bay is \neffectively controlled by the Navy; it is part of the United States.\n  The question for the court is, Did the Congress, under 2241, intend \nto exclude al-Qaida from the statute? And the answer was that Congress \nhad taken no action. So the issue, 6 years after the war started here: \nDoes the Congress wish to confer upon enemy combatant terrorists housed \nat Guantanamo Bay habeas corpus rights under section 2241, a statute we \nwrote? That is the issue.\n  Now, imagine after 9/11 if someone had come to the floor of the \nSenate and made the proposal: In case we catch anybody who attacked us \non 9/11, I want to make sure they have the right of habeas corpus under \n2241 because I want to make sure their rights exceed any other prisoner \nin any other war. I think you would have gotten zero votes.\n  Well, that is the issue.\n  Now, last year, Congress spoke to the courts, and the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals understood what we were saying. Congress affirmatively \nstruck from 2241 the ability of a noncitizen alien enemy combatant to \nhave access to Federal court under the habeas statute. Why is that so \nimportant? From a military point of view, it is hugely important. Under \nthe law of armed conflict, if there is a question of status--is the \nperson a civilian? Are they part of an organized group? Are they an \nunlawful combatant? There are many different categories that can be \nconferred upon someone captured on a battlefield.\n  Under Geneva Conventions article 5, a competent tribunal should be \nimpaneled--usually one person--to determine questions of status, and \nthe only requirement is they be impartial. The question of who an enemy \ncombatant is is a military decision. We should not allow Federal \njudges, through habeas petitions, to take away from the U.S. military \nwhat is effectively a military function of labeling who the enemies of \nAmerica are. They are not trained for that. Our judges do not have the \nmilitary background to make decisions as to who the enemy force is and \nhow they operate.\n  So a habeas petition would really intrude into the military's ability \nto manage this war because if habeas rights were granted by statute to \nthe prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, they could pick, through their \nlawyers, any district court in this country. They could go judge \nshopping and find any judge in this country they believed would be \nsympathetic and have a full-blown trial, calling people off the \nbattlefield, having a complete trial as to whether this person is an \nenemy combatant in Federal court and let the judge make that decision. \nWell, that has never been done in any other war, and it should not be \ndone in this war. Judges have a role to play in war, but that is not \ntheir role. The role of the U.S. military in this war, as it has been \nin every other war, is to capture people and classify them based on \ntheir activity within that war, and habeas would undo that. That is why \nlast year Congress said: No, that is not the way we should proceed in \nthis war.\n  This is not unknown to our courts. In World War II, there was a \nhabeas petition filed by German and Japanese prisoners who were housed \noverseas asking the Federal courts to hear their case and release them \nfrom American military confinement. Chief Justice Jackson said:\n\n       It would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering \n     of a field commander than to allow the very enemies he has \n     ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his \n     own civil courts and divert his efforts and attention from \n     the military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.\n\n  Justice Jackson was right. And what has happened since these habeas \npetitions have been filed? Hundreds of them have been filed in Federal \ncourt before Congress acted. Here is what they are alleging:\n  A Canadian detainee who threw a grenade that killed an American medic \nin a firefight and who comes from a family with long-standing al-Qaida \nties moved for a preliminary injunction forbidding interrogation of him \nor engaging in cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of him. This was \na motion made by an enemy prisoner for the judge to sit in there and \nconduct the interrogation or at least monitor the interrogation. I \ncannot think of anything worse in terms of undermining the war effort.\n  A motion by a high-level al-Qaida detainee complaining about base \nsecurity procedures, speed of mail delivery, medical treatment, seeking \nan order that he be transferred to the least onerous conditions at \nGITMO, asking the court to order that GITMO allow him to keep any \nbooks, reading materials sent to him, and report to the court on his \nopportunities for exercise, communications, recreation, and worship.\n\n  Hundreds of these lawsuits have been filed under the habeas statute. \nThat is why Congress said: No, dismiss these cases because they have no \nbusiness in Federal court.\n  Surely to God, al-Qaida is not going to get more rights than the \nNazis. Surely to God, the Congress, 6 years after 9/11, will not, \nhopefully, give a statutory right to some of the most brutal, vicious \npeople in the world to bring lawsuits against our own troops in a \nfashion never allowed in any other war.\n  Here is what we did last year: We allowed the military to determine \nwhether a person is an enemy combatant, whether they were an unlawful \nenemy combatant through a competent tribunal called a Combatant Status \nReview Tribunal made up of three officers. The legislation allows every \ndecision by the military to be appealed to\n\n[[Page S11690]]\n\nthe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals so the court can look at the quality \nof the work product and the procedures in place.\n  There is Federal court review over activity at Guantanamo Bay where \njudges review the work product of the military. To me, that is the \nproper way to move forward because some people at Guantanamo Bay, \nbecause they are so dangerous, may not be released anytime soon or may \nnever be released. More people have been released at Guantanamo Bay \nthan are still at Guantanamo Bay. They were thought not to be a threat. \nThirty of them have gone back to the fight. We have released people at \nGuantanamo Bay to take up arms against us again. That is the result of \na process where you make a discretionary decision.\n  It would be ill-advised for this Congress to confer on American \ncourts the ability to hear a habeas petition from enemy prisoners \nhoused at Guantanamo Bay where they could go judge shopping and sue our \nown troops for anything they could think of, including a $100 million \nlawsuit against the Secretary of Defense. That will lead to chaos at \nthe jail. It will undermine the war effort.\n  I am urging a ``no'' vote to this amendment. We have in place Federal \ncourt review of every military decision at Guantanamo Bay and a way to \nallow the courts to do what they are best trained to do--review \ndocuments, review procedures, review outcomes--not to take the place of \nthe U.S. military. I cannot think of a more ill-advised effort to \nundercut what I think is going to be a war of a long-standing nature \nthan to turn it over to the judges and to take away the ability to \ndefine the enemy from the military, which is trained to make such \ndecisions, and give it to whatever judge you can find, wherever you can \nfind him or her, and let them have a full-blown trial at our national \nsecurity detriment.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe I have 10 minutes reserved at \nthis time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is divided between the \nleaders or their designees.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will act as the acting designee since \nno one is on this side of the aisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I see that the Senator from Vermont \nis yielding 10 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Pennsylvania is the lead cosponsor of \nthis amendment. I proudly yield him 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, the arguments advanced by the Senator from South \nCarolina a few moments ago are outdated. The Supreme Court of the \nUnited States has held in the Rasul case that the Guantanamo detainees \nhave rights under the Constitution to proceed in court in habeas \ncorpus. In my view, that decision was based on both constitutional and \nstatutory grounds. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nhas held that it is a matter of statutory interpretation. I believe \nthat will be reversed by the Supreme Court in a case now pending there. \nBut the existing law is governed by the Military Commissions Act, and \nthe question is whether the Congress should now correct the provision \nin the Military Commissions Act which eliminated the right of \nGuantanamo detainees to challenge their detention by habeas corpus \nproceedings in Federal court.\n  The District of Columbia Circuit has held that the provisions of the \nCombatant Status Review Tribunal are adequate. I believe that an \nexamination of those proceedings will show that they are palpably \ndeficient and obviously inadequate on their face.\n  The constitutional right of habeas corpus is expressly recognized in \nthe Constitution, with a provision that habeas corpus may be suspended \nonly in time of invasion or insurrection, neither of which situation is \npresent here. That fundamental right has been in existence since the \nMagna Carta in 1215. As noted earlier, the Supreme Court, in Rasul, has \nrecently applied that constitutional right to Guantanamo Bay detainees.\n  Now, Congress has acted to legislate to the contrary. Of course, \nCongress cannot legislate away a constitutional right; that can be done \nonly by amendment to the Constitution. That matter is now pending \nbefore the Supreme Court, and I believe on the precedents it will be \nheld that it remains a constitutional right.\n  But the issue which we confront today is the statute, the Military \nCommissions Act passed by Congress 2 years ago which eliminates habeas \ncorpus. The Supreme Court has held, in the case of Swain v. Pressley, \nthat habeas corpus in the Federal courts may be eliminated by an \nadequate substitute. In that case, the substitute held to be adequate \nwas a proceeding in the District of Columbia courts. The Supreme Court \nsaid: That was adequate judicial review to superintend executive \ndetention.\n  But when we take a look at the provisions of the Combatant Status \nReview Board, as examined by the District Court in the District of \nColumbia, in the In re: Guantanamo cases, this is illustrative. An \nindividual was charged with being an associate of al-Qaida individuals. \nWhen asked to identify whom he was supposed to have associated with, \nthe tribunal could not identify the person. I discussed this case at \nsome length yesterday, and the courtroom broke into laughter. It was a \nlaughing matter to be detaining somebody who was allegedly associated \nwith someone from al-Qaida when they could not even identify who the \nperson was.\n  Now, there has been a very revealing declaration filed by LTC Stephen \nAbraham, who was a member of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal and \nobserved the process.\n  This is the way Lieutenant Colonel Abraham described the process:\n\n       Those of us on the panel found the information presented to \n     try to uphold detention to ``lack substance.'' What were \n     purported to be specific statements of fact lacked even the \n     most fundamental earmarks of objectively credible evidence. \n     Statements allegedly made by witnesses lacked detail. Reports \n     presented generalized statements in indirect and passive \n     forms without stating the source of the information or \n     providing a basis for establishing the reliability or \n     credibility of the sources.\n\n  I put this in the Record yesterday, but it shows a proceeding totally \ndevoid of any substance. You don't have to have sufficient evidence to \ngo to court to detain someone at Guantanamo, but there has to be some \nbasis for the detention. An examination of what is happening with the \nCombatant Status Review boards shows they are entirely inadequate under \nthe standards set down by the Supreme Court in the case of Swain v. \nPressley. Therefore, the alternative established by Congress in the \nMilitary Commissions Act is totally insufficient to provide fair play.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has laid it on the line. Even \nthe Guantanamo detainees are entitled to fairness. Guantanamo has been \nridiculed around the world and Guantanamo is not being closed. No \nalternative has been found for it. But at a minimum, those who are \ndetained at Guantanamo ought to have some proceeding to establish some \nbasis, however slight, for their continued detention.\n  When Congress established the Military Commissions Act and provided \nfor Combatant Status Review boards, we did so with the thought that we \ncould have an alternative to going to Federal court, which would \nprovide a basic rudimentary element of fairness required by the Geneva \nConventions and required by the Supreme Court, which brushed aside the \npractices from World War II, overruling the prior precedents. So now it \nis up to the Congress of the United States to correct that mistake \nwhich we made 2 years ago. I believe any fair reading of what happens \nwith the Combatant Status Review boards would demonstrate that we ought \nto correct the 2005 legislation. This amendment ought to be adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from New Mexico \nwants 3 minutes. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n\n[[Page S11691]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise in support of \nthe amendment being offered by Senators Leahy and Specter to restore \nthe writ of habeas corpus. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation, and it is my sincere hope that it will be adopted.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of the administration's onslaught \non basic civil rights, which has largely been carried out with the \nacquiescence of Congress, is with regard to the suspension of habeas \ncorpus.\n  The ``great writ,'' as it is known in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, is \nsimply the basic right to challenge the legality of one's confinement \nby the Government. It is based on a core American value that it is \nunacceptable to give the executive branch unchecked authority to detain \nwhomever it wants without an independent review of the legality of the \nGovernment's actions. The right dates back to the Magna Carta, and our \nFounding Fathers included it as one of the fundamental rights \nguaranteed by our Constitution.\n  I would like to take a moment to briefly recount how we ended up \nwhere we are today.\n  In 2004, in the case Rasul v. Bush, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \nindividuals held at the Guantanamo Bay naval base have the right to \nchallenge the legality of their detention by filing a habeas petition \nin a U.S. Federal court.\n  In November 2005, in response to the Supreme Court's decision, and at \nthe behest of the Bush administration, Senator Graham offered an \namendment to the 2006 Defense Authorization bill that sought to \noverrule the Rasul decision and strip Federal courts of jurisdiction to \nhear habeas claims filed by Guantanamo prisoners.\n  I offered an alternative amendment aimed at preserving the right to \nhabeas corpus. My amendment was voted on the day before the Senate \nrecessed for Veterans Day. No hearings had been held in either the \nSenate Judiciary Committee or the Armed Services Committee regarding \nthe impact of eliminating this longstanding right. After very little \ndebate on the Senate floor, my amendment was defeated by a vote of 49-\n42. The next week I offered a second amendment also aimed at preserving \nhabeas rights, but it was also defeated after a deal was reached as \npart of what is known as the Graham-Levin compromise.\n  Under the Graham-Levin compromise, which was ultimately included in \nthe Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, habeas rights were curtailed but \nthe D.C. Circuit was granted very limited jurisdiction to review the \ndetermination of a Combatant Status Review Tribunal. That compromise \nwas adopted 84-14. In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in the Hamdan case \nthat it was unclear as to whether Congress intended to prospectively \nrepeal habeas rights and that the military commissions in Guantanamo \nwere improperly constituted in violation of the Geneva Conventions and \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n  Once again, the Senate had the opportunity to restore our Nation's \ncommitment to the rule of law.\n  Unfortunately, rather than standing up for the rights enshrined in \nour Constitution, the Senate passed, by a vote of 65-34, the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006, which explicitly eliminated habeas rights.\n  Today is almost exactly a year after the Senate voted to pass the \nMilitary Commissions Act, and the Senate once again has the opportunity \ndo what is right. We have the chance to restore one of the most \nfundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution, and I hope the \nSenate will take this important step in restoring our Nation's \ncommitment to the rule of law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Might I inquire how much time exists on both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is approximately 18\\1/2\\ \nminutes on both sides.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  I request the Chair to advise me when I have spoken for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond to some of the arguments that \nhave been made in support of this amendment and urge my colleagues, as \nthey have done in the past, to reject it. The first thing that must be \nclarified is that the writ of habeas corpus is not being restored. It \ncan't be restored because it has never existed to question detention. \nPOWs and enemy combatants, detainees, have never, in the history of \nEnglish common law or American jurisprudence, had the constitutional \nwrit of habeas corpus to challenge their detention--never. So it is a \nmistake for those who support this amendment to claim that somehow we \nneed to restore the right. It has never existed for this purpose; no \ncase in the history of English or American jurisprudence or anywhere \nelse in the world, for that matter.\n  Yesterday our distinguished friend and colleague Senator Dodd praised \nand upheld the honor and wisdom of those like his father who \nparticipated in the Nuremberg tribunals after World War II. It is well \nthat he should. Along with his father, Thomas Dodd, is, of course, \nRobert H. Jackson, who became a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in \n1941 and who returned to the Court after serving as chief counsel at \nthe Nuremberg tribunals from 1945 to 1946. The heroes of American \njustice and the lions of Nuremberg did not become evil men or ignorant \nin the law in the period between 1946 and 1950, the year that Johnson \nv. Eisentrager was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a case in \nwhich Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the court that enemy \ncombatants have no constitutional right to habeas corpus. That was the \nholding in the case by the very jurist who presided over the Nuremberg \ntrials. He knew what he was talking about. That precedent remains the \nlaw of the United States to this day.\n  My colleague from South Carolina quoted Justice Jackson in that \ndecision in which he said he could think of nothing that would fetter \nour commanders more than granting to enemy POWs a right to contest \ntheir detention, a constitutional habeas corpus right to question their \ndetention in American courts. He said the very act of war is to subdue \nyour opponent and for that opponent to have the right to require you to \ngo into the courts of your land to defend your capturing of that enemy \nwould be, from the commander's standpoint, an impossible burden to \nbear. He was right. It is the wisdom and correctness of that decision \nand all of the precedents that we defend today.\n  So, first, this is not about restoration of a right. With respect to \nquestioning detention, that right has never existed. The reasons why \nshould be evident to us all.\n  Secondly, to the extent there needs to be a process for determining \nwhether an individual should be detained, this Congress has gone \nfurther than ever in the history of our country and granted an \nunprecedented process and procedure for that issue to be resolved. \nAfter the military tribunals sort out the people who have been captured \nand they determine, based upon the evidence they have, whether to \ndetain these individuals, what we have granted to these detainees is a \nright never before granted. It is unprecedented in the history not just \nof the United States; no other country has done this. We allow that \ndetainee to appeal that detention to a court in the United States, a \nFederal court, and not just any Federal court, the U.S. Circuit Court \nfor the District of Columbia, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, which many view as the court directly below the \nU.S. Supreme Court. And from a decision of that DC Circuit Court, the \nlosing side can petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Never has such an unprecedented legal right been granted to a \nPOW or a detainee. So we should not be suffering under the illusion \nthat by not granting habeas, they don't have any rights. They have more \nrights than they have ever had.\n  I would briefly respond to my good friend and colleague Senator \nSpecter, who cited an affidavit of an individual who said, from his \nperspective, the evidence of the Government was inadequate in a case or \nin a series of cases, there are three remedies for that. The first is \nthat the tribunal says the evidence is inadequate. The detainee gets to \ngo. The second is for the court to ask for more evidence and say this \nisn't sufficient; do you have anything else you can provide. Of course, \nit is usually a question of classified information that the Government \nis loathe\n\n[[Page S11692]]\n\nto release because frequently it is from a source to which a commitment \nhas been made that the source would not be revealed or that the \nintelligence wouldn't be revealed, or sometimes it is from another \ncountry that we have gotten the information from and we have also made \nagreements with those countries not to air intelligence they provided \nto us. So there is always a tension between how much evidence the \nUnited States wants to reveal of a classified nature in order to keep \nthis person in detention. But that is the second remedy.\n  The third remedy is if the court nonetheless decides that there is \nsufficient evidence, the individual is detained, he can appeal that \ndetention to the circuit court. The circuit court can make all of those \nsame inquiries. So you have one of the most prestigious courts in the \ncountry making the final decision about whether the evidence is \nsufficient. That is certainly adequate process.\n  The Congress has ratified that twice through our decisions in dealing \nwith the statutory right of habeas. Remember, there is the \nconstitutional right and a statutory right of habeas. What Congress did \n2 years ago, in consideration of the Detainee Treatment Act, was to \ndevelop a compromise that provided this procedure and make it clear, we \nthought, that the statutory right of habeas did not apply to these \ndetainees.\n  A subsequent court decision said: Well, you made that clear with \nrespect to future cases, but for pending cases we think you have not \nmade it clear. So we came back and made it clear that the statutory \nright applied to neither the existing cases nor future cases. Of \ncourse, Congress has the right to limit the statutory right of habeas \ncorpus. So neither the statutory right nor the constitutional right has \nprovided a remedy for these detainees.\n  There is an alternative remedy that is perfectly adequate. When the \nMilitary Commissions Act was marked up by the Armed Services \nCommittee--the bill that is before us--it was adopted with an even more \nspecific provision removing Federal court habeas jurisdiction over \nenemy combatants to clear up any remaining doubt after the Supreme \nCourt's interpretation of the DTA in the Hamdan decision. That vote, \nlast September, was 15 to 9, including all the committee's Democratic \nmembers. Were they all wrong about the Constitution at that time? After \nsubsequent negotiations that did not change the habeas provisions in \nthe bill, the MCA passed this body on a vote of 65 to 34.\n  We have acted on this matter. I urge my colleagues, when they vote in \na few minutes, to refer to their previous vote. It was correct at that \ntime. It remains correct today. If, by some reason, we are wrong, and \nthe case the Supreme Court has before it decides that this fall, then \nthere is no necessity for us to act in a statutory way now. It is not \ngoing to change what the Court decides. The Court will say that right \nexists, and nothing we do will affect that. It would be unnecessary in \nany event. But if the Court confirms we are right, then it would not \nonly be unnecessary but wrong for us to change that law by supporting \nthe habeas amendment in a few minutes.\n  The final point I wish to make is that the consequences of granting \nthe habeas right would be horrendous. Justice Jackson referred to this \nin the Eisentrager decision. I can be more explicit. But as he said: No \ndecision of this Court supports the view. None has ever even hinted \nthat the right of habeas existed in this case.\n  What would the consequences of granting habeas be?\n  At least 30 detainees who have been released from the Guantanamo Bay \nfacility have since returned to waging war against the United States \nand our allies. A dozen released detainees have been killed in battle \nby U.S. forces. They went right back to fighting us. Others have been \nrecaptured. Two released detainees later became regional commanders for \nTaliban forces. One released Guantanamo detainee later attacked U.S. \nand allied soldiers in Afghanistan, killing three Afghan soldiers. \nAnother former detainee killed an Afghan judge. One released detainee \nled a terrorist attack on a hotel in Pakistan and also led a kidnaping \nraid that resulted in the death of a Chinese civilian. This former \ndetainee recently told Pakistani journalists he plans to fight America \nand its allies until the very end.\n  The point here is even detainees whom we have released, either \nbecause there was insufficient evidence to hold them or because we \ndeemed they no longer posed a threat to us, have gone back to the \nbattlefield and have fought us and fought our allies, have killed and \nbeen killed. These are dangerous killers.\n  This is not some law school exercise we are going through here. This \nis not the American criminal justice process. This is dealing with \nterrorists who are fighting us on the battlefield, and will continue to \ndo so if they are released improperly. That is why dealing with \nsomething such as habeas is a very serious--very serious--matter.\n  I mentioned the problem of classified evidence. In a habeas trial, \nthere clearly would be a right of the defendant or the detainee to both \ncall witnesses--he would literally be able to call his captors, the \npeople who captured him on the battlefield and require them to verify \nhis identity and the reasons why he was held and why he needs to \ncontinue to be held--totally disrupting our operations--and classified \nevidence would probably be required in most of the cases because these \nare people on whom we have gotten good intelligence as to their \nintentions and their past activities. Much of this intelligence is \nhighly sensitive as it comes from foreign sources and human sources to \nwhom we have made commitments that we would not reveal the information \nthey provided to us.\n  It is a Hobson's choice, then, if you treat this like an American \ntrial, where you say either the Government has to come and make this \nclassified evidence available--and then it becomes public--or you have \nto withhold the classified information and let the detainee go. That \ncannot be the case in the case of these detainees. That is another \npractical reason why you cannot have the habeas granted to allow them \nto contest detention.\n  Again, put this in the context. What we have is a process that allows \nthem to contest their detention at several stages. It allows counsel to \nhave access to at least some of the classified information. It allows \nthe court--and, in fact, the court of appeals has said it has the \nright--to review this information, all of the information that is \nrelevant to a particular detainee's case.\n  The process is not lacking. It is not as if you have to grant habeas \nin order for these individuals to have a fair determination of their \ndetainee status. They have that today. What they do not have is the \nextra right that habeas accords American citizens, people here in the \nUnited States, to call the witnesses to the court who captured you, to \ncall up all of the classified evidence that is used against you--for \nthe detainee to have a right to that.\n  The judge who tried the 1993 World Trade Center bombing case and the \nPadilla case made the point that when information was granted to the \nlawyers of the detainees in that case, within 10 days the information \nthat was supposed to remain classified--the lawyers were not supposed \nto reveal it to anyone because it was highly classified; it included \nthe names of coconspirators--within 10 days that information was in \nSudan and was in the hands of Osama bin Laden. He knew because his name \nwas on the list that we were after him. He was named as a coconspirator \nin the case.\n  So when the habeas right exists, and you have an even greater \nrequirement to release this information, it is inevitable that highly \nsensitive information in fighting this war on terror will find its way \ninto enemy hands. So the detainees can get back to the battlefield and \nthe highly sensitive information will be very much jeopardized.\n  These are reasons not to grant, for the first time, a writ of habeas \ncorpus. It is a reason to sustain what we have established for these \ndetainees--a very fair procedure. I urge my colleagues not to grant the \ncloture motion, to vote ``no'' on cloture, so we do not open up this \ncan of worms, so we can continue to fight the war against these \nterrorists.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of the time on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask to be yielded 2 minutes.\n\n[[Page S11693]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the law we passed last Congress stripped \nthe Federal courts of jurisdiction to grant habeas corpus despite a \nconstitutional prohibition which says that habeas corpus may not be \nsuspended except in cases of rebellion or invasion, neither of which is \nthe state of affairs today.\n  I want to make in this 2 minutes one essential point. The Specter-\nLeahy-Dodd amendment does not grant any individual the affirmative \nright to go to court. It does not grant a right of habeas corpus. It \nsimply removes a legislative barrier to such action, restoring the law \nas it was before we enacted this provision in the last Congress, \nleaving it up to the courts--where it belongs and it always has been--\nas to whether habeas corpus should be granted.\n  When we debated this provision in the last Congress, we received a \nletter from three retired Judge Advocates General who urged us not to \nstrip the courts of habeas corpus jurisdiction. That letter, signed by \nAdmirals Hutson and Guter, and General Brahms, said the following:\n\n       We urge you to oppose any further erosion of the proper \n     authority of our courts and to reject any provision that \n     would strip the courts of habeas jurisdiction.\n       As Alexander Hamilton and James Madison emphasized in the \n     Federalist Papers, the writ of habeas corpus embodies \n     principles fundamental to our nation. It is the essence of \n     the rule of law, ensuring that neither king nor executive may \n     deprive a person of liberty without some independent review \n     to ensure that the detention has a reasonable basis in law \n     and fact. That right must be preserved. Fair hearings do not \n     jeopardize our security. They are what our country stands \n     for.\n\n  Well, we received similar letters from nine distinguished retired \nFederal judges and from hundreds of law professors from around the \nUnited States, and from many others.\n  I urge our colleagues to support the Specter-Leahy-Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am cosponsoring this amendment because \nI strongly support the restoration of the right to habeas corpus for \nnoncitizens detained as enemy combatants.\n  This bill will reinstate one of the cornerstones of the rule of law. \nHabeas corpus protects one of our most fundamental guarantees: that the \nGovernment may not arbitrarily deprive persons of their liberty.\n  President Bush and Congress undermined that guarantee last year by \nenacting the Military Commissions Act, which stripped courts of \njurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions by enemy combatants. That \nlegislation is a stain on our human rights record and an insult to the \nrule of law. It is almost surely unconstitutional.\n  For centuries, the writ of habeas corpus has been a core principle of \nAnglo-American jurisprudence. Since the days of the Magna Carta in the \n17th century, it has been a primary means for persons to challenge \ntheir unlawful government detention. Literally, the Latin phrase means \n``have the body'' meaning that persons detained must be brought \nphysically before a court or judge to consider the legality of their \ndetention.\n  The writ prevents indefinite detention and ensures that individuals \ncannot be held in endless detainment, without indictment or trial. It \nrequires the Government to prove to a court that it has a legal basis \nfor its decision to deprive such persons of their liberty.\n  The Framers considered this principle so important that the writ of \nhabeas corpus is the only common law writ enshrined in the \nConstitution. Article I, section 9, clause 2, specifically states, \n``The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, \nunless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may \nrequire it.''\n  Mr. President, 9/11 was a tragic time for our country, but we did not \nset aside the Constitution or the rule of law after those vicious \nattacks. We did not decide as a nation to stoop to the level of the \nterrorists. In fact, we have always been united in our belief that an \nessential part of winning the war on terrorism and protecting the \nNation is safeguarding the values that Americans stand for, both at \nhome and throughout the world.\n  Instead of standing by these principles, however, the Bush \nadministration used 9/11 to justify abandoning this basic American \nvalue. It has consistently undermined habeas corpus, claiming that the \nConstitution, statutory habeas corpus, and the Geneva Conventions, \nwhich Alberto Gonzales described as ``quaint,'' do not apply to enemy \ncombatants held at Guantanamo Bay or elsewhere.\n  The administration even went so far as to establish detention \nfacilities outside the United States to avoid the reach of U.S. courts \nand the application of basic legal protections such as habeas corpus. \nThe administration's purpose was to hold these combatants indefinitely \nand try them in military commissions.\n  The commissions, however, have severely limited the rights of alleged \nenemy combatants. The accused have no access to the evidence which the \nGovernment claims it possesses and no ability to provide a meaningful \ndefense. The tribunals are a sham and an insult to the rule of law.\n  The administration's lawlessness failed. Last year, the Supreme Court \nruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that Federal courts have jurisdiction over \nhabeas corpus petitions brought by detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Justice \nStevens reminded the administration that ``in undertaking to try Hamdan \nand subject him to criminal punishment, the Executive is bound to \ncomply with the Rule of Law.''\n  In the face of this clear Supreme Court precedent, the administration \nand Congress recklessly responded with the Military Commissions Act, \nwhich eliminated the right of all noncitizens labeled by the executive \nas enemy combatants to be heard in an Article 3 court. This bill will \nrepeal these disgraceful provisions of the Military Commissions Act and \nrestore the right to habeas corpus for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay \nand elsewhere. I urge my colleagues to vote for the rule of law and to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to once again voice my support for \nthe Specter-Leahy-Dodd amendment to the Department of Defense \nAuthorization Act. This amendment will restore habeas corpus rights to \nindividuals held in U.S. custody.\n  Just as importantly, it will begin to undo the damage done by the \nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006--legislation that undermined our \nvalues and our commitment to the rule of law. In a struggle with \nterrorism in which our credibility, our good name, is a powerful \nweapon, the Military Commissions Act was not simply wrongheaded; it was \ndangerous. The amendment we offer today is a first step out of that \ndanger and back to our moral authority.\n  Critics of this amendment in the Bush administration and elsewhere \nhave argued that restoring habeas corpus rights will clog Federal \ncourts and hamper our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This \nis simply not true.\n  First, in keeping with long tradition, this amendment only applies to \nindividuals held on clearly defined U.S. territory, including \nGuantanamo--but not to individuals held in U.S. custody in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Several individuals filing habeas petitions from Iraq and \nAfghanistan have already been denied. The truth is that a relatively \nsmall number of individuals are covered by this amendment. Right now, \nfewer than 500 people are held in Guantanamo Bay. It is simply not \ncredible to suggest that thousands or millions of petitions would \ndeluge our courts and grind them to a halt. From 2002 to 2006, when \ndetainees had the ability to file habeas petitions, the Federal courts \ncontinued to run smoothly. Last year, a distinguished group of retired \njudges wrote to Congress, stating clearly that habeas petitions from \ndetainees in no way tied up our courts.\n  Second, habeas petitions heavily favor the Government's position. \nThey are often decided solely by paper filings by the Government, and \nFederal judges have wide discretion in determining what type of \nevidence they need to make their determinations. In addition, usually \nonly a minimal amount of evidence is needed to justify continued \ndetention. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that U.S. servicemembers \nwill be called from the battlefield to testify before a Federal judge.\n\n[[Page S11694]]\n\n  Finally, many of those who oppose this amendment have relied on \nJustice Jackson's opinion in Johnson v. Eisenstrager to defend the \nstripping of habeas rights to detainees. But Eisentrager has been \novertaken by more recent cases. Justice Jackson's opinion in that case \nrelied in part on the fact that the petitioners were German prisoners \nof war who were imprisoned outside the United States. In 2004, however, \nthe Supreme Court held in Rasul v. Bush that the U.S. courts have \njurisdiction to hear challenges to the legality of detention of foreign \nnationals held there because the United States had complete \njurisdiction and control over the base at Guantanamo. In other words, \nthe Supreme Court itself rejected the Government's reliance on \nEisentrager as it applies to individuals held in Guantanamo. That was \nthe very decision that prompted the President and Congress to strip \ndetainees of habeas rights with the Military Commissions Act.\n  In ignoring the most recent precedent, President Bush and his \nsupporters are ignoring the history of the very bill they are now \nfighting to uphold. Their reliance on outdated rulings is, at best, \ndisingenuous. Willfully or not, they have once again distorted the \nfacts.\n  I believe that returning to the legal framework that was in place \nprior to the Military Commissions Act would not undermine our security. \nIn fact, I believe reaffirming our commitment to the rule of law will \nstrengthen our efforts to combat terrorism--we can protect our security \nand uphold our values at the same time. And so I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nLeahy-Specter amendment to restore habeas corpus, as part of the \nDefense authorization bill. This amendment is identical to S. 185, the \nHabeas Restoration Act, which was introduced earlier in this Congress \nand enjoys bipartisan support. I was pleased to sign onto that bill as \none of its earliest cosponsors, and I am pleased to speak in favor of \nthis amendment today.\n  I strongly disagree with the provisions in the Military Commissions \nAct that were passed last fall, eliminating the jurisdiction of \nAmerican courts to consider any petition for a writ of habeas corpus \nfiled by an alien detained by the United States after either being \ndetermined to be an enemy combatant or while awaiting such a \ndetermination.\n  I believe the Leahy-Specter amendment would rectify this provision, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I firmly believe that we must do all we can to fight the war on \nterrorism. But we also must preserve the core principles that create \nthe foundation of this country.\n  The right to habeas corpus is one of those fundamental principles. \nHabeas corpus is the right secured in the Constitution, allowing a \nperson to seek relief from unlawful detention. It has roots that date \nback to the Magna Carta of 1215.\n  Habeas corpus has been suspended only a few times in our history--and \nthen only temporarily, such as during our Civil War. Never in history \nhave we suspended habeas corpus indefinitely, for a war that has no \nforeseeable end.\n  This is not simply a matter affecting a few hundred detainees at \nGuantanamo. The Military Commissions Act went far beyond eliminating \nthe rights of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo--it also \npotentially can reach all 12 million lawful permanent residents in the \nUnited States, as well as visitors to our country. Under this law, any \nof these people can be detained, potentially forever, without any \nability to challenge their detention in Federal court, simply based on \nthe Government declaring them enemy combatants.\n  In fact, the Government need not even find that a noncitizen is an \nenemy combatant for their habeas rights to be stripped. It is enough \nfor someone to be ``awaiting'' a determination--of a mere accusation is \nenough for a person to lose this basic right.\n  Here is what the Military Commissions Act says:\n\n       No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear \n     or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed \n     by or on behalf of an alien detained by the United States who \n     has been determined by the United States to have been \n     properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such \n     determination.\n\n  Most of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo have been held without \ncharges for years. While they did receive very limited due process \nthrough DOD-sponsored administrative tribunals, designed to evaluate \nwhether they can continue to be classified and held as enemy \ncombatants, in these review tribunals, detainees can often face: secret \nand hearsay evidence, evidence obtained from ``enhanced interrogation \ntechniques,'' and no right to counsel. Appeals from these review \ntribunals are limited to the question of whether the Government \nfollowed its own limited procedures. There are even recent reports that \nwhen some of these tribunals found that a detainee was not an enemy \ncombatant, the Defense Department arranged for the tribunals to be \nrepeated, until Government officials got a result that they wanted.\n  Rather than abolishing habeas corpus, I believe the judiciary plays a \nvital role in evaluating and reviewing whether due process has been \nprovided and whether innocent persons are being held.\n  This is not a partisan issue, as demonstrated by the fact that the \nlead Senators are the chair and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. In addition, conservatives like Kenneth Starr, Professor \nRichard Epstein, and David Keene of the American Conservative Union \nhave all called for restoration of habeas, as have a long list of \nliberal and other scholars, retired Federal judges, and military \nleaders such as RADM Donald Guter, former Judge Advocate General of the \nNavy, who wrote that the elimination of habeas corpus rights for \ndetainees ``makes us weaker and impairs our valiant troops.''\n  The right of habeas corpus is a key component of what keeps our \nsystem of justice fair and balanced. It is time for Congress to ensure \nthat it remains available. I urge my colleagues to support the Leahy-\nSpecter amendment to restore the rule of law at Guantanamo and \nelsewhere and the Great Writ of habeas corpus to its rightful place in \nour American system of justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator from Alabama a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is it the Senator's intention to close for his side?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, let's see how the time looks. I think \nperhaps so. How much time is left on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes remain.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would utilize that 3 minutes and allow \nthe distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee to close with his \nremarks.\n  First, I express my appreciation to Senator Lindsey Graham and \nSenator Jon Kyl, who meticulously explained the origin of the situation \nwe find ourselves in today and why we have never provided the writ of \nhabeas corpus to enemy combatants and why we should not do so.\n  Let's back up a little bit and go to the core of it. The Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, I think correctly gave us the status of the \ncase. Congress passed section 2241, part of the United States Code, a \nstatutory provision of Congress dealing with habeas. At that time, I \nsuggest, without any doubt in my own mind, Congress had no idea that \nyears later the Supreme Court would conclude that language--and rightly \nor wrongly on the Supreme Court ruling--that language would provide \nhabeas rights to combatants captured on the battlefield. OK. But the \nSupreme Court ruled that based on the way the statute was written. It \nwas an unintended consequence. I would note, three members of the \nSupreme Court dissented and did not think that statute covered that.\n  So after that happened, we had to ask ourselves: Is the Supreme Court \nsaying: You, Congress, provided habeas rights to prisoners. You did it \nwhen you passed the statute. We are not saying the Constitution \nrequires it. We are not saying the Supreme Court requires it. What we \nare saying is you did it when you passed the statute?\n  So Congress said: OK, we did not mean that. Then we passed the \namendment last year Senator Graham offered\n\n[[Page S11695]]\n\nthat fixed it, and did not provide, for the first time in the history \nof American history--or world history, for that matter--enemy prisoners \nbe given the right to sue the generals who have captured them.\n  All right. So we did that, and we passed it. The DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, in interpreting that statute, has followed it and concluded \nthat Congress has changed the law and that the prisoners in Guantanamo \nare not entitled to habeas rights that we provide to every American \ncitizen.\n  Now, that is the right thing. This is exactly what we should do. So I \nam somewhat taken aback by the suggestion of those who are promoting \nthis amendment that somehow Congress denied the Great Writ and changed \nthe law and they are here to restore it.\n  This is purely a matter of congressional policy and national policy \non how we want to conduct warfare now and in the future. How are we \ngoing to do that? Are we going to do it in a way that allows those we \ncapture to sue us? Now you can utilize those rights if we choose to try \na prisoner of war and to lock them up or to execute them. You can use a \nlot of legal rights. A prisoner can use those rights, but not in this \ncircumstance. This is merely to restore the historical principles of \nhabeas that already existed. The current law does that. The new \namendment would change it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the beginning of this debate, I said \nCongress committed a historic error when it eliminated the Great Writ \nof habeas corpus because it did it not just for those detained at \nGuantanamo Bay--that raises enough questions about our sense of history \nand our sense of our own basic jurisprudence in this country--but \nCongress also eliminated it for millions--millions--of permanent legal \nresidents here in the United States. Some of them are professors in our \nfinest schools, others are medical people in our hospitals, and some \nare actually serving in our law enforcement and in our military. \nListening to the arguments these past few days of those opposed to \nrestoring habeas rights, it becomes ever more apparent that this was a \nmistake the last Congress and the administration made based on fear. I \ncannot think of a greater mistake than one based on fear in the most \npowerful Nation on Earth.\n\n  Opponents make the alarmist argument that if we permit people to \nchallenge their detention in Federal court, we will jeopardize our \nnational security and place ourselves in greater danger. In fact, of \ncourse, the opposite is true.\n  We have heard these kinds of arguments before during trying and \nturbulent times in American history, such as when the Government \nshamefully interned tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans during \nWorld War II. We should know by now that it hurts this country, and \nespecially our men and women in uniform, when we allow public policy to \nbe guided by fear, rather than by American values and freedoms.\n  The critics of habeas restoration resort to scare tactics because \nthey know that history and the facts are against them.\n  The truth is that casting aside the time-honored protection of habeas \ncorpus makes us more vulnerable as a nation because it leads us away \nfrom our core American values and calls into question our historic role \nas the defender of human rights around the world. It also allows our \nenemies to accomplish something they could never achieve on the \nbattlefield--the whittling away of liberties that make us who we are, \nthe liberties we fought during the Revolutionary War to preserve, the \nliberties we fought a civil war to preserve, the liberties we defended \nnot only our own freedom but the freedom of much of the Western World \nin two world wars to preserve.\n  The need for the Great Writ has never been stronger than it is today. \nWe have an administration that at every opportunity has aggressively \nsought unchecked executive power while working to erode or to eliminate \nconstitutionally enshrined checks on that power by the courts and by \nCongress. Stripping away habeas rights which allow people to go to \ncourt to challenge detention by the executive is just the latest brazen \nattempt in a 6-year-long effort to consolidate power in the executive \nbranch. You could have picked up somebody, locked them up, and all that \nperson wants to say is: I am not the person named here. Before we did \nthis, someone could at least get a writ of habeas corpus, go to the \ncourt, and say: I am not going to contest the case or anything else, \nbut just the fact that you picked up the wrong person. They can't even \ndo that now. This is America?\n  The writ of habeas corpus is not some special benefit to be honored \nonly when it is convenient. As no less a conservative than Justice \nAntonin Scalia has written, ``[t]he very core of liberty secured by our \nAnglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from indefinite \nimprisonment at the will of the Executive.'' Habeas has served for \ncenturies to protect individuals against unlawful exercises of state \npower.\n  Habeas corpus is the only common law writ enshrined in the \nConstitution. Article I, section 9 provides that the ``Writ of Habeas \nCorpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of rebellion or \ninvasion the public Safety may require it.'' The Judiciary Act of 1789 \nspecifically empowered federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus \n``for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment.'' In more \nthan two centuries since then, habeas has only been suspended four \ntimes, all of them at times of active rebellion or invasion. Even this \nadministration does not claim that we are at such a point now.\n  The Military Commissions Act of 2006 spurned centuries of tradition \nand empowered the executive to detain noncitizens potentially forever, \nwith no meaningful check by another branch of Government. With this \nact, Congress permanently eliminated the writ of habeas corpus for any \nnoncitizen determined to be an enemy combatant or even awaiting such \ndetermination. If the determination hasn't been made, we are going to \nspend a few years making up our minds whether you are an enemy \ncombatant, but you still can't contest the fact that we have picked up \nthe wrong person. So a mere accusation by the executive is enough to \nkeep a person in custody indefinitely, and that detention is not \nsubject to review. As our Founders knew well, no administration--no \nadministration, not this one, not the next one, not the one after \nthat--can be trusted with that kind of power.\n  The Specter-Leahy amendment would restore the proper balance of power \nbetween the branches of Government by reestablishing the law on habeas \nas it existed prior to the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act and \nthe Military Commissions Act. It creates no new legal rights. The U.S. \nSupreme Court confirmed in the Rasul case that American and British \ncourts have routinely assumed jurisdiction over habeas claims made by \naliens.\n  British courts in the 18th century considered habeas claims of aliens \nheld as enemy combatants, as did the U.S. Supreme Court during World \nWar II, a war where we faced the possible destruction of democracy. \nThese courts considered habeas claims of alien enemy combatants who had \nalready received military trials--meaning even before their habeas \nclaims, they had already received more process than most noncitizen \ndetainees will ever get now. Our legendary Chief Justice, John \nMarshall, in one instance granted relief to an alien enemy combatant \nbringing a habeas claim. In most of these historical cases, though, \nhabeas petitioners lost and were not granted any relief, and indeed \nmost habeas petitioners have their claims dismissed with a simple, one-\npage ruling from a judge. This historical record is evidence that \nhabeas can be relied upon as a necessary, but entirely reasonable, \ncheck on Executive power.\n\n  As in the past, noncitizen detainees alleged to be enemy combatants \nshould at least have the right to go into an independent court to \nassert that they are being held in error--not to have a trial but at \nleast to say: Hey, we read the warrant, this is not the person--I am \nnot the person named; you picked up the wrong person. They can't even \nask an independent court to determine that.\n  As in the past, a court will only grant habeas relief if the \npetitioner is able to, in fact, establish this effort.\n\n[[Page S11696]]\n\nWe are not talking about having a trial with all of these red herrings \nwe have heard from those on the other side, who say that somehow we \nwould have to bring in battlefield tactics or we would have to bring in \nclassified information. That is not it. That is not it. We are talking \nabout just being able to at least contest the fact that they have been \npicked up.\n  If the detainees held at Guantanamo truly are the worst of the worst \nof our enemies, as this administration claims, surely it will be easy \nfor the Government to make a baseline showing in court that they are \nlawfully detained. If they are really such enemies, we ought to at \nleast know that and know that they were lawfully detained. Of course, \nsenior government and military officials have told the press a story \nvery different from the party line. They have told the New York Times \nthat the Government detained many of the Guantanamo detainees in error.\n  In any case, the sweep of the Military Commissions Act goes well \nbeyond the few hundred detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. It threatens \nthe civil liberties of an estimated 12 million lawful, permanent \nresidents of the United States. They work here, they pay taxes in this \ncountry, and under current law, any of these people can be detained \nforever without the ability to challenge their detention in Federal \ncourt simply on the executive say-so, even if the Government made a \nmistake and picked up the wrong person. As we heard from Professor \nMariano-Florentino Cuellar at the Judiciary Committee's hearing on this \nissue, this is of particular concern to the Latino community, which \nincludes so many of the hard-working lawful permanent residents in this \ncountry.\n  The cursory review process set up by Congress for detainees, called \ncombatant status review tribunals or CSRTs, is no substitute for habeas \ncorpus because, among many other deficiencies, it does not provide a \nneutral arbiter--a Federal judge--to review the factual record for \nerror. This summer, LTC Stephen Abraham, a military lawyer who \nparticipated in the CSRT process, said in a sworn affidavit that the \nevidence presented to CSRTs ``lack[s] even the most fundamental \nearmarks of objectively credible evidence.'' He also said that \nsuperiors pressured the officers on review panels to find detainees to \nbe ``enemy combatants.'' That is neither just nor fair, and rigged \ntribunals are not the way this country has ever dispensed justice, nor \nthe way it should. Court review allowed under current law that relies \non the findings of such a flawed system falls well short of the \nindependent review that our system of checks and balances demands.\n  Restoring habeas would send a clear message that when we promote \ndemocracy and the importance of human rights to the rest of the world, \nwe are practicing what we preach. I have heard so many speeches on the \nfloor of this body--and I agree with them--criticizing other countries \nfor doing what we have done. How do we go to these other countries and \nsay: You can't do this. And they say: But you do it. And we say: Oh, \nwell, that was the war on terror; we are facing this great threat, so \nwe have to do it, but you shouldn't do it. Well, we need to listen to \nour military leaders and our foreign policy specialists on this point \nwho disagree with what we have done.\n  The former Navy Judge Advocate General Donald Guter told the \nJudiciary Committee in May that by stripping even our enemies of basic \nrights, we are providing a pretext to those who capture our troops or \nour civilians to deny them basic rights. What do we say the next time \nan American civilian, lawfully in another country, is picked up and \ndetained and not even allowed to raise the point that they picked up \nthe wrong person, and we go to that country, and they say: Hey, wait a \nminute, that is what you do in your country; don't preach to us. Your \nAmerican citizen is going to stay behind bars. We are just doing to you \nwhat you are allowed to do to us.\n  William H. Taft IV, former Deputy Secretary of Defense under \nPresident George H. W. Bush, and a former State Department adviser in \nthe current administration, told us that stripping the courts of habeas \njurisdiction sacrificed an important opportunity to enhance the \ncredibility of our detention system. Restoring habeas to detainees will \nimprove our strategic and diplomatic positions in the world and remove \na rallying point for our enemies.\n  The right to habeas corpus is a limited right. Habeas, as I said \nbefore, does not give a person the right to a trial. It does not give a \nhabeas petitioner a right to personally appear in court. It most \ncertainly does not mean that U.S. service men and women will be pulled \nfrom the battlefield to testify in such proceedings, notwithstanding \nthe alarmist comments made on the other side of the aisle. All the \nGovernment must do to defeat a habeas claim is demonstrate to a judge \nby a preponderance of the evidence that the detainee is being lawfully \nheld. That is all.\n  Most habeas petitions are rejected by the Federal courts without the \nneed to call a single witness. I certainly knew that when I was a \nprosecutor. Any time I ever sent anybody to prison for more than a \nyear, I knew there would be half a dozen habeas petitions filed. They \nwould usually be denied without even ever having called a single \nwitness. In fact, habeas petitions can be, and routinely are, disposed \nof in Federal court based on a single affidavit by a Government agent \nexplaining the basis for detention. I simply sent over an affidavit \nshowing the date and time of conviction to the court clerks. That is \nall I had to do. Habeas simply provides an opportunity for a detainee \nto argue to an independent Federal judge that he or she is being held \nin error. If the detainee is properly held, the Government can easily \novercome that claim. The distinguished Presiding Officer was a \ndistinguished U.S. attorney. He understands very well that point.\n\n  Recent history makes clear that restoring habeas will not invite \nhabeas litigation from abroad, as some have claimed. The Supreme Court \nfound habeas jurisdiction at Guantanamo Bay because Guantanamo is, for \nall intents and purposes, a U.S. territory. U.S. courts have found no \nhabeas jurisdiction in the case of enemies captured, detained, and held \nin Iraq. There was no flood of international habeas petitions following \nthe 2004 Rasul decision validating the extension of habeas rights at \nGuantanamo, and there is not going to be if habeas is restored now.\n  Guantanamo detainees had habeas rights until those rights were \nconclusively taken away last year. Between 2002 and late 2006, these \nclaims were handled by judges in the U.S. District Court in Washington, \nDC. The judges in that court released no detainees, and they issued no \norders compelling the Government to alter the detainees' conditions of \nconfinement. Habeas is a necessary and appropriate check on executive \npower, but it is a far cry from a get-out-of-jail-free card.\n  Opponents of habeas restoration suggest other countries will not open \ntheir courts to petitions from enemy aliens. But if a foreign country \nimprisoned an American, as I said before--say an aid worker or a nurse \nor a civilian contract employee--and held that person without any \ncharge as a combatant, or simply said: We are going to ``determine'' \nwhether that person is a combatant because he or she has supported the \nU.S. military, for example, or had a ``Support Our Troops'' sticker on \ntheir car, the U.S. Government would surely demand that American have a \nchance to go to court. Our consul would be down there immediately \ndemanding that. What kind of a reaction would there be in this country \nif we read in the paper where another country said: No, you have no \nright to challenge the fact that we picked them up; you have no right \nto challenge even that we picked up the wrong person. When we screamed \nabout that in editorials all over this country saying how horrible that \nis, they would simply answer: We are just doing what you do. By denying \nbasic rights to alien detainees, we encourage other nations to do the \nsame to American civilians, and they will. They will. That is why we \nhear from so many of our military, so many distinguished people that we \nshould change this.\n  Critics of the Specter-Leahy bill also point to released detainees \nwho they assert went back to the battlefield, as a reason not to \nrestore habeas rights. But the truth is that those Guantanamo detainees \nwho have been released since 9/11 have been freed by the military \nfollowing its own process, not by Federal judges on habeas review.\n  The critics' assertions that habeas proceedings in Federal court will \nsomehow lead to the sharing of classified information with terrorists \nis\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\ncockamamie. It is merely fear-mongering. This argument demeans our \nFederal judiciary. It ignores the procedures established by Congress to \nensure that classified information is safeguarded in Federal \nproceedings. Federal judges have significant discretion in determining \nwhat kinds of evidence to consider, what witnesses, if any, to allow \nfor a habeas claim. Many detainee habeas claims could be resolved with \nno recourse to classified documents at all. Where classified evidence \nis relevant, all Federal judges are cleared to view such information, \nand they are well equipped to deal with it without compromising \nnational security.\n  We must not succumb to baseless, fear-driven arguments. The sky will \nnot fall if we vote to restore habeas. Quite the contrary: Congress \nwill take a positive step toward returning to our core American values \nof liberty, due process, and checks and balances. In doing so, we will \nincrease America's security and bolster our place in the world. That is \nwhy this amendment has support from across the political and \nideological spectrum.\n  I thank Senator Dodd, Senator Menendez, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nLevin, and Senator Specter for coming to the floor and eloquently \ncalling for a return to basic American values and the rule of law.\n  Yesterday, 41 Republicans voted to filibuster a bill that would have \ngiven to hundreds of thousands of residents of the District of Columbia \nthe fundamental right to vote for Congress--the District of Columbia, \nwhich has roughly the same population as my own State of Vermont. I \nhope they will not follow that sad day with a filibuster today of \nlegislation to restore the fundamental right of someone held by the \nGovernment without any charge to at least go to court and ask why.\n  The most daunting challenge in the age of terrorism is to strike the \nproper balance between maintaining our national security against very \nreal threats but also preserving the liberties that are the proudest \nlegacy of our Founders. It is our Founders who were willing to risk \ncapture and hanging to bring about a nation based on the principles \nthat you, Mr. President, and I have always supported and which we \nsupported in our oath of office.\n  More than ever, especially in the wake of September 11, we have to \nremain vigilant against security threats, but let's never forget that \nour values are the foundation that makes our Nation strong. Now is the \ntime to reaffirm those values, to be renewing this country's \nfundamental, longstanding commitment to habeas corpus review. I urge \nevery Senator to support the Specter-Leahy amendment to restore habeas \ncorpus.\n  Mr. President, I wish Members would look at those who support this. \nSupport from this amendment goes across the political spectrum, from \nthe American Conservative Union to liberal groups, to some of our \nleading citizens, including former Secretary of State Powell and others \nwho have spoken out for this. We should pass this amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have been talking with Senator McCain, \nand it is our understanding the agreement now is the Graham amendment, \nwhich would be next in order under the previous UC, would be laid aside \ntemporarily--we think we are making some progress on working out that \namendment--and then we would now have Senator Webb recognized to \nintroduce his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend from Michigan. \nWe would like to get a time agreement on debate on the Webb amendment, \nbut I do not know how many speakers we have on our side. We will be \nproposing an amendment that has been put together by my other colleague \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner, as a sort of side-by-side effect.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, for working on an \namendment that I think expresses very clearly we all want all our \ntroops home. We understand the stress and the strain that has been \ninflicted on the men and women in the military--and the Guard and \nReserves--and we admire the motivation and the commitment of Senator \nWebb from Virginia. We are, obviously, in opposition to his amendment \nand think his colleague from Virginia has an alternative idea that \nexpresses the will of practically all of us to relieve this burden on \nthe men and women in the military.\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\n  So I wish to thank my friend from Michigan, and I also wish to say \nagain, hopefully, within a relatively short period of time we can get a \ntime agreement on debate and vote as soon as possible on this issue. \nThis same amendment has been debated before in the Senate and it is \npretty well known to our colleagues, although it is very clear that \nmany want to speak on it because of its importance.\n  So I thank my friend from Michigan and both Senators from Virginia, \nfor whom I have the greatest respect, and we will look forward to a \nrather unusual situation here in the Senate--a vote on a resolution by \none Senator from Virginia and a resolution from another Senator from \nVirginia on the same issue. I look forward to this debate. I know it \nwill be both educational and, I hope, enlightening and informative not \nonly to our colleagues but to the American people.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside and that Senator Webb be recognized to \noffer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I would not object, \nbut I ask my friend from Michigan, will the vote on this amendment have \na 60-vote requirement?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that is the intention, as part of a unanimous-\nconsent agreement. It is my understanding that is the intent, however, \nthat will be part of a larger UC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I assume you are calling on this particular \nSenator from Virginia.\n  I rise to offer, along with Senator Hagel, as the lead Republican \ncosponsor, and 35 of my colleagues a bipartisan amendment that speaks \ndirectly to the welfare of our servicemembers and their families.\n  I have learned from Senator McCain's comments that Senator Warner \nwill be offering a side-by-side amendment that goes to the sense of the \nCongress rather than the will of the Congress, and I would like to \nstate emphatically at the outset this is a situation that calls for the \nwill of the Congress. It calls for the Congress to step in and act as, \nif nothing else, an intermediary in a situation that is causing our men \nand women in uniform a great deal of stress and which again calls for \nus in the Congress to do something about this.\n  We have been occupying Iraq for more than 4 years--more than 4\\1/2\\ \nyears. During that time, it is sensible to assume our policies could \nmove toward operational strategies that take into account the number of \ntroops who are available rather than simply moving from one option to \nanother, one so-called strategy to another, and continually going to \nthe well and asking our troops to carry out these policies. This \namendment would provide a safety net to our men and women in uniform by \nproviding a minimum and more predictable time for them to rest and \nretrain before again deploying.\n  If you are a member of the regular military, this amendment basically \nsays that as long as you have been gone, you deserve to have that much \ntime at home. This is a 1-to-1 ratio we are trying to push. Many of our \nunits and our individuals are below that, even when the Department of \nDefense's stated goal and the restated goal of the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps not long ago was to move back to 2 to 1. In other words, \nour troops right now are being deployed in environments, many of them, \nwhere they are spending more time in Iraq than they are spending at \nhome, when traditionally they should have twice as much time in their \nhome environments to refurbish their units, retrain, get to know their \nfamilies, and then continue to serve their country. For the Guard and \nReserve, we have a provision in here that would require that no member \nor unit be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within 3 years of a previous \ndeployment.\n  I would like to emphasize this amendment is within the Constitution. \nThere have been a number of Members, including the Senator from \nArizona, who have stated publicly this is blatantly unconstitutional. \nIt is well within the Constitution, and I read from article I, section \n8:\n\n       The Congress has the power to make rules for the government \n     and regulation of the land and naval forces.\n\n  This constitutional authority has been employed many times in the \npast, most significantly during the Korean war, when the administration \nin charge at the time was sending soldiers to Korea before they had \nbeen adequately trained. The Congress stepped in under that provision \nof article I, section 8 and mandated that no one be deployed overseas \nuntil they had at least 120 days of training. We are doing essentially \nthe same thing in terms of a protective measure for the troops of our \nmilitary but on the other end. We are saying, as long as you have been \ndeployed, you deserve to have that much time at home.\n  This amendment is responsible. It has been drafted with great care. \nWe have put waivers that would apply to unusual circumstances into it. \nThe President can waive the limitations of this amendment in the event \nof an operational emergency posing a threat to vital national security \ninterests. People who want to go back, can go back. It does not stop \nanyone from volunteering to return if they want to waive this \nprovision.\n  I have spoken with Secretary Gates, spoken with him at some length \nlast week. I listened to his concerns. We put in two additional \nprovisions in this amendment to react to the concerns the Secretary of \nDefense raised. The first is a 120-day enactment period, which is \ndifferent from the way this amendment was introduced in July. In other \nwords, the Department of Defense would have 120 days from the passage \nof this legislation in order to make appropriate plans and adjust to \nthe provisions.\n  I also have a provision in this bill that would exempt the special \noperations units from the requirements of the amendment. Special \noperations units are highly selective, their operational tempos are \nunpredictable, and we believe it is appropriate they be exempted.\n  This amendment is not only constitutional, not only responsible, but \nit is needed. It is needed in a way that transcends politics. After \n4\\1/2\\ years in the environment in Iraq, it is time we put into place \noperational policies that sensibly take care of the people we are \ncalling upon to go again and again.\n  That is one reason why the Military Officers Association of America \ntook the unusual step to actually endorse this amendment. The Military \nOfficers Association of America is not like the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, not like the American Legion. They rarely step into the middle of \npolitical issues. But this organization, which comprises 368,000 \nmembers, military officers, took the step of sending a letter of \nendorsement for this amendment, calling upon us in the Congress to \nbecome better stewards of the men and women who are serving.\n  It is beyond politics in another way. We are asking our men and women \nin uniform to bear a disproportionate sacrifice as the result of these \nmultiple extended combat deployments with inadequate time at home. We \nowe them greater predictability.\n  This is this week's issue of the Army Times. The cover story in the \nArmy Times this week talks about brigade redeployments, who has gone \nthe most, who has gone the least, who is going next. At least eight of \nthe Army's active combat teams have deployed three or four times \nalready. These are year or 15-month deployments. Another six, including \nthree from the 101st Airborne, leave this month for either round three \nor round four.\n  There is one brigade in the 10th Mountain Division, which is now \nnearing the end of its 15-month deployment, that is on its fourth \ndeployment. When these soldiers return in November, they will have \nserved 40 months since December 2001. That is about two-thirds of the \ntime we have been engaged since December 2001. This amendment is needed \nfor another reason, and that is that it has become clearer since the \ntestimony of General Petraeus and Admiral Crocker that the debate on \nour numbers in Iraq and our policy in Iraq is going to continue for \nsome time. We have divisions here in the Senate. We have divisions \nbetween the administration and the Congress. We are trying to find a \nformula, the right kind of a formula that can undo\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\nwhat I and many others believe was a grave strategic error in going \ninto Iraq in the first place. But we have to have this debate sensibly. \nIn the meantime, because this debate is going to continue for some \ntime, we need to put a safety net under our troops who are being called \nupon to go to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I noted with some irony on Monday, as I was presiding, when the \nRepublican leader expressed his view that it would not be an unnatural \noccurrence for us to be in Iraq for the next 50 years. This comparison \nto Korea and Western Europe is being made again and again.\n  I go back to 5 years ago this month when I wrote an editorial for the \nWashington Post, 6 months before we invaded Iraq. One of the comments I \nmade in this editorial 5 years ago was that there is no end point, \nthere is no withdrawal plan from the people who have brought us to this \nwar, because they do not intend to withdraw.\n  I said that 5 years ago. It is rather stunning to hear that ratified \nopenly now by people in the administration and by others who have \nsupported this endeavor. We need to engage in that debate. We need to \ncome to some sort of agreement about what our posture is going to be in \nthe Middle East. And, as we have that debate, it is vitally important \nthat we look after the well-being of the men and women who are being \ncalled upon, again and again, to serve.\n  We are seeing a number of predictable results from these constant \ndeployments. We are seeing fallen retention among experienced combat \nveterans. We are seeing soldiers and marines--either retained on active \nduty beyond their enlistments in the ``Stop Loss'' program or being \nrecalled from active duty after their enlistments are over--being sent \nagain to Iraq or Afghanistan. We are seeing statistics on increased \ndifficulties in marital situations and mental health issues.\n  There was a quote in this week's Army Times by one Army division's \nsergeant major who was saying:\n\n       After the second deployment, it's hard to retain our \n     Soldiers. They have missed all the first steps, they've \n     missed all the birthdays; they've missed all the \n     anniversaries.\n\n  I have seen that again and again with people I have known throughout \ntheir young lifetimes. One young man who is a close friend of my son \njust returned with an army unit, back for his second tour in Iraq. One \nof his comments at his going-away party was: 15-month deployments mean \ntwo Thanksgivings, two Christmases, two birthdays.\n  What we are trying to do with this amendment is to bring a sense of \nresponsibility among the leadership of our country in terms of how we \nare using our people. It is an attempt to move beyond politics as the \npolitics of the situation are sorted out. Again, it is constitutional, \nit is responsible, it has been drafted with care, it is needed beyond \npolitics. I hope those in this body will step forward and support it to \nthe point that it could become law.\n  I note my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, has arrived, my \nprincipal cosponsor, for whom I have great regard. He and I have worked \non many issues over nearly 30 years. I am grateful to be standing with \nhim today and I yield my time and hope the Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2909 to amendment no. 2011\n\n  Mr. President, I had assumed the amendment was called up by the \nchairman. I erred. I ask amendment No. 2909 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Webb] for himself, Mr. Reid, \n     Mr. Hagel, Mr. Levin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Smith, Mr. Obama, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Brown, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Tester, Mrs. \n     McCaskill, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Mikulski, \n     Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Carper, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n     Akaka, and Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered 2909.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To specify minimum periods between deployment of units and \n members of the Armed Forces deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom and \n                      Operation Enduring Freedom)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1031. MINIMUM PERIODS BETWEEN DEPLOYMENT FOR UNITS AND \n                   MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES DEPLOYED FOR \n                   OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND OPERATION ENDURING \n                   FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress expresses its grateful thanks to the men and \n     women of the Armed Forces of the United States for having \n     served their country with great distinction under enormously \n     difficult circumstances since September 11, 2001.\n       (2) The all-volunteer force of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States is bearing a disproportionate share of national \n     wartime sacrifice, and, as stewards of this national \n     treasure, Congress must not place that force at unacceptable \n     risk.\n       (3) The men and women members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States and their families are under enormous strain \n     from multiple, extended combat deployments to Iraq and \n     Afghanistan.\n       (4) Extended, high-tempo deployments to Iraq and \n     Afghanistan have adversely affected the readiness of non-\n     deployed Army and Marine Corps units, thereby jeopardizing \n     their capability to respond quickly and effectively to other \n     crises or contingencies in the world, and complicating the \n     all-volunteer policy of recruitment, as well as the \n     retention, of career military personnel.\n       (5) Optimal time between operational deployments, commonly \n     described as ``dwell time'', is critically important to allow \n     members of the Armed Forces to readjust from combat \n     operations, bond with families and friends, generate more \n     predictable operational tempos, and provide sufficient time \n     for units to retrain, reconstitute, and assimilate new \n     members.\n       (6) It is the goal of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     to achieve an optimal minimum period between the previous \n     deployment of a unit or member of a regular component of the \n     Armed Forces and a subsequent deployment of such a unit or \n     member that is equal to or longer than twice the period of \n     such previous deployment, commonly described as a 1:2 \n     deployment-to-dwell ratio.\n       (7) It is the goal of the Department of Defense that units \n     and members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States should not be mobilized continuously for \n     more than one year, and that a period of five years should \n     elapse between the previous deployment of such a unit or \n     member and a subsequent deployment of such unit or member.\n       (8) In support of continuous operations in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and other contested areas, the Army has been \n     required to deploy units and members to Iraq for 15 months \n     with a 12-month dwell-time period between deployments, \n     resulting in a less than 1:1 deployment-to-dwell ratio.\n       (9) In support of continuous operations in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and other contested areas, the Marine Corps \n     currently is deploying units and members to Iraq for \n     approximately seven months, with a seven-month dwell-time \n     period between deployments, but it is not unusual for \n     selected units and members of the Marine Corps to be deployed \n     with less than a 1:1 deployment-to-dwell ratio.\n       (10) In support of continuous operations in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and other contested areas, the Department of \n     Defense has relied upon the reserve components of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States to a degree that is unprecedented \n     in the history of the all-volunteer force. Units and members \n     of the reserve components are frequently mobilized and \n     deployed for periods beyond the stated goals of the \n     Department.\n       (11) The Commander of the Multi-National Force-Iraq \n     recently testified to Congress that he would like Soldiers, \n     Marines, and other forces have more time with their families \n     between deployments, a reflection of his awareness of the \n     stress and strain placed on United States ground forces, in \n     particular, and on other high-demand, low-density assets, by \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (b) Minimum Period for Units and Members of the Regular \n     Components.--\n       (1) In general.--No unit or member of the Armed Forces \n     specified in paragraph (3) may be deployed for Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom (including \n     participation in the NATO International Security Assistance \n     Force (Afghanistan)) unless the period between the deployment \n     of the unit or member is equal to or longer than the period \n     of such previous deployment.\n       (2) Sense of congress on optimal minimum period between \n     deployments.--It is the sense of Congress that the optimal \n     minimum period between the previous deployment of a unit or \n     member of the Armed Forces specified in paragraph (3) to \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and a \n     subsequent deployment of the unit or member to Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom should be equal \n     to or longer than twice the period of such previous \n     deployment.\n       (3) Covered units and members.--The units and members of \n     the Armed Forces specified in this paragraph are as follows:\n       (A) Units and members of the regular Army.\n       (B) Units and members of the regular Marine Corps.\n       (C) Units and members of the regular Navy.\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\n       (D) Units and members of the regular Air Force.\n       (E) Units and members of the regular Coast Guard.\n       (c) Minimum Period for Units and Members of the Reserve \n     Components.--\n       (1) In general.--No unit or member of the Armed Forces \n     specified in paragraph (3) may be deployed for Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom (including \n     participation in the NATO International Security Assistance \n     Force (Afghanistan)) if the unit or member has been deployed \n     at any time within the three years preceding the date of the \n     deployment covered by this subsection.\n       (2) Sense of congress on mobilization and optimal minimum \n     period between deployments.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that--\n       (A) the units and members of the reserve components of the \n     Armed Forces should not be mobilized continuously for more \n     than one year; and\n       (B) the optimal minimum period between the previous \n     deployment of a unit or member of the Armed Forces specified \n     in paragraph (3) to Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation \n     Enduring Freedom and a subsequent deployment of the unit or \n     member to Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring \n     Freedom should be five years.\n       (3) Covered units and members.--The units and members of \n     the Armed Forces specified in this paragraph are as follows:\n       (A) Units and members of the Army Reserve.\n       (B) Units and members of the Army National Guard.\n       (C) Units and members of the Marine Corps Reserve.\n       (D) Units and members of the Navy Reserve.\n       (E) Units and members of the Air Force Reserve.\n       (F) Units and members of the Air National Guard.\n       (G) Units and members of the Coast Guard Reserve.\n       (d) Inapplicability to Special Operations Forces.--The \n     limitations in subsections (b) and (c) shall not apply with \n     respect to forces that are considered special operations \n     forces for purposes of section 167(i) of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n       (e) Waiver by the President.--The President may waive the \n     limitation in subsection (b) or (c) with respect to the \n     deployment of a unit or member of the Armed Forces specified \n     in such subsection if the President certifies to Congress \n     that the deployment of the unit or member is necessary to \n     meet an operational emergency posing a threat to vital \n     national security interests of the United States.\n       (f) Waiver by Miliary Chief of Staff or Commandant for \n     Voluntary Mobilizations.--\n       (1) Army.--With respect to the deployment of a member of \n     the Army who has voluntarily requested mobilization, the \n     limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be waived by the \n     Chief of Staff of the Army (or the designee of the Chief of \n     Staff of the Army).\n       (2) Navy.--With respect to the deployment of a member of \n     the Navy who has voluntarily requested mobilization, the \n     limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be waived by the \n     Chief of Naval Operations (or the designee of the Chief of \n     Naval Operations).\n       (3) Marine corps.--With respect to the deployment of a \n     member of the Marine Corps who has voluntarily requested \n     mobilization, the limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be \n     waived by the Commandant of the Marine Corps (or the designee \n     of the Commandant of the Marine Corps).\n       (4) Air force.--With respect to the deployment of a member \n     of the Air Force who has voluntarily requested mobilization, \n     the limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be waived by the \n     Chief of Staff of the Air Force (or the designee of the Chief \n     of Staff of the Air Force).\n       (5) Coast guard.--With respect to the deployment of a \n     member of the Coast Guard who has voluntarily requested \n     mobilization, the limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be \n     waived by the Commandant of the Coast Guard (or the designee \n     of the Commandant of the Coast Guard).\n       (g) Effective Date.--In order to afford the Department of \n     Defense sufficient time to plan and organize the \n     implementation of the provisions of this section, the \n     provisions of this section shall go into effect 120 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge my friend, the junior \nSenator from Virginia, and also recognize his leadership, not just on \nthis issue that he has framed over the last few minutes on which the \nSenate will be voting, as we did in July, but his years of \ncontributions to this country--specifically his efforts on behalf of \nour military. I think most of us recognize the distinguished record of \nSenator Jim Webb, that service to his country. We appreciate that, and \nin particular his leadership on this amendment is important.\n  Senator Webb and I wrote this amendment many months ago. We \nintroduced it on the floor of the Senate in July. We received 56 \nbipartisan votes for it. As Senator Webb has noted in his explanation \nof what this amendment does, it is relevant to our Armed Forces, to our \ncountry, and to our future. I wish to take a little time to expand on a \ncouple of the points Senator Webb has made.\n  First, a democracy of 300 million people, the greatest democracy in \nthe world, the oldest living democracy in the world, finds itself in a \nsituation today where we are asking about 1 percent of our citizens to \ncarry all the burden, make all the sacrifices. We will be dealing with \nthis issue for many years to come, because the consequences of what has \nbeen going on are that we are doing great damage to our military force \nstructure, great damage to our Army and our Marines.\n  Senator Webb noted some examples. These are not isolated episodes. \nThe fact is, you cannot grind down your people, you cannot grind down \nyour force structure as we have been doing to our force structure over \nthe last years--redeployment after redeployment, and longer and longer \ndeployments.\n  We know, because our generals and admirals tell us, that this will \ncome to an end sometime next spring, the rate of redeployments. Why is \nthat the case? That is the case because we can't sustain the force \nstructure we have assigned in Iraq today. It is not because I say it or \nSenator Webb says it, but our professional military leaders say it.\n  It doesn't do us much good to go back and review the mistakes we have \nmade over the last 5 years, first when we invaded and occupied a \ncountry. The fact is, we never had enough force structure in that \ncountry. Many Senators, including the distinguished ranking Republican \non the Armed Services Committee, our friend John McCain, noted that. He \nstill talks about it, as many of us do. This administration refused to \ntake the counsel of the then Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General \nEric Shinseki, when he, in open hearing before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, was asked the question: What will it take, General, \nto invade, occupy, and help stabilize Iraq? He said it would take \nhundreds of thousands of American forces.\n  He was right. He was right. But this administration chose not to \nlisten to the Chief of Staff of the Army, who knew far more about the \ndetails of manpower requirements than anyone in the White House.\n  We are not going to go back and unwind all that series of bad \ndecisions. We are where we are, and we are in a mess in Iraq today by \nany dynamic, any measurement, any qualifications. We heard about that, \nI think in some detail, as we probed General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker's testimony last week--two distinguished Americans. General \nPetraeus and Ambassador Crocker are two of our best. But the military \ndoesn't set policy. The civilian leadership sets policy. So we hand \nthat off to the military. They salute; they say, Yes, sir. Now, you go \nimplement the policy.\n  What we are addressing in this amendment is not only a basic \ncomponent of fairness in how you treat your people--because, after all, \nas we know, it is people who represent the greatest resource of an \ninstitution, of a country, of a society. When you grind those people \ndown to a point where they just cannot be effective, but when the \nmorale is gone, when they leave the institution as we are seeing happen \nin the Army and Marines, when you are 15,000 short of Army captains and \nlieutenant colonels and majors, and senior enlisted, and story after \nstory--every Senator in this body can relate these specific stories \nlike I had in my office yesterday. A Marine Corps officer, couple of \nyears in Iraq, 14 years in the Marines, got out. He loved the Marines. \nIt pulled his heart out to leave the Marines.\n  I said, Why did you leave?\n  He said, Sir, I tried to balance my family life. The last time I got \nback from Iraq my youngest daughter said, Daddy, I am going to tape you \nto the refrigerator so you don't have to leave again.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said in \nhis confirmation hearing a few months ago, and I quote from Admiral \nMullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:\n\n       I am concerned about the number of deployments, the time \n     when they're home--in fact, even when they are home, there's \n     training associated with that, so they spend\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\n     weeks, if not months, out of their own house, again, away \n     from their families, and I believe we've got to relieve that.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the new Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. So, are we really asking so much here when we say that \nour brave fighting men and women, who are bearing all the burden, \ncarrying all the sacrifice for this country, that 1 percent of our \nsociety, that we say they ought to have at least the same amount of \ndowntime off as they serve in a war zone in combat? Is that outrageous?\n  We in this town are very good at abstractions. We talk about \npolicies. We act like moving men and brigades in combat--that somehow \nthis is a chess game. Somehow these people are objects.\n  No, humanity is always the underlying dynamic of the world and life \nand it always will be. As Senator Webb has often said: Who speaks for \nthe military? The National spokesmen.\n  Their leaders are appointed by the President. They have spokesmen, \nthey are Governors, if no one else. But who speaks for the rifleman? \nWho speaks for the people whom we ask to go fight and die and their \nfamilies?\n  Now, let's be very clear about another issue. As Senator Webb has \nnoted, this certainly is within the constitutional authority and \nresponsibility of the Congress of the United States. Senator Webb said \narticle I of the Constitution is about the Congress. Section 8 of the \nConstitution, in article I, speaks specifically to Congress's \nresponsibilities. We can have disagreements about policies and \nstrategies, and that is appropriate, should be, absolutely, in a \ndemocracy. But let's not be confused about our responsibilities as \nwell.\n  The fact is, as General Shinseki warned us in his comments before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee before we invaded Iraq, that it would \ntake hundreds of thousands of American soldiers.\n  What has happened is we have a mission that does not match our \nmanpower capabilities. So what is this administration's answer? Keep \ngrinding down the people out there who have been fighting and dying. \nKeep grinding them down more because we do not have any choice. Are you \ngoing to suit the Boy Scouts up on the weekends?\n  Where is the manpower going to come from? So the easy answer is--\nbecause who speaks for the rifleman? Who speaks for the military? You \nkeep asking them to do more. You keep pushing more down on them.\n  By the way, the so-called surge the President of the United States \nannounced to America in January--by the way, I do not find the term \n``surge'' in any military manuals. Surge is not a policy, it is not a \nstrategy, it is a tactic.\n  But the President said: This is temporary. That escalation of troops, \nthat 30,000 more troops on top of the 130,000 troops they already had \nover there, that is temporary. Because we are going to buy time for the \nIraqi Government to find an accommodation so there can be political \nreconciliation. In the end, that is all that counts. As General \nPetraeus and everybody, every one of our great generals has said, there \nis no military solution in Iraq.\n  General Petraeus and every general has said that. They know it better \nthan anyone knows it. The only solution in Iraq is going to come from, \nmust come from, some political accommodation resulting in a political \nreconciliation.\n  So let's buy more time, let's grind those guys down more. Well, it \nwill automatically come to some kind of an end. But in the process, \nwhat are we doing to our society, to our country, to our Armed Forces, \nthat is going to take years to rebuild, just as General Schwarzkopf and \nGeneral Powell and other great generals after Vietnam, they stayed in \nthe military and rebuilt the military after what we had done to it \nduring Vietnam.\n  This is a very modest step forward, of clear thinking. This is \nrelevant. It is rational. This has at least a modicum of humanity in \nit. If we do not take these steps, the consequences we are going to \ncontinue to face are going to be severe.\n  I know the questions, the concerns on the other side of this issue \nare appropriate. Is this not a back-door way of trying to micromanage \nthe war, micromanage our force structure? Well, the fact is, as I have \nalready noted, we have inverted the logic. In order to carry out a \nmission or a policy or strategy, you have to match the resources for \nthat. Those resources were never matched to that mission.\n  So the easy answer for all of us in Washington, and 99 percent of the \nAmerican people, is: Well, let those guys over there do more. So we \nhave 15-month deployments, in some cases they are 18-month deployments, \nin some cases they are longer than that. So what if they go over there \nthree times.\n  That is not a good enough answer. That is a failed answer. That is \nirresponsible.\n  So I hope our colleagues take a hard look at this, and I hope they \nwould give some intense thought to what we are doing, not only for the \nimmediate term but for the long term. This is essential for our \ncountry. This has ramifications, societal implications that go far \nbeyond our force structure.\n  I am very honored to be the original cosponsor and coauthor of this \namendment with my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I begin my comments on the pending \namendment, I think--I hope it is appropriate to mention our colleague \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Hagel, has announced his intentions not to seek \nreelection in this body.\n  I have the highest degree of affection and respect for my friend; we \nhave adjoining offices in the Russell Senate Office Building. He has \nserved this Nation in many capacities, including in combat during the \nVietnam War. I think he has been an outstanding Member of this body and \na dear friend. I will say a lot more about him in many venues, but I \nwish to express my appreciation for his outstanding service in the \nSenate, to the people of Nebraska, and to this country.\n  On July 11 of this year, I spoke against Senator Webb's amendment on \ndwell time, as it is now called. The amendment has not changed \nsubstantially since then. I thought the debate at the time was \ncomprehensive and adequately addressed the merits of the proposal. But \nhere we are again. Here we are again. Why?\n  In July, Senator Webb said:\n\n       This is an amendment that is focused squarely on supporting \n     our troops who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan; it \n     speaks directly to their welfare and the needs of their \n     families by establishing minimum periods between deployments.\n\n  More recently, he has called it a ``safety net for the troops.'' I \nhave no doubt of Senator Webb's sincerity and his concern for our \nground troops and their families. No one in this body has served his \nfamily more honorably than Senator Webb.\n\n  I share Senator Webb's concerns for the well-being of our troops and \ntheir families, as I know all Senators do. But let me be clear: Senator \nWebb's amendment is not a litmus test for whether you care about the \ntroops. Would it not be great if our choices were that easy.\n  I argued back in July, and I repeat today, that the amendment would \ndo more harm than good and should not pass. But the question remains: \nWhy are we arguing again? Why are we arguing again about this proposal?\n  Unfortunately, the reason is obvious. It was spelled out in a New \nYork Times article on September 15, by David Herszenhorn and David \nCloud, who stated:\n\n       The proposal by Senator Webb has strong support from top \n     Democrats who say that the practical effect would be to add \n     time between deployments and force General Petraeus to \n     withdraw troops on a substantially swifter timeline than the \n     one he laid out before Congress this week.\n\n  Senator Biden was quoted in the article as calling the proposal the \n``easiest way for his Republican colleagues to change the war \nstrategy,'' to change the war strategy. The reporters referred to the \namendment as a ``backdoor approach'' aimed at influencing the conduct \nof the war. That is what this amendment is about.\n  I say to my colleagues, I will say it again and again, the \nPresident's present strategy is succeeding. If you want the troops out, \nsupport the present mission, support the mission that is succeeding. \nDon't say you support the troops when you do not support their mission. \nExcuse me, I support you but not the mission you are\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\nembarking on today as you go out and put your life and limb on the line \nin a surge that is succeeding--that is succeeding.\n  We will have a lot of discussion on the floor of this body about the \nMaliki Government and the national police and the other challenges we \nhave, but the military side of this is succeeding. This goes at the \nheart, this goes at the heart of the surge that is showing success in \nAnbar Province, in Baghdad, and other parts of Iraq.\n  Now, maybe someone does not agree with that. Maybe that is the point. \nBut the effect of this amendment--the effect of this amendment--would \nbe to emasculate this surge. That is why the Secretary of Defense, Mr. \nGates, sent a letter to my colleague, Senator Graham, which I intend to \nquote from in a minute. So what is this debate about? This debate is \nabout whether we will force, as Senator Biden was quoted, as the \neasiest way for his Republican colleagues to change the war strategy, \nthis backdoor approach aimed at influencing the conduct of the war.\n  Not only that, it is blatantly unconstitutional. Are we going to \nhave, in conflicts the American people engage in--if it is unpopular \nwith the American people, the way the Korean war was unpopular--and \nsomehow designate who should stay and who should not and how long?\n  That is a micromanagement of the military that is very difficult to \ncomprehend. The President is the Commander in Chief because he is the \nCommander in Chief. Nowhere in the Goldwater-Nickles bill, nowhere in \nthe Constitution do I see the role for Congress to play in determining \nthe parameters under which the men and women who have enlisted and are \nserving in the military, in an enterprise which the majority of this \nbody voted to support, being embarked on.\n  Secretary Gates echoed this assessment last weekend in various \ninterviews, stating the Webb amendment is:\n\n       Really pretty much a backdoor effort to get the President \n     to accelerate the drawdown so that it is an automatic kind of \n     thing, rather than based on conditions in Iraq.\n\n  So I would say to my colleagues, let's not conceal or fail to mention \nthe intended effect or purpose of this amendment. I wish to repeat, \nevery one of us, every one of us cares about the men and women who are \nserving in the military, every single one of us on an equal basis. It \nis clear that in the wake of General Petraeus's report, the majority \nhas brought this back in order to reduce the numbers of fully trained \nand combat-experienced troops available to our military commanders and \nthus to force an accelerated drawdown of troops and units in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Why don't we be clear about that? Let's consider the impact of this \namendment on the force. The effect of the amendment would be to exclude \nfully trained, combat-experienced officers, NCOs, soldiers, and marines \nfrom military units that need them to perform in combat. I think we \nshould ask the question: Will an unintended consequence of this \namendment be to cause harm to our troops? I argued in July, as did \nvarious other Senators, that the amendment would cause harm to the \nmission, the units, and members who would have to succeed in combat \ndespite the obstacle this amendment would impose.\n  Now we have the view of Secretary Gates to consider in a letter \nregarding the Webb amendment, which without objection, Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 2007.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Thank for your recent letter \n     requesting my views on the Webb amendment.\n       I understand that the specifics of this amendment may be \n     changing so my comments are based on the version filed for \n     Senate consideration in July (the only version available \n     publicly).\n       As drafted, the amendment would dramatically limit the \n     nation's ability to respond to other national security needs \n     while we remain engaged in Iraq or Afghanistan. Although the \n     amendment language does provide the President a waiver for \n     ``operational emergencies,'' it is neither practical nor \n     desirable for the President to have to rely on waivers to \n     manage the global demands on U.S. military forces. Moreover, \n     the amendment would serve to advance the dangerous perception \n     by regional adversaries that the U.S. is tied down and \n     overextended.\n       Further, the amendment, if adopted, would impose upon the \n     President an unacceptable choice: between 1) accelerating the \n     rate of drawdown significantly beyond what General Petraeus \n     has recommended, which he and other senior military \n     commanders believe would not be prudent and would put at real \n     risk the gains we have made on the ground in Iraq over the \n     past few months, and 2) resorting to force management options \n     that would damage the force and its effectiveness in the \n     field.\n       The first choice is not acceptable. The latter choice would \n     require one or more of the following actions for units \n     deployed or deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan:\n       Extension of units already deployed beyond their current \n     scheduled rotation.\n       Creating ``gaps'' in combat capability as units would \n     rotate home without a follow-on unit being available to \n     replace them. Rearranging schedules to close such gaps would, \n     even if possible, further limit the ability to continue the \n     sound practice of overlapping unit rotations to achieve \n     smooth hand-offs and minimize casualties.\n       Increase in the use of ``in lieu of'' units that are either \n     minimally or not normally trained for the assigned mission. \n     We will always deploy trained units, but the quality, depth \n     of experience and thus combat capability associated with the \n     broader use of ``in lieu of'' forces will invariably degrade \n     combat readiness.\n       Return to the cobbling together of new units from other \n     disparate units or unassigned personnel. We have discouraged \n     this practice by adopting a unit rotation policy.\n       As the options for and availability of active duty units is \n     constrained, the broader and more frequent mobilization of \n     National Guard and Reserve units would be inevitable.\n       I am told that one of the possible modifications to the \n     original amendment is to allow a transition period of a few \n     months before its requirements are binding. While transition \n     periods are generally helpful, such a modification would not \n     alleviate the damaging impact this amendment would have on \n     our military force and our efforts against violent \n     extremists.\n       In sum, the cumulative effect of the above steps necessary \n     to comply with Senator Webb's amendment, in our judgment, \n     would significantly increase the risk to our service members. \n     It would also lead to a return to unpredictable tour lengths \n     and home station periods that we have sought to eliminate for \n     our service members and their families.\n       The above impacts on managing the flow of military units \n     pale in comparison to the disruptive and harmful effects the \n     amendment would have if we have to comply with its \n     requirements at the level of each individual service member. \n     Such an approach would make it exceedingly difficult to \n     sustain unit cohesion and combat readiness.\n       Finally, the amendment would unreasonably burden the \n     President's exercise of his Constitutional authorities, \n     including his authority as Commander in Chief. In particular, \n     the amendment would hinder the President's ability to conduct \n     diplomatic, military, and intelligence activities and limit \n     his ability to move military forces as necessary to secure \n     the national security.\n       I believe that the intent of those who support this \n     amendment is honorable and motivated by a desire to advance \n     the welfare of our service members. Unfortunately, I also \n     believe the amendment would in fact result in the opposite \n     outcome while restricting our nation's ability to respond to \n     an unpredictable and increasingly dangerous world.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M. Gates.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. He said:\n\n       As drafted, the amendment would dramatically limit the \n     nation's ability to respond to other national security needs \n     while we remain engaged in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n  He said the amendment would cause the Army and Marine Corps to resort \nto force management options that would further damage the force and its \neffectiveness on the field and would result in the following actions \nfor units deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan:\n\n       Extension of units [in Iraq and Afghanistan] already \n     deployed beyond their current scheduled rotation.\n       Creating ``gaps'' in combat capability as units would \n     rotate home without a follow-on unit being available to \n     replace them.\n\n  This, in turn, would squeeze ``the ability to continue the . . . \npractice of overlapping unit rotations to achieve smooth hand-offs and \nminimize casualties.'' And minimize casualties. That seems important, \nminimizing casualties.\n  Secretary Gates goes on. The Webb amendment would:\n\n       Increase the use of `in-lieu of' units that are either \n     minimally or not normally trained for the assigned mission.\n       [Would] return to the cobbling together of new units from \n     other disparate units or unassigned personnel.\n\n  A practice discouraged by the adoption of a unit rotation policy. As \na result of the Webb amendment, it would\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\nresult in the ``broader and more frequent mobilization of National \nGuard and Reserve units [which] would be inevitable.''\n  Secretary Gates, in his letter, said the Webb amendment would impose \nan unacceptable choice upon the President and our military to either, \none, accelerate the rate of drawdown significantly beyond what General \nPetraeus has recommended, which he and all of our military commanders \nbelieve would not be prudent and would put at real risk the gains we \nhave made on the ground in Iraq in the last few months; two, resorting \nto force management options that would further damage the force and its \neffectiveness in the field.\n  Not surprisingly, Secretary Gates has stated unequivocally that if \nthis amendment were included in the authorization act, he would \nrecommend the President veto it. I urge my colleagues to reject, again, \nthe Webb amendment.\n  My friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, pointed out accurately--and \nhe has played an incredible role--the terrific mistakes made in the \nconduct of this conflict under Secretary Rumsfeld and other leaders. \nThis strategy, the Senator from Nebraska and I knew, was doomed to \nfailure. As far back as 2003, we came back from Iraq and said: This \nstrategy has to change or it is doomed to failure. As I have said, it \nwas very much like watching a train wreck. Those mistakes and errors in \nthe strategy have been well chronicled in a number of books that have \nbeen written, among them, and which I strongly recommend, ``Fiasco'' by \nTom Ricks and ``Cobra II'' by General Trainor and Michael Gordon But we \nare where we are.\n  I would be glad, along with my friends from Nebraska and Virginia, to \nchronicle those many mistakes. Those mistakes were made with \nexpressions of optimism which were, on their face, not comporting with \nthe facts on the ground in Iraq: a few dead-enders, stuff happens, last \nthroes, on and on. The fact is, the American people became frustrated, \nand they have become saddened and angry. Nothing is more moving than to \nknow the families and loved ones of those who have sacrificed, nearly \n4,000 in this conflict, not to mention the tens of thousands who have \nbeen gravely wounded. But we have a new strategy. We have success on \nthe ground.\n  As I said earlier, all of us are frustrated by the fact that the \nMaliki government has not functioned with anywhere near the \neffectiveness we need. We also acknowledge that there are portions of \nthe national police which are ``corrupt,'' which is a kind word, a kind \ndescription. But the facts were made very clear last week by the \nPresident of Iran, the President of a country that has dedicated itself \nto the extinction of Israel, a country that is developing nuclear \nweapons, a country that is exporting explosive devices of the most \nlethal kind into Iraq today that are killing young Americans. He said: \nWhen the United States of America leaves Iraq, we will fill the void. \nThat is what this conflict is now about. It may not have been that when \nwe started. The President of Iran has made Iranian intentions very \nclear. The Saudis will feel that the Sunnis have to be helped. Syria \ncontinues to try to destabilize the Government of Lebanon and continues \nto arm and equip Hezbollah. By the way, there is a standing United \nNations Security Council resolution that calls for the disarmament of \nHezbollah. Has anybody seen any effect of that lately? Jordan has \n750,000 refugees in their small country.\n  The situation as regards Afghanistan, as far as Pakistan is \nconcerned, is certainly murky at best, and perhaps we could see a \nnuclear-armed country, which Pakistan is, in the hands of people who \nmay not be friendly to the United States or interested in controlling \nthe Afghan-Pakistan border areas which are not under control now.\n  As Henry Kissinger wrote in the Washington Post over the weekend, a \nprecipitous withdrawal would have profound consequences. As GEN Jim \nJones testified, on the results of his commission, his last words were, \na precipitous withdrawal would cause harm to America's national \nsecurity interests, not only in Iraq but in the area.\n  The reason I point this out is because the effect of the Webb \namendment--and whether it is intended by the Senator from Virginia or \nnot but it is interpreted by many, including others whom I have \nquoted--would be to force precipitous withdrawal before the situation \non the ground warranted.\n  I hope we understand that America is facing a watershed situation. We \nhave grave challenges in Iraq. I believe if we set a date for \nwithdrawal or, through this backdoor method, force a date for \nwithdrawal, we will see chaos and genocide in the region, and we will \nbe back.\n  I fully acknowledge to my friends and colleagues that we have paid a \nvery heavy price in American blood and treasure because of failures for \nnearly 4 years. I understand their frustration. I understand their \nanger. But I am also hearing from the men and women serving in Iraq as \nwe speak. Always throughout this long ordeal, the most professional and \nbest- equipped and best-trained and bravest military this Nation has \never been blessed with were doing their job. They were doing their job \nunder the most arduous conditions of warfare that any American, Army \nand Marine Corps and military, has ever been engaged, ever.\n  But now in the last few months, we are hearing a different message \nfrom these brave people; that is, they believe they are succeeding. \nThey believe they are succeeding. In Anbar Province, the marines are \nwalking in downtown Ramadi, which used to be Fort Apache. Neighborhoods \nin Baghdad are safer. They are not safe, but they are safer. Al-Qaida \nis being rejected in many areas. I pointed out the difficulties in the \nother part of it, but I also believe, from my study of history, that \nwhen you have a condition of military security, it is very likely and \nmuch more possible that the commercial, social, and political process \nmoves forward in a successful fashion. I keep saying over and over: We \nhave not seen that with the Maliki government, and we have every right \nto see it. But I believe the conditions have been created, if they \nseize it, that we will also see political progress in that country.\n  I believe the people of Iraq, not wanting to be Kurds or Sunni or \nShia but Iraqis, harbor the same hopes and dreams and aspirations to \nlive in a free and open society where they can send their kids to \nschool and live in conditions of peace and harmony. That can be \nachieved over a long period of time.\n  Let me finally say that success in Iraq is long and hard and \ndifficult, but I also believe the options are far worse than to pursue \nwhat has been succeeding.\n  This amendment will probably define our role in Iraq as to how this \nwhole conflict will come out. I question no one's patriotism. I \nquestion no one's devotion to this country. I am sure there are Members \non the other side of this issue, supporting this amendment, who are \nmore dedicated than I am, perhaps. But the fact is, this is a watershed \namendment. We need to defeat it. We need to make sure these brave young \nmen and women who are now serving and succeeding have more opportunity \nto succeed and come home with honor. We all want them home. We don't \nwant to see the spectacle of another defeated military. Overstressed, \noverdeployed, weary, but not defeated--that is our military today. The \nWebb amendment could easily bring about their defeat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to yield further time to the \nSenator from New Jersey, but before doing so, I would like to respond \nto some of the things the Senator from Arizona said in his statement, \njust to clarify the intention of this amendment and the environment in \nwhich it is being offered.\n  Contrary to what the Senator from Arizona said, this amendment has \nbeen changed since July. There is a 120-day implementation provision in \nit, after my discussion with Secretary Gates. There is also an \nexclusion of special operations units from the requirements of the \namendment. There are, as always, clear waiver provisions in here which \nwould address a number of the situations Secretary Gates mentioned.\n  The Senator from Arizona may believe the impact of this amendment \nwould be to alter the strategy in Iraq, and he has made a few \nimplications\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\nthat people cannot support our military people unless they support a \npolitical mission. I don't believe that is correct. I believe it is the \nrole in American society to question missions when one believes they \nare heading in the wrong direction. I believe many of our troops have \nthat option and also exercise it. You can look at poll after poll on \nthat.\n  The one thing we can say about the U.S. military is that it has \nalways controlled the tactical battle space into which it has been put. \nWe can clearly say that in Iraq today. We can say that about other \nengagements. That is the job the military is being called upon to do.\n  When the Senator from Arizona talks about what is this debate really \nabout, to characterize this as a debate about defeat is inappropriate. \nThe narrow purpose of this amendment is not to question so much whether \nthe strategy is working but how do you feed troops into an operational \nenvironment. Where do we draw the line? I suppose we could have a \ndecision from an administration that we would put all of American \nforces in Iraq until the war was over. When does the Congress decide \nthat the policies of the executive branch have reached an imbalance? \nThis is a very modest amendment.\n  With respect to the constitutional implications, this is a tired old \nargument. I addressed it in July. I addressed it again today. There is \na third provision in article I, section 8, which clearly gives Congress \nthe authority to make these sorts of decisions.\n  Senator McCain rightly talks about the loss of qualified officers and \nNCOs. My experience, looking at the U.S. military today, is that we are \nnow losing them permanently. If you look at the retention rates from \nWest Point, they are clearly on a marked downside. That is the canary \nin the bird cage.\n  With respect to the letter of Secretary Gates, I respect Secretary \nGates. I talk with him. He is a political appointee. We can expect \npolitical answers to a number of these questions.\n  When Senator McCain speaks of the implications of withdrawal, we are \nin a box, I agree. The same implications being addressed right now for \nwithdrawal were the implications that people such as myself, General \nZinni, General Scowcroft, General Hoar, and many others with long \nnational security experience were warning about if we went in in the \nfirst place. We have a region that is on the edge of chaos. We have oil \nnow at $82 a barrel. We have a situation with the Turks, who once were \nour greatest supporters in the region, being roundly critical of the \nUnited States, complaining about guerilla activities emanating out of \nthe Kurdish areas. We need to get the Saudis to the table. We need to \naddress Iran. The only way for us to do that on a permanent basis is \nthrough aggressive diplomacy.\n  I, too, read Henry Kissinger's article last Sunday. A big portion of \nit at the end was about the need to move forward more strongly with \ndiplomacy.\n  All of those issues are legitimate. They are all going to be \nthoroughly debated. The purpose of this amendment, again, is to put a \nsafety net under our Active-Duty military and our Guard and Reserve \nwhile these debates are taking place.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the Senator from New Jersey \nwishes to speak. Perhaps the Senator from Arizona wants to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \ncomments. I would like to point out that the Senator from Virginia says \nhis amendment has a waiver associated with it, so, therefore, it should \nbe acceptable to us. I would like to quote from Secretary Gates's \nletter to Senator Graham. He says:\n\n       Although the amendment language does provide the President \n     a waiver for ``operational emergencies''--\n\n  ``Operational emergencies''--not just a waiver, but there has to be \nan operational emergency--\n\n     it is neither practical nor desirable for the President to \n     have to rely on waivers to manage the global demands on U.S. \n     military forces. Moreover, the amendment would serve to \n     advance the dangerous perception by regional adversaries that \n     the U.S. is tied down and overextended.\n\n  So I think we ought to understand what this waiver really means. Of \ncourse, Secretary Gates is a political appointee. That is the way the \nGovernment functions. But to somehow, therefore, question his judgment \nbecause he is a political appointee is inappropriate, I say to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  GEN Brent Scowcroft, whom the Senator from Virginia referred to, \nsaid: The costs of staying are visible. The costs of getting out are \nalmost never discussed. If we get out before Iraq is stable, the entire \nMiddle East region might start to resemble Iraq today. Getting out is \nnot a solution.\n  Now, that is the view of one of the most respected men in America. He \nalso was a political appointee at one time as the President's National \nSecurity Adviser. He believed very strongly we should not have gone to \nIraq, and I would be glad someday, along with Senator Webb and Senator \nHagel, to talk about all the reasons why we should or should not have. \nBut the fact we are where we are today, in his view, is very clear.\n  Now, on the issue of constitutionality, it clearly violates the \nprinciples of separation of powers. Congress has no business in wartime \npassing a law telling the Department of Defense which of its fully \ntrained troops it can and cannot use in carrying out combat operations.\n  As we all know, this dwell time provision, as I said, has been tried \nbefore. The President, when it was included in the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act, said:\n\n       [T]he micro-management in this legislation is unacceptable \n     because it would create a series of requirements that do not \n     provide the flexibility needed to conduct the war.\n       This legislation is unconstitutional because it purports to \n     direct the conduct of operations of the war in a way that \n     infringes upon the powers vested in the Presidency by the \n     Constitution, including as Commander in Chief of the Armed \n     Forces.\n\n  The Senator from Virginia referred to article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution, which gives Congress the power ``to make Rules for the \nGovernment and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.'' Well, clearly \nthat applies to pay, equipment, end strength, basing, and most of the \ntraining, equipping, and organizing functions that are vested in the \nservices under the Goldwater-Nichols Act. But the article I power \ncannot be employed to accomplish unconstitutional ends, and that would \ninclude restricting the President's authority as Commander in Chief in \nwartime to direct the movement of U.S. forces.\n  Justice Robert Jackson, who served as President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt's Attorney General, said:\n\n       The President's responsibility as Commander in Chief \n     embraces the authority to command and direct the armed forces \n     in their immediate movements and operations, designed to \n     protect the security and effectuate the defense of the United \n     States.\n\n  I submit that current policies regarding combat unit rotations, tour \nlength, and dwell time that affect our brave men and women in uniform \nfall squarely under that authority.\n  In his letter, as I mentioned before, Secretary Gates addressed this \nconstitutional question. He said:\n\n       The amendment would unreasonably burden the President's \n     exercise of his Constitutional authorities, including his \n     authority as Commander in Chief. In particular, the amendment \n     would hinder the President's ability to conduct diplomatic, \n     military, and intelligence activities and limit his ability \n     to move military forces as necessary to secure the national \n     security.\n\n  Let's consider other legislation--the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986--\nwhich fundamentally reorganized the Department of Defense and reflected \nsome serious thought about how wars ought to be conducted. The act \nsays:\n\n       Unless otherwise directed by the President, the chain of \n     command to a unified or specified command runs--\n       from the President to the Secretary of Defense; and\n       from the Secretary of Defense to the commander of the \n     combatant command.\n\n  I see no mention of Congress in that chain of command.\n  The Goldwater-Nichols Act also has a section titled \n``Responsibilities of the Combatant Commanders'' that says: The \ncommander of a combatant command is responsible to the President and to \nthe Secretary of Defense for the performance of missions assigned to \nthat command by the President or by the Secretary with the approval of \nthe President. Again, no mention of Congress in that chain of command.\n  I want to clarify to my friend from Virginia, I have--again, I \nrepeat, and I\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\nam sure I will repeat several times in the conduct of this discussion--\nI have no doubt that the intent of the Senator from Virginia is to \nrelieve this terrible burden of service that is being laid upon a few \nAmericans. He and I both know people who have been to Iraq and \nAfghanistan three and four times--an incredible level of service. The \nNational Guard has never, ever that I know of in my study of history \nborne the burden they have today. These citizen soldiers have performed \nnot only at the same level but sometimes at a higher level of our \nprofessional standing Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy. But the \nfact is, the amendment of the Senator from Virginia--I believe and am \nconvinced from my study of the Constitution, my view of the role of the \nCommander in Chief, what is at stake in Iraq, as I pointed out--will \nhave the effect of reversing what has been a successful strategy \nemployed by General Petraeus, General Odierno, and the brave men and \nwomen. I have no doubt of the intention of the Senator from Virginia in \nthis amendment, but I have great concerns and conviction that the \neffect of this amendment would have impacts that would lead to greater \nconsequences and require, eventually, over time, because of chaos in \nthe region, greater sacrifice of American blood and treasure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Webb-\nHagel amendment. Both of our colleagues have served our country not \nonly in the Senate but also in uniform, and they have done so \nhonorably. So they speak from experience, and I, for one, do not \nquestion their sincerity of purpose. I do not know how every Member of \nthe Senate will decide on how they will cast their vote, but I do not \nquestion their sincerity or the purpose of what they are driving at.\n  This is about preserving our troops, enhancing their ability, and in \nthe long term being able to continue to enlist people who want to serve \ntheir country, who bear the overwhelming burden of the national \nsecurity of the United States by a small percentage of the population. \nThat is what I believe Senator Webb is doing, and that is why I join \nhim strongly in support of his and Senator Hagel's amendment.\n  This amendment provides an important opportunity to recognize the \ncourageous efforts of our men and women in uniform. This amendment \nprovides a critical opportunity to ensure the care and safety of our \ntroops--the care and safety of our troops--now, but I would argue not \nonly now but for the long term. To those who believe this amendment is \nonly about now, to change the current course of events, I believe the \namendment has longstanding import now and for the long term. It sets \nour policy as to where we are going to be headed in the deployment of \ntroops--the respites they need, the ability for us to sustain a \nvoluntary Army under all of the circumstances.\n  This amendment provides a great opportunity for us in the Senate to \nignore politics and work together on behalf of our troops. This \namendment simply says that our troops should have at least--at least--\nthe same time at home as they spend deployed abroad. It ensures that no \nunit, including the National Guard, which is clearly citizen soldiers \nwho have been asked to do far beyond what many of them thought they \nwere ever going to be called upon to do on behalf of their Nation--they \nwould get the same treatment.\n  This amendment simply says that after 4\\1/2\\ years of bravely \nfighting for our country, we must honor the sacrifice of the troops and \ntheir families. This amendment simply says we must make sure we are \ntaking care--underline ``taking care''--of our troops. We believe we \nmust protect our troops fighting in combat now, just as we must take \ncare of our veterans when they return home from combat.\n  Let me be clear. I do not believe this amendment ties the hands of \nthe administration in the case of a clear threat to our national \nsecurity. Senator Webb has been responsive in providing a fair and \nreasonable waiver for the President, as well as a waiver for those \nindividuals in service who want to volunteer to return early. If they \nwant to return, if they feel they are ready to return, they will be \nable to do so and provide the continued leadership they have been \nproviding. I am sure many may. But the bottom line is, there are many \nwho may not feel they can do that. So, therefore, their ability to \nperform at the optimum is not being preserved under the present \ncircumstances.\n  This amendment also responds to specific concerns raised by the \nSecretary of Defense and other military leaders. It allows the \nDepartment of Defense time for a transition period, for an \nimplementation period that is well within the scope that is necessary. \nIt also provides a specific exemption for special operations forces \nsince the nature of their deployment schedule is much different.\n  So I think Senator Webb has listened and responded since the last \ntime he offered this amendment, as has Senator Hagel.\n  Now, unfortunately, the war in Iraq has taken a terrible toll on our \nmilitary. I am deeply concerned about our ground forces. I am deeply \nconcerned about severe mental health issues, such as post-traumatic \nstress syndrome, which comes out of extended and repeated deployments. \nI am deeply concerned about our ability to retain experienced \nservicemembers and our ability to recruit new forces.\n  Clearly, if someone is looking at whether to be engaged, in addition \nto their great desire to serve their country, especially if they have \nfamily, they are going to be looking at: Well, how are these \ndeployments taking place? Are they taking place in a way to respond to \nmy desire to serve but also to be able to sustain my family? That is \nwhy we have to adopt this amendment. It is about now and the long term.\n  Some here have argued that Congress should not interfere. But the \nFounding Fathers put it right up there early in the Constitution. They \ndid not wait for various later articles; they put it right up there in \narticle I. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution is where they gave \nthe Congress the right, the power ``to make Rules for the Government \nand Regulation of the land and naval Forces.''\n  I have heard other statutory references here, but none of those \nstatutory references have the power to undermine the Constitution. The \nConstitution is supreme. It comes first above all other acts. So, \ntherefore, the Founders understood how important it was for the \nCongress to have the role ``to make Rules for the Government and \nRegulation of the land and naval Forces,'' and they put it up early in \nthe Constitution to make it very clear. Those who wish to ignore or \nreject that provision of the Constitution, in my mind, undermine the \nConstitution by doing so.\n  This President often acts as if the only role for the Congress is to \nprovide a blank check for his failed war policy. I believe he is \ndefinitely wrong in believing that Congress's only role is to provide a \nblank check. That is not the role of the Congress. As a matter of fact, \nthat would be an abdication of the duties and responsibilities of the \nCongress in its role under the Constitution. We have a fiduciary \nresponsibility to the American people, both in national treasures and, \nmost importantly, in lives. We have a responsibility to the men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  This amendment before us reflects the reality on the ground and the \nwill of the American people, but most importantly the welfare of those \nsacrificing the most. I have heard a lot from our colleagues in the \ntime I have been in the Senate, and before in the House, about \nsupporting our troops. Well, we are providing here a plan to fully \nsupport our troops who volunteer to put their lives on the line for our \ncountry. Senator Webb has referred to the Military Officers \nAssociations' unusual movement or action of supporting this amendment. \nI think we need to listen to those who serve, especially when they act \nout of the norm and say: We believe this is in the interests of those \nmen and women who serve. And it comes from the association of those men \nand women who are actively engaged in serving. I have so often heard \nour colleagues say: Let's listen to those on the ground. Well, this is \na reflection of those in boots in service. Our brave troops have \nanswered the call of duty. Let us now answer the call to do what is \nright by them.\n\n[[Page S11706]]\n\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support this amendment. It goes to \nthe heart of how we truly honor those people who are serving our \ncountry, sacrificing for our country, and in my mind, when we talk \nabout supporting the troops, making sure our long-term security can be \npreserved and enhanced goes to the very core of how we are going to \ntreat them in their service. That is why I strongly support Senator \nWebb's and Senator Hagel's amendment, and I hope all of our colleagues \nwill do so as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Webb \namendment. I guess if I can pick up where my colleague from New Jersey \nleft off, what is the best thing for the Congress to do in terms of \nsupporting our troops? What are our duties? What are our obligations? I \nwould argue the worst thing the Congress can do at a time of war is to \nstart taking over operational control of deployments.\n  Many of us are up for reelection next year. This Iraq war has become \none big political commercial. There are commercials being run out \nthere--I don't know if they are on the air right at this moment, but \nevery time there is a vote in this body, a Republican in a tough State \nwill have an ad run in their State saying: Senator so-and-so has voted \nsix times not to withdraw from Iraq. There are political commercials \nbeing run around every policy debate we have regarding this war. This \nis a political consultant's dream, this war.\n  Well, this war is not about the next election; this war is about \ngenerations to come. The commercials will keep coming. Every time we \nhave a vote like this, somebody is going to take a work product, turn \nit into a political ad, and try to get some political momentum from the \ndialog we have on the floor.\n  None of us question each other's patriotism. That is great. To those \nwho have served in combat, my hat is off to you. But we all have our \nindependent obligation to make our own decisions here, and those who \nhave never worn the uniform, you are just as capable of understanding \nthis issue as I think anybody else. If you have been to Iraq, you \nunderstand how tired people are. They are tired. If you visit the \nmilitary on a regular basis, you know they are stressed.\n  Let me give my colleagues some numbers here. The 1st Cavalry \nDivision, their retention rates are 135 percent; The 25th ID, 202 \npercent; the 82nd Airborne, 121 percent retention rates. Recruiting and \nretention is very good because people who are in the fight now \nunderstand the consequences of the fight and they don't want to lose. I \nwas in Baghdad on July 4. We had 680-something people reenlist in \ntheater.\n  The troops are tired. That is not the problem. They understand the \nwar. They understand the enemy because they deal with the enemy face-\nto-face, day-to-day. They realize that if we don't get this right--and \nin spite of the mistakes we have made, we can still get it right--if at \nthe end of the day we don't get it right in Iraq, their kids are going \nto go back. The No. 1 comment I get from the troops after having been \nthere many times is: I want to do this, Senator Graham, so that my \nchildren do not have to come over here and fight this war. Let's get it \nright now.\n  Well, let's help them get it right. I think we are not helping them \nif the Congress mandates troop rotations that will undercut the ability \nfor the surge to continue.\n  Everyone cares about the troops, but the politics of this amendment \nare such that it would get--the bill would be vetoed. The President has \nsaid that if this amendment gets to be part of the underlying Defense \nauthorization bill, he would veto it. I think any President would veto \nthis bill. The Secretary of Defense's letter to me is a chilling \nrendition of what would happen to the force if this amendment was \nadopted. So we know the Defense authorization bill would get vetoed, \nand all the good things in it we do agree on--about MRAPs, support for \nthe troops, better health care--all that gets lost.\n  Now, why are we doing this? Some people have a very serious concern \nthat the force is stressed, and they want to take pressure off the \nforce by giving them as much time at home as they have in the theater. \nSome people want to use this amendment to make sure the surge can't go \nforward because that would be the effect of it. People are all over the \nboard. The consequence to the Defense authorization bill is it would \nget vetoed over this provision. Now, if that is what my colleagues want \nto happen, this is a way to make sure it happens.\n  The idea of telling the Department of Defense how long someone can \nstay in combat once they are trained and ready to go to the fight is \nprobably the most ill-advised thing any Congress could do in any war. \nThe Congress is a political body that is driven, appropriately, by the \nmoment, by the next election, the voices of constituents, concerns of \nthe public. Wars are not fought that way. Decisions in wars are not \npoll-driven--I hope. Decisions of politicians appropriately incorporate \npolitical consequences to the Member. Let's not make military policy \nbased on the political consequence to the Member of Congress. That is \nwhat you would be opening a can of worms to.\n  If we take on this responsibility of managing troops from a \ncongressional point of view, setting their rotation schedules, how many \ncan go and how long they can go, then their presence in whatever \nbattlefield or theater we are talking about in the future is very much \ntied to the political moment back home. Think about that. If we begin \nto adopt this way of managing a war where the Congress takes this bold, \nunknown step of saying: You can only go in theater this long and you \ncan't do A and you can't do B, but you can do C, what happens in the \nnext war? Is it wise for political people who worry about their own \nreelection--which is an appropriate, rightful thing to be worried about \nif you are in politics--to have this much power? Is it good for the \nmilitary for the Congress--535 people--to have this much power over \nmilitary deployments? Our Constitution gives them a political Commander \nin Chief--a single person--who has to answer to the public at the \nballot box.\n\n  The Congress can, as part of our constitutional responsibilities, \nterminate any war because our constitutional role allows us to fund \nwars. So to my colleagues on the other side and those on this side who \nwant to support this amendment, you would be doing the country a \nservice and eventually, I think, the troops a service by trying to stop \nthis war by cutting off funding, if that is your goal. If you think the \nwar is lost and you believe it is the biggest foreign policy mistake in \na generation and that it is a hopeless endeavor and that Iraq will \nnever get any better, then just come to the floor and offer an \namendment on the appropriations bill to say we will not continue to \nfund this war and create an orderly withdrawal. If you do that, I will \ndisagree with you, but you will have followed a constitutional path \nthat is well charted, and if you believe all the things I have just \nsaid, you will be doing the troops a great service because you will not \ncreate a precedent in the future where some other politician may take \nup your model and use it in a way you never envisioned.\n  Once we legitimize politicians being able to make rotation deployment \nschedule decisions, once we go down that road, we have opened up \nPandora's box where the politics of the next war could dramatically \naffect the ability to operate on the battlefield. If we limit our \nactions to cutting off funding, that will be a sustainable way for \nCongress to engage in terms of wars they believe have been lost.\n  Now, the majority leader, Harry Reid, said the war was lost in April \nand the surge has failed. If you really believe that, let's have a \ndebate not about micromanaging troop schedules and deployment \nschedules; let's have a debate that would be worthy of this Congress \nand this Nation. Let's come back onto the floor and put an amendment on \nthe desk to be considered that would end the war by stopping funding \nfor the war. That is not going to happen. The reason that is not going \nto happen is because the surge has been somewhat successful and the \npolitics of ending this war--everybody is trying to hedge their bet a \nlittle bit now. The politics of the next election are affecting the \npolitics of this body when it comes to war policy in a very unhealthy \nway.\n  We have a side-by-side alternative to Senator Webb that puts \ncongressional\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\nvoice behind the idea that we would like the policy of Secretary Gates \nto be implemented of ensuring the dwell time at home is consistent with \nthe amount of time one is in theater. It is a sense-of-the-Senate that \ngives voice to Secretary Gates's goal and policy of dwell time without \nretreating into the Commander in Chief's functions, without getting out \nof our constitutional lane. Senator McCain has introduced this side-by-\nside. It will be called up at an appropriate time, and I can talk about \nit later on. It is a sense-of-the-Congress where we all agree that it \nwould be a great policy to have if the conditions on the ground would \nwarrant it, to give our troops a little bit of rest.\n  But what our troops need more than anything else is a commander who \nknows what he is doing and who can carry out his mission unimpeded by a \nbunch of politicians who are scrambling to get an advantage over each \nother. This whole debate is unseemly. It is destructive to our \nconstitutional system. It brings out the worst in American politics. \nYou have an ad being run against the very general in charge of our \ntroops that is sickening and disgusting, and we are just absolutely \ngoing to a new low as a nation over this war.\n  So if you think all the things I said before--the war is lost, \nhopeless, stupid; the worst decision ever made in terms of U.S. foreign \npolicy--end the thing. End it. Cut off funding. Don't play this game of \nhaving 535 people become generals who have no clue of what they are \ntalking about. I respect everybody in this body, and those who have \nserved, I respect you, but there is not one person here who I think has \nanywhere close to the knowledge of General Petraeus in how to fight a \nwar. You could dig up Audie Murphy, and he could come back and tell me \nto vote for this amendment, and I would respectfully disagree. To those \nwho have been in battle: God bless you. You deserve all the credit and \nhonor that comes your way.\n  This is about winning a war we can't afford to lose. This is about \nwho should run this war--a group of politicians who are scared to death \nof the electorate and who will embrace almost anything to get an \nadvantage over the other, who is at 14 percent approval rating in the \neyes of their fellow citizens? You want to scare the military? You want \nto give them something to be afraid of? Let them read in the paper \nCongress takes over operational control of Iraq. We would have some \nretention problems then. Anybody in their right mind would get out.\n  There are a lot of choices to be made in our constitutional democracy \nabout war and peace. The one choice we have never made before is to \nallow the Congress to set rotation schedules, deployment schedules, and \nif we do it now, not only will we hurt this war effort, we will make it \nimpossible for future commanders and future Presidents to protect us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding that Senator Graham, the senior \nSenator from South Carolina, is a member of the Air Force Reserve and \nthe JAG Corps; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand you just spent a couple of weeks in Iraq \nserving in active duty and in your capacity as an Air Force colonel?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And despite the mistake that was made in the promotion \nsystem, you did form impressions over there from the day-to-day \ninterface with the men and women who are serving there?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it might be appropriate, given the Senator's \nrecent probably longer stay than any Member of Congress has ever had in \nIraq, maybe he can talk to us a bit on the record not only about where \nthe troops' morale is, what they believe in, and about the issue that \nwas the reason he went there, and that is this enormous challenge of \nthe rule of law, and whether we are making progress in that area, and \nwhat he expects, particularly in the area of the prisoner situation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will try my best. No. 1, my time in the \nservice has been as a military lawyer. I am not a combat operational \nguy. If you want to talk about my experiences in the military, I am \nglad to talk about them, but they are limited, and I know how far they \nshould go--not very. As a JAG colonel, I cannot tell you how to deploy \ntroops. I don't know. That is out of my line. I have to make a decision \nas a Senator when the general comes, as Senator McCain says, as to \nwhether it makes sense to me. I would not advise any Member of this \nbody to follow a four star general's recommendation just because of the \nnumber of stars.\n  Here is what I would advise the Members of this body to do. Listen to \nwhat the general says. Use your own common sense. Go in theater and see \nif it makes sense. For 3\\1/2\\ years, we went to Iraq and we were told \nby the generals in the old strategy that things were fine. On about the \nthird trip with Senator McCain, I would say we were in a tank. I am a \nlawyer, so I don't understand military deployments and how to deploy \ncombat troops. But I can tell you this from a lawyer's perspective and \nfrom good old South Carolina common sense: After the third visit to \nIraq, if you thought things were getting better, you were crazy. We \nblamed it on the Republican side. The media doesn't tell the story \nright. It wasn't the media's fault. We were losing operational control \nof Iraq because we didn't have enough troops. You could see it if you \nwanted to look. If you were blinded by the partisanship that exists in \nthis building, you will find some other group to blame it on. But it \nwas there to be seen.\n  I have been seven times--twice in uniform--working on issues where I \nthink I have a little bit to offer. My contribution is insignificant, \ninconsequential, but I am honored to have been able to be allowed to \ngo, because I am cheering on people over there and I am still in \nuniform and I am the only one left, and I wish I could stay over there \nlonger because I feel an obligation to do so.\n  Here is the morale as I see it this time around. A year ago, I was in \nIraq--maybe a little bit longer--sitting at lunch across the table with \na sergeant. I asked him: Sergeant, how is it going? He said: Senator, I \nfeel like I am driving around waiting to get shot. Not going very well.\n  This last tour, when I was there for 11 days, I got to have three \nmeals a day with them in Baghdad and meet folks with different missions \nand responsibilities, including combat guys coming in from the field. I \nsat down with them every night and I asked: How is it going? I was \ntold: Colonel, we are kicking their ass.\n  Morale is high because of the new strategy. They are fighting and \nliving with the Iraqi troops out in the field. Their army is getting \nbetter. When you talk to the marines in Anbar, they will tell you with \npride: Look at what we did here.\n  For us politicians to deny what they did is an insult to their hard \nwork. They liberated Anbar Province because there were enough of them \nthis time around to join up with the Sunnis in Anbar to make a \ndifference and drive out al-Qaida. This new strategy--and everybody has \nbeen asking for something new for a long time--is working. It is \nworking. There are areas in Iraq, as Senator McCain described, that are \nliberated from a vicious enemy.\n  On the rule-of-law front, judges have a new level of security because \nof the surge that they have never known before. The first thing General \nPetraeus did when he went in theater was create a rule-of-law green \nzone for judges. We have taken an old Iraqi base and built housing for \njudges and created a perimeter of security. We have a jail inside the \ncomplex, judge housing, a police station, and a brandnew courtroom, so \nthat the judges can implement the law without fear of assassination. I \nhave never seen such growth in an area as I have in the rule of law \nsince the surge began. The judges now are able to do their job without \ntheir families being assassinated, and we have seen dramatic \nimprovements.\n  I will give you two examples. There was a Shia police captain accused \nof torturing Sunnis at the police station he was in charge of. He is \nnow facing a long-term prison sentence because the Iraqi legal system \ndidn't listen to the fact that he was a Shia and the people he abused \nwere Sunni. They gave a verdict based on what he did, not who he did it \nto. It is sweeping the whole legal system.\n  Judges are going into areas that al-Qaida operated from just months \nago\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\nand they are rendering justice, but not based on what sect you come \nfrom; it is based on what the person was accused of. I witnessed a \ntrial downtown Baghdad where two people of the three were Shia police \nofficers in the Iraqi police force. There was a raid on the house they \nwere living in by the American forces. Coalition troops were the only \nwitnesses and these two defendants who were in a house full of IED \nmaterial, rocket-propelled grenades, explosive devices that were meant \nto kill Americans. The defense said: Who are you going to believe, us \nor the invader? The lawyers in the trial looked the judge in the eye \nand started citing one verse of the Koran after another to tell the \njudge he had a duty to stand beside his Muslim brothers and reject the \ntestimony of the infidels. I was there; I saw it.\n  The three judges conducted a trial that everybody who witnessed that \ntrial would have been proud of. They asked hard questions. They \nseparated the defendants, and rather than listening to dictates from \nthe Koran coming out of the mouth of their lawyer, they asked questions \nsuch as how were they in the house, and how could they not have known \nthe weapons were there? They did a great job proving these guys were \nlying through their teeth. When they reconvened, they got convicted, \ngetting 6 years in jail.\n  There is progress going on in Iraq. There are people in Iraq who are \nbigger than sectarian differences. There are judges, lawyers, and \naverage, everyday people who are risking their lives to make their \ncountry better. One of the biggest problems they have had is that we \nscrewed up early on and let security get out of hand. With better \nsecurity, people are beginning to engage in a way I have never seen \nbefore.\n  This idea of pulling back now, reducing our military footprint, at a \ntime when we have made a real difference, is too disheartening to the \ntroops. They are watching what we are doing. I was stopped every 30 \nfeet with questions such as: What are we going to do? Is the war going \nto go on? Are they going to cut it short? The people fighting want one \nthing, and that is the ability to finish the job. Do they want to come \nhome? Yes, God knows they want to be home. Are they tired of going \nover? Yes. But above all others, they want to win.\n  Senator McCain said he met people for the third and fourth time. \nWell, nobody stays in this military unless they volunteer, to begin \nwith, and when their enlistment is up, there are stop-loss problems, \nbut there is an end to this war for them; it is an end of their \nchoosing. This force, unlike others, chooses when to end the war for \nthem when their enlistment comes. What they are choosing to do we need \nto understand. They are choosing to reenlist at numbers greater than \nany other area of the military. Why can't this body sit down and think \nfor a moment; what do they see about this war that I don't see? Why do \nthey keep leaving their families and going to a dangerous place time \nand time again, in numbers larger than any other group in the military? \nDo you know why they do it? I think they do it because they interact \nwith the judges I have just described to you. They see hope. They \nunderstand the enemy. They know an enemy that will take a 5-year-old \nchild and put that child in front of their parents, douse him with \ngasoline and set him on fire, is an enemy to their family. They \nunderstand that Iran is trying to drive us out of Iraq because they \nwant to be stronger. And they understand that will mean they are likely \nto have to fight a bigger war.\n  From the troops' perspective, from my view, they want to come home, \nand they want a lot of things; but they want, above all others, the \nchance to win a war they believe they can win and one we cannot afford \nto lose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the author \nof the amendment, Senator Webb, be recognized, and that following his \ncomments, Senator Warner from Virginia be recognized, Senator Vitter be \nrecognized, and that I follow Senator Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at this point, I have to object, unless \nthe Senator from Georgia will agree that if there is a person on the \nother side who wants to speak in opposition, we can go back and forth. \nIf we can modify the request that a speaker in support of the amendment \nmay be interjected into that lineup, if there is a speaker in support \nof the amendment, I will not object. Is that agreeable to the Senator \nfrom Virginia?\n  Mr. WEBB. That is agreeable.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I say to my friends, I already discussed that with \nSenator Webb. I agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request, as modified, \nis agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, can I hear the unanimous consent request \nagain, please?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Yes. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Webb, be recognized; that following him, Senator \nWarner be recognized; that following him, Senator Vitter and myself be \nrecognized; that if there is a member of the other side of the aisle \nwho comes in after Senator Warner or after Senator Vitter, they be \ngiven the opportunity to be interjected into the rotation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I neglected to vote on rollcall vote \nNo. 340. Had I voted, I would have voted negatively.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes and clarify, \nfrom my perspective, the intention of this amendment in the context of \na number of the things the Senator from South Carolina spoke about. \nThat was quite a lengthy speech. There was a lot of material in it.\n  This amendment is a very narrow amendment. It is talking about a \nminimal adjustment in terms of troop rotation ratios. That is all this \namendment is doing.\n  When the Senator from South Carolina mentioned we should not have the \npolitics of the next election being the driving force in these sorts of \nsituations, I hasten to clarify that my election occurred last year. It \nis going to be a while before that decision is faced again. The \nprincipal cosponsor on the Republican side, Senator Hagel, has \nindicated he is retiring from the Senate. These issues we are \nattempting to put before the Senate have nothing to do with the \npolitics of being reelected.\n  Another point that I think needs to be made is that no one I know of \nis trying to push a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina made a lot of comments about if you want to end the war, \nif you believe it is the worst strategic error we have ever made, we \nshould call for cutting off the funding. There are a lot of us, \nincluding myself, who believe this was a huge strategic blunder and \nsaid so before we went in. As I said to General Petraeus when he was \ntestifying: That was then, this is now.\n  We have to find a way out of Iraq, for those of us who want to remove \nour residual forces eventually. That doesn't include everybody in this \nbody. For those of us who want to remove all residual forces \neventually, we have to do so in a way that will not further increase \nthe instability in the region and will allow us to focus on \ninternational terrorism and our other strategic interests around the \nworld. There is no debate on that. That is not what this amendment is \nabout. We must do that through a proper, regionally based diplomatic \nsolution. That will only take place with the right sort of leadership \nout of the administration. But that is not on the table. That is not \nwhat we are trying to address in this amendment.\n\n  There have been questions on the constitutional issues. Again, I go \nto article I, section 8. The Congress has the power ``To make Rules for \nthe Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces. . . .''\n  There has been some discussion about how this should not apply to \nmovement of forces during a time of war. I don't see this as a movement \nof forces in a time of war, and I do see precedent, again, from the \nKorean war. This is a very similar situation; it is on the other end of \nit.\n  In the Korean war, an administration was sending our troops into \ncombat before they had been properly trained.\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\nThe administration would say that is proper. The Secretary of Defense \nwould come in and say that is proper, we need these troops in Korea. \nBut the Congress decided it was not proper, that once our people step \nforward and take the oath of enlistment or oath of office, there is \nsome protection that should come if there is a belief from the Congress \nthat the executive branch has not used them properly.\n  This is an intrinsically limited power. It is limited by the nature \nof this process. All one has to do is take a look at the votes we need \ntoday to move it forward. But it is a power that belongs in the \nCongress when the right vote is taken.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Graham had a lengthy colloquy about \nservice. Believe me, I am indebted to both of them and to the others \nwho have served our country for the service they have given. Thirty \nyears ago this year, I started as a committee counsel in the Congress. \nI was the first Vietnam veteran to work as a full committee counsel. At \nthat time, two-thirds of the Members in the Congress had served in the \nmilitary. That number is a very small percentage today. So it affects, \nin some cases, the ability of people to understand the movements on the \nground, but it also increases the importance of people such as Senator \nMcCain and Senator Graham, both of whom I respectfully disagree with on \nthis particular amendment, but it increases the importance of what they \nare saying and the insight they are bringing. I greatly respect both of \nthem for their service.\n  I know there is going to be a sense of the Senate submitted after our \nvote is taken--I assume after our vote is taken. I wish to say again \nthis is basically a figleaf. This is not a time for the Congress to be \ngiving advice. It is a time for the Congress to step in and put a floor \nunder those people who are serving us.\n  This is a very minimal adjustment, but it is, in my view and in the \nview of others, an essential adjustment in terms of how we are handling \nthe welfare and well-being of people who are going again and again.\n  On that point, I again remind the Senate that for the first time in \nall the years we have been involved in Iraq, we are seeing people from \nthe administration and from the other party openly saying they expect \nwe might be in Iraq for the next 50 years. I was warning 5 years ago \nthis month, in an editorial in the Washington Post, that there was no \nexit strategy from the people who wanted us to go into Iraq because \nthey didn't intend to leave. Now we are seeing graphic evidence of \nthat. That is a debate we are going to have. That is a debate we are \ngoing to have separate from this amendment. The only purpose of this \namendment is to provide some stability in the rotational cycles, \nparticularly of our traditional ground forces in the Army and Marine \nCorps, so we can have that debate in a way that calms down the \ninstability in the forces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while my friend from Virginia is on the \nfloor--my other friend from Virginia--I apologize to him for \nmisspeaking this morning about his sponsorship of any amendment. I know \nhe has a number of proposals he may bring before the Senate in the \ncourse of this debate, and I apologize to him for assuming he hadn't \nhad any of those ready at that particular time.\n  Again, I thank him for the enormous input he has made in this debate \nand his wisdom and knowledge, and his leaving will create a void around \nhere. Voids are always filled, but I think it may exist for a long time \nbecause of the many years of leadership on national security issues he \nhas provided to this body, the State of Virginia, and the Nation. I say \nto the Senator, please accept my apologies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. The factual basis \nthat this follows--I wish to thank him and I wish to indicate to my \ncolleague from Virginia the exact background. I first saw the \namendment, prepared by, I believe, Senator McCain and Senator Graham, \nyesterday when it was circulated to the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee. At that time, I promptly suggested a change in the amendment \nor, more specifically, an addition that a waiver be put in. I suggested \nthe President. The draft now has the Secretary of Defense.\n  I say to my good friend--and, indeed, Senator Webb and I share a very \nstrong bond of friendship. It actually goes back over 30 years, when I \nwas in the Navy Secretariat. Senator Webb, at that time, a young--still \nyoung but anyway a bit younger--Marine captain who, fortunately for me \nand others in the Secretariat, was assigned to our staff. He had just \nfinished his tour in Vietnam, where he displayed a measure of courage \nfew in uniform in the history of our country can equal. For that he \nreceived our Nation's second highest decoration.\n  I stand in awe of his military career. My modest career pales in \ncomparison to his. Nevertheless, we did form at that time a friendship \nand resumed it once he came here.\n  I would like to also say, Senator Webb and I were both privileged to \nserve as Secretaries of the U.S. Navy. As I look back on the good \nfortune I have had in life, that was a chapter--5 years, 4 months, 3 \ndays as Secretary of the Navy--that I cherish as the very foundation \nfor whatever I have achieved thereafter in life. It was the \nassociation, the learning I had from men and women of the Armed Forces, \nthat gave me a certain sense of confidence and inner strength that has \nenabled me to go on and do other things, most humbly, I say, to serve \nVirginia for now my 29th year in this chamber.\n  I have come to know Senator Webb, of course, in the perspective of \nbeing a Senator. I said to others that he possesses the intellectual \nability, the sincerity, the feeling about people to make him a great \nSenator. His career is before him; my career is behind me. When I leave \nsome 14 months from now, having finished 30 years in the Senate, I \nleave with a sense of confidence that this fine young Senator will \nrepresent Virginia well, and they can take righteous pride in his \nleadership.\n  But the amendment by Senator Graham is one I somewhat disagree with \nmy colleague on. It embraces the principles he put forth in his \namendment, principles which led me to join him when he first laid down \nhis amendment and vote for that amendment. So the question arises: Why, \nat this point in time, would I go into a very intense deliberative \nprocess of reconsidering that process? I will enumerate those reasons.\n  But I wish to go back again to the service we both had as Secretary \nof the Navy. It was the management of a force of men and women in \nuniform. During my period, it was somewhat larger in number than when \nSenator Webb was Secretary of the Navy. But nevertheless, we both \nlearned the difficulty, the challenges of managing under the all-\nvolunteer force the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  One of the reasons I joined my good friend was the all-volunteer \nforce. I was in the Department of Defense, as I stated, from 1969 \nthrough 1974, serving under three Secretaries of Defense, Melvin Laird \nbeing the first. He had the concept of going to the all-volunteer \nforce. That concept was not by any means readily accepted. There was \nconsiderable and, I think, justified doubt among the uniform ranks at \nthat time, in the White House, and elsewhere, that this daring concept, \nthis unique concept would be able to adequately serve America, given \nthe troubled world, not only at the time of Vietnam but subsequently \nand particularly at that time in the midst of the Cold War when the \nSoviet Union, in many respects, had challenged us potentially in terms \nof their military prowess. Nevertheless, in the wisdom of the executive \nbranch, we went forward, and the Congress subsequently endorsed it.\n  Senator Webb's amendment, I say without any equivocation, is designed \nto help protect the concept of the all-volunteer force. It was for that \nreason that I joined him because I felt, having been in the Department \nof Defense at the period of time when the formative stages of that \nconcept were developed, I had a stake in it.\n  I have said many times on this floor it is a national treasure that \nthe members of today's Armed Forces, every one of them, are men and \nwomen who have raised their hands and volunteered. They were not \nsubjected, as\n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\nprevious generations had been, to a draft and compelled to go into \nuniform. They were there, every one of them, because they wanted to be \nthere, they wanted to be a part of the Armed Forces that would protect \nour country.\n  If we add up all the men and women in the Armed Forces today and \ninclude the very valuable Reserve and Guard--because the Reserve and \nGuard are as much a part of our defense structure, more so than they \nhave ever been--and how magnificently the Reserve and Guard have proven \nthroughout the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, their ability to take \non in every way responsibilities, dangers, and personal risk equal to \nthe regular force.\n  I come back to that little chapter when both of us served as \nSecretary, and then he subsequently served in the Department in other \ncapacities where Senator Webb gained a basic knowledge of personnel \nmanagement, management of not only the Navy Secretariat but prior \nthereto, when he was looking at all the force structures of the \nDepartment of Defense. I readily acknowledge he is an expert and, in \nsome ways, more current than I am, in terms of the management of our \nforces in uniform.\n  We have a difference, Senator Webb and I, and I will spell it out, \nwith regard to the amendment. I endorsed it. I intend now to cast a \nvote against it. The reasons are as follows:\n  I went forward some months ago and informed the Senate and, indeed, \ninformed the country, having returned from my 10th trip to Iraq, that I \nwas gravely concerned about the situation over there and gravely \nconcerned about the turbulence here at home, gravely concerned that the \nU.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps were being pushed to the limits, \ngreatly concerned that our Guard and Reserves were being pushed to the \nlimit. Furthermore, I felt that the surge--although I did not fully \nsupport the surge, and the record of this body, the Senate, clearly \nreflects my concerns--at that time, I felt that far more of the \nresponsibility should be borne by the Iraqi forces. In January of this \nyear, 2007, when the President announced his policy regarding the \nsurge, I believed that Iraqi forces should take on a far greater role, \nparticularly as it related to the sectarian violence--the criminal \nelements that are striking against our forces, and for nothing more \nthan a few bucks undertaking, to put at risk the lives of our great \nsoldiers, airmen, marines, and sailors. I thought that the Iraqi force \nshould take on that and we should concentrate more on the security of \nthat nation, to maintain the sovereignty and integrity of its borders \nand tighten the borders.\n\n  I won't go into the details, but the record is clear that I \nquestioned the surge. Once the decision was made, I think I felt, like \nmost Senators, that I should support the President, and I have tried to \ndo so.\n  But back again to the force structure problem. At that time, I felt \nthat we should send a signal to the Iraqi Government by putting some \nteeth in what the President had repeatedly said; namely, we are not \ngoing to be there forever. Our Ambassador in Iraq at that point in time \nhad said something to that same effect. At the time that I announced \nthe recommendation to reduce the forces and have that reduction take \nplace so they could be home by Christmas, Ambassador Crocker had said: \nWe are not giving you a blank check. They were just verbal statements \ndirected at the Maliki government and all levels of the Iraqi \nGovernment to say that we are not going to be there forever, but you \nhad to put teeth in it.\n  I felt if we first announced that we were going to take the first \ngroup home--and I carefully said that the President should consult with \nthe ground commanders before he accepted any recommendation from me or \nanybody else to reduce force levels and begin to send people back such \nthat they would be back home with their families before Christmas, and \nthe President obviously did that. In his message of a week or so ago, \nhe indicated--not necessarily agreeing with me--that he agreed with the \nconcept; that after consultation with General Petraeus and other on-\nscene commanders, that they could now, based on certain successes of \nthe operation of the surge and visible successes that the intelligence \ncommunity verified. Indeed, Senator Levin and I, on our trip a few \nweeks ago, saw with our own eyes, where there had been measurable \nsuccess of the surge--but consequently the President agreed with the \nthought that troops could begin to depart Iraq ahead of schedule and \ncome home. There are further details of that well-known to Members of \nthis body.\n  So first and foremost, I asked for that, the administration and the \nuniformed side agreed with it, and it was done. That put me in a \ndifferent posture because I felt my thought that it was time to bring \nsome people home was accepted, and therefore I could then turn to the \nWebb amendment and the need to go back and get a clear understanding \nfrom the U.S. military, the uniformed side, of the consequences of the \nwell-intentioned principles of the Webb amendment.\n  I would like to also digress momentarily to talk about politics. The \nSenator felt challenged. I wasn't here for the earlier debate. I was \nholding a briefing with senior members of the military from the \nDepartment of Defense on this very subject--the Webb amendment. And I \ncan tell you without any equivocation whatsoever, knowing Senator Webb \nas I do, that politics is not a factor in his judgment. He honestly \nbelieves--he honestly believes--based on his long experience and his \ncurrent knowledge of the readiness of the situation of our Armed Forces \ntoday that we need a policy, and we need it now, of a 1-month home for \nevery month served abroad in a combat zone.\n  As I said, I agreed with him. But in that subsequent period of time, \nI have had consultations with a lot of senior military officers and \njust concluded a briefing with Lieutenant General Ham, the Director of \nOperations of the Joint Staff and Lieutenant General Lovelace, the \nDeputy Chief of Staff for Operations for the U.S. Army. Two respected \nthree-star generals, whom I invited to come over here and further brief \nme and several other Senators who were present. They are not \npolitically motivated. They are motivated by what they have to do to be \nfair to those serving in Iraq today.\n  It is their professional judgment that if this amendment were to be \nadopted and become law--and I will put aside all the other issues of a \npossible veto, and I just don't want to see another veto scenario here \nright in the middle of the war, and that is another reason--but they \nare absolutely convinced, and have now convinced me, that they cannot \neffectively put into force that amendment at this time, without causing \nsevere problems within the existing forces and those who are serving \nthere.\n  One of the consequences that could change in some fashion could be \nthe very thing I advocated--namely, let us bring some of the troops \nhome by Christmas. That might not be feasible if this amendment were \nadopted. The announced schedule of withdrawals--bringing the force \nstructure down by July 2008 to what we call the pre-surge level, \nannounced by the President and General Petraeus that might not be \nachievable, the reason being that on any day, if you look at the \ntotality of the U.S. Army, about one-third of it is globally deployed \nbeyond our shores--some 250,000 men and women in uniform. There is a \nrotation in and out of Korea of roughly 20,000 a year and rotation in \nother areas of concentration. You just cannot simply look at Iraq or \nAfghanistan; you have to look at the totality of the Army.\n\n  A soldier coming out of, say, Korea, having spent a year over there \nand expecting to have a year back at home, joins a unit for further \ntraining, and that unit is suddenly called to go to Iraq. Well, the \nonly recourse is to begin to pull that soldier and some others out \nbecause of their need to have 12 months back here. In fairness, that \nsoldier should have 12 months back here, but that unit has to deploy.\n  These generals, again putting all politics aside, they have not been \nordered to do this; they are simply trying to manage the U.S. Army \ntoday in a way that is equitable to every single soldier, and they have \nconvinced me they cannot manage it in this time period. If this \namendment were changed to be effective at, say, the beginning of fiscal \nyear 2009--starting in October of 2008--they feel they could manage it, \ncertainly with regard to the combat units that are going over. But they \nstill have a problem with--for example, in Iraq today there are some \n50,000 soldiers who are in what we call combat support roles, not just \ncooks and bakers,\n\n[[Page S11711]]\n\nalthough they are essential, but the people who are performing the \nremoval of the IEDs over which the combat trucks roll to go forward to \nthe front. If there is any single front in Iraq, and I don't think \nthere is, the concept being they are deployed there to different parts \nof Iraq. Iraq is a 360-degree battle zone, in my judgment. And how well \nwe know that the IED is causing the most severe damage to our soldiers \nin terms of loss of life and limb in Iraq today. They explained to me \nthat the persons, the explosives experts who know how to go in and \ndetect and remove these lethal weapons, are in short supply. The Army \nis doing everything it can, the Marine Corps everything it can, to \ntrain sufficient numbers of these individuals to come in and do these \njobs, but they, too, have to be treated with a sense of fairness. They \ncannot be subjected to having to stay there maybe 15 months, maybe even \nlonger, because we have no replacement for them.\n  So at another time, because I don't want to go into greater detail \nhere--there was point after point these generals made in our briefing \nand that I have studied that clearly documents the difficulty, the \nunfairness, to others now serving in Iraq if this amendment were to \nbecome law.\n  Now, to the credit of Senator Webb and in my conversations with him--\nalthough I don't know that I was the one who persuaded him--he went \nahead and added an extension to his amendment, so that it goes into \neffect 120 days after the authorization bill is signed into law. Well, \nthat still does not carry it anywhere near the October 2008 date, which \nis the earliest date that the Army feels it can now follow the Webb \namendment and its goals. These generals told me there is no one who \nwants to move to the 1-to-1 ratio with any greater fervor or desire \nthan the senior military staff of the U.S. Army and, indeed, others in \nthe Department of Defense. They want it. They would do everything \nwithin their realm of professional responsibility to make it happen. \nBut they simply cannot make it happen in the time frame as it is now \ncouched in the provisions of the Webb amendment.\n  Mr. President, for those reasons and others--and I know I am taking \ngenerously of the time of others here--I feel I will have to cast a \nvote against my good friend's amendment. It is a change of vote for me, \nI recognize that, but I change that vote only after a lot of very \ncareful and analytical work with the uniformed side of the Department \nof Defense.\n  The Secretary of Defense has written me on this subject, in a very \ndetailed letter. I have a great deal of respect for him. I traveled \nwith him this week and talked to him, and I tried to explain that \npossibly there are changes which could be made to the Webb amendment \nwhich would enable us to go forward and enact it into law, as opposed \nto a sense of the Senate, which I do hope we vote on later, but that \nwas not achievable. I did my very best, but it was not achievable.\n  So I say to my good friend from Virginia, I agree with the principles \nyou have laid down in your amendment, but I regret to say that I have \nbeen convinced by those professionals in uniform that they cannot do it \nand do it in a way that wouldn't invoke further unfairness to other \nsoldiers now serving in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Virginia \nfor his knowledge, his wisdom, and his in-depth analysis of the \nsituation. All of us who know him are appreciative of the very \ndifficult process he has gone through as he has attempted to balance \nthe needs of the military, America's national security, and the \nfrustration and sorrow and anger that is felt by many Americans over \nour failures in this war. I thank him for the consultation process he \nhas gone through. I have never known the Senator from Virginia to \narrive at a decision without a thorough and complete analysis of it. He \nhas used the wisdom he has acquired since World War II, when he served \nas a brave marine.\n  Mr. WARNER. Sailor, you rascal. How could you forget that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Excuse me--sailor, and later in the Marine Corps. He went \nwrong--I mean he did very well by serving both in the U.S. Navy and the \nU.S. Marine Corps, and then, of course, as Assistant Secretary of the \nNavy and as an outstanding chairman of the Armed Services Committee. So \nI thank him for his in-depth analysis, I thank him for his leadership \nand guidance to all of us and to all of our citizens, and for a very \nthoughtful and persuasive discussion.\n  As we move forward on this issue, no matter what happens with the \nWebb amendment, we will be faced with the situation in Iraq. I hope the \nsituation improves and these debates can be eliminated over time. I am \nnot sure they can. I hope and pray they can, but in the meantime we \nwill rely on the judgment and guidance of our friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might ask the Senator a question \nbecause, indeed, the Senator has a career of active-duty service to the \ncountry that cannot be paralleled, certainly by this humble Senator or \nmany others. But don't you believe in your heart of hearts the Webb \nconcept of 1 to 1 is a good one, and if it were possible for the \nmilitary to achieve it they would do so, and we would all vote for this \namendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend, he is exactly right. He is exactly \nright. Among the many failures, as my friend from Virginia knows very \nwell, is that at the onset of this conflict it was believed by the then \nSecretary of Defense and others in the administration, including the \nPresident of the United States, this was going to be quick, it was \ngoing to be easy, it was going to be over.\n  There were people such as the Senator from Virginia--and, I might \nadd, and me--who said you have to have a bigger Army. You have to have \na bigger Marine Corps. The Army and Marine Corps is one-third smaller \nthan it was at the time of the first gulf war. We should have paid \nattention to our friend and comrade, General Powell, and the Powell \ndoctrine, and we obviously should have understood the requirements in \nthe postinitial combat phase, which I think would have relieved this \nterrific burden we have laid on the men and women in both the Active \nDuty and the Guard and Reserve. God bless them for being able to \nsustain it. It is a remarkable performance on their part.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on that point, I grilled these officers \ntoday very intensely. You may recall that in January, subsequent to the \nPresident's announcement of the surge, the Secretary of Defense stepped \nup and said: Hold everything. I am going to put in place a callup \npolicy for the Reserve and the Guard which will enable them to have a \nclearer understanding of how much active service they will be called \nupon to do and, more important, once that active service is completed, \nhow much time they can remain home.\n  Now, a reservist has to maintain two jobs, in a way: his Reserve job \nand his job with which he puts, basically, the bread on the table for \nhis family, in the private sector. So they are different than the \nregulars.\n  I was told today that, if the Webb amendment became law, they would \nhave to go back and revisit and change that policy that the Secretary \nof Defense enunciated for the Guard and Reserve in January, this year.\n  Is that your understanding?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is my understanding, I would say to the Senator from \nVirginia, and I also say that is why I think we need to have a Sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution, to reflect the overall opinion of the Senate \nthat we need to fix this situation. Obviously, the unintended \nconsequences of putting it into law at this time are myriad. The \nSenator from Virginia has, in the most articulate fashion, described \nthose. I agree with the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I conclude my remarks by saying--others \nare waiting to speak--the reason I brought up Senator Webb's \ndistinguished career as former Secretary of the Navy, and indeed in the \nDepartment of Defense in an earlier assignment, is he understands these \narguments. He has looked at them. I respect his views. We have a \npersonal difference of opinion on the professional viewpoints, that it \ncan or cannot be done.\n  He believes honestly it can be done. I believe, based on what I \nrelated this\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\nmorning and that my ranking member has stated--we feel it can't be \ndone. Therein is the problem.\n  I, in no way, in any way denigrate what Senator Webb is trying to do. \nIt is just that we have an honest difference of opinion, mine based on \nbasically the same facts that have been given to him. He has a \ndifferent analysis than do I.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to add one additional point, \nthough, that I think is important. I also believe that it is \nunconstitutional for this body to dictate the tours of duty and the \nservice of the men and women in the military and how that is conducted. \nI am absolutely convinced, from my reading of history and of the \nConstitution, that to enact such an amendment would be an encroachment \non the authority and responsibility of the Commander in Chief which \ncould have significant consequences in future conflicts, particularly \nif those conflicts at some point may be unpopular with the American \npeople. So I have additional reasons, besides our desire to--the \nimpracticability, as the Senator has so adequately pointed out.\n  I see my friend from Illinois is waiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, let me begin by expressing my utmost \nsupport for Senator Warner. I am absolutely convinced of his commitment \nto our troops. I do not think there are many people in this Senate \nChamber who understand our military better or care more deeply about \nour military. So I have the highest regard for him.\n  I have to say I respectfully disagree on this issue and must rise in \nstrong support of the amendment offered by Senator Webb to require \nminimum periods between deployments for members of our armed services \nwho are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. This amendment protects our \nbrave men and women in uniform and ensures that our Armed Forces retain \ntheir ability to meet any challenge around the world. That is something \nthat ultimately all of us have to be concerned about. I am proud to be \na cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I opposed the war in Iraq from the beginning and have called \nrepeatedly for a responsible end to the foreign policy disaster that \nthis administration has created. Over 3,700 American service men and \nwomen have died in this war. Over 27,000 have been seriously wounded. \nEach month, this misguided war costs us a staggering $10 billion. When \nall is said and done, it will have cost us at least $1 trillion.\n  There are different views of the war in this Chamber, but there is no \ndisagreement about the tremendous sacrifice of the men and women who \nare serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have performed valiantly \nunder exceedingly difficult circumstances. They have done everything we \nhave asked of them. But they have also been stretched to the limit. The \ntruth is, we are not keeping our sacred trust with our men and women in \nuniform. We are asking too much of them, and we are asking too much of \ntheir families. We owe it to our troops and their families to adopt a \nfair policy that ensures predictable rotations, adequate time to be \nwith their families before redeployment, and adequate time for \nrealistic training for the difficult assignments we are giving them.\n\n  Our service men and women will always answer the call of duty, but \nthe reality is extended deployments and insufficient rest periods are \ntaking their toll. The effects of the strain are clear: Increasing \nattrition rates, falling retention rates among West Point graduates, \nincreasing rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and unprecedented \nstrain on military families.\n  This amendment is a responsible way to keep our sacred trust while \nrestoring our military to an appropriate state of readiness. It ensures \nthat members of our Armed Forces who are deployed to Iraq or \nAfghanistan have at least the same amount of time at home, before they \nare redeployed. It would also ensure that members of a Reserve \ncomponent, including the National Guard, cannot be redeployed to Iraq \nor Afghanistan within 3 years of their previous deployment.\n  After 4\\1/2\\ years of fighting in Iraq and almost 6 years of fighting \nin Afghanistan, we owe it to our troops and their families to provide \nthem with a more predictable schedule with sufficient time home between \ndeployments. As the Military Officers Association of America, which \nrepresents 368,000 members, has stated:\n\n       If we are not better stewards of our troops and their \n     families in the future than we have been in the recent past, \n     the Military Officers Association of America believes \n     strongly that we will be putting the all-volunteer force at \n     unacceptable risk.\n\n  There are scores of anecdotes that bear out the strain on our \nfamilies. One woman from Illinois recently wrote my office telling me \nhow her husband was facing his fourth deployment in 4\\1/2\\ years. She \ndescribed how her husband had spent so much time in Iraq that, in her \nwords: ``He feels like he is stationed in Iraq and only deploys home.'' \nThat is not an acceptable way to treat our troops. That is not an \nacceptable way to treat their families.\n  This amendment is not only important for military families, it is \nalso important for our national security. Our military simply cannot \nsustain its current deployments without crippling our ability to \nrespond to contingencies around the world.\n  This is all the more important since the administration has \nsquandered our resources on the war in Iraq and neglected to address \nserious threats to our safety. According to the National Intelligence \nEstimate in July, al-Qaida has ``protected or regenerated key elements \nof its homeland attack capability,'' including a safe haven in \nPakistan's tribal areas, operational lieutenants, and its top \nleadership.\n  Ensuring the readiness and capabilities of our troops will be crucial \nto confronting the threat of al-Qaida in Afghanistan and other parts of \nthe world and deterring other threats to America's national security.\n  Over the coming months, I will continue to push for a new course in \nIraq that immediately begins a safe and orderly withdrawal of our \ncombat troops, that changes our military mission to focus on training \nand counterterrorism, that puts real pressure on the Iraqis to resolve \ntheir grievances, and that focuses our military efforts on the real \nthreats facing our country.\n  I believe this amendment is an important part of that new course. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I was on the floor when the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner, made his comments a little bit earlier. \nI hope a lot of the American people were listening to what Senator \nWarner had to say because there is nobody in this Senate who has more \nrespect, not just on military issues but principally on military \nissues, than does Senator Warner. He not only has a lot of expertise, \nand great experience, but he is known to be very thoughtful in his \ndeliberations. He doesn't arrive at decisions of major importance very \neasily or very quickly. For him to come to the floor and to make the \nstatement he made earlier this afternoon, having thought through this \nissue and having now decided to change his vote on this particular \namendment, is of monumental importance. It is the type of decision that \nmakes all of us proud to serve in this great institution.\n  I rise in opposition to the Webb amendment. This amendment is about \nrestricting the President and his military leaders' ability to \nprosecute a war we have asked them to execute and which we unanimously \nconfirmed General Petraeus to carry out. It is an unwise and harmful \neffort to limit the ability of the President and his military \nleadership and to handicap their use of personnel and resources \navailable to them.\n  Senator Webb's amendment would preclude deployment of certain Active \nand Reserve Forces based on the number of days they have spent at home. \nKeep in mind, these restrictions would apply to the Nation's most \nexperienced and capable troops during a time of war, when we face an \nunpredictable and highly adaptive enemy.\n  That statement is very similar to what Senator Warner said a little \nbit earlier.\n  There is no one in this body who would not like to see every single \none of our troops come home tomorrow. There is nothing pretty about a \nmilitary conflict. There have been times in\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\nthe history of our country when we have had to bow our backs and when \nwe have had to stand up to an enemy that sought to destroy what America \nstands for. That is exactly what we are doing in Iraq today.\n  What Senator Warner said is that if we make a decision in this body \nto micromanage the war, let's make no mistake about it, if this \namendment passes, what we are really going to be doing is subjecting \nour men and women to greater harm and to the possibility of even \ngreater inflicting of injuries and greater numbers, possibly, of making \nthe ultimate sacrifice. This amendment says there are 435 Members of \nthe House of Representatives and 100 Members of the Senate who have \ndetermined that this is the rotation that should be carried out by our \nmilitary leadership relative to the conflict in Iraq, and that is a \nmicromanagement of the war from the Halls of Congress versus the \nmanagement of this conflict on the ground in theater by our military \nleadership in Iraq.\n  If we do micromanage this war, exactly what Senator Warner said is \nwhat is going to happen, and that is, today in Iraq, the most dangerous \nweapon that is being fired at our brave men and women who wear our \nuniform and are protecting the freedom is what we call the IED and the \nEFPs. These particular weapons are inflicting injuries on our men and \nwomen, and are inflicting death on our men and women, requiring them to \nmake the ultimate sacrifice for our sake. We have a very limited number \nof trained military personnel who are experts in the area of detecting \nand defusing IEDs and EFPs. If we put those men and women on a \nmandatory rotation, then we are setting our men and women in uniform up \nfor failure.\n  I have had a policy since I have been elected to Congress of not \ntrying to make decisions on military issues relative to my personal \nfeelings and my personal beliefs. My decisions have been based upon \ninformation I have received from our military leadership, both inside \nand outside the Pentagon, some civilian folks as well as men and women \nin uniform, who are more expert in these areas than I am.\n  In this case, I listened very closely last week as General Petraeus \nand Ambassador Crocker came to Congress and spent the whole day Monday \nwith the House of Representatives, the whole day Tuesday in the Senate, \ntestifying, answering every question that was propounded to them about \nwhat is going on relative to the new vision and the new strategy on the \nground in Iraq. What I heard from those men who are the leaders from a \ndiplomatic standpoint as well as from the military standpoint is we are \nseeing great progress made on the ground by our military that is unlike \nany progress we have seen during the last 4\\1/2\\ years. That is \nsignificant.\n  If you are not impressed by that, then you simply did not hear what \nthey had to say. So I think now to say to them: Well, we appreciate the \ngreat job you have done leading our troops, but we are going to take \nthe decision-making process out of your hands, and we are now going to \ndecide how the war is going to be prosecuted, that, I think would be a \nhuge mistake.\n  The Pentagon and the civilian side have responded to the Webb \namendment and said this, that if the Webb amendment passes:\n\n       Operations and plans would need to be significantly \n     altered. Units or individuals without sufficient dwell time \n     would need a waiver to deploy based on threat. This waiver \n     process adds time, cost, and uncertainty to deployment \n     planning.\n\n  Secondly:\n\n       In emergency situations, the waiver process could affect \n     the war fight itself by delaying forces needed in theater.\n\n  Thirdly:\n\n       Units would need to be selected for deployment based on \n     dwell criteria that may in fact cause significant disruption \n     to needed reset, planned transformation or unit training \n     schedules.\n\n  Fourthly:\n\n       The Department routinely deploys units at less than a one-\n     to-one deployment-to-dwell ratio if the individuals within a \n     unit meet minimum dwell requirements.\n\n  The proposed language stipulates minimum periods between deployments \nfor both units and individuals. The requirement to meet both criteria \nfor unit and individuals before deployment could severely limit the \noptions for sourcing rotations.\n  And more specifically and directly to the point, in a letter dated \nSeptember 18, 2007, from the Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, to \nSenator Lindsey Graham, I quote a comment made by the Secretary. He \nsays:\n\n       The cumulative effect of the above steps [and he had \n     outlined the Webb amendment] necessary to comply with Senator \n     Webb's amendment, in our judgment, would significantly \n     increase the risk to our servicemembers.\n\n  Now, this is one of the military experts in the United States of \nAmerica, the chief civilian military officer, saying: If this amendment \npasses, it could significantly--it would significantly increase the \nrisk to our servicemembers. And yet some folks are going to vote in \nfavor of this amendment in spite of the fact that the chief civilian \nmilitary leader of the United States says it has the potential to \nsignificantly increase the risk to our men and women in uniform.\n  The power of Congress under article I of the Constitution to make \nrules for the Government and the regulation of the land and naval \nforces is well understood, as is the President's authority under \narticle II, to command our military forces as commander-in-chief. This \namendment, however, is an unprecedented wartime attempt to limit the \nauthority of the President and the military leaders by declaring a \nsubstantial number of troops and units unavailable.\n\n  Now, again, let me close by saying I wish we could bring everybody \nhome tomorrow and that this conflict would be over. We know we are \ngoing to be in this conflict for a long time. The President could not \nhave been clearer on that issue when, on September 17, 2001, in a \nstatement to a joint session of both the House and the Senate, he said:\n\n       This is going to be a long and enduring war.\n\n  He was right then, and he is right now. This is a long and enduring \nwar. It is not dictated by the brave and professional job our men and \nwomen are doing, but it is dictated by a vicious enemy that seeks to \ndestroy everything that is good about America.\n  We have men and women who are serving today in an all-volunteer Army, \nNavy, Air Force, Marine Corps. They are very dedicated men and women. \nThey know the mission they have to carry out in Iraq. I know because I \nhave been there five times. I have talked with them with their boots on \nthe ground, including about 3 months ago when I had an opportunity to \nvisit with a number of soldiers in an area that had just been cleaned \nout, an area in Al Anbar Province called Ramadi.\n  Ramadi, a year ago this month, was the self-declared capital of al-\nQaida in Iraq by al-Qaida itself. Today, because of the great job and \nthe professional job our men and women, fighting side by side with \nmembers of the Iraqi Army and other coalition forces, is clear of al-\nQaida. But if we seek to limit the ability of our leadership, if we \nseek to micromanage the war from the Halls of Congress versus on the \nground by our leadership in Iraq, then the potential is certainly there \nfor an immediate return of al-Qaida in Iraq to places such as Ramadi.\n  There is no more important time in the history of our country than \nthe present. That has been the case in so many situations. Certainly \nthis is a very critical time in the history of our country from the \nstandpoint of the ability of future generations to live in the same \nsafe and secure America every previous generation has enjoyed. There is \nno better way to ensure that, than to make sure we prevail and we win \nin Iraq.\n  It is my opinion and the opinion of military leadership, the passage \nof this amendment leads this nation down a trail of exposure to those \nwho seek to do us harm, when what we need to be doing is listening \nthose men and women who are serving proudly to secure our future \ngenerations from the enemy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore (Mr. CARDIN). The Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a supporter of the Webb \namendment. I want to compliment the Senator from Virginia for offering \nthat amendment. Although he is a freshman Senator, he certainly is no \nstranger to war a combat veteran, a warrior's warrior, and he\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\nis fully aware of the stresses the men and our military are facing \nalong with their families.\n  I support the Webb amendment, and I support it for several reasons. \nOne, I want to talk about the surge. I called it an escalation. The \nescalation was to send more troops to give the Iraqis more time to come \nup with a political solution.\n  Well, I wish to salute our troops. For those who are on the ground, \nthe basic number, for those who were part of the escalation, we want to \nsupport them for doing their duty, and doing their duty so well. I \nthink by every account, regardless of how one feels about the war, one \nis very proud of the men and women who are part of our military, who \nhave been on the ground, and have been on the job. They have done their \npart. And that is what the two reports we got last week are, that if \nyou send in more people, the violence will temporarily come down. But \nwhat happens when you do not keep that level? Well, that is a point of \ndiscussion.\n  Let's go back to why they went. They went this summer, in blazing \nheat, with blazing guns, to give the Iraqis more time. And what did the \nIraqis do while our guys and gals were out there in 100-pound armor, \ntrying to avoid IEDs? The Iraqis took a vacation. More time. More time. \nMore time. What is wrong with this picture? So what did more time get \nus? It got us nowhere. With their 2-month break, they still did not go \nanywhere near a political solution. Now we are told we have got to keep \nthis up, and we could be there indefinitely because of what? The Iraqis \nneed more time.\n  Well, I think we are out of time. I think we are genuinely out of \ntime. This is why I support the Webb amendment, because I think we need \na different direction. I think we need a different direction in Iraq to \ndo what we can to contain the violence and also to move ahead with a \npolitical solution. I am going to support the Webb amendment because I \nam never going to vote to cut off money. I will vote to protect our \ntroops, and the best way is at least to give them more time while we \nare giving the Iraqis more time.\n  How about giving our troops more time to be at home? I am really hot \nabout this. One hundred six degrees in July, they took a break; 110 \ndegrees in Baghdad, our troops are there, they took a break--they, the \nIraqis, took a break.\n  I am also going to be supporting the Biden amendment, because if the \nIraqis will not come up with a political solution, now with the so-\ncalled soft position, it is time to go to the international community \nand see if there needs to a hard solution.\n  I am beginning to explore and believe that perhaps Iraq needs to be \npartitioned. Part of our solution, though, is while the Iraqis want \nmore time, I want more time for our troops. I want more time for our \ntroops to be at home. That is why I am supporting this brilliant \namendment by Senator Jim Webb, for our men and our women in the \nmilitary.\n  We know what his amendment says is that they have to be at home for \nat least as long as the length of their last deployment. So if they \nwere there for 15 months, they should be home for 15 months. Then, for \nthe National Guard and for the Reserves, no one would be redeployed \nwithin 3 years of their previous deployment.\n  Why is that important? It is not only important for the Guard and the \nReservists, but as the Presiding Officer knows, when a National Guards \nperson goes to meet their duty, their employer in many instances is \nrequired to keep that job open, or they at least have that as a \ncommitment of honor.\n  That used to be 6 months. Now it is 15 months, and home again, back \nagain, while the Iraqis want more time. Our employers are wondering how \nthey can keep those jobs open because they don't want to turn their \nbacks on the military.\n  We have to get real here. A $20,000 bonus for a quick fix, quickly \ntrained military doesn't cut it. Jim Webb is really onto something. Our \nmilitary is overstretched. Our troops are exhausted. Their families are \nliving with tremendous stress. Every day they wonder what is happening. \nEvery day a family that hears a news report about another attack \nwonders if their loved one was in it. Every time they are at home and \nthey hear: CNN, breaking, 4 U.S. military killed, 10 killed, 4 killed, \nthey first listen; is it in the zone where my husband or my wife or my \nson or daughter is? Then when they hear that, they think: Is it the \nArmy or the Marines? They want to know because what they are doing is \nwondering how close to home it is.\n  Then they hear that news. For some, it is unbearable news. But all of \nthe news is unbearable for the families at home. We are crushing the \nvery spirit these families have to keep them going. It is not that they \nwent once; it is that they go again. And no sooner do they come back \nand say: Hello, honey, I think your name is Mary Beth, than they have \nto go back out again. What are we doing to our families?\n  I want more time for the troops. I want to give them more time the \nway the Iraqi politicians want more time. When we think about our \ntroops, we know what they are laboring under. You have heard me say it \nbefore. I check the temperature every day in Baghdad. Yesterday, it was \n102 degrees. For us, it was 73, a beautiful day. What a day to be out \non the bay. I know a lot of our National Guard already deployed would \nlove to be there. I think about our troops, carrying 100 pounds of \narmor in brutal heat, being shot at, being attacked by IEDs, while we \nhave a policy that is going to give the Iraqis more time, while they \nare there doing their duty. Let's talk about these families.\n  In World War II, the military would say: If the Army wanted you to \nhave a wife, we would have issued you one. It was primarily a single \nmilitary. That is not true today. For our families, the stress of \nmaintaining a family during all of this while a spouse is at war is an \nenormous stress. Not only are they facing traumatic stress, but so is \nthe spouse at home. They are trying to protect their children. They are \ntrying to shield their children. The children wonder: How is daddy \ndoing; how is mommy doing? The children learn e-mail. They e-mail mom. \nThey e-mail dad. I know how they communicate. Mom and dad will \ncommunicate by e-mail. The little guys and gals will often read the \nfirst paragraph, but the last two paragraphs are spouse-to-spouse \ntalking about what is going on. The tension, the fear, the anxiety and, \nI might add, the financial stress as well is amazing. We are talking \nabout 19-year-olds, 21-year-olds. We are talking about people with two \nand three children. But we have to give the Iraqis more time.\n  Well, we are out of time. I know my time is up on the floor, but I \nwill tell you, I am going to vote for this Webb amendment because I am \ngoing to give our troops more time. I am going to vote to give our \ntroops more time at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nspeaker on our side be Senator Kyl. He has asked to be in line on this \nside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I last came to the floor to speak on the \nsubject of the way ahead in Iraq. Since that time, significant events, \nboth good and bad, have occurred. First and foremost, General Petraeus \nhas presented to the Congress a candid and encouraging assessment that \nthe new strategy in Iraq has shifted the momentum in our favor. The \ntestimony by the general and by Ambassador Crocker reinforced what I \nand my congressional delegation in May saw in Iraq and what I have \nheard directly from troops on the ground. The Petraeus \ncounterinsurgency strategy, which is clear an area, move in with local \nforces, hold it, and then help them build their community, enlisting \nthe locals in fighting the terrorist and showing them security is \nworking--this is the strategy which, last year, I and many of our \ncolleagues were asking for. The old strategy without enough people, \nwithout a permanent presence in the community, was not working. Well, \nit is starting to work now. But General Petraeus has proposed minor \nimmediate withdrawals, withdrawals that are based on the commander's \nrecommendations and security conditions, not Washington politics or \nmicromanaging from this wonderful air-conditioned building.\n  The President used the term ``return on success.'' That is the term I \nhope we\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\nwill embrace. These brave men and women went over there as volunteers \nto accomplish a mission. We need to allow them to work with the \ncommanders to accomplish that mission. Even General Petraeus testified \nthat the new strategy had reversed the trajectory of the war. He said: \n``Al Qaeda is on the run. Security incidents'' since the surge began \nhave fallen in 8 of the last 12 weeks. Civilian deaths have decreased \nby 45 percent. Ethno-sectarian deaths are down 55 percent, and attacks \nin Al Anbar are down 85 percent.\n\n  For all the attempts by the antiwar movement to discredit General \nPetraeus--and I will address that--he demonstrated enough military \nprogress from his new counterinsurgency strategy to conclude that ``we \nhave a realistic chance of achieving our objectives in Iraq.''\n  Secretary Gates on Monday gave a speech in which he said:\n\n       For America to leave Iraq and the Middle East in chaos \n     would betray and demoralize our allies there and in the \n     region, while emboldening our most dangerous adversaries. To \n     abandon an Iraq where just two years ago 12 million people \n     quite literally risked their lives to vote for a \n     constitutional democracy would be an offense to our interests \n     as well as our values, a setback for the cause of freedom as \n     well as the goal of stability.\n       We must realize and recognize that the institutions that \n     underpin an enduring free society can only take root over \n     time.\n\n  Secretary Gates was absolutely right. One only needs to look at our \nown history to understand this. After a long, bloody revolution, a \ncivil war, a struggle for women's suffrage, and a civil rights \nmovement, some 150 years later, democracy is still a work in progress.\n  Just as Ambassador Crocker testified:\n\n       Iraq is experiencing a revolution, not a regime change.\n\n  Difficult challenges remain. Political progress in Iraq has been too \nslow. They have done some things. Actually, they have passed a few \nbills. In this body, we haven't passed an appropriations bill or a \nDefense authorization bill yet. We took August off ourselves. It is \nkind of tough for us to claim that the Iraqi Parliament is not doing \nits job when we can't seem to get our job done.\n  On the political front in Iraq, the Government is already sharing oil \nrevenues among provinces. They are reaching out to former Baathists, \nallowing them to participate in the army and the Government. As I said, \nmillions turned out to vote. It will take time for them, just as \nAmerica's revolution did, but the benefits of a stable Iraq as an ally \nto the United States in the most volatile region of the world would be \na major blow to terrorism, al-Qaida, and Iran's religious extremists.\n  Let me be clear: Our national security interest for the near and \nintermediate term is preventing chaos, genocide, and a regionwide war. \nThat is our interest there, that is why our troops are there, because \nif they left, we could be facing far greater challenges, likely attacks \non the United States and potentially a regionwide war. Our Intelligence \nCommittee has long warned that precipitous withdrawal would create \nchaos and those impacts. If we were to be driven out of Iraq on the \nterms of terrorists and political timelines, terrorists from the Middle \nEast to Southeast Asia to Europe to Africa would be emboldened to \nspread their fear, oppression of women, death and destruction, just as \nthey were emboldened when we failed to respond appropriately to \nbombings of the USS Cole, Khobar Towers, embassies in Iraq, and the \n1993 attack on the World Trade Center--all instances in which civilians \nand servicemembers were murdered.\n  Despite General Petraeus's testimony, despite our intelligence \ncommunity warnings, and despite Secretary Gates's recent remarks, some \nwar opponents continue to want to cede defeat. They refuse to listen to \nthe advice of commanders. They ignore the consequences of a political \nwithdrawal and the problems about which the Intelligence Committee \nwarned.\n  I am very concerned about the amendment before us. I urge my \ncolleagues to think about it and then vote against it. This is an \namendment which would micromanage the war. Even a few of its supporters \nhave been forthright enough to admit that it is a backdoor way of \nachieving what they want, which is defeat in Iraq by a premature \nwithdrawal, because they know the chaos this would spread. They know \nwhat would happen if we tried to implement this into law. As Secretary \nGates said on FOX News, such congressional meddling would mean force \nmanagement, make problems that would be extremely difficult, and affect \ncombat effectiveness and perhaps pose greater risk to our troops. He \nsaid when lawmakers intrude into this process, they could produce gaps \nduring which one unit pulling out would not be immediately replaced by \nanother, and as a result, they would have an area of combat operations \nwith no U.S. forces, and the troops coming in would be at greater risk.\n  Contrary to the notion of its supporters that the measure would give \nthe Armed Forces relief, it actually might force greater use of the \nNational Guard and reservists. I am concerned about the National Guard \nand Reserve; they have been overstressed. I am concerned about our \nmilitary; they have been overstressed. You know what happened? After \nthe first gulf war in the 1990s, we slashed the size of our military. \nWe slashed it far too much. The President recommended; the Congress \nwent along with it. We slashed it too far. We are starting to rebuild. \nWe have a very dangerous world. We need to have a military ready to \nrespond.\n  Let me talk about the troops. I hear from a lot of them. I hear from \nmy son, who is on his second tour in Iraq. He is a sniper platoon \ncommander. He says he can only speak for 30 or 40 marines, but the one \nthing they understand is they want to complete their mission. They want \nto come home. Sure, they would like to be home. But they signed up for \na mission. They don't want to withdraw, see all their contributions and \nsacrifices go for naught. They know that meddling in the war strategy, \ncut and withdrawal, cut and jog, or tying up the management of the war \nwould be a disaster. They know that al-Qaida and the enemy is hoping \nthat will happen.\n  This amendment is not as straightforward as cutting funding or \nwithdrawing the troops, but it is perhaps more dangerous. That is why I \nurge my colleagues to stand up for the men and women who might be put \nat greater risk, and our national security interests, by refusing the \namendment.\n  I want to talk about another part of this debate that is very \nshameful. MoveOn.org's attack depicting General Petraeus as ``Betray \nUs'' should be condemned, period.\n  It was an attack on the integrity of an intellectual, distinguished, \nand patriotic officer serving his Nation during a time of war, with the \nconfidence of his troops behind him.\n  Make no mistake about it, discussing and condemning MoveOn.org's ad \nis not a sideshow or a distraction. In fact, it is paramount in a time \nof war we condemn the trashing of decorated military officers highly \nrespected by their troops, and this one unanimously approved by this \nbody, in order to achieve a political objective.\n  Marty Conaster, commander of the American Legion said:\n\n       As Americans, we all have a duty to speak up when our \n     uniformed heroes are slandered.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The libelous attack on a general is not the American \n     Legion's primary concern about the anti-war movement. Our \n     concern is for the private, the sergeant, the lieutenant and \n     the major. If a distinguished general could be attacked in \n     such a manner, what can the rank-and-file soldier expect when \n     he or she returns home?\n\n  Sadly, the MoveOn.org ad is emblematic of a broader struggle by \nopponents of the war to muzzle other experts and discredit their views.\n  It is this tactic of desperation and, ironically, one that attempts \nto distract the American people from the realities of the threat our \nNation and our allies face from terrorism.\n  Sadly, Mr. Presiident, this effort is being used to attack another \ndistinguished military man approved by this body. It has to do with the \nfield of intelligence, and this is another area we learned is \ncritically important on our Intelligence Committee delegation to Iraq \nin May.\n  When we were in Iraq, one of our key generals expressed his great \nfrustration that old provisions of the FISA law were blocking him from \nkeeping our troops in the field safe. Well, I have some good news on \nthat front, and I\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\nthank the Members of this body on both sides of the aisle who, on a \nbipartisan basis, approved the Protect America Act on August 3 and \nAugust 4. That has opened up the lines of communications, the lines of \nintelligence for our troops in the field, for our safety here at home \nand homeland security. It has been very important and it eliminated a \nblockage that was critical.\n  Now, after we passed it, I have heard some critics, most recently, \nnotably, in the House who have been trying to rewrite history and say \nthe law did things it did not do. They have tried to discredit ADM Mike \nMcConnell, the Director of National Intelligence. I am compelled to set \nthe record straight.\n  As vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and sponsor of \nthe Protect America Act, I was the lead negotiator during the final \nhours as Congress acted to pass a critical short-term update to our \nNation's law governing terrorist surveillance. As one who was there, I \ndispute the misinformation being spread by some, and largely those who \nwere not there, and I will outline the events as they occurred. For my \ncolleagues and members of the press who are interested in the other \nside of the story, here is what happened.\n  First, the timeline of events:\n  In January, the President announced his Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram was being put under the FISA Court, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act Court. Our Director of National Intelligence, the DNI, \nsubsequently stated that after that time the intelligence community \nlost a significant amount of its collection capability because of the \nfact that the law, as interpreted, did not square with the technology \nnow in place and it was imposing unwarranted limitations we had not had \nwhen we were collecting radio communications, and he asked the Congress \nto modernize FISA sooner rather than later.\n  As I said, when we toured Iraq in May, our Joint Special Operations \nCommander, LTG Stan McChrystal, told us the blockage in electronic \nsurveillance by FISA was substantially hurting his ability to gain the \nintelligence he needed to protect our troops in the field and gain an \noffensive advantage.\n  On April 12, the DNI sent his full FISA modernization proposal to \nCongress. On May 1, DNI McConnell presented it in open session to the \nSenate Intelligence Committee. Immediately following the admiral's \ntestimony, I urged that our committee mark up FISA legislation. The \nreply was until the President turned over certain legal opinions from \nthe surveillance program, Congress would not modernize FISA.\n  That Congress would hold American security hostage to receiving \ndocuments from a program that no longer existed was disheartening. We \nhave received an inordinate amount of documents from the Department of \nJustice and the DNI. Yet I do not dispute the desire or the right of \nMembers to seek a few important documents from the executive branch. In \nfact, I have joined in requesting those. But I did disagree with \nholding up FISA modernization when those documents are not necessary to \ndo that. Now, despite the urging from the DNI and knowing this outdated \nlaw was harming our terrorist surveillance capabilities, for more than \n3 months Congress chose to do nothing.\n  In late June, Admiral McConnell briefed Members of the Senate again \nurging us to modernize FISA. Finally, his pleadings began to gain \ntraction.\n  In mid-July, Members of Congress agreed to discuss a short-term, \nscaled-down version of FISA to protect the country for the next few \nmonths before we could address comprehensive reform this fall. Admiral \nMcConnell immediately sent Congress his scaled-down proposal.\n  Over the next week, Admiral McConnell was given nearly a half dozen \nversions of unvetted proposals from various congressional staffs across \nCongress and then pressed for instant support of these proposals. The \nadmiral returned a compromise proposal, including some of the \nprovisions requested.\n  Finally, we in this body on August 3 and in the House on August 4 \npassed, on a bipartisan basis, the Protect America Act.\n  I am pleased that the admiral and I could include in the measure we \npassed several important changes suggested by members of the majority \nparty. We recognized this legislation still needs to be clarified, but \nit allowed the intelligence community to collect very important foreign \nintelligence targeted at foreign sources to keep our troops and \nAmericans here at home safe.\n  After the passage of the act, I spoke with a number of members of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, and I am confident now that we will be \nable to craft an improved, permanent version of FISA. So there is good \nnews on that front. But now that I have laid out the timeline of sorts, \nI do need to address some recent attempts, primarily in the other body, \nto discredit our Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell.\n  As I said with General Petraeus, unfortunately, the M.O. for some is \nattacking military leaders. Here, as others attacked Petraeus, they are \nattacking personally another honorable man. I am disappointed with \nthose who are charging Admiral McConnell with partisanship and \nduplicity for their own political gains.\n  Despite accusations to the contrary, Admiral McConnell never agreed \nto any proposal he had not seen in writing by congressional staff. \nThere were indeed several dialogs where concepts were discussed, but I \nnoted that Admiral McConnell at the end of every discussion said he \nneeded to see and review with these leaders the congressional language \nin writing before he could support it. It is a good thing he objected \nbecause I was present when several elements of FISA were agreed to that \nthe DNI and I wanted but subsequently and notably were absent from \ncongressional proposals later sent to the admiral.\n\n  Unfortunately, this bait-and-switch during negotiations was not the \nonly disappointment. There were efforts by some to circumvent the \ncommittee process and craft legislation behind closed doors without \ninput from the relevant committee or from the minority side of the \naisle. Even as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I was \nexcluded from most of the key meetings. Not only was I excluded, but \nmost members of the Intelligence Committee, Republicans and Democrats, \nwere left out of the process. Despite attempts to leave out key Members \nof Congress during the last negotiations, I think we are on the right \ntrack. I am confident the Senate Intelligence Committee can pass \ncomprehensive FISA reform, and we have engaged in very positive and \nencouraging talks, not just--obviously, I have talked with the \nchairman, Chairman Rockefeller. The Democrats and Republicans in the \nSenate are making great progress. We are working on the issue, and I \nhave confidence that colleagues on both sides of the aisle can come \ntogether on this issue.\n  Unfortunately, again, today, another Member of the House is trying to \ndemonize to the American public the Protect America Act that we passed \nin August, saying the bill went too far and was a power grab of \nexecutive power. They wrongly claim the law allows warrantless searches \nof Americans' homes, offices, and computers and reduces the FISA Court \nto a rubberstamp. That is absolutely flat dead wrong.\n  While I agree, as I said earlier, the law can be improved, clarified, \nnothing could be further from the truth. Quite the opposite, the law \ngave the FISA Court a greater role than it was ever meant to have when \nFISA was passed in 1978. This Protect America Act in no way allows for \nwarrantless physical searches of Americans' homes, offices, and \ncomputers. This sort of inaccurate fear-mongering should have no place \nin this debate.\n  I am counting on cooler heads to prevail in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, and in the committee we are making real progress. I think \nwith the members we have on our committee, we have a great chance to \nget an even better bill forging bipartisan solutions that will deal \nwith some questions probably not contemplated when the initial proposal \ncame up to us. We have a lot of different opinions, but all our members \nwant to do what is best for national security and best ensures privacy \nprotections. The key is working out just the right balance, and I am \noptimistic we will do so.\n  As we saw in the strong bipartisan support for the Protect America \nAct,\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\nwe can act in a bipartisan manner to protect terrorist surveillance--a \ncritical early warning system--while protecting the civil liberties of \nordinary Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a brief editorial from \nInvestor's Business Daily called ``Mettle Vs. Meddle,'' referring \nessentially to the amendment before us, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Mettle Vs. Meddle\n\n       After last year's elections gave them a slim majority, \n     Senate Democrats enthusiastically endorsed President Bush's \n     choice of Robert Gates to replace Donald Rumsfeld as \n     secretary of defense--with not a single one of them voting \n     against his nomination.\n       As Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin, the Democrat \n     from Michigan, wished Gates well at that time, he said he \n     hoped the new Pentagon chief would ``speak truth to power.'' \n     Gates certainly did that on Fox News Sunday--telling the \n     powers that be in Congress the truth about their impending \n     attempts at micromanaging the war in Iraq. Gates called the \n     Democrats' plan to require that troops spend as much time at \n     home as in the field ``pretty much a back-door effort to get \n     the president to accelerate the drawdown so that it's an \n     automatic kind of thing, rather than based on the conditions \n     in Iraq.'' While on Fox News, Gates also said:\n       ``The president would never approve such a bill,'' and the \n     secretary would personally recommend a veto.\n       Such congressional meddling would ``force management \n     problems that would be extremely difficult and . . . affect \n     combat effectiveness and perhaps pose greater risk to our \n     troops.''\n       Intrusions by lawmakers would produce gaps during which ``a \n     unit pulling out would not be immediately replaced by \n     another, so you'd have an area of combat operations where no \n     U.S. forces would be present for a period, and the troops \n     coming in would then face a much more difficult situation.''\n       Contrary to the Democrats' notion that the measure would \n     give the armed forces relief, it actually might force greater \n     use of the National Guard and reservists.\n       Gates stressed that ``the consequences of getting this \n     wrong--for Iraq, for the region, for us--are enormous.''\n       He added: ``The extremist Islamists were so empowered by \n     the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, if they were \n     to be seen or could claim a victory over us in Iraq, it would \n     be far, far more empowering in the region than the defeat of \n     the Soviet Union.''\n       Compare that sober warning with House Defense \n     Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman John Murtha's appearance \n     at the National Press Club on Monday, in which the \n     Pennsylvania Democrat blustered that Iraq would cost as many \n     as 50 House Republican seats in the 2008 elections.\n       Gates and his boss are obviously interested in America and \n     the rest of the free world winning the global war on terror. \n     The war Murtha and so many of his fellow top Democrats seem \n     interested in winning is the political one being waged in \n     Washington.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to emphasize yet again the very \nminimal adjustment this amendment is asking for in terms of policy and \nto also emphasize again it is well within the Constitution and within \nprecedent--article I, section 8.\n  The precedent is a similar phenomenon as to the issues that are \nfacing us today, just on the other side of the deployment schedule, \nfrom the Korean war. When our troops were being sent into harm's way \nwithout proper training, the Congress stepped in. It overruled an \nadministration that was doing that. It set a minimum standard of \ndeployment. We are attempting to do the same thing on the other end.\n  There seems to be a great deal of question in our national debate as \nto what exactly ``dwell time'' means. I was in a discussion with \nLieutenant Colonel Martinez, who is an Army fellow in the Senate who \nhas extensive command experience at all levels up to the battalion \nlevel, as I recall, in many different theaters, just trying to put \ntogether notionally what goes on when military units are home after \ndeployment.\n  So I have an outline, Mr. President, which I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Major Tasks That Occur During A One Year Dwell Time\n\n       Month 1: One week-two weeks to redeploy the BCT from \n     theater; ``Re-integration'' training; normally 2-3 weeks \n     long; Single Soldier Barracks reassignments.\n       Month 2: 21 days to 30 days ``Block Leave''; Activation of \n     Headquarters; Rear-Detachment Headquarters disbanded; Begin \n     recovery of equipment that was shipped from OIF or OEF.\n       Months 3-5: Recovery operations of equipment; Personnel \n     receive orders (if they haven't already) for reassignment--\n     needs of the Army (Recruiting, Drill Instructor, Instructors \n     at Training Centers); for individual requirements; and to \n     fulfill reenlistment options; Newly assigned personnel \n     arrive--intent is to create a one-for-one equation for \n     losses.\n       Month 6: Individual training, crew training, team training, \n     squad-level training; very limited platoon level training; \n     Major reset and refit of major pacing items of equipment--\n     major weapon systems are enrolled into maintenance; \n     Leadership and key personnel receive plans and operational \n     guidance for pending deployment (D-180); Small core of \n     personnel deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan for a 10-day \n     reconnaissance; logisticians deploy to Kuwait to inspect \n     pending stocks; Deployment orders lock in personnel.\n       Month 7: Platoon and company level training--limited \n     resources to conduct quality training; 2-3 weeks deployed in \n     the field; Deployment training continues--key leaders deploy \n     to a National Training Center (Fort Polk, Fort Irwin, \n     Hoensfel, GE); 2-3 weeks deployed to these centers; \n     Maintenance of critical weapon systems and equipment \n     continues.\n       Month 8: Leadership and Key Leaders tied into Command and \n     Control exercises and begin interfacing directly with units \n     in Iraq or Afghanistan--reverse training cycle (evenings) to \n     stay in touch with Baghdad and Kabul times-zones; Units begin \n     reporting combat readiness and deployment issues to DA; \n     Battalion (minus) collective training--2-3 weeks deployed to \n     the field; Maintenance of critical weapon systems and \n     equipment continues.\n       Month 9: Ship equipment to a National Training Center for \n     Mission Rehearsal Exercise; Ship equipment to theater; Short \n     block leave period (2 weeks).\n       Month 10: Brigade and Battalion level Mission Rehearsal \n     Exercise--3-4 weeks deployed (units at 75% strength, at \n     best).\n       Month 11: Advanced Party Personnel pack equipment and \n     depart; Final Non-deployment personnel are identified--unit \n     request for fills is submitted; other divisional units and \n     the Army begin to provide replacements; Main Body Personnel \n     pack equipment; Limited individual to squad level training \n     continues; Major equipment systems return to unit; inspected, \n     packed, shipped to theater as required or will be taken with \n     Main Body.\n       Month 12: Active Rear Detachment; Replacements continue to \n     arrive; Begin final packing; Deployment Training \n     (Administrative Tasks); Begin Deployment.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. But I would like to mention some points out of this \noutline. It is a very good survey of the types of things our soldiers \nhave to do.\n  So put yourself in the mind of a soldier who has just finished a 15-\nmonth deployment in Iraq. When they come home for a year, which is all \nthey get now after a 15-month deployment, they do not sit around and \nget to know their family and have rest time. There is a little bit of \nthat, but month by month during these 12 months of dwell time before \nthey have to redeploy, these are the types of things they do:\n  In the first month, they have 1 to 2 weeks of redeployment from the \ntheater back home. That is a part of that first month. They have what \nis called reintegration training for a couple weeks.\n  In the second month, there is ``block leave,'' but then they activate \nthe headquarters. They begin recovery of equipment that was shipped.\n  In the third through the fifth months, they have recovery operations \nof their equipment. They have the requirement of bringing in newly \nassigned people, the typical adjustment at the top and at the bottom \nwhich requires a great deal of command supervision in terms of bringing \nthese people and assimilating them into the units.\n  In the sixth month, they have individual training, crew training, \nteam training, squad-level training, and begin platoon training. A \nsmall core of their personnel at the top actually have to deploy back \nto Iraq or Afghanistan for 10-day reconnaissance.\n  In the seventh month, they have more platoon and company-level \ntraining, and 2 to 3 weeks out of that 1 month are out in the field.\n  In the eighth month, they have command and control exercises. They \nhave units beginning to report their readiness status to the Department \nof the Army. They do collective training, just below the battalion \nlevel. And 2 to 3 weeks, again, out of that month are in the field.\n  In the ninth month, they start shipping equipment, which is a 24/7 \nprocess, shipping equipment to a national training center, shipping \nequipment back to\n\n[[Page S11718]]\n\ntheater. The 10th month, they have rehearsal exercises, brigade and \nbattalion level. These are 3 to 4 weeks out of that one month where \nthey--and at this point these units are approximately 75 percent full \nstrength. So what happens then? You have a unit which is 75 percent \nfull strength which is going to deploy, and they start bringing people \nin. They call it backfill. It is also predominant in the Marine Corps. \nThey start bringing people in who have been home, in many cases, less \nthan even the people in this unit.\n\n  The 11th month, you have the advanced party personnel leaving, \npacking their gear and going. You have your final personnel being \nselected. You go back to individual training, major equipment systems \nreturning to the unit, inspected, packed, and shipped to theater.\n  The 12th month, you activate rear detachments, you assimilate your \nfinal replacements, and you deploy.\n  So that is the year, which is called dwell time after a 15-month \ndeployment. Obviously, what occurs after that 12-month cycle of dwell \ntime is another combat deployment.\n  So that is the situation we are addressing. That is the situation \nthat, in my view, we need to bring the Congress in as a referee. Why? I \nwill give you one example. When the Chief of Staff of the Army called \nme to tell me they were going to 15-month deployment cycles several \nmonths ago, moving from 12- to 15-month deployment cycles, I was \nstunned. I said: How can you do this? How can you not stand up and \nresist the notion that your troops are going to be deployed for 15 \nmonths with only 12 months at home? He said: Senator, I only feed the \nstrategy; I don't make the strategy. Yet when we had General Petraeus \nbefore the Armed Services Committee and Senator Nelson of Florida asked \nhim about this dwell-time problem, he basically said: Talk to the Chief \nof Staff of the Army. He is the person who gives us our people.\n  So when you have that kind of a situation, and this sort of activity \nthat goes on when people are arguably out of theater, we need a result. \nWe need a resolution. We need people who are going to stand up and say, \nbasically, however long you have been gone, you get that much back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will take a minute to say to my \ncolleagues we have several speakers lined up, and if Senators would \ncome over and speak and also call as to whether you wish to speak and \nhow much time, because we, I think, are close to entering into an \nagreement on speakers and also a time agreement so we can set a time \nfor the vote on the Webb amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition \nof the Webb amendment, that a side-by-side alternative to the Webb \namendment be considered, which is in keeping with the agreement--well, \nI withdraw my request because I will wait until Senator Levin comes so \nthere is no misunderstanding, except to say we do intend, after the \ndisposition of the Webb amendment, to propose a side-by-side amendment \nwhich then we, I hope, could act on quickly because it is basically the \ndebate we have been having. There is also the habeas amendment pending, \nas I understand it, and negotiations I think are still going on with \nregard to that issue. I hope we could get that resolved, and then we \nwill try to nail down the number of amendments so we can address the \nissue of Iraq and associated amendments so we can then move forward \nwith the rest of the DOD authorization bill.\n  I will very soon have conversations with Senator Levin, but in the \nmeantime, if there are those on either side who wish to speak on this \namendment, please make their wishes known, and the length of their \nstatement, so we can begin to put together a unanimous consent \nagreement, which would then allow for a vote on the Webb amendment. I \nsay this after having had discussions with Senator Webb on the issue.\n  I wish to make one additional comment. Dr. Kissinger had a piece in \nthe Washington Post on Sunday which I had printed in yesterday's \nRecord. I also commend to my colleague an article by Frederick W. Kagan \nentitled ``A Web of Problems.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know there are others who \nwish to speak. I would like to reiterate what Senator McCain and \nSenator Warner have said with regard to the pending amendment. All of \nus have the utmost regard for the junior Senator from Virginia and his \nintentions with respect to this amendment, but it is also true that \ndespite those best intentions, there would be very unfortunate \nconsequences should his amendment be adopted. It has been well \npresented by a number of my colleagues as to what those consequences \nare. Secretary Gates himself has personally responded to the \npossibility of such an amendment being adopted by noting the adverse \nconsequences for his ability and those of the military commanders to \ndeal with the constraints that such an amendment would place on their \nability to deal with individuals and units being deployed.\n  Part of the problem, as I understand it, is the amendment applies not \njust to the units of military combat but the individuals within those \nunits because it relates to the specific amount of time those \nindividuals spend back home either in training or at rest while they \nare not deployed. Part of the problem, as Secretary Gates personally \nrelated to me, is the fact that when you get ready to send a unit \nabroad into theater, especially for a combat mission, you want them to \nbe not only trained together but prepared to do everything our military \ndoes in the middle of combat with a unit-cohesive approach to \nprotecting their friends and carrying out their mission. They do this \nby training together and fighting together.\n  The concern expressed was that if you get into a situation where \nCongress imposes a law on the Executive, which is then binding on the \nmilitary commanders about the exact amount of time that is permitted \nfor troop rotation, that the individuals responsible for putting these \nunits together are going to have to review each and every member within \nthat battalion, for example, to determine whether the appropriate \namount of time back home has been spent as opposed to in theater and, \ntherefore, to the extent they do not meet the criteria, pull them out \nof the units so others then can be plugged in. This may be on the eve \nof deployment. It could be at any point. The result is you do not have \nthe kind of unit cohesiveness you would otherwise. You have people who \nhave been plugged into military units who should have been training \nwith them all along, so when they go into combat, they fight as one. \nThat could put forces at risk.\n  In addition to that, because you will have to draw people from other \nplaces, the concern is it could put greater strain on the Guard and on \nthe Reserve, filling in for slots that are vacant from Active-Duty \npersonnel. The Secretary has spoken to this, as I said. It has been \nwell presented by Members on the floor as to what his concerns are.\n  The last point I would mention, and it is not a small point, is the \nattempt by Congress to dictate very specific terms of operational flow \nof individual members of our military, which is clearly not within the \npurview of Congress's jurisdiction. I know there has been an attempt to \nmake an argument that the Constitution does not prohibit this. You have \nto stretch pretty far as a lawyer to make that argument. It is clear \nunder the Constitution the Founders thought it would be best if the \nPresident, the Executive, be the Commander in Chief of the military \nforces. If anything should fall within his purview as Commander in \nChief, and then within the chain of command to his military commanders, \nit should be the individual soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nfighting in theater, it should be the individual--the decision of those \ncommanders with respect to the deployment of those individuals. That is \nabout as specific and personal as you can get with respect to a \nCommander in Chief's jurisdiction over these fine men and women who \nserve for us.\n  To suggest that Congress actually has the authority to override or to \nbind any future Commander in Chief in this\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\nregard I think is to stretch the Constitution way beyond what the \nFounders thought and way beyond what makes sense. Somebody has to be in \ncharge. You can't have all of us, as smart as we are, as ``armchair \ngenerals'' deciding all of these details of deployments with respect to \nthe members of our military. It does not make sense. As Secretary Gates \nsaid, it could put our folks at risk. Why would we want to do anything \nthat might put them at risk? I know this isn't the intent of the author \nof the amendment, but it is very clear that one of the unfortunate \nconsequences of this is the indirect--the backdoor--influence on the \namount of time we can spend in this surge.\n  It is probably true that as a result, were this amendment to be \nadopted, the way the surge is carried out, the time within which troops \ncould be redeployed home will be adversely affected. That is an \nunfortunate consequence of the amendment.\n  So for all these reasons, I hope my colleagues will be very careful \nabout binding future Presidents, about getting very close to the line \nin terms of constitutional policy--I think going over the line--and \nintruding into an area that could put our forces at risk. Take the \nconcerns of the Secretary of Defense--whom I think all of us have a \ngreat deal of confidence in--take those concerns into account. Don't \ndismiss them. They are very real. I think he has expressed them in a \nmost serious way.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Washington be recognized for 14 minutes and then followed by the \nSenator from Kentucky for 12 minutes; and then I see the Senator from \nMontana on the floor, so the Senator from Montana for 5 minutes, \nfollowed by the Senator from Connecticut--this is going back and forth \non both sides--for 14 minutes. I hope by then we will have been able to \nhave the speakers and their times together so we could set a limit on \nthis debate when everybody is heard.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhelping us work through that.\n  More than 4\\1/2\\ years into this war in Iraq, our troops are \nstretched thin, we all know the equipment is deteriorating, and the \npatience of the Nation is wearing out. We have now seen 3,700 of our \nservicemembers die and thousands and thousands more have been injured. \nMonth after month, our fighting men and women are pushing harder and \nharder and our troops are leaving their loved ones behind for months \nand years and putting their lives on the line without complaint. We owe \nthem the best treatment and the best training possible. Unfortunately, \nthe Bush administration has continually fallen short in doing that.\n  Our country is home to some of the finest fighting forces in the \nworld, and we can all be very proud of that. We need our military to \nremain the best trained, the best equipped, and most prepared force in \nthe world. Tragically, however, the war in Iraq and the President's use \nof extended deployments are now undermining our military's readiness. \nThe current deployment schedule hampers our ability to respond to \nthreats around the world. We know it causes servicemembers to leave the \nmilitary service early. It weakens our ability to respond to disasters \nat home. It unfairly burdens family members and intensifies the combat \nstress our servicemembers experience.\n  We do need to rebuild our military, and the first step is giving our \nfighting men and women the time they need at home to prepare and train \nfor their next mission. So that is why I am on the floor today, to \nspeak to the readiness challenges that threaten our military strength \nand ultimately our Nation's security.\n  Two months ago, I came to the floor and spoke those very same words \nin my effort to support the Webb amendment--virtually the same measure \nwe are now, this afternoon, considering. Member after Member did the \nsame, pleading with our colleagues to join us in this most basic effort \nto truly support our troops. Unfortunately, even though 56 Senators \nvoted in favor, it was blocked by the Republican Senators. Now since \nthat time, 2 months later, more of our troops have died, more have been \nwounded, and more have been subjected to 15-month deployments, without \nhope for the same amount of time at home. Meanwhile, the administration \nhas told us 15-month deployments will continue, and they have \nmaintained their plan to keep 130,000 troops in Iraq.\n  Today we have another chance--another chance to support our troops, \nto support their families, and to return some common sense to our troop \nrotations. We need a few more courageous Senators to join us. Today I \nhope they will.\n\n  Sadly, our forces are being burned out. Many of our troops are on \ntheir third and even fourth tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Months ago, \nthe Department of Defense announced that tours would be extended from \n12 months to 15 months. On top of all that, they are not receiving the \nnecessary time at home before they are sent back to battle.\n  This is not the normal schedule. It is not what our troops signed up \nfor. And we in Congress--those of us who represent these people--should \nnot simply stand by and allow our troops to be pushed beyond their \nlimits like this.\n  Traditionally, active-duty troops are deployed for 1 year and then \nthey rest at home for 2 years. National Guard and Reserve troops are \ndeployed for 1 year and they rest at home for 5 years. But that, as we \nknow, is certainly not the case today. Currently, our active-duty \ntroops are spending less time at home than they are in battle, and \nGuard and Reserve forces are receiving less than 3 years rest for every \nyear in combat.\n  With the increasing number and length of deployments, this rest time \nis even more critical for our troops. Unfortunately, though, our forces \nare not receiving the break they need, and that increases the chances \nthat they become burned out. But this administration has decided to go \nin the other direction, pushing our troops harder, extending their time \nabroad, and sending troops back time and again to the battlefield.\n  The current rotation policy not only burns out servicemembers, but it \nhurts our military's ability to respond to other potential threats.\n  For the first time in decades, the Army's ``ready brigade,'' that is \nintended to enter troubled spots within 72 hours, cannot do so; all of \nits troops are in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The limited time period between deployments also lessens the time to \ntrain for other threats. Numerous military leaders have spoken to us \nabout this problem.\n  GEN James Conway said:\n\n        . . . I think my largest concern, probably, has to do with \n     training. When we're home for that seven, eight, or nine \n     months, our focus is going back to Iraq. And as I mentioned \n     in the opening statement, therefore, we're not doing \n     amphibious training, we're not doing mountain-warfare \n     training, we're not doing combined-armed fire maneuvers, such \n     as would need to be the case, potentially, any other type of \n     contingency.\n\n  Those were not my words; those were the words of GEN James Conway, \nwho spoke before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February of \nthis year.\n  GEN Barry McCaffrey said that because all ``fully combat ready'' \nactive-duty and Reserve combat units are now deployed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, ``no fully-trained national strategic Reserve brigades are \nnow prepared to deploy to new combat operations.''\n  This current deployment schedule is making us less ready for other \ncontingencies we need to be ready for. It is also making us less secure \nat home. The current rotation policy has left our Guard units short of \nmanpower and supplies, and it has severely hindered their ability to \nrespond to any kind of disaster they might face here at home.\n  For years, those kinds of problems were the exception, not the rule. \nBut I fear that the balance has shifted. Recently, USA Today reported \nthat National Guard units in 31 States say 4 years of war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan have left them with 60 percent or less of their authorized \nequipment. Last month, LTG Steven Blum said the National Guard units \nhave 53 percent of the equipment they need to handle\n\n[[Page S11720]]\n\nState emergencies, and that number falls to 49 percent once Guard \nequipment needed for war, such as weapons, is factored in. In fact, \nBlum said:\n\n       Our problem right now is that our equipment is at an all-\n     time low.\n\n  That is deeply concerning to a lot of us who worry about national \ndisasters in our States. Out in the West, where I live, we face forest \nfires; along the gulf coast, we have seen the destruction of hurricanes \nthis season; and in the Midwest, entire towns can be decimated by \ntornadoes in minutes. So we are deeply concerned about our Guard and \nReserve being ready for a disaster here at home.\n  This problem is about more than equipment. It is about retention \nrates. It is about real people and real families. We all know military \nlife can be very tough on our troops and their families. They go for \nmonths, and sometimes years, without seeing each other. Our troops--\nthese men and women--need adequate time at home to see their newborns, \nto be a part of their children's lives, to spend time with their \nhusbands or wives, and to see their parents. This current rotation \npolicy decreases the time families are together, and that places a \ntremendous strain on everyone. Our troops, who are facing these early \ndeployments and extended tours today, have spoken out. When the tour \nextensions and early deployments were announced, our troops themselves \nexpressed their displeasure.\n  In Georgia, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\n       Soldiers of a Georgia Army National Guard unit were hoping \n     to return home in April, but instead they may be spending \n     another grueling summer in the Iraqi desert. At least 4,000 \n     National Guard soldiers may spend up to 4 extra months in \n     Iraq as part of President Bush's troop increase announced \n     last month.\n       SGT Gary Heffner, a spokesman for the 214th, said news of \n     the extension came as a ``little bit of a shock'' to the \n     Georgians.\n\n  In the 1st Cavalry Division, according to the Dallas Morning News:\n\n       Eighteen months after their first Iraqi rotation, the 2nd \n     Battalion, 5th Cavalry regiment, and the last of the Fort \n     Hood, Texas-based 1st Cavalry Division, returned to Iraq in \n     mid-November.\n\n  These are the words of Brandon Jones, a veteran from my State of \nWashington. He testified before a field hearing on mental health care \nthat I held in Tacoma last month. He said:\n\n       In November 2003, I was called to full-time duty with the \n     81st Brigade. I was given very short notice that my unit was \n     being mobilized. In that time, I had to give up my civilian \n     job--an income loss of about $1,200 a month--and my wife had \n     to drop out of classes at Olympic College to care for our \n     children.\n       I went from living at home and seeing my children on a \n     daily basis to living on base--just a mile from home--and \n     visiting my children periodically. To my kids, I went from \n     being their dad to the guy who drops by the house for a \n     visit once in a while.\n       The 3 months of mobilization before my deployment were very \n     stressful. We struggled financially. Although we reached out \n     for help, we were told that the only financial resources \n     available were strictly for active duty soldiers at Fort \n     Lewis. It wasn't until we were threatened with eviction and \n     repossession of our car that my wife was able to obtain a \n     small amount of assistance generally reserved for active duty \n     soldiers. Our families helped us make up the rest--about 60 \n     percent of what we were in need of.\n       The stress made it difficult for my wife to keep a positive \n     attitude, for our children to feel comfortable, and for me to \n     concentrate on the mission ahead of me. When my wife and I \n     reached out for marriage counseling prior to my deployment, \n     we were made to feel that the few sessions we were given were \n     a favor to us and that we were taking up a resource meant for \n     active duty soldiers from the base.\n       Let me remind you that all of this happened before I was \n     even deployed.\n\n  As Brandon said, that was before he was even deployed. Just imagine \nthe sacrifice these families have made when they go through these 15-\nmonth deployments. To me, it is very clear that we need to pass the \nWebb amendment. We hear a lot of rhetoric on the floor about supporting \nour troops, but I believe this amendment is the opportunity we need to \nend the rhetoric and start with action.\n  Troops should be at home for the same amount of time as they are \ndeployed. That seems to me like a basic commonsense requirement. I \napplaud our colleague from Virginia for being a champion for our troops \nand for crafting this bipartisan measure that he and the entire Senate \ncan be proud of.\n  Our troops have sacrificed a lot. They have already gone above and \nbeyond the call of duty. We need to institute a fair policy for the \nhealth of our troops, for the health and well-being of their families, \nand for our Nation's security and our ability to respond to disasters \nhere at home. This amendment does all of those things. I urge our \nSenators to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan, the chairman, \nwill be recognized to point out that we will have a side-by-side \namendment, which I will be prepared to introduce soon. We also wish to \nmove forward with speakers so we can set a time for a vote on the Webb \namendment, in keeping with the wishes of the respective leaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I discussed this with the Senator from \nArizona. I ask unanimous consent that after the current lineup of \nspeakers, Senator Brown be recognized for up to 10 minutes, Senator \nStabenow be recognized for up to 10 minutes, and then, as the Senator \nfrom Arizona mentioned, we will try to see if in the next few minutes \nwe are able to come up with an agreement to schedule a vote--probably, \nI guess, around 5 o'clock, for the convenience of Senators.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong objection \nto the Webb amendment. I voted against this amendment when it was \noffered 2 months ago, and I will vote against it again today.\n  I will not support this slow-bleed strategy from Iraq. It ties the \nhands of our commanders. I cannot remember a time in history when the \nCongress of the United States has dictated to our commanders on the \nground how to conduct their mission to this extent.\n  This is an extremely dangerous amendment. The junior Senator from \nVirginia would like for you to believe it helps our troops and that a \nvote in support of his amendment is a vote to support our troops. \nWrong. Nothing can be further from the truth.\n  This amendment would be a nightmare to execute. It says a soldier \nmust spend 1 day at home for every day the soldier is deployed. That \nmay sound reasonable on its face, but anyone who knows how the military \nplans its missions knows it will be a logistical roadblock for our \nmilitary planners.\n  The problem is when a unit returns from a deployment, its personnel \nare often reassigned to other units and other assignments. Divisions, \nbrigades, battalions, and units don't stay together forever. In a \nmilitary of millions of people, there are a lot of people reassigned \neach day.\n  This amendment would essentially require the Army and Marine Corps \nstaff to keep track of how long each service man or woman has spent in \nIraq or Afghanistan, how long they have been at home, how long their \nunit was deployed, and how long it was home. This is absurd. This would \nmean pulling soldiers out of units scheduled to deploy if the \nservicemembers did not have enough dwell time.\n  This breaks up leadership and soldier teams, the formations of which \nare the purpose of the Army and Marine training system. Requiring the \nPresident to issue a certification to Congress to waive this \nrequirement for every individual servicemember who might be affected by \nthis is even more absurd.\n  This amendment takes tools and flexibility away from our commanders \non the ground, such as General Petraeus. That is why it is being \noffered today.\n  Commanders make estimates about the forces they need based on \nassumptions about current and future threats. If a commander in Iraq or \nAfghanistan concludes that some event might require the deployment of \nadditional forces to his theater, this amendment would restrict the \nunits and personnel that could be sent.\n  The junior Senator from Virginia claims to be concerned for the \nwelfare of our troops. Not one Member of this body is opposed to troops \ngetting rest after a long deployment. But we need to be equally \nconcerned about the dangers our soldiers face when they do not\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\nhave the necessary resources and reinforcements available to do their \nmission. This is the true purpose of this amendment. It cripples the \nability of Secretary Gates, General Petraeus, and our other commanders \non the ground to accomplish their mission and forces a drawdown of our \ntroops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I will not support this strategy out of Iraq. It puts troops in \nharm's way, restricting the resources and reserves they need to \nsuccessfully accomplish their mission.\n  This is not supporting our troops. It is wrong to cloak a troop \npullout amendment in language that relates to troop rest, but that is \nexactly what this amendment does.\n  This week I had the pleasure of visiting with two brave Kentuckians \nwho recently served in Iraq. They came to me directly to ask me to vote \nagainst the Webb amendment. These Kentuckians know the sacrifices their \nfellow soldiers and families make. They know and understand the \nimportance of rest back home. They know the strains of war. They have \nexperienced the heat of Iraq and the tragedy of knowing that some of \ntheir fellow soldiers never made it home.\n  But these two Kentuckians also know the intent of this amendment. \nThey know why it was offered, and they do not want to tie the hands of \nthe military so we are forced to leave Iraq and Afghanistan before the \nmission is completed. That is why they came from Lawrenceburg, KY, and \nHebron, KY, to ask me to oppose the Webb amendment.\n  It is not Congress's role to mandate individual soldiers and unit \ndeployments. I know the Democrats like to try to micromanage the war, \nbut I am not the Commander in Chief and neither are any of my \ncolleagues across the aisle. I want to remind everyone in this body of \nthis fact.\n  If you want to truly support our troops, then vote against the Webb \namendment. It was defeated 2 months ago on the Senate floor, and I can \nonly hope it will be defeated again today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Webb amendment. I \nam pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. Much has been made \nabout this amendment and the well-being of our troops and their \nfamilies. Make no mistake, this amendment is about ensuring that we do \nnot do permanent damage to the military's most valuable asset--its \npeople.\n  Congress must make the health and well-being of our men and women \noverseas a priority. We know multiple deployments with short periods of \nrest back home raise the incidence of PTSD. Studies have shown that the \nlikelihood of a soldier being diagnosed with PTSD rises by 50 percent \nwhen he or she is on a second or third deployment.\n  We know multiple deployments are causing a massive strain on our \njunior officer corps. Earlier this year, the Army's Deputy Chief of \nStaff told Congress these officers are getting out of the Army at \nnearly double the rate that the Army says is acceptable. That is why \nuntil this war, we have always given our active-duty soldiers a ratio \nof 2 days at home for every day in combat, and we have always given the \nNational Guard and Reserve 5 days at home for every day in combat. That \nhas been the standard until this war.\n  That is why the National Military Families Association supports this \namendment. That is why the Military Officers Association of America \nsupports this amendment. The Military Officers Association says:\n\n       If we are not better stewards of our troops and their \n     families . . . we will be putting the all-volunteer force at \n     unacceptable risk.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to what our officers and their \nfamilies are saying through their support of the Webb amendment.\n  As my colleagues know, I am a farmer; I am not a military expert. But \nI believe and the people of my State believe in no uncertain measure \nthat we need to continue to have the strongest military in the world, \nnot only today, not only 6 months from now, but 6 years from now as \nwell.\n  The good news is we have a strong military. I represent 3,500 Air \nForce personnel, more than 300 of whom are serving in Iraq and other \nplaces around the world today. I represent another 3,600 Guardsmen, \nmany of whom have spent a tour or two in Iraq. I can tell my colleagues \nthat these people are the best in the world at what they do, and I am \nproud to represent them.\n  But the bad news is what I am hearing is we are in danger of losing \ntoo many young leaders in our military today who are leading a platoon \nbut whom we will be relying on to lead brigades and entire divisions in \nthe future.\n  I know some people on both sides of the aisle have raised the \nquestion of how this measure will impact the schedule for the surge \nGeneral Petraeus has outlined. The fact is, even if this amendment \nbecomes law, the Pentagon would still have another 4 months to prepare \nfor the change in policy, and if there is a national emergency, there \nis an opportunity for even more time. The fact is, this amendment will \nhave a much greater impact on tomorrow's military than it will impact \non the military surge.\n  I believe we need the Webb amendment to ensure that we maintain a \nstrong military today, tomorrow, and for years to come.\n  I congratulate Senator Webb for this amendment. This has been a good \ndebate. For the most part, it has been thoughtful and respectful. There \nhave been differences of opinion, but it is time to allow this measure \nto have an honest vote before the Senate. Let's not simply debate \nwhether to debate this amendment. Let's have an up-or-down vote on the \nmeasure. Our troops, their families, and the American people deserve \nnothing less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Connecticut has \n14 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to respectfully speak against \nthe amendment offered by my colleague from Virginia.\n  Let me put this in context, as I see it. One week ago, the commander \nof our military forces in Iraq and our top diplomat in Baghdad returned \nto Washington to address the Members of this Congress. What General \nPetraeus and Ambassador Crocker offered us last week was not hype or \nhyperbole but the facts. They offered us the facts. What we heard from \nthem was reality--hard evidence of the progress we have at last begun \nto achieve over the past 8 months--progress against al-Qaida, progress \nagainst sectarian violence, progress in standing up the Iraqi Army, \nprogress that all but the most stubborn of ideological or partisan \nopponents now acknowledge is happening.\n  What we also heard from General Petraeus last week was a plan for the \ntransition of our mission in Iraq which he has developed, together with \nour military commanders on the ground, that builds on facts on the \nground, not on opinions over here, that builds on the successes our \ntroops have achieved on the ground which will allow tens of thousands \nof American troops to begin to return home from Iraq starting this \nmonth.\n  So the question now before the Senate is not whether to start \nbringing some of our troops home. Everyone agrees with that point. \nBeginning this month, some of our troops will be coming home. The \nquestion before the Senate now is whether we are going to listen to the \nrecommendations of our commanders and diplomats in Iraq, or instead \nwhether we will reject them and try to derail the plan they have \ncarefully developed and implemented and that is working. The question \nis whether we build on the success of the surge and the strategy of \nsuccess led by General Petraeus, or instead whether we impose a \ncongressional formula for retreat and failure.\n  I believe the choice is clear because we have too much at stake for \nour national security, our national values, and most particularly, of \ncourse, freedom is on the line and the outcome in Iraq. Are the victors \ngoing to be the Iraqis with our support and the hope of freedom and a \nbetter future for them or are the victors going to be al-Qaida and Iran \nand Iranian-backed terrorists? That is the choice. It is in that \ncontext that I believe the Webb amendment is a step in precisely the \nwrong direction. That is its effect.\n  The sponsors of the amendment say they are trying to relieve the \nburden on our men and women in uniform. I, of course, take them at \ntheir word. They\n\n[[Page S11722]]\n\nhave an honorable goal that all of us in this Chamber share. It is not, \nhowever, what the real-world consequences of this amendment will be.\n  On the contrary, Secretary of Defense Bob Gates has warned us in the \nmost explicit terms that this amendment, if enacted, would have \nprecisely the opposite effect that its sponsors say they desire. It \nwould create less security, more pressure on more soldiers and their \nfamilies than exists now.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Secretary Gates is a man who chooses \nhis words carefully. He is a former member of the Iraq Study Group. He \nis a strong believer in the need for bipartisan consensus and \ncooperation when it comes to America's national security, particularly \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. He does not practice the politics of \npolarization or partisan spin. So when he tells us this amendment would \ndo more harm than good, so much harm, in fact, that he, as Secretary of \nDefense, would feel obliged to recommend to the President that if this \namendment is adopted, the President veto the entire underlying \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill, well, then, when Bob Gates, \nSecretary of Defense, says that, I think we have a responsibility to \nlisten and to listen to his words very carefully.\n  The reason for Secretary Gates' opposition to this amendment is not \npolitical, it is practical. As he explained in a letter to Senator \nGraham of South Carolina earlier this week, the Webb amendment ``would \nsignificantly increase the risk to our servicemembers''--significantly \nincrease, not decrease, the risk to our servicemembers--and ``lead to a \nreturn to unpredictable tour lengths and home state periods and home \nstation periods.'' Exactly the opposite of the intention of the \namendment.\n  By injecting rigid inflexibility into the military planning process, \nthis amendment would force the Pentagon to elevate one policy--the \namount of time individual members of the military spend at home--above \nall other considerations, above the safety and security of those same \nsoldiers and their colleagues when they are deployed abroad, above the \nimpact of implementing that policy would have on our prospects for \nsuccess in Iraq and all that means to our country and, I add, to our \nsoldiers. Secretary Gates also described a range of grim consequences \nthat would result if this amendment is adopted.\n\n  To begin with, it would likely force the Pentagon to extend the \ndeployments of units that are already in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond \ntheir scheduled rotations. So some of those units which are now \nscheduled to be there for 15 months might have to be extended beyond \nthat because of the provision in this amendment that says you have to \nhave an equal amount of time at home as deployed. Why? Because there \naren't enough capable units to replace them that meet the inflexible \nrequirements imposed by this amendment.\n  Far from relieving the burden on our brave troops in battle deployed \noverseas, this amendment would actually add to their burdens and keep \nour soldiers away from their families, certainly a goodly number of \nthem, for even longer. It would also mean more frequent and broader \ncallups of our National Guard and Reserve units, pulling forces into \nthe fight that would otherwise be able to remain at home.\n  In other cases, this amendment will require the Pentagon to deploy \nunits trained for one mission to go fight another mission, not because \nit makes military sense to do so but because they are the only ones \nleft that meet this amendment's inflexible dwell-time rule. In plain \nEnglish, we are going to be forced by this amendment to send less-\ncapable units into combat.\n  In addition to imposing greater dangers thereby on our individual \nservice men and women, this amendment would also have other baneful \neffects on our national security. At a time when our military is \nstretched and performing brilliantly, it would further shrink the pool \nof units and personnel available to respond to events, crises, not just \nin Iraq and Afghanistan but around the world. In doing so, this \namendment--and again I quote Secretary Gates--``would dramatically \nlimit the Nation's ability to respond to other national security needs \nwhile we remain engaged in Iraq or Afghanistan.'' Is that what any one \nof us desire? Is that what the men and women who serve us in uniform \ndesire? No.\n  All of us recognize the extraordinary services our troops are giving \nour country and the burden that places on their family in this time of \nwar. All of us want to do something to help relieve the burden they \nbear. But the answer is not to impose a legislative straitjacket on our \nmen and women in uniform. The answer is not to impose an inflexible \none-size-fits-all rule that will endanger their safety and hobble our \nmilitary's ability to respond to worldwide threats. The answer is not, \nin our frustration, to throw an enormous wrench into the existing, \nwell-functioning personnel system of the U.S. military. The answer is \nmost definitely not to make it harder for us to succeed in Iraq.\n  I know there has been some disagreement among the supporters of this \namendment about whether it is intended to be a backdoor way to \naccelerate the drawdown of our troops from Iraq, for which there is not \nadequate support in this Senate Chamber, fortunately, and thus discard \nthe recommendations of General Petraeus and, if I may say so, put us on \na course for failure instead of the course of success we are on now. My \nfriend, the Senate majority leader, said he does not see this as a \nbackdoor way to accelerate the drawdown. On the other hand, Congressman \nMurtha said that is exactly what it is supposed to do and he hopes it \nwill do.\n  The fact is many in this Chamber have argued honestly and openly for \nmonths that General Petraeus and his troops were failing to make \nmeaningful progress in Iraq and that Congress should, therefore, order \nthem to begin to withdraw. That could be done by cutting off funding or \nmandating a congressional deadline for withdrawal.\n  I have argued against those recommendations, as my colleagues know. \nBut I must say I respect the fact that those arguments by opponents of \nthe war accept the consequences of their beliefs, and they are real and \ndirect. Those in the Chamber who want to reject the Petraeus \nrecommendations and his report of progress and impose on him their own \nschemes for the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, I think ought to do \nit in the most direct way, rather than any attempt to derail this now \nsuccessful war plan by indirection.\n  The fact is, regardless of the intention of its sponsors, the Webb \namendment, if enacted, will not result in a faster drawdown of U.S. \ntroops from Iraq. The fact is the Commander in Chief and the military \ncommander in Iraq are committed to the success of this mission. On the \ncontrary, therefore, it would only make it harder for those troops, \nalong with their brothers and sisters in uniform in Afghanistan, to \ncomplete their mission successfully, safely, and return home but to \nreturn home with honor to their families and their neighbors.\n  Yesterday, a couple of Connecticut veterans from the Iraq war were in \ntown and came to see me. At the end of a good discussion, in which they \ndid urge me to vote against the Webb amendment, one of them said to me: \nSenator, we want to win in Iraq, and we know we can win. I said to \nthem: Thanks to your bravery and skill--and now a good plan--and with \nthe help of God, you are going to win, so long as the American people \nand their representatives in Congress don't lose their will. That \nvictory will not only secure a better future for the people of Iraq and \nmore stability and an opportunity for a course in the Middle East that \nis not determined by the fanatics, the haters, the suicide bombers of \nal-Qaida and Iranian-backed terrorism but is determined by the people \nthemselves who pray every day and yearn every day for a better future.\n  I will say something else. There are different ways to burden men and \nwomen in uniform. One is the stress of combat, another is to force them \ninto a position where they fail. I have had many conversations with \nsoldiers from Connecticut and elsewhere who have served in Iraq, and I \nhave had the conversations in Iraq and here. I don't want to mislead my \ncolleagues in what I am about to report. I don't get this in 100 \npercent of those conversations, but in an overwhelming number of those \nconversations, they are proud of what they are doing, they believe in \ntheir mission, they believe they are part of a battle that can help \nmake the future of\n\n[[Page S11723]]\n\ntheir families and our country more secure. They are proud. They are \nreenlisting at remarkable numbers. That is the best indicator of this \nattitude.\n  If you want to burden them and their families in a way we can never \nquite make up for, then take us from the road of success, leading to \nthe road of victory, and force us directly, force them directly or \nindirectly, to a retreat and defeat. That can break the will of an \narmy. We don't have to do it, we must not do it, and I believe this \nSenate will not allow this to happen. I, therefore, urge my colleagues \nto vote against the Webb amendment.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Webb for his \nleadership on this important issue as I rise in support of the Webb \namendment.\n  This amendment, first and foremost, is about supporting our troops. \nIt is about supporting the military families. Every Member of this \nbody, some even more than others, talk about their support for our \ntroops. Many put the yellow ribbon magnets on their cars, many wear \nother kinds of clothing to show their support for the troops. They talk \nabout it at home, they talk about it here. This vote will put that \nsupport for our troops into action.\n  This amendment ensures that our military gets the rest at home they \ndeserve; that our military readiness gets the support it needs. This \namendment will ensure that our National Guardsmen will stay at home for \nat least 3 years after returning from deployment, the men and women of \nthe Guard who leave businesses, jobs, and families on hold while \nbravely serving our Nation.\n  The current Iraq policy is overextending our troops and placing \nunacceptable burdens on families back home, with spouses often acting \nas single parents, doing their very best, in sometimes worse economic \ntimes, to keep their families together.\n  I have met with these families for 4 years, going back as early as \n2003, soon after tens of thousands of American troops were deployed in \nIraq. They would talk frequently about the shortage of body armor. They \ntalked frequently about the shortage of bottled water, about hygiene \nproducts, and all kinds of things our troops needed as our Government \nrushed into war in 2003 without adequately supplying them. Families \nwould raise money at events to provide the body armor and to send \nbottled water and hygiene products or whatever their loved ones needed \nin Iraq.\n  Our Government didn't do what it should have done back then because \nof the poor civilian leadership and its lack of preparation for this \nwar in Iraq. I heard comments over and over about the difficulty of \nadjusting, as those troops came back home, due to the lack of foresight \nand the lack of planning on the part of the civilian leadership of our \nmilitary.\n  Our Armed Forces have served bravely and honorably again and again, \ndeployment after deployment, often without, as I said, the proper body \narmor, proper vehicle protection, proper training, and dwell time \nbetween deployments. We fought in this body and in the House for more \nbody armor, we fought for more MRAPS, the triangular-bottomed vehicles. \nWe shouldn't have to fight to allow our soldiers the proper amount of \ntime between deployments.\n  The requirement in this amendment for dwell time is something the \nmilitary has voluntarily done for decades because they know that serves \nthe troops well, they know it serves the families well, and they know \nprincipally it serves the military well to have that dwell time between \ndeployments. The 1-to-1 standard in the Webb amendment is actually \nbelow the historic standard of the Department of Defense for dwell \ntime. We could do even better than this.\n  We can debate about our role in Iraq's civil war, we can debate \ntimelines for ending our involvement, we can debate how much money we \nshould spend in Iraq, but we shouldn't need to debate how much rest, \npreparation, and training our troops get before they go back off to \nwar. Everyone in this Chamber talks about supporting our troops, even \nas our President failed to provide body armor and MRAPs, failed to \nprovide support and supplies, and even as our President has failed to \nprovide enough money for medical care for the Veterans' Administration \nfor when our troops return home. Everyone in this Chamber talks about \nsupporting our troops, but this amendment puts the soldiers and their \nfamilies first.\n  They have done their job. It is time we do ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nMichigan, whom we are so proud of, for all his efforts in supporting \nour troops and leading our efforts as it relates to the defense of our \ncountry and for once again leading this very important bill on the \nDefense reauthorization.\n  It is time to put aside for a brief moment the overall debate of the \nwar and focus on the troops. Regardless of whether you supported going \ninto Iraq or, as I did, voted no on going into that war, we come \ntogether and we hear frequently from colleagues on both sides of the \naisle that, of course, we support our troops. We want what is best for \nthe brave men and women who are fighting in harm's way, who didn't take \nthat vote and didn't decide the policy but who are, in fact, stepping \nup to defend that policy and defend our country.\n  The question is, What is best for the troops on the ground right now, \nin the middle of these conflicts that have gone on now for over 4\\1/2\\ \nyears? We are here today to talk about what is best for our military, \nour troops, and for their families.\n  We are not here to debate the merits of the mission. I certainly am \nwilling to do that and do that with other amendments. But this \nparticular amendment, the amendment of Senator Webb, is an effort to \ndetermine what makes sense when it comes to deploying our armed \nservices, what is best for those who have been willing to put their \nlives on the line for our country, who follow the leadership of the \nDepartment of Defense and operate under the policies that have been set \nby this Congress and this President.\n  What is very clear is that the current system is broken for our \ntroops. We are forcing our troops into longer and longer combat \ndeployments and giving them shorter and shorter rest periods. We are \ndemanding multiple combat deployments over very short periods, with \nmany units on their second, their third, or even their fourth \nredeployment in the war in Iraq. We are denying the men and women who \nput their lives on the line for America the time they need off from the \nfront lines to recuperate, to retrain, to prepare themselves physically \nand mentally to return to combat and, just as important, to spend time \nwith their families, to be able to reconnect with the loved ones they \nhave left behind when they have gone into this war.\n  We are placing an unfair and unreasonable burden on those military \nfamilies, families who are willing to sacrifice, who have sacrificed; \nfamilies who count on us to be there for them, representing their \ninterests and the interests of their loved ones who are on the front \nlines. They are doing all of it in the name of a policy that the \nmilitary itself has indicated is not only unreasonable but unsafe. The \nDepartment of Defense itself has said that the conditions under which \nthey are operating have been unreasonable and unsafe.\n  Historically, the Department of Defense, as has been said, has \nmandated a combat-to-rest ratio of 1 to 2--1 month on, 2 months off as \nan example; 1 year in combat, 2 years at home--to rest, retrain, and \nprepare for the next deployment. In fact, the historic 1-to-2 ratio is \ncurrently the stated policy of the DOD. We are hearing from colleagues \non the other side of the aisle as if this is some outrageous idea, that \nwe put some parameters around the deployment and redeployment of our \ntroops. Yet it is the stated policy of the Department of Defense: 1 \nmonth or 1 year on, 2 months or 2 years here at home.\n  The Webb amendment merely sets a 1-to-1 ratio, a floor that only gets \nus halfway to the standard the Department of Defense itself has called \nfor. The policies pursued by this administration have stretched our men \nand women in uniform to the breaking point. Our Armed Forces are \ngetting the job done under the most extreme\n\n[[Page S11724]]\n\nand trying conditions imaginable. Most of us have had an opportunity, \nfirsthand, to see them in action, to see what they are doing and the \nconditions under which they are operating. They are getting the job \ndone. No one is surprised because we have the best and the brightest, \nbut they are under extreme and trying conditions. They face an enemy \nwho often cannot be identified. They face an environment that is harsh \nand hot and unbearable. They do their jobs with pride, with honor, with \ndignity, and most certainly with excellence.\n  The current deployment schedule places an unfair burden not only on \nour soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines but on the families \nthey leave behind. Military families have, in their own way, been \ncalled to serve this country, been called to sacrifice. They demand our \nrespect and support for the sacrifices they are making. What we are \ncurrently asking of them is simply unreasonable. When our troops go \ninto combat, the people they leave behind shoulder the burden of \nkeeping the family together while mom or dad--mother, father, sister, \nbrother--is fighting in service to their country. They are left to face \nnot only the practical problems that come with having a family member \ngone for long stretches of time but also the constant uncertainty and \nstress of simply not knowing what is happening to their loved one. Are \nthey safe? Will they come home safely? Our troops and their families \nhave done everything we have asked of them. They have been there for \nAmerica. And now the answer to the question must be that we will be \nthere for them.\n  The young Americans who volunteer to put on the uniform and fight for \nour country are truly our best. They are the best-trained, the best-\nequipped, the bravest fighting forces in the world, and they are one of \nthe Nation's most valuable assets and greatest resources. Current \nadministration policy is abusing their willingness and desire to serve. \nThis has to stop. By straining and stretching our military, we are \nundercutting our own national security. We are compromising everything \nwe have done to build up a force that can defend America and properly \nrespond to the dangers we face in today's uncertain world.\n  Senator Webb has crafted an amendment that addresses the concerns of \nour military leaders. It includes reasonable waivers in the face of \nunexpected threats to America. It includes a transition window that \nwill allow a shift in the deployment schedule without a disruption of \nour fighting forces. We have worked with the military to develop a \npolicy that makes sense. I commend Senator Webb for his foresight and \nhis willingness to work with the Secretary of Defense and others to \nmake the changes, to make this even more workable. We compromised where \nit makes sense to strengthen the legislation, but we will not \ncompromise on the safety of our troops or on the support for their \nfamilies.\n  This amendment is not about where we stand on the war. It is not \nabout partisan politics. It is about doing the right thing for our \ntroops and for their families. I urge my colleagues to stand up and \nvote for the Webb amendment. Stand with the people we have sent to war \nand their families waiting at home, and stand with all Americans who \nwant us to have the right kind of policy to support our troops and to \nkeep us safe for the future.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time first to thank Senator \nWebb for bringing forward his amendment that I strongly support. I \nbelieve it is in the best interests of our troops, their families, our \nmilitary readiness, and the proper deployment of our troops.\n  I also thank Senator Levin and Senator Reid for their efforts in \nallowing us the opportunity to try to change our mission in Iraq. I \nbelieve it is not only in the best interest of the United States to do \nthat but also the Iraqi people.\n  I also compliment Senator Biden for his efforts to bring forward an \namendment that would give us a more realistic and achievable political \ngame plan in Iraq. As has been recently reported, the Iraqi Government \nis dysfunctional, and the only way we are going to be successful in \nIraq is if we can have a political solution to their problems.\n  On September 3, 2007, President Bush told troops at Al-Asad Air Base \nthat the troop buildup has strengthened security--and that the military \nsuccesses are ``paving the way for the political reconciliation and \neconomic progress'' in Iraq. ``When Iraqis feel safe in their own homes \nand neighborhoods,'' said President Bush, ``they can focus their \nefforts on building a stable, civil society.''\n  I believe that the last part of that statement, when an Iraqi can \nwalk into the street without fear of being attacked, blown up, or \nbribed, of having family harmed, his house or his business taken, when \nhe is confident that his children will have enough food and water and \nbe able to attend school in peace, he will be able to focus on building \na more stable civil society.\n  But what I don't see is any independent evidence that the increased \nU.S. troop presence has, as promised, led to greater civilian security, \nlet alone paved the way for political and economic success.\n  The 2007 emergency supplemental appropriations bill required \nPresident Bush to report to Congress and the American people in July \nand September on the progress Iraqis are making toward achieving \ncertain critical benchmarks put forward by the Iraqi Government and \naffirmed by President Bush in his January ``New Way Forward'' speech. \nThese were not benchmarks established by Congress. These were \nbenchmarks established by the Iraqis, in this legislation. That same \nlegislation asked the independent Government Accountability Office to \nundertake the same investigation and chartered the Independent \nCommission on the Security Forces of Iraq to investigate the progress \nthose institutions are making toward independence. We now have each of \nthose reports.\n  Not even President Bush claims that substantial progress toward \npolitical or economic benchmarks has occurred. As reported by his \nadministration in July and September there has been little progress on \ndebaathification reform, oil revenue sharing, provincial elections, or \namnesty laws.\n  The GAO reports that the Iraqi Government has met only \\1/8\\ of the \nlegislative benchmarks. The rights of minority party political parties \nin the Iraqi legislature are protected, though the same is not true for \nthe Iraqi population whose ``rights are often violated.''\n  Any prospects for further progress toward these goals have been \ndashed by the withdrawal of 15 of the 37 members of the Iraqi cabinet. \nThe Congressional Research Service reported that the boycott has left \n``the Iraqi Government in essential collapse.''\n  That is another reason why we need The Biden amendment, and more \nimportant, for us to move forward implementing a new strategy in Iraq.\n  Just as important, there is no independent evidence that increased \ntroop presence has created the security necessary to foster future \npolitical and economic progress in Iraq.\n  The GAO reports that it is not clear whether sectarian violence has \nbeen reduced and that the average number of daily attacks aqainst \ncivilians has remained about the same.\n  The August National Intelligence Estimate reports that the level of \noverall violence in Iraq, including attacks on and casualties among \ncivilians, remains high and will remain high over the next 6 to 12 \nmonths.\n  According to figures compiled by the Associated Press, Iraqis are \nsuffering double the number of war-related deaths throughout the \ncountry compared to this time last year.\n  In an August op-ed, seven non-commissioned officers wrote:\n\n       [T]he most important front in the counterinsurgency, \n     improving basic social and economic conditions, is the one on \n     which we have failed most miserably. . . . Cities lack \n     regular electricity, telephone services and sanitation. . . .\n       In a lawless environment where men with guns rule the \n     streets, engaging in the banalities of life has become a \n     death-defying act. . . . When the primary preoccupation of \n     average Iraqis is when and how they are likely\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\n     to be killed, we can hardly feel smug as we hand out care \n     packages. As an Iraqi man told us a few days ago with deep \n     resignation, ``We need security, not free food.''\n\n  Even if we assume a decline in violence, in certain regions in Iraq \nit is far from clear that increased U.S. troops are responsible. There \nare over 2 million refugees that have fled Iraq.\n  Internally displace persons are estimated at 2 million and are \nincreasing by 80,000 to 100,000 each month. At that rate, Washington, \nDC would be empty by March.\n  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees found that 63 \npercent of those displaced moved because of threats to their security. \nSixty-nine percent left homes in Baghdad. Baghdad is undergoing \nsectarian cleansing. If the death toll in a Sunni district falls \nbecause its residents have fled, the resulting reduction in violence is \nnot attributable to increased troops, and that kind of development is \nnot ``progress.''\n  The bottom line: the GAO report found the Iraqi Government has not \neliminated militia control over local security or political \nintervention in military operations. It has not ensured evenhanded \nenforcement of the law or increased the number of army units capable of \nindependent operations.\n  Are Iraqis more secure? For me, the 100,000 people fleeing their \nhomes each month in fear for their safety answer the question. The \ntruth, as everyone acknowledges, is that the security that Iraqi man \nwanted instead of free food will only come with political \nreconciliation.\n  Those same seven NOC's explained that:\n\n       political reconciliation in Iraq will occur, but not at our \n     insistence or in ways that meet our benchmarks. It will \n     happen on Iraqi terms. . . .\n       [I]t would be prudent for us to increasingly let Iraqis \n     take center stage in all matters, to come up with a nuanced \n     policy in which we assist them from the margins but let them \n     resolve their differences as they see fit.\n\n  President Bush predicted that increased U.S. troop levels taking a \nmore visible--rather than marginal--role would stabilize the country so \nthat its national leaders could reach political agreement. They would \nenable us to accelerate training initiatives so that Iraqi army and \npolice force could assume control of all security in the country by \nNovember 2007. President Bush sent over 28,000 more soldiers into Iraq \nto fulfill these goals.\n  The reports before us in September, like the reports before us in \nJuly, show us that President Bush's troop escalation is ineffective. It \nhas failed to make Iraq more secure, failed to stem the civil war going \non in Iraq, and failed to lead to political reconciliation. That \nfailure was clear when I last came to the floor to discuss this issue \nin July, and it is clear today.\n\n  Since July, 150 more American soldiers have died; nearly 5,000 more \nhave been wounded. My home State of Maryland has lost three more of its \nbravest citizens. One of those seven NOC's, whose wisdom and insight I \nhave quoted at length, was shot through the head and, just last week, \ntwo others were killed. Every month in 2007 has seen more U.S. military \ncasualties over the same month in 2006.\n  Six years after 9/11, our policy in Iraq has distracted us from \nconfronting the weaknesses those attacks revealed. Terrorist attacks \naround the world continue to rise. No progress has been made on the \nArab-Israeli conflict. Our military might has been stretched thin.\n  The most recent intelligence analysis reports that al Qaeda in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan is stronger now than at any other time since \nSeptember 11, 2001. Iran is as dangerous as ever.\n  Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, cochairs of the 9/11 Commission, \nwrote that ``we face a rising tide of radicalization and rage in the \nMuslim world--a trend in which our own actions have contributed.'' Last \nweek, Senator Warner asked General Petreaus whether continuing the \nstrategy the general laid before Congress would make our country safer. \nGeneral Petreaus responded, ``Sir, I don't know actually.''\n  He didn't know because he has been ``focused on . . . how to \naccomplish the mission of the Multi-national Force in Iraq.'' That is \nwhat he should be focused on. That is his job. But the people focused \non our Nation's safety and our overall strategy in the Middle East \nagree with Kean and Hamilton.\n  Admiral Fallon, chief of the U.S. Central Command, which oversees \nMiddle East operations, has argued for accepting more risks in Iraq in \norder to have the necessary forces available to confront other \npotential threats. The Joint Chiefs have been sympathetic to Admiral \nFallon's view.\n  In order to bolster our military and refocus attention on the global \nterrorist threat, this Congress has attempted to change the mission of \nour operation in Iraq. But President Bush and a minority in Congress \nhave rebuffed the effort.\n  We cannot wait any longer to change the mission in Iraq. The cost of \nfurther delay in lives, materiel, treasure, and our standing in the \nworld is too great. President Bush's strategy has put this Nation at \ngreater risk--a risk that metastasizes each day that we sit by and \nwait.\n  A new policy starts by removing our troops from the middle of a civil \nwar and giving them a more realistic mission: counterterrorism, \ntraining, and force and border protection.\n  The Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq, chaired by \nretired GEN James L. Jones, and composed of prominent senior retired \nmilitary officers and chiefs of police, suggests that:\n\n       Coalition forces begin to be adjusted, realigned, and re-\n     tasked . . . to better ensure territorial defense . . . \n     concentrating on the eastern and western borders and the \n     active defense of the critical infrastructures essential to \n     Iraq.\n\n  The Commission also emphasized the importance of transferring \nresponsibility to Iraqis, noting the ``fine line between assistance and \ndependence.'' Iraqi citizens turn to our military for protection and \nthe basic services the government has failed to provide. We want Iraqis \nto become loyal to their government, not to the local U.S. military \ncommander.\n  We must begin to extricate ourselves and hand responsibility to the \nIraqis themselves.\n  As the bipartisan Iraq Study Group noted, ``There is no action the \nAmerican military can take that, by itself, can bring about success in \nIraq.'' But any effort must include stepped-up diplomacy--a \n``diplomatic surge,'' if you will. Iraq's neighbors have a stake in \nIraq's stability. The war in Iraq means the spread of fundamentalist \ninsurrection and sectarian violence, and an increase in basic crime and \nlawlessness, and not just in Iraq.\n  We must begin to have a broader diplomatic and economic vision in the \nMiddle East. Currently, all of Iraq's neighbors are involved in the \nconflict, but they operate under the table. Iran supports the Shiite \nmilitias. Saudi Arabia supports the Sunni militias. Turkey plays a role \nin the North, Syria exerts control over Iraq's western border.\n  The United States engaged all of Afghanistan's neighbors at the \nhighest levels and secured their cooperation at the beginning of that \nconflict. We must engage in that same high level effort with Iraq's \nneighbors no matter how much we wish circumstances or the current \nbalance of power in the region were different.\n  We need our Nation's most senior officials engaged in bringing other \nnations and international entities such as the United Nations and the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the table.\n  The various agencies of the United Nations are well-suited to tackle \nmatters of economic and community development and providing \nelectricity, water, and sanitation service. OSCE could assist Iraq with \ncollective border security, police training, and immigration and \nreligious tolerance efforts.\n  A change of mission, an increased diplomatic effort, and a movement \nto engage international entities presents the best chance of helping \nthe Iraqis build a government that has their confidence and would \nstrengthen our own national security and military readiness.\n  The world has an interest in a safe and secure Iraq. We can no longer \nignore the overwhelming evidence or recoil from the cold reality the \nfacts on the ground reveal. It is time to change the mission, step up \nour diplomatic efforts with a realistic and workable game plan, \nrecognize the limits of deployment of our troops and internationalize \nthe effort to bring stability to the country and to the Middle East.\n\n[[Page S11726]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to take the opportunity, since it \nlooks as if there are no other Senators who wish to speak at this \nmoment, to clarify a few items in this amendment with respect to some \nof the criticisms that have been leveled against it.\n  Again, let me emphasize, this is a minimum amendment. It wants to \nmake a small adjustment to our operational policy that is needed \nbecause of these continuous rotations that have been going on for the \nlast 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  With respect to the constitutionality issue which has been mentioned \na number of times, my staff has put together a fact sheet, which I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WEBB. I have mentioned many times the situation in Korea during \nthe Korean War, where the Congress passed legislation to provide that \nevery person inducted into the military would receive full and adequate \ntraining for a period of not less than 4 months, and that no personnel \nduring that 4-month period would be assigned duty overseas. This was \nthe Congress stepping in to correct a situation that had been created \nby the executive branch in sending people to Korea before they were \ntrained.\n  In 1940, the Selective Training and Service Act stipulated that \npeople inducted into the land forces of the United States would not be \nsent beyond the limits of the Western Hemisphere, except in U.S. \nterritories.\n  The Congress acted in similar ways multiple times prior to World War \nII. In 1915, the Army Appropriations Act restricted Army tours of duty \nin the Philippines to 2 years, and tours in the Canal Zone to 3 years. \nThere are a number of other examples here. This is a matter that is \nclearly within the constitutional prerogative of the Congress should it \nchoose to act.\n  There was a comment earlier by the junior Senator from Arizona \nregarding Secretary Gates's concern about the strain on the Guard and \nReserve if this amendment were to pass. Again, let me reiterate that \nthis amendment addresses the Guard and Reserve. It specifically states \nthat National Guard and Reserve units that have been deployed will not \nbe redeployed for a period of 3 years. This is not going to result in a \ngreater strain on the Guard and Reserve if this amendment passes.\n  There was also some comment about individuals being difficult to \nmanage if the amendment were passed, because we do single out in this \namendment that not only units being deployed should be protected, but \nalso individuals. The reason that language was inserted into this \namendment is because there is a common practice now to backfill \nindividuals who may have returned from a tour of duty much more \nrecently than the unit they have been assigned to.\n  At the same time, we do have this goal, a laudable goal, of having \nunits train together and then deploy together. But even under today's \ncircumstances--for instance, in the data sheet that Lieutenant Colonel \nMartinez has put together for us--and I have heard this from many \npeople, that even by month 10, on a 12-month dwell time back here, the \nunits are still putting people together.\n  So you want them to train together, but it is a fallacy to say they \nhave been training for this entire period before they are deployed. \nMost importantly, this is not difficult to manage. Everyone in the U.S. \nmilitary has a service record book of some sort, and in that record \nbook, there are indications of when they have served overseas. In \ntoday's computer age, it is not very difficult to figure out who has \ncome back and what period of time. Units are tagged to deploy at least \n6 months before they deploy. So you know who in your unit has recently \nbeen returned and who has not. It is not a difficult problem to fix.\n  I wanted to make these clarifications.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Fact Sheet: Constitutionality of Senator Webb's Bipartisan Dwell-Time \n                               Amendment\n\n       (1) There is clear constitutional authority and extensive \n     legislative precedent for Congress to impose minimum periods \n     between operational deployments. As then-Acting Secretary of \n     the Army Geren stated during his confirmation hearing before \n     the Senate Committee on Armed Forces earlier this year, \n     ``Article I of the Constitution makes Congress and the Army \n     full partners.''\n       (2) Among the many congressional authorities the \n     Constitution delineates with regard to the armed forces and \n     the nation's common defense, Article I, Section 8 empowers \n     Congress ``to make rules for the government and regulation of \n     the land and naval forces.'' The Congress has exercised this \n     authority to regulate land and naval forces many times with \n     regard to military training and operational assignments. The \n     most noteworthy example occurred during the height of the \n     Korean War, when Congress passed legislation to require all \n     service members to receive no less than 120 days of training \n     before being assigned overseas.\n       (a) Despite pressing wartime exigencies in Korea, Congress \n     amended the Selective Service Act in 1951 to provide that \n     every person inducted into the Armed Forces would receive \n     ``full and adequate training'' for a period not less than 4 \n     months and no personnel, during this 4-month period, would be \n     assigned for duty at a land installation located outside the \n     United States, its territories, or possessions.\n       (b) This Korean-War legislation had as its precedent \n     similar congressional action before and after World War II. \n     In 1940, for example, the Selective Training and Service Act \n     stipulated that persons inducted into the land forces of the \n     United States under the Act would not be employed beyond the \n     limits of the Western Hemisphere, except in U.S. territories \n     and possessions. In 1948, the Selective Service Act provided \n     that 18- and 19-year-old enlistees for 1-year tours could not \n     be assigned to land bases outside the continental United \n     States.\n       (c) Congress acted in similar ways multiple times prior to \n     World War II. In 1915, for example, the Army Appropriations \n     Act restricted Army tours of duty in the Philippines to 2 \n     years and tours in the Canal Zone to 3 years--unless the \n     service member requested otherwise or in cases of \n     insurrection or actual or threatened hostilities.\n       (d) Congress has continued to exercise its constitutional \n     authority to pass laws to govern and regulate the armed \n     forces. In 1956, a public law prohibited the assignment of \n     female service members to duty on combat aircraft and all \n     vessels of the Navy. Congress subsequently saw the wisdom of \n     repealing this legislation.\n       (e) Later, during the 1980s and 1990s, Congress invoked the \n     War Powers Resolution in the ``Multinational Force in Lebanon \n     Resolution'' to authorize Marines to remain in Lebanon for 18 \n     months. In 1993, the House used a section of the War Powers \n     Resolution to stipulate that U.S. forces should be withdrawn \n     from Somalia by March 1994. Congress also prohibited the \n     expenditure of funds to support personnel end-strength levels \n     above specific limits in NATO countries and other nations \n     outside the United States during the post-Cold War era of the \n     1990s. Other examples also exist.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we hope to be able in the next few moments, \nperhaps after Senator Martinez has gone, to enter into a unanimous \nconsent agreement which would hopefully schedule votes on both the Webb \namendment and on the McCain amendment. We expect those votes would \nbegin at approximately 5:15. We do not have a unanimous consent locked \nin yet, but we do expect, perhaps after Senator Martinez has completed, \nto be able to offer a unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I mention to my friend, I think by 4:40 we \nwould know for sure. That is when the meeting the principals are in now \nis over. But we fully anticipate that at 5:15 a vote would be agreed \nto.\n  If there are other Senators who want to speak between now and about \n5:00, please come down and do so. But my understanding is that this \nagreement is, following the Webb amendment vote, there would be 10 \nminutes equally divided and a vote after that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the expectation. So two votes and 10 minutes \ninterviewing between the two, and then move on to other amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition of \nthe current amendment, the Webb amendment, to the fiscal year 2008 \nNational Defense authorization bill.\n  The fact is that this amendment, in its good intentions to think \nabout the care and condition of our men and women in uniform who have \nso bravely served us, in fact is very much misguided in that it \nattempts to dictate to the military leaders exactly what type and how \ntroop rotations should take place.\n  I think it is a dangerous amendment because it could also interfere \nwith the ability of our country to respond in times of a national \nemergency, even\n\n[[Page S11727]]\n\nthough it has a waiver provision in the amendment for the President's \nability to respond to the dangerous situations that can occur in the \nvery dangerous world in which we live.\n  The fact is--I know it has been mentioned, but I reiterate--the \nSecretary of Defense, the person charged with the constitutional \nresponsibility of deployment of the Armed Forces, has foursquare \nclearly stated that this amendment, while well intended, is certainly \nnot a good amendment. It would dramatically limit the Nation's ability \nto respond to other national security needs while we remain engaged in \nIran and Afghanistan. Secretary Gates, in a letter of September 18 to \nSenator Graham, indicated clearly his concern. He goes on to mention \nsome other concerns.\n  General Petraeus announced--and the President affirmed--that there \nwould be troop drawdowns in Iraq in the upcoming weeks. In fact, this \namendment could have the effect of extending the tours of duty of \ntroops in Iraq beyond their currently scheduled rotation.\n  There is another thing that bothers me. I think we also need to think \nabout our constitutional scheme, how our Government is organized and \nordered. Constitutionally to enact an amendment such as this would \nclearly be an encroachment on the constitutional duties of the \nCommander in Chief. This is not an area where the Congress is welcomed \nto dictate. We have one Commander in Chief, not 535. We only elect one \nat a time. This Commander in Chief has a Secretary of Defense. It is \ntheir responsibility under our form of Government to determine what our \ntroop rotations should be.\n  There are other very practical considerations of why this should not \nhappen, why this is a bad idea. The Secretary of Defense goes into \nseveral items in his letter. But it does make sense, when you look at \nit, that units do not always stay together. Following an individual \nrather than a unit and following the deployment of an individual rather \nthan that of a unit is something that would be cumbersome, difficult, \nand, in fact, not a way in which we would be, in this very dangerous \ntime, having to run our military. The fact is, there is something here \nwhich is maybe the most underlying and important reason of all why this \namendment is not a good idea, which is the clear desire and design of \nthe amendment to limit the options of our military forces to maintain \nthe current policy in Iraq. We ought to not use the good intentions and \nthe good ideas about our soldiers, about our troops and their \nrotations, to have an underlying mission of simply saying, they can't \nkeep this up so they will have to pull troops out. We will change \npolicy by dictating how troops are rotated in and out of the \nbattlefield. The fact is, that could have serious consequences for our \nNation as other nations would view this as a vulnerability. It would be \nviewed as a weakness, as a fact that the United States is overextended \nand incapable of responding to crisis. It is these kinds of \nmisperceptions and misunderstandings that can lead irresponsible states \nto take irresponsible actions that could lead to frightening scenarios \nin the very dangerous world in which we live.\n  It is important to also note that many of the members of our Armed \nForces consider it a privilege and an honor to serve this Nation at \nthis difficult time. My recent trip to Iraq was in Tikrit. While there, \nI visited with a number of troops, some of them Floridians, all proud \nof their service. Over 90 percent of those troops had already \nreenlisted, knowing full well of our involvement in Iraq, knowing what \nthe expectations of their service would be during their time of \nreenlistment, and they had voluntarily reenlisted. Reenlistment rates \nof those serving in the theater are larger than those of any other. It \nis a testament to their courage, valor, and sense of duty to their \ncountry. We would demean their service if we were to say to them that \nthere had to be parity between the time in service out of the country \nand the time at home.\n  The goal ought to be for us not to have 15-month deployments. The \nhope would be that these would never be necessary. But a mandate from \nCongress that this is how we must operate our Armed Forces is ill-\nconceived. It is dangerous and does not serve either the national \ninterest of the Nation or the interest of the soldiers on the field \nwhom it is intended to serve. We should not have a subterfuge of policy \nto change direction in Iraq heaped on the backs of our brave men and \nwomen in uniform. If, in fact, there is the thought that this policy is \nwrong and it should be changed--and I know many Members feel that way; \nthere has been plenty of debate about this issue--there ought to be the \ncourage to say: We will not fund the troops. If you can't do that, you \nshouldn't do it this way. This is unnecessary. It is cumbersome, and it \nwill be detrimental to the national security of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11727-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11727-S11739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DWELL TIME\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Webb-Hagel \ndwell time amendment. Our service men and women are under constant \nstrain, spending more time in theater than they have with their \nfamilies. These men and women are risking their lives to protect this \ncountry, some on their fourth tour in Iraq. Their bodies are aching and \ntheir minds are stressed, but by the time they become acclimated to \nhome life, they are sent back into combat. Something must be done to \nprevent the breakdown of our military and the men and women who serve. \nThis amendment would provide our troops ample rest and recuperation, \ntime to visit with family, and an opportunity to extract our troops \nfrom the stress of war.\n  The Oregon National Guard has served admirably since we began combat \noperations in 2001. I could not be more proud of their contributions to \nthe war on terror while still serving as the foundation of their \nfamilies and communities.\n  Many citizen-soldiers have been on multiple deployments for over a \nyear at a time, placing a significant strain on their families, \nemployers, and communities. The amendment will give our soldiers \npredictability by preventing surprise deployments. Providing a \nconsistent schedule allows them to plan for this disruption. Often, \nthese men and women are the core of the community, the major \nbreadwinner of their family or a needed caregiver and require advanced \nnotice to plan for such a major disruption in their lives.\n  If current enlistment levels do not allow us to provide our troops \nwith the rest and recuperation needed to protect our Nation, then we \nmust examine increasing the number of volunteer troops, both Active \nDuty and Reserve.\n  For the past 10 years, we have shrunk the National Guard and ignored \ntheir call for needed resources. As a country, we are finally realizing \nthe importance of our citizen-soldiers. They serve admirably in combat \noperations overseas, they provide help at home in the face of a natural \ndisaster or emergency, and they are the bedrock of our community. \nGiving them some stability in their lives is the least we can do.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to join me in supporting the Webb-Hagel \ndwell time amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for 4 long years, our Nation has been \nengaged in a war without a clear objective, exit strategy, or \ninternational mandate, and the consequences of such policies have been \ndevastating. Our moral standing in the world has plummeted. Iraq is now \nmired in civil war, and terrorists have found a recruiting and training \nground for attacking American troops. But few effects of this war are \nmore troubling than the destructive impact this war has had on our \nArmed Forces.\n  Approximately 3,800 brave American servicemembers have been killed in \nIraq, and tens of thousands have been severely wounded. Military \nfamilies have been forced to endure long and repeated stretches of time \nwithout their loved ones. And most significant, our forces have been \nstretched thin to a near-breaking point. This can be seen in the ever \nincreasing number of suicides among our returning servicemembers, \nalltime low reenlistment rates, and the destruction of our military \nfamilies. The adage is true--we recruit a soldier, but we retain a \nfamily. And if that family is broken, so, too, will be the soldier.\n  While long deployments are testing our troops in the field, they are \nalso\n\n[[Page S11728]]\n\ntaxing critical stocks of combat gear and training time. According to \nsome reports, over two-thirds of our Army and 88 percent of our \nNational Guard are unable to report for duty due to equipment \nshortfalls and insufficient military instruction stateside.\n  The bipartisan Webb amendment is an important step toward restoring \nour military's readiness and providing the important support that our \nservicemembers and families need and deserve.\n  It would implement two simple principles--if a unit or member of a \nRegular component of the Armed Forces deploys to Iraq or Afghanistan, \nthey will have the same time at home before they are redeployed. No \nunit or member of a Reserve component, including the National Guard, \ncould be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within 3 years of their \nprevious deployment.\n  These are the very principles incoming Secretary of Defense Robert \nGates committed to months ago. And now, the distinguished junior \nSenator from Virginia has modified his proposal to address objections \nraised concerning both the time the Pentagon needs to implement it and \nthe flexibility needed for our special operations forces, SOF.\n  Senator Webb's amendment now allows 120 days for the Department to \nimplement its provisions and provides exceptions for SOF. But as is \nclear, the administration still objects to any interference by this \nbody in how we expect our troops to be treated. Of course, this body \nhas a unique role in the governance of our Armed Forces. Specifically, \narticle 1, section 8 of the Constitution states that the Congress shall \nhave the power to, `` make rules for the Government and Regulation of \nthe land and naval Forces.'' Obviously, the Founding Fathers of this \ngreat Nation had a very specific idea of how the Congress should behave \nwith respect to the troops--that Congress, and Congress alone, should \nhave the power and authority to govern and regulate our forces. We can \nsee first hand the tragedy that occurs when the administration is given \na free hand to engage our troops in conflict without any oversight from \nthis body--and we should reassert our constitutional prerogative.\n  Since the war's beginning I have tried to advance initiatives that \nwould reverse the administration's irresponsible defense policies, so \nthat our troops would be prepared and protected in combat and our \ncountry made safer. In 2003, I offered an amendment to the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill to add $322 million for critical \nprotective gear identified by the Army that the Bush administration had \nfailed to include in their budget. But it was blocked by the \nadministration and their allies. In 2004 and 2005, I authored \nlegislation, signed into law, to reimburse troops for equipment that \nthey had to purchase on their own because the Rumsfeld Pentagon failed \nto provide them with the body armor and other gear they needed to stay \nsafe. And last year, working with Senators Inouye, Reed, and Stevens, I \noffered an amendment to help address a $17 billion budget shortfall to \nreplace and repair thousands of war-battered tanks, aircraft, and \nvehicles. Without these additional resources, the Army Chief of Staff \nclaimed that U.S. Army readiness would deteriorate even further. This \nprovision was approved unanimously and enacted in law. But much more \nremains to be done.\n  Senator Webb's amendment is an important first step, but it is only \nthe first step. Ultimately, we need to withdraw our combat forces as \nquickly as possible. This can only be accomplished by changing our \nmission in Iraq, and it will only be accomplished when this body \nfinally stands up to the administration and their failed policies and \nenacts legislation that will bring our troops home. I strongly support \nthis amendment and hope all of our colleagues do as well.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the war in Iraq has severely \noverstretched and strained our military personnel and their families. \nAccording to many of our foremost experts, we're actually in danger of \nbreaking our military.\n  Frequent and extended deployments are over-taxing our brave military \nmen and women and their families and our support structures at home. \nIt's reducing our ability to adequately train our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and Marines.\n  The men and women of our military forces signed up in the belief that \nthey were going to defend America, and preserve our way of life. \nInstead, they find themselves entangled in an Iraqi civil war that is \nnot theirs to win or lose.\n  Their repeated and extended deployments breach the trust they have in \ntheir government. We as a Congress must do everything we can to ease \nthe strain.\n  The Department of Defense itself has set a goal of 2 years at home \nfor every year deployed, and that makes sense. It gives servicemembers \ntime to be with their families, and re-establish the bonds that we all \ntake for granted.\n  It also gives our servicemembers time to train--not just for a return \nto Iraq, but for other missions we may ask them to undertake.\n  Because of the President's misguided war and his so-called surge, the \nDepartment of Defense can no longer meet this goal.\n  As General Casey, Chief of Staff for the Army said last month, \n``Today's Army is out of balance. We're consumed with meeting the \ncurrent demands and we're unable to provide ready forces as rapidly as \nwe would like for other contingencies; nor are we able to provide an \nacceptable tempo of deployments to sustain our soldiers and families \nfor the long haul.''\n  What does the General mean when he says the army is ``consumed with \nmeeting current demands?''\n  Over 1.4 million American troops have served in Iraq or Afghanistan; \nMore than 420,000 troops have deployed more than once.\n  The Army has a total of 44 combat brigades, and all of them except \none--the First Brigade of the Second Infantry Division, which is \npermanently based in South Korea--have served at least one tour of duty \nin Iraq or Afghanistan, and the majority of these 43 brigades have done \nmultiple tours: 17 brigades have had two tours in Iraq or Afghanistan; \n13 brigades have had three tours in Iraq or Afghanistan; and 5 brigades \nhave had four tours in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  Army recruiting is struggling to maintain the current force \nstructure, let alone meet its goal of increasing its overall end \nstrength over the next 5 years.\n  The Army missed its recruiting goals for both May and June by a \ncombined total of more than 1,750, and it's borrowing heavily on future \ncommitments to meet its goals for this year.\n  Spending on enlistment and recruitment bonuses tripled from $328 \nmillion before the war in Iraq to over $1 billion last year.\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps, James Conway, says his marines \ncan't focus on conventional operations because training time is too \nscarce.\n  It's an impossible situation. Our military is strained--some would \nsay already broken--and we face a crisis in recruiting.\n  We can't continue to sacrifice our Nation's security and the \nreadiness of our forces while Iraq fights this civil war. This \namendment will give General Conway and General Casey the time they need \nto make sure that our forces are ready and able to defend our country \nagainst any threat. It will also show our appreciation for the men and \nwomen who serve our country so well. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, over 4 years of war have stressed our \nArmed Forces to the breaking point. Our Army and Marine Corps are \nstretched dangerously thin. They are performing magnificently, as they \nalways do. Chronic personnel and equipment shortages plague our \nnondeployed forces resulting in dangerously low readiness. As a nation, \nwe simply do not have the ground forces necessary, nor are the few \nuncommitted forces trained and ready, to protect our interests against \nother threats around the world. As Army Chief of Staff GEN George Casey \nput it:\n\n       The demand for our forces exceeds the sustainable supply.\n\n  Nearly 1.6 million servicemembers have been deployed to Iraq or \nAfghanistan. Of the Army's 43 active brigades available for rotation, \n10 brigades have been deployed three or more times. All others have \nbeen deployed once or twice, with the exception of one new brigade just \nforming. Of course, the single brigade stationed in Korea does not \ndeploy as part of the Iraq or Afghanistan rotation. All of our National \nGuard combat brigades have at least one rotation to Iraq, Afghanistan, \nor\n\n[[Page S11729]]\n\nKosovo. Two National Guard combat brigades have two rotations. Guard \nbrigades from Indiana, Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Minnesota, and New \nYork have been notified that they should be prepared to deploy at the \nend of this year.\n  Through the first part of this year, units pushed to Iraq as part of \nthe surge strategy barely had enough time to make up their personnel \nand equipment shortages or complete their training. Inadequate time to \nprepare for war puts a unit at risk when sent into harm's way.\n  We have the responsibility to make sure that our forces have adequate \ntime available to prepare and then use that time to best advantage. We \nhave accepted too much risk for too long.\n  Senator Webb's amendment goes to the heart of this obligation, \nensuring that our forces have the time they need to recover and \nprepare. Multiple rotations and insufficient dwell time inherently \nraise readiness risks. Units must have the time necessary to fully man, \nequip, and train prior to their next deployment. Readiness reports we \nreceive here in Congress consistently show that most of our nondeployed \nunits are not ready to deploy, and those getting ready to deploy to \nIraq and Afghanistan do not have personnel and equipment necessary for \ncomprehensive training until very late in their preparation. In order \nto provide some relief for the personnel shortages in next-to-deploy \nunits, the Army is cutting training at its important officer and NCO \nschools. The Army has gone so far as to institute a 6-day training week \nat many of these schools to accelerate getting troops back to their \nunits. For soldiers, especially young leaders and instructors just back \nfrom deployment, working a 6-day week starts to make dwell time feel a \nlot like deployment. Insufficient dwell time contributes to retention \nchallenges, especially among young officers.\n  There is ample evidence that multiple long deployments are impacting \nour troops' mental health and family stability. Servicemembers and \ntheir families, particularly among our young officers and NCOs, are \nvoting with their feet, leaving the military rather than endure the \nuncertainty and turmoil in their families' lives. There is no greater \nthreat to the quality and viability of our all-volunteer force than the \nloss of these combat-experienced young leaders.\n  The Webb amendment exempts our special operations forces. Their \ndeployment cycles are always irregular, their readiness sustained at \nmuch higher levels, and their ability to respond to emergencies is \ncritically important. The exemption in this amendment preserves that \nflexibility.\n  Servicemembers and their families are weary of the deployment cycle \nand uncertainty about timing and length of deployments. They are eager \nfor greater predictability about when and for how long troops will be \nat home or deployed. The Webb amendment will require the DOD to make \nearlier strategic and operational decisions which will result in \ngreater predictability and stability for troops and their families.\n  The Webb amendment will incentivize the Department of Defense to \ngreater certainty in the implementation of unit and individual rotation \npolicies. Controlling deployment cycles is the only way to rapidly stop \nthe dramatic loss of readiness in our nondeployed and next-to-deploy \nunits. Controlling deployment cycles is the only way to provide the \nfastest possible relief to our troops and their families. Controlling \ndeployment cycles is a critical step in preserving our all-volunteer \nmilitary system. The Webb amendment deserves the support of this \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the issues relating to Iraq have been \nvery complex, have aroused an enormous national reaction, and have been \nconsuming for those of us in the Congress trying to decide what is the \nbest course of action.\n  Had we known Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, \nI do not think we would have gone into Iraq. But once there, we do not \nwant to leave precipitously, and we do not want to leave Iraq in an \nunstable condition with all of the potential forces that might bode ill \nfor the United States in the future with respect to terrorism, with \nrespect to Iran moving into a vacuum, and many complex problems which \nmight arise.\n  The President, in his recent speech, and General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker, in their testimony before Congress, have gone to \nconsiderable distance in trying to move toward some of the areas of \nconcern. There have been commitments of troop withdrawal before \nChristmas. There are projections for additional troop withdrawal next \nyear. There has been a modification to some extent of the mission. But \nstill there is an unease with the current policy.\n  I voted against the Levin-Reed amendment when it came before the \nSenate because I think it is unwise to fix a firm date of withdrawal. \nIt just gives the insurgents a target date to shoot at to declare \nvictory.\n  I think the provisions of the Warner-Lugar amendment had much to \nrecommend them and joined as a cosponsor. I have already expressed on \nthe floor my concern that the Warner-Lugar amendment was not called \nbefore the Senate. I think its thrust to have required a report by the \nPresident by October 15 and the possibility of a withdrawal date later \nbut leaving the ultimate discretion to the President would have been a \nstep forward. It would have imposed an obligation on the part of the \nPresident, the administration, to come forward with a plan.\n  I have also cosponsored the Salazar-Alexander amendment, which \nincorporates the findings of the independent study group. I believe \nthat is a general outline which is desirable to follow. Again, I \nexpressed my concern when the majority leader took down this bill \nbefore calling up the Salazar-Alexander amendment. I have cosponsored \nthat as an outline. Again, it does not place the administration in a \nstraitjacket but outlines certain goals and certain objectives.\n  I believe the idea advanced by Senator Biden for some time now, to \ndivide Iraq into three parts--the Shiites, the Sunnis, and the Kurds--\nwhere those factions have been engaging in violent warfare, is an idea \nwhich is worth pursuing. Again, that is a matter which has to be \ndecided by the Iraqi Government, not by the Congress of the United \nStates, but Senator Biden has couched it in the form of a resolution, \nreally, on what amounts to a recommendation.\n  I have been considering the amendment offered by the junior Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Webb. I discussed the issue with him last week and \nsince that time have undertaken to try to find out what the impact of \nthe Webb amendment would be on force projection.\n  I met with LTG Carter Ham last week. General Ham is in charge of \noperations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  During the course of that meeting, General Ham outlined the \nprojection by the Department of Defense that they could meet that 1-to-\n1 ratio--12 months in Iraq and 12 months at home, which is the thrust \nof the Webb amendment--that they could meet that objective by October \n1, 2008, the beginning of the next fiscal year. General Ham was not \nsupportive of the Webb amendment because he raised a number of concerns \nthat on its face, if you enact the Webb amendment, there are troops in \nIraq now who will have to stay longer. There would have to be \nadditional calls to the Reserves and National Guard. There might be a \nneed to take people out of units which would impact on morale, but that \nif there were an October 1 date, 2008, that the 1-to-1 ratio could be \nachieved, according to the Department of Defense projections.\n  Earlier today, at the invitation of Senator Warner, I met to talk \nagain to LTG Carter Ham and to LTG Lovelace who works with General Ham. \nDuring the course of that meeting, the target date of October 1, 2008, \nto be the 1-to-1 ratio was reaffirmed. There was an additional factor \ninjected into the discussion, and that is the factor of some 5,500 \nadditional troops in a variety of categories, special forces and \nothers, where this 1-to-1 ratio could not be met by October 1.\n\n[[Page S11730]]\n\n  Following that meeting, I have had telephone conversations with \nSecretary of Defense Gates and National Security Adviser Hadley to get \nsome sense of the position of the Department of Defense and the \nadministration. Secretary Gates confirmed the ability of the Department \nof Defense to meet in general terms the 1-to-1 ratio by October 1, \n2008. He talked about some other difficulties and, obviously, is not \nendorsing any plan. The administration would prefer not to have any \ncongressional action on this subject. Similarly, after an extended \ntelephone conversation with National Security Adviser Hadley, I heard \nthe reasons there is opposition--the difficulty of knowing whether the \nfactors on the ground will be as they are projected now, and they are \nresisting congressional action which would tie the hands of the \nadministration.\n  In considering these issues, I have been very concerned about the \nproblems of micromanaging the Department of Defense by the Congress. \nThere is no question we are not equipped to do that. I have studied the \nconstitutional law aspects, and I studied the case of Fleming v. Page \n[50 U.S. 603 (1850)], a decision by Chief Justice Taney, and the case \nof the United States v. Lovett [328 U.S. 303 (1946)], decided by the \nSupreme Court in 1946. I am well aware of the authority, the broad \nauthority the Constitution vests in the President under Article II as \nCommander in Chief, but I am also cognizant of the authority of the \nCongress under Article I, Section 8: ``To raise and support Armies;'' \n``To provide and maintain a Navy;'' ``To make rules for the government \nand Regulation of the land and naval Forces;'' ``To provide for \norganizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing \nsuch Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United \nStates.''\n  We have seen the Supreme Court recently strike down executive action \non military commissions, saying it is the function of the Congress of \nthe United States, and the Congress has acted there. So there is \nauthority for the Congress on that premise, in addition to our power of \nthe purse, our power of appropriation.\n  I have discussed the matter with Senator Webb and have indicated--\nhave stated an interest on my part in supporting the Webb amendment, if \nthe concerns which have been expressed to me by the Department of \nDefense could be accommodated, and that is a change of date to October \n1, and an accommodation of the 5,500 specialty forces that cannot be \nenumerated. Of course, there is the waiver provision which is already \npresent in the Webb amendment. I asked about the possibility of \ndeferring the vote. I think that if there was an understanding by other \nSenators about the ability of the Department of Defense to meet a 2008 \nOctober 1 date, and the flexibility needed on some 5,500 additional \ntroops, there might be some additional interest in the amendment. I am \ntold, at least as of this moment of 4:36, the vote is going to go ahead \n5:15. But I have discussed the matter, as I say, with the sponsor of \nthe amendment, Senator Webb.\n  There is also the obvious factor that what we do here is unlikely, in \nany event, to have the full effect of law. If the Webb amendment gets \n60 votes and is embodied in congressional enactment, it is virtually \ncertain to be vetoed by the President of the United States, and there \nare not 67 votes to override a Presidential veto. But our function in \nthe Congress is to exercise our best judgment and pass what we think is \nappropriate. Then, under our constitutional system, it is the \nprerogative of the President to either sign or veto. So we take all of \nthese matters a step at a time. There is a lot of concern in the \nCongress of the United States about what is happening now, and an \ninterest in, if it can be structured, congressional action which would \nbe helpful. All of this is obviously very involved and requires a lot \nof analysis and consideration.\n  I think it would be a very helpful thing for the U.S. effort, \ngenerally, if the Congress and the President could come to an agreement \non a policy and a plan without leaving it solely to the discretion of \nthe executive branch. The Congress is going to continue funding, and I \nhave voted for that. We are not going to put the troops at risk. We are \nnot going to set times for withdrawal. It is possible we could use the \nVietnam model, where funding existed up to a certain date on the \ncondition that the troops be reduced to a certain number and then by \nanother date. That hasn't been tried, but I think it unlikely the \nCongress is going to go that route. We are too concerned about the \ntroops and we want to support them, but we are also gripped with a \nsense of unease as to what is happening.\n  There is agreement between the Department of Defense, for the purpose \nof Senator Webb's amendment, that the stays in Iraq are too long. We \nhave noted the increase in the suicide rate, the increase in the \ndivorce rate, the increase in psychiatric problems and stress \ndisorders. The policy of the Department of Defense is to have 2 months \nat home for every 1 month in Iraq for the Army; 5 months at home for \nevery 1 month in Iraq for the Reserves. We are far from that. So we are \nstruggling and groping to try to find an answer. In the course of the \nremaining time before the roll is called, I am going to see if it is \npossible to find some constructive way forward and some rational basis \nfor the vote I will cast.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have watched and listened to the \ndebate today on the floor of the Senate. It is a debate in many ways \nthat is similar to debates we have had on previous occasions, and I \nknow there are people on all sides who feel passionately about these \nissues. I respect differences of opinion. I respect those who come to \nthe floor and say: Here is how I see it, here is what I believe, and \nhere is what I think we should do.\n  This is a very important issue. There is so much at stake for our \ncountry with respect to this issue of the war in Iraq. It casts a \nshadow on virtually everything else we consider and do in public policy \nand our relationships around the world. It is a situation I think that \nrequires us to do the best we can to develop public policy that finds a \nway to extract ourselves from what has largely become a civil war with \nsectarian violence in the country of Iraq, and take the fight to the \nterrorists.\n  I wish to raise a few points about fighting terrorism, even as I come \nto the floor to support the amendment offered by Senator Webb. I think \nit is an amendment that has great merit and an amendment that will be \nsupportive of the best interests of this country in pursuing the war \nagainst terror.\n  Let me say there have been a series of reports--an almost dizzying \nnumber of reports and speeches and testimony over the last several \nweeks--about the status of the war in Iraq and the performance of the \nIraqi Government. There are claims and counterclaims; I expect there is \nspinning on all sides of these issues. Much of it has been about \nwhether the U.S. military surge of 30,000 troops since January 2007 has \nworked and about the benchmarks--about whether the Iraqi Government has \nbeen willing to or has made progress in meeting benchmarks it has \npromised to meet to do its job, to justify U.S. troops fighting and \ndying in their country. Through all of that, it seems to me there are \nthree facts that are clear. First, only political reconciliation among \nthe Shiites, the Sunnis, and the Kurds will stop the civil war that \nrages in Iraq. Only political reconciliation will ultimately solve this \nproblem.\n\n  Second, the Iraqi Government has made very little progress--perhaps \nsome in several areas but in the main very little progress toward the \nneeded reconciliation.\n  Third, terrorism remains the No. 1 threat to the United States. The \nJuly National Intelligence Estimate makes the case. This is not coming \nfrom me; this comes from a July 2007 National Intelligence Estimate. \nThe unclassified portion says:\n\n       Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the homeland. We assess that the group has \n     protected or regenerated key elements of its homeland attack \n     capability, including: A safe haven in the\n\n[[Page S11731]]\n\n     Pakistan federally administered tribal areas, operational \n     lieutenants, and its top leadership.\n\n  Let me say again that it says that ``al-Qaida is and will remain the \nmost serious terrorist threat to the homeland.'' We know that as of \nlast week, Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, al-Zawahiri, and \nothers who lead al-Qaida are still speaking to us through videos and \nthrough voice tapes, giving us their version of the world. These are \npeople who have boasted about murdering innocent Americans on 9/11, and \nsix years later, they remain in what the National Intelligence Estimate \nsays is somewhere on this planet that is secure or safe. It is almost \nunbelievable to me that there is a ``safe haven'' anyplace on this \nplanet for the people who have boasted of initiating the 9/11 attacks \nagainst this country, but that is what our National Intelligence \nEstimate says--they are in a safe haven.\n  There ought not be 1 square inch on planet Earth that is safe for the \nleadership of al-Qaida. How did we come to this point of having a safe \nhaven for those very terrorists who initiated the attacks against this \ncountry and who, as our most recent National Intelligence Estimate \nsays, remain the most serious terrorist threat to our country? How have \nwe reached that point? What has been happening while we have surged \ntroops in Iraq? Well, as I indicated, Osama bin Laden released two \nvideos, one on September 7 and one on September 11. He boasted about \nthe 19 hijackers who did the killings on September 11 and rambled on \nabout the coming downfall of America, as is his custom.\n  Regardless of what Osama bin Laden has said, our National \nIntelligence Estimate says that al-Qaida is back stronger than ever and \nterrorism remains the No. 1 threat to the U.S. homeland. I think we \nneed a set of policies that focuses on fighting terrorists first. \nFrankly, what is happening in Iraq is not the central fight on \nterrorism. It seems to me the central fight on terrorism is to \neliminate the leadership that represents the greatest threat to our \ncountry, and they are not in Iraq. That leadership, we are told by the \nNational Intelligence Estimate, is in a safe haven in the Pakistan \nfederally administered tribal areas.\n  I don't mean to say that dealing with that would be easy or without \ndifficulty. I do mean to say that if this represents the judgment of \nour National Intelligence Estimate, and if we know--and we all do--that \nthose who boasted about initiating the 9/11 attacks are there and are \npledging additional attacks against our homeland, it seems to me that \nshould be where we focus our country's priority of action.\n  We are told, by the way, that the leadership of that terrorist \norganization that is, again, the most serious threat to this country--\nwe are told they have regenerated.\n  Here is a September 11 story quoting our intelligence officials. The \nheadline is ``Al-Qaida's Return: The Terrorists Have a Sanctuary Once \nAgain.'' In the last week or so, we have seen terrorist arrests in \nDenmark and in Germany, and we see that these arrests, particularly in \nGermany, are for terrorists plotting attacks against large U.S. \nmilitary bases. Those attacks against our military base in Europe are \nbeing plotted by terrorists who have trained in Pakistan, which is the \nvery area where the Intelligence Community says Osama bin Laden has \nregenerated his terrorist training camps in the tribal area.\n  Madam President, this issue of a sanctuary for terrorists to begin \nplanning additional attacks against our country, as they are apparently \nnow doing, it seems to me ought to claim our attention and ought to \nclaim the policy debate about what is the approach this country might \nbest use.\n  My colleague from Virginia comes to the floor with respect to this \nissue of the war in Iraq. What are we doing in the war in Iraq? What \nabout the surge and the road ahead? What about the Petraeus report? My \ncolleague has made an important argument on the Senate floor about the \nstrength of the U.S. military if you don't provide ample opportunity \nfor the U.S. military to have sufficient time home from the battlefield \nto rest and regenerate and also sufficient time for additional \ntraining.\n  Madam President, the point of the amendment offered by Senator Webb \nis to provide a sufficient opportunity for troops who are on station, \non duty in a war zone 24 hours a day, to give them time to retrain, \nrest, and refresh. You cannot have a fighting force that doesn't have \nthat opportunity. That is what my colleague from Virginia is suggesting \nin his amendment.\n  My point about this is that as we discuss how to deal with these \nissues in Iraq, we are, on a course at the moment that says our mission \nin Iraq is to go door to door in Baghdad in the middle of sectarian \nviolence or a civil war. My point is, while that is going on, while we \nare in the middle of a civil war in Baghdad with our soldiers--and, \nyes, there is some al-Qaida presence there, but that is not the \nmajority of what is happening there; it is largely a civil war. While \nwe are doing that, here is what we are understanding and knowing. This \nis not a claim, this is what we know: ``Europeans Get Terror Training \nInside Pakistan.'' We picked them up in Denmark and Germany. We find \nout that the terrorists are being trained in Pakistan. We are told that \nis where the al-Qaida leadership is, reconstituting its base, its \nstrength, building new training camps. We picked up the people who are \nthreatening to attack the largest military installation owned by the \nUnited States in Europe.\n  Should that surprise us? Not if we have been reading the newspaper. \nWe don't have to read the intelligence; we can just read the newspaper.\n  This is a New York Times newspaper story from February 19 of this \nyear. This is from our intelligence officials talking about what they \nknow:\n\n       Senior leaders of al-Qaida, operating from Pakistan over \n     the past year, have set up a band of training camps in the \n     tribal regions near the Afghan border, according to American \n     intelligence and counterterrorism officials. American \n     officials said there was mounting evidence that Osama bin \n     Laden and his deputy, al-Zawahiri, have been steadily \n     building an operations hub in the mountainous Pakistan tribal \n     area of north Waziristan.\n\n  Now we have picked up terrorists who were trained there. We are told \nby the National Intelligence Estimate that the greatest threat to our \ncountry is from the al-Qaida organization and the leadership of al-\nQaida, who are now planning terrorist attacks against our homeland. \nThat is the greatest threat to our country. So what are we doing? We \nare going door to door in Baghdad in the middle of a civil war while \nthere is a ``safe haven'' on this Earth, apparently, for the leadership \nof al-Qaida. Is there common sense missing here? Would one not think \nthose who boasted of murdering 3,000-plus Americans on 9/11, 2001, that \nthey would have long ago been apprehended? President Bush was asked \nabout this, and he said, ``I don't think about Osama bin Laden and the \nleadership of al-Qaida.'' I really think we ought to take the fight to \nwhat the National Intelligence Estimate insists is the greatest threat \nto our country, and I don't believe that is happening.\n  I support the effort of my colleague from Virginia. I think that \namendment is one which will give our military the opportunity to \nretrain, rest, and be refreshed and represent the kind of fighting \nforce we want and need. All of us are proud of our American soldiers \nwho walk in harm's way.\n  There is a verse about those soldiers and patriots:\n\n       When the night is full of knives and the drums are heard \n     and the lightning is seen, it's the patriots that are always \n     there ready to step forward and fight and die, if necessary, \n     for their country.\n\n  We have a lot of patriots who got up this morning and put on body \narmor and are walking in harm's way on behalf of this country. What we \nowe them, it seems to me, as policymakers is our unyielding support for \nwhatever they need to finish their job. In addition, we owe them good \npolicy that focuses on attacking and destroying and eliminating the \ngreatest terrorist threat to this country. And nobody should take it \nfrom me; take it from the National Intelligence Estimate of July of \nthis year. The greatest terrorist threat to our country is Al-Qaida.--I \nwill put the chart back up:\n\n       Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the homeland.\n\n  The NIE says that they have a safe haven in Pakistan. So that is the \nfight--to eliminate the greatest terrorist threat to our homeland. \nThere ought not to be a square inch of safe haven anywhere on this \nplanet for that group.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S11732]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 5:20 p.m. be for debate with respect to the Webb \namendment 2909, with the time divided as follows: Senator Durbin be \nrecognized for 5 minutes; at 5:05, the majority leader be recognized \nfor 10 minutes; and at 5:15, for 5 minutes, which would be immediately \nprior to the vote, it be equally divided and controlled between \nSenators McCain and Webb or their designees; and that at 5:20, without \nintervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to vote on the \namendment; further, that upon disposition of the Webb amendment, there \nbe 10 minutes of debate with respect to the McCain-Graham amendment No. \n2918, with the time equally divided and controlled between Senators \nMcCain and Webb; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the amendment; that no amendment be in order to \neither amendment in this agreement; that each amendment must achieve 60 \nvotes to be agreed to, and if neither vote achieves 60 votes, it be \nwithdrawn; that if either amendment receives 60 votes, then it be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to object, earlier I asked for some \ntime. I asked for 10 minutes, but I would like to have at least 5 \nminutes before the vote. If we can do that, I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That would make the vote at 5:25. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So Senator Carper would be after Senator Durbin for 5 \nminutes, and everything else will be delayed for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Parliamentary inquiry: Is it necessary to call up \namendment No. 2918 or is it in order according to the unanimous consent \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will need to be called up.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2918 to amendment No. 2011\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. At this time, I call up amendment No. 2918 to be in order \naccording to the unanimous consent agreement propounded by the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2918.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on Department of Defense \n                      policy regarding dwell time)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1031. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE POLICY \n                   REGARDING DWELL TIME RATIO GOALS FOR MEMBERS OF \n                   THE ARMED FORCES DEPLOYED IN SUPPORT OF \n                   OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND OPERATION ENDURING \n                   FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the wartime demands in support of Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) placed on \n     the men and women of the Armed Forces, both in the regular \n     and reserve components, and on their families and loved ones, \n     have required the utmost in honor, courage, commitment, and \n     dedication to duty, and the sacrifices they have made and \n     continue to make in the defense of our nation will forever be \n     remembered and revered;\n       (2) members of the Armed Forces who have completed combat \n     deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan should be afforded as \n     much ``dwell time'' as possible at their home stations prior \n     to re-deployment; and\n       (3) consistent with wartime requirements, the Department of \n     Defense should establish a force management policy for \n     deployments of units and members of the Armed Forces in \n     support of Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring \n     Freedom (including participation in the NATO International \n     Security Assistance Force (Afghanistan)) as soon as \n     practicable that achieves the goal of--\n       (A) for units and members of the regular components of the \n     Armed Forces, providing for a period between the deployment \n     of the unit or member that is equal to or longer than the \n     period of the previous deployment of the unit or member;\n       (B) for units and members of the reserve components of the \n     Armed Forces, and particularly for units and members in the \n     ground forces, limiting deployment if the unit or member has \n     been deployed at any time within the three years preceding \n     the date of the deployment; and\n       (C) ensuring the capability of the Armed Forces to respond \n     to national security needs.\n       (b) Certifications Required.--The Secretary of Defense may \n     not implement any force management policy regarding mandatory \n     ratios of deployed days and days at home station for members \n     of the Armed Forces deployed in support of Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom until the Secretary \n     submits to Congress certifications as follows:\n       (1) That the policy would not result in extension of \n     deployment of units and members of the Armed Forces already \n     deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan beyond their current \n     scheduled rotations.\n       (2) That the policy would not cause broader and more \n     frequent mobilization of National Guard and Reserve units and \n     members in order to accomplish operational missions.\n       (c) National Security Waiver Authority.--The Secretary of \n     Defense may waive the provisions of any force management \n     policy and any attendant certification requirement under \n     subsection (a) or (b), and the applicability of such a policy \n     to a member of the Armed Forces or any group of members, if \n     the Secretary determines that the waiver is necessary in the \n     national security interests of the United States.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with that modification, I ask that the \nunanimous consent request be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I understand that under the agreement, I \nhave 5 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the Webb amendment. \nWhat is the Senator from Virginia, a Marine Corps veteran from Vietnam, \ntrying to do? It is actually easy to state. He wants to make sure that \nwhen our troops are deployed, they have at least as much time home \nbetween deployments as they do the length of the deployment. If they \nare deployed for a year, they will have a year at home before they are \ndeployed again. If they are deployed 15 months, they will have 15 \nmonths at home before they are deployed again.\n  Madam President, you have been to Iraq and I have been there, too--\nthree times. I do not profess to be an expert on the military. That is \nnot a field of my training or expertise, but I talk to those who are. \nThe last time I visited Iraq, I went to Patrol Base Murray, south of \nBaghdad 12 miles, part of the surge, the Third Infantry Division, Fort \nStewart, GA, and saw the Illinois soldiers and others. I had a little \nlunch with them.\n  As I was starting to leave, one of the officers came over to me and \nspoke to me privately. Do you know what he told me? He said: Senator, \n15 months is too long. These troops have to be on guard every moment of \nevery day for roadside bombs and snipers and other dangers.\n  He said: After 12 months, I work so hard to keep them on their toes \nso they come home safe and protect the soldiers who are with them. \nFifteen months is too long. He told me: I am a career soldier. My wife \nknew what we were getting into long ago. So I leave, but it is tough on \nmy family.\n  He said: When I left Fort Stewart, GA, my daughter was in the sixth \ngrade. When I get back home, she will be in the eighth grade. I will \nhave missed a year in her life. That is the price we pay.\n  He said: These young soldiers with babies at home, they are e-mailing \ntheir wives every single day. They are hearing how the babies are \ngrowing up and the problems the family is having. At the end of the \nyear, they can't wait to go home, and we tell them: Give us 3 more \nmonths.\n  I said: What about the 12 months in between deployments?\n  He said: It is not enough; 12 months is not enough time to \nreconstitute our unit, retrain them, equip them, give them time with \ntheir families so they can get their lives back together. Twelve months \nis not enough.\n  I said: How much time do you need?\n  He said: Twice that. Give us 2 years. That is what it takes.\n  That is the reality of this war on the ground. So when we hear the \narguments being made by Senators that somehow we should not, as a \nSenate, be sticking our nose into the business of how they manage the \nmilitary overseas, I am sorry, but that is part of our constitutional \nobligation. We do not just declare the war and send the money; we have \nresponsibilities that reach far beyond that.\n  Over the years, Congress has spoken to the number of troops our \ncountry will have. It has spoken to whether those troops can be \ndeployed overseas. It has passed laws restricting Presidents from \nsending troops overseas\n\n[[Page S11733]]\n\nwithout at least 4 months or 6 months of training. We have restricted \nthe roll of women in the military. Time and again, Congress has spoken \nunder its constitutional authority to make certain our military is \ntreated properly. That is part of my responsibility as a Senator. It is \npart of every Senator's responsibility.\n  Calling this micromanagement is unfair to our troops. Our soldiers \nand their families are making more sacrifices than any of us serving in \nthis Chamber today. They are risking their lives at this very moment. \nAll they ask for is a little more time to be with their families, a \nlittle more time to get their unit combat ready before it is sent out \nagain.\n  Senator Webb knows this story because he lived it in Vietnam as a \nmarine. He knows it as a father of a soldier who is in Iraq today. We \nshould know it too, and we should understand something as well. It is \ntrue, as someone once said, war is hell, but politicians should not \nmake it any worse, and we are making it worse when we push these \nsoldiers to the limit.\n  Look at the numbers coming back to us: Divorce rates among our \nsoldiers now reaching record highs, suicide rates higher than any time \nsince Vietnam, cash incentives to bring people into the military and \nkeep them at a record level of $10,000 and $20,000, waiving the \nrequirements so we can fill the ranks with people who have not \ngraduated from high school or have some criminal records. These are the \nrealities of the Army today.\n  For the President to stand and boldly say, ``I am sending the troops \ninto battle'' is to ignore the reality. Many of our warriors are weary. \nHaving fought the good fight and stood up for this country, they \ndeserve for this Senate to stand up for them and adopt the Webb \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise in support of the Webb amendment. \nI have had a chance to think about this issue that is before us today \nwearing a hat other than my hat as Senator. During my time in the \nVietnam war, I served 5 years active duty as a naval flight officer. I \nspent 3 tours in Southeast Asia with my squad. I spent another 18 years \nafter that as a Naval Reserve flight officer, staying current in the P-\n3 aircraft and was made mission commander of that aircraft.\n  Then for 5 years before I came to the Senate, from 1993 to 2001, I \nwore another hat. I was commander in chief of the Delaware National \nGuard, a force that served in the last 15 years in two wars--the \nPersian Gulf war and the Iraq war to date.\n  So I have had a chance to think about this issue, not just as a \nperson who helps set policy for our country but someone who has worn a \nuniform on active duty in a hot war, wore a uniform in the Cold War, \nand then as commander in chief of my State's National Guard.\n  When I first heard of this idea that Senator Webb had come up with of \nequaling the Active-Duty deployed time with the dwell time folks have \nto catch up, to retrain, reunite with their families for Active-Duty \npersonnel, I had some questions about it. I know others do as well.\n  One of the questions I had was, what if the President or what if the \nSecretary of Defense felt a particular individual with certain skills \nor unit that brought certain attributes to a fight were needed. Could \nthe President or the Secretary of Defense intercede and be able to say: \nWe need this individual, we need this unit. As it turns out, that \nconcern has been addressed.\n  What if you had an individual who said: I know I am entitled to 12 \nmonths downtime or 2 years downtime, dwell time back home. I don't want \nto use it. I want to go back and serve. The question is, Does this \namendment allow that to happen? And it does.\n  A number of legitimate questions have been raised not just as to the \nintent but the practical effect of the legislation, and I believe they \nhave been addressed in a good way.\n  Another concern was, if we adopt this amendment, if it is passed as \npart of a Defense authorization bill and the President signs it, does \nit take effect immediately. If this provision were to take effect \nimmediately, I would not want to be Secretary of Defense or Secretary \nof the Navy. I would want to have time to try to make this work. It is \nnot going to be easy, but given a reasonable amount of time, it could \nwork.\n  To his credit, Senator Webb changed the early language of the \namendment, I think after consulting with Secretary Gates, in order to \nsay we are going to provide, after enactment of this provision, after \nit is signed into law, 4 months during which the Secretary of Defense \nand our services have a chance to figure out how we actually work with \nthis provision and make it work.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for providing the kind of \nflexibility that is needed if we are going to enact this kind of \nlegislation. I think it is good policy. I believe some major concerns \nthat I and others had have been addressed.\n  My last point is I wish to talk about what it is like to be a \nreservist or guardsman. My Active-Duty squad flew out of the naval air \nstation at Willow Grove, PA, north of Philadelphia. I tell my \ncolleagues, if the men--and we were all men in my squadron at that \ntime--if we thought we were going to be deployed a year or two, come \nback and then go back a year or two, we would not have had much in \nterms of reenlistment and reupping. They would be gone. It is not a \nquestion of patriotism, that is the fact. They have families to \nsupport. They have jobs. In their own lives, they have businesses, in \nsome cases, to run. They need the kind of break that is envisioned in \nthis legislation to enable them to not just be a patriot, to be a \nreservist, to be a citizen twice over but to always keep commitments to \ntheir families, keep commitments to their employers, and keep \ncommitments, in many cases, to their employees, to the businesses they \nhave started and gone on to run.\n  This is a good provision. It is a good proposal. It is better \nactually than the proposal we voted on several months ago. I urge my \ncolleagues, particularly those who are on the fence--most people have \nmade up their minds--particularly those on the fence, they can vote for \nthis amendment not just in good conscience but I think knowing the \nquestions that needed to be addressed have been addressed and that the \npeople who will benefit from this will very much appreciate our taking \nthis step.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will come a time in the not-too-\ndistant future when people will write about what we as a Senate did, \nwhat we as a Congress did regarding this intractable war in which we \nfind ourselves in faraway Iraq.\n  I approach my comments today recognizing people are going to look \nback at what we do to make sure our country is safe and secure and that \nwe have done everything we can to make sure not only is our country \nsafe and secure but we do everything we can to allow the men and women \nin our military to be safe and secure.\n  The fight to end the war in Iraq and refocus our efforts against \nthose who attacked us on 9/11 has now raged in this Chamber and \nthroughout the country for months--no, not months, for years.\n  On one side, Democrats stand united to responsibly end the war, to \nbegin to bring home our brave soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors, \nand refocus our attention to Osama bin Laden, his al-Qaida operatives, \nand others around the world who seek to do us harm.\n  On the other side, most of our Republican colleagues, including some \nwho have publicly questioned the current course, stand with the \nPresident and his failed policies. Seven Republicans have previously \nvoted courageously for this amendment. The amendment is better than it \nwas last time. Certainly they should vote that way again.\n  We on this side of the aisle are not going to stop waging the hard \nbut necessary fight to responsibly end this war. Today we have the \nopportunity to take an important step in that direction by voting for \nan amendment upon which all of us, Democrat or Republican, can and \nshould agree.\n\n  Regardless of where we stand on this war, we should stand as one in \nour commitment to keeping our military the strongest in the world. We \ncan only sustain that strength if our men and women in uniform are \ngiven the respect they deserve and the opportunity\n\n[[Page S11734]]\n\nto reset, rebuild, and restore their capabilities. That is not a \nDemocratic talking point or a Republican talking point. It is common \nsense, and in this debate it is long overdue.\n  On President Bush's watch, our military and their families have been \nstretched to the breaking point. This is not idle talk. Every single \none of the Army's 38 available combat brigades is either deployed, just \nreturning or scheduled to go to Iraq or Afghanistan, leaving no fresh \ntroops to replace the five extra brigades sent to Iraq earlier this \nyear. Most Army brigades have completed two or even three tours in Iraq \nor Afghanistan, with one, the 2nd Brigade of the 10th Mountain \nDivision, having served four tours already.\n  The Army has been forced to rely on a so-called $20,000 ``quick-\nship'' bonus to meet recruiting goals, paying soldiers $20,000 to stay \nin the military, in part to make up for last year's shortage of \nmilitary officers. We are 3,000 officers short, and the number is only \nprojected to rise.\n  Eighty percent of our National Guard and Reserves have been deployed \nto Iraq or Afghanistan and are serving an average of 18 months per \ndeployment.\n  Those National Guard and Reserves remaining in the United States have \n30 percent of the essential equipment they need because so much of it \nhas been shipped overseas, destroyed, in need of repair, or now \nobsolete. Thirty percent is what they have in case of an emergency, and \nthey have to help in this country. We have all heard of the heavy \npersonal toll this overburdening of our military is taking. Let me give \ntwo examples.\n\n  First, the heartbreaking story of Army PFC Travis Virgadamo of Las \nVegas. Travis was a boy who loved his country. What did he want to do? \nHe wanted to go in the military, and he did that. He loved serving in \nthe military. He saw it, as his family said, as his calling. Yet after \nmonths of serving in Iraq--and here is how he described it, ``being \nordered into houses without knowing what was behind strangers' doors, \nwalking along roadsides fearing the next step could trigger lethal \nexplosives''--and he said other things, but that is enough--the horrors \nwere more than this 19-year-old could take.\n  He sought therapy. He wanted to have somebody help him with his \nemotional status while he was overseas, but he got nothing. He came \nhome, asked for help, and was given some medicine and forced to go back \nto Iraq. He felt as if he wasn't going to be able to do his job. His \nfamily knew it. They talked about it. As I said, he was given medicine \nand sent back for his second tour of duty. Travis was, I repeat, 19 \nyears old when he committed suicide after going back to Iraq for just a \nmatter of weeks.\n  The ordeal he went through was sadly far from unique. Is this fair? \nIs this fair to those other troops he was asked to serve with and who \nrelied upon him? The answer is no.\n  Last year, the Veterans Affairs Department reported that more than \n56,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan had been diagnosed with mental \nillness--56,000. Many of them had been sent back into battle without \nreceiving adequate care.\n  A second example. SGT Anthony J. Schober, a 23-year-old from northern \nNevada, was killed in May in an ambush while serving his fourth tour of \nduty. I had the chance to speak with Anthony's family--his grandfather. \nBefore returning to Iraq for the last time, Anthony told his \ngrandfather and other family members he knew he wouldn't be coming \nhome. He had survived too many explosions, in his words. Too many of \nhis buddies were killed who were with him.\n  Madam President, if my time expires, I will use my leader time.\n  Travis and Anthony died as heroes. Our troops are all heroes, but \nAnthony and Travis weren't machines, they were people, one 19 years \nold, one 23 years old. They sacrificed so much--all our troops have--\nand asked for so little in return. We want to give them something in \nreturn. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  With gratitude for their service and recognition that our national \nsecurity demands no less, I rise to once again support the amendment \noffered by Jim Webb, representing the Commonwealth of Virginia. They \nsent to Washington to represent them in the Senate a brave man. It is \nmore than his ability to talk and say the right thing courageously. \nHere is a man who is qualified to talk about this. He has been in \ncombat. The author of this amendment is a Naval Academy graduate, a \nMarine Corps commander, received a Silver Star award for heroism, the \nNavy Cross, the Bronze Star for heroism, a couple of Purple Hearts, and \nwas a Secretary of the Navy. His amendment, his readiness amendment, \nbegins the critical and long overdue process of rebuilding our badly \noverburdened military.\n  It is simple, his amendment. It states:\n\n       If a member of the active military is deployed to Iraq or \n     Afghanistan, they are entitled to the same length of time \n     back home before they can be redeployed.\n\n  It also states:\n\n       Members of the Reserves may not be redeployed within 3 \n     years of their original deployment--which will not only give \n     them time to recover from deployment, but will also restore \n     our reserve forces ability and availability to respond to \n     emergencies here at home.\n\n  Some have tried to confuse this issue by calling it an infringement \nof Presidential authority. That argument was debunked the first time \nanyone ever suggested it. The Constitution of the United States, \narticle I, section 8, says Congress is empowered:\n\n       To make rules for the government and regulation of the land \n     and naval forces.\n\n  This argument is undercut even further by the fact the amendment \nprovides ample authority for the President to waive these requirements \nin case of an emergency that threatens our national security. The Webb \namendment establishes a new policy, but it doesn't tie the President or \nCongress's hands to respond to any emergency.\n  If we are committed to building a military that is fully equipped and \nprepared to address the challenges we face throughout the world--and I \nknow we are--then we must support this amendment. If we are committed \nto repaying in some small measure the sacrifices our brave troops are \nmaking every day--and I know we are--then we must support this \namendment.\n  The decision by Republican leadership to thwart the will of the \nmajority in this body from adopting this troop readiness amendment back \nin July was discouraging, to say the least. And after 3 more months of \nkeeping our troops enmeshed in a civil war, their continued effort to \nundermine this legislation today is simply inexplicable to me. If \nRepublicans oppose troop readiness, they are entitled to vote against \nthis. If Republicans don't believe our courageous men and women in \nuniform deserve more rest and mental health, they can vote ``no'' on \nthis amendment. If they do not agree constant redeployments and \nrecruitment shortages are straining our armed forces, they can vote \n``no'' on this amendment. If they believe it is in our national \nsecurity interest to push our brave troops and their families beyond \ntheir breaking point, then let them vote ``no'' on this amendment. But \nto stop the majority of this body from acting shows yet again that most \nof my Republican colleagues are much more concerned about protecting \nthe President than protecting our troops.\n\n  Some in the administration have argued that this amendment would be \ntoo complicated for the Defense Department to enact. We, our military, \ncan develop and deploy the best technology on Earth, and we have done \nthat. Our stealth fighters can enter undetected into enemy territory. \nWe can launch terrain-hugging missiles from thousands of miles away and \nhit a single target the size of a small window in a building. We can \npay, clothe, feed, train, and manage a military force of over 2 \nmillion, plus their families. Yet we are supposed to believe that the \nDepartment of Defense can't follow one simple rule, that each and every \nsoldier, sailor, airman, and marine must receive rest equal to their \ntime of deployment.\n  Senators, please don't fall victim to the White House talking points. \nThis amendment is for Travis Virgadamo and his family, for Anthony \nSchober and his family, and for the 50 other Nevadans who have given \nthe ultimate sacrifice, and the approximately 2,800 other Americans who \nhave died.\n  Because some in the minority are choosing obstruction doesn't mean \nall Republicans must follow in lockstep. We almost overcame Republican \nobstructionism on this amendment in\n\n[[Page S11735]]\n\nJuly. We can finally do the right thing here today. So I say to my \nfriends, my Republican friends, this is Bush's war. Don't make it also \nthe Republican Senators' war.\n  I know every single one of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, \nwould agree that America's Armed Forces are the envy of the world and \nmust continue to be. This amendment puts that commitment into action \nand honors our troops and prepares our Armed Forces for the serious \nchallenges that lie ahead--and they do lie ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I understand I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I think we ought to understand what this \namendment is all about. In the view of the Secretary of Defense, he \nsays:\n\n       As drafted, the amendment would dramatically limit the \n     Nation's ability to respond to other national security needs \n     while we remain engaged in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The amendment would impose upon the President an \n     unacceptable choice between accelerating the rate of drawdown \n     significantly beyond what General Petraeus has recommended, \n     which he and other senior military commanders believe would \n     not be prudent, and would put at real risk the gains we have \n     made on the ground in Iraq over the past few months, or to \n     resort to force management options that would further damage \n     the force and its effectiveness in the field.\n\n  That is what this amendment is about. Nowhere in the Constitution \ndoes it say the President of the United States is deprived of the \nauthority to decide when and where to send troops in a time of war. \nNowhere. Nowhere in the history of this country have such restrictions \nbeen imposed or privileges assumed by the Congress of the United \nStates. We have one Commander in Chief, and one only. To somehow assume \nthat we would begin with Congress's 535 commanders in chief, I think, \nwould reduce our ability to ever fight another war effectively.\n  Let me sum up by saying that clearly the message I am getting from \nthe troops in the field is not that the war is lost, as the majority \nleader in the Senate stated last April. We are succeeding and we are \nwinning. And with the enactment of this amendment, we will choose to \nlose. This is setting a formula for surrender, not for victory.\n  I am hearing from the troops in the field three words, three words: \nLet us win. They have sacrificed a great deal, as the majority leader \ndescribed very dramatically. Now give them a chance to win. That is \nwhat they want. They do not want that sacrifice to be in vain.\n  This amendment would do exactly what the Secretary of Defense says, \nas well as other interested observers. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthis amendment. Allow this new strategy and for this great general, \nwhom the American people had a great opportunity to see last week as he \nspoke to the Congress and the American people. Reject this amendment \nand let us win.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I wish to first say I am grateful to all \nthe Senators who participated in the debate today, including my good \nfriend Senator McCain, for whom I have had respect for a long time.\n  I wish to emphasize again that this amendment provides a minimal \nadjustment in our rotation policies, and it does so with the notion \nthat we can get a minimum floor underneath the deployment cycles of \npeople who have been conducting the operational policies of the United \nStates for 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  If we were attempting to be obstructionists or we were attempting to \nshut down a system, we would probably be arguing for the 2-to-1 ratio \nwhich is the goal of the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the \nhistorical tradition of the U.S. military. We are simply saying for \nevery period you have been gone, you should have that amount of time \nback here at home.\n  This amendment is constitutional. It is well within the Constitution. \nI have given a memorandum that shows at least a half dozen different \nexamples of when the Congress has put these sorts of restrictions in \nplace when the executive branch has gone too far.\n  It is responsible. It was drafted with a great deal of care. We have \nlistened. This amendment is an adjustment from the amendment that was \noffered last July. We have spoken with Secretary Gates. We modified the \nlanguage of it. It is needed. It is needed in a way that is beyond \npolitics, and certainly would not contribute to what some people are \ncalling defeat.\n  It is needed for troop and family reasons, and that is why the \nMilitary Officers Association of America, 368,000 military officers, \nhas supported the amendment. It is needed because the state of the \ndebate on the Iraq war is going to continue for a long period of time. \nWe all know that now. We know it specifically since General Petraeus's \ntestimony.\n  We are going to have to resolve this in the political environment. We \nneed to do so under a framework that protects our troops. I ask my \ncolleagues to support it. I am very pleased we have 36 cosponsors on \nthis amendment, and I would hope the Senate passes it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 341 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Under the previous order, \nrequiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2918\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 10 minutes of debate equally \ndivided before a vote on amendment No. 2918.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I again wish to express my appreciation \nand respect for the author of the amendment that was just considered by \nthe Senate. I appreciate the courtesy and the level of debate that was \nconducted. I also always appreciate very much his brave service to our \nNation.\n  I hope I could convince my friend from Virginia that perhaps we could \nhave a voice vote on this, because as we know, it is a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment. I will not take all of my time except to say that all \nSenators share the concern for the men and women of the Armed Forces \nand their families, as a result of the operational demands of \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This amendment expresses a sense of Congress--a sense of Congress, \nnot a mandate--that consistent with wartime requirements, DOD should \nput into place force management policies that reflect the dwell time \nratios in the Webb amendment.\n  The amendment is clear, however, that such dwell time policies cannot \nbe implemented if to do so would prevent mission accomplishment or harm \nother\n\n[[Page S11736]]\n\nmembers of the force. That is why it includes a certification \nrequirement that would have the Secretary of Defense assure Congress \nthat such a policy would not result in extending deployments of units \nor members beyond their current scheduled rotation.\n  The amendment also includes a waiver provision that Senator Warner \nsuggested. It wisely provides authority to the Secretary of Defense to \nwaive the requirements of any existing dwell time policy and an \nattendant certification if the Secretary of Defense determines it is \nnecessary to do so in the interest of national security.\n  I again want to thank Senator Warner, our distinguished former \nchairman and long-time Member of this body, who played such an \nimportant role in this whole debate and continues to.\n  I realize this debate on Iraq is far from over, that this is only one \namendment. But I also appreciate the level of dialog, debate, and \ndiscussion on this very important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I wish to begin this statement the same \nway I did the last one, by thanking the Senator from Arizona for his \nservice and also for the quality of the debate I believe we had on the \nother amendment.\n  I would be very anxious to try to find some common ground here on \nsomething that we could agree upon that would help move this forward. \nThere are portions of this amendment that I think are fairly useful. \nBut I am unable to support it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against it. The first part of it is \nnothing more than a statement of existing policy even with the language \nthat the Department of Defense ``should'' establish a force management \npolicy.\n  On the second part, I have attempted several times to read it \ncarefully. As an attorney, and as someone who used to be a committee \ncounsel, the certifications required are very confusing. It is kind of \ngobbledy-gook.\n  I believe it would, on one level, be redundant to current policy and \non the other be confusing. I don't think it is useful, and I intend to \noppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 55, the nays are \n45. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for adoption of this \namendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Senator from Texas, I understand, is \nnow ready to offer an amendment. We have been alternating. My \nunderstanding is he will lay down his amendment tonight, then he will \nspeak on his amendment for some period of time, and then we will pick \nthat up tomorrow morning. There may very well be a side-by-side \namendment relative to the Cornyn amendment. We do not know, though, \nuntil we see that amendment.\n  Then I would ask unanimous consent that--I do not have my ranking \nmember here, however, so I am going to withhold the unanimous consent \nrequest. It is my intent to ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nCornyn lays down his amendment and speaks on it, that we then move into \nmorning business. That is my intent as soon as--all right, it turns out \nthat has been cleared on that side.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Cornyn is \nrecognized, lays down his amendment, speaks to it, we then go into \nmorning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could say for the record--and I am going to withdraw \nmy objection--we passed a rule that provided something that many \nMembers are not aware of: that before an amendment would be considered \nat the desk, a copy would be given to both sides of the aisle before \nthe amendment debate begins.

SENSE OF SENATE ON GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Senate unanimously confirmed General David H. \n     Petraeus as Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq, by \n     a vote of 81-0 on January 26, 2007.\n       (2) General Petraeus graduated first in his class at the \n     United States Army Command and General Staff College.\n       (3) General Petraeus earned Masters of Public \n     Administration and Doctoral degrees in international \n     relations from Princeton University.\n       (4) General Petraeus has served multiple combat tours in \n     Iraq, including command of the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault) during combat operations throughout the first year \n     of Operation Iraqi Freedom, which tours included both major \n     combat operations and subsequent stability and support \n     operations.\n       (5) General Petraeus supervised the development and \n     crafting of the United States Army and Marine Corps \n     counterinsurgency manual based in large measure on his combat \n     experience in Iraq, scholarly study, and other professional \n     experiences.\n       (6) General Petraeus has taken a solemn oath to protect and \n     defend the Constitution of the United States of America.\n       (7) During his 35-year career, General Petraeus has amassed \n     a distinguished and unvarnished record of military service to \n     the United States as recognized by his receipt of a Defense \n     Distinguished Service Medal, two Distinguished Service \n     Medals, two Defense Superior Service Medals, four Legions of \n     Merit, the Bronze Star Medal for valor, the State Department \n     Superior Honor Award, the NATO Meritorious Service Medal, and \n     other awards and medals.\n       (8) A recent attack through a full-page advertisement in \n     the New York Times by the liberal activist group, Moveon.org, \n     impugns the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all \n     the members of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to reaffirm its support for all the men and women of \n     the United States Armed Forces, including General David H. \n     Petraeus, Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq;\n       (2) to strongly condemn any effort to attack the honor and \n     integrity of General Petraeus and all the members of the \n     United States Armed Forces; and\n       (3) to specifically repudiate the unwarranted personal \n     attack on General Petraeus by the liberal activist group \n     Moveon.org.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if this amendment sounds familiar, it is \nbecause I offered this amendment roughly 10 days ago. In response to my \ncolleague from Illinois, this is virtually the same amendment I offered \nduring the consideration of the Transportation and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment appropriations bill, to which the other side of the aisle \nraised a point of order, and it was judged not germane.\n  I respect that ruling on that bill, but we are back here today, 10 \ndays later, on the Defense authorization bill--a bill to which this \namendment is clearly germane. I want to make a few points.\n  First of all, for my colleagues' recollection, I have in the Chamber \na copy of the ad that ran on September 9, 2007, immediately before GEN \nDavid Petraeus came to testify before the Congress, along with \nAmbassador Ryan Crocker, the Ambassador to Iraq from the United States.\n  It is important for colleagues to recognize that this ad ran before \nthe general came to testify, even though it had been well known the \ngeneral would come back in September 2007 and report on progress on the \nfight in Iraq, both from a military as well as a diplomatic \nperspective.\n  So it is clear, at least to me, the purpose of this ad was to smear \nthe good name of this four-star U.S. Army general, the commander of \nmultinational forces in Iraq, before he even had a chance to make his \nreport to the Congress and to the American people on the progress of \nthe surge of forces and of operations in Iraq.\n  As the amendment, which has been read, indicates, General Petraeus is \nthe senior commander on the ground for the United States and coalition \nforces in Iraq. Before the general testified, this ad placed in the New \nYork Times--apparently at a discounted rate below the $167,000 ad rate \nwhich ordinarily would be charged for a full-page ad in the Sunday New \nYork Times--this ad, which was sold at a discount by the New York Times \nto MoveOn.Org, asks the question: ``General Petraeus or General Betray \nUs?'' and accused this professional soldier of ``Cooking the Books for \nthe White House.''\n  It goes on--and all of us can read--to further disparage the good \nreputation of this professional soldier and someone who is responsible \nfor roughly 170,000 American men and women wearing the uniform of the \nUnited States military in Iraq.\n  The reason why MoveOn.org bought this false ad was because they were \nafraid of what General Petraeus would indeed report when he testified \nbefore Congress a week or so ago.\n  In fact, General Petraeus testified that ``the military objectives of \nthe surge are, in large measure, being met.''\n  He told us the ``overall number of security incidents in Iraq has \ndeclined in 8 of the past 12 weeks,'' preceding his testimony.\n  He said: ``Coalition and Iraqi forces have dealt significant blows to \nAl Qaeda-Iraq.''\n  He said: ``We have also disrupted Shia militia extremists.''\n  He went on to testify that ``Coalition and Iraqi operations have \nhelped reduce ethno-sectarian violence, as well [as] bringing down the \nnumber of ethno-sectarian deaths substantially in Baghdad and across \nIraq since the height of the sectarian violence last December.''\n  He said: ``The number of civilian deaths has also declined during \nthis [same] period.''\n  If that sounds familiar, it is because General Petraeus's testimony \nwas preceded by the issuance of the National Intelligence Estimate on \nIraq, issued just the preceding month, which basically came to the same \nconclusions as General Petraeus.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate, of course, represents the \nconsidered opinion of the intelligence community of the U.S. \nGovernment. It is delivered by the Director of National Intelligence \npursuant to requirements of Congress in law.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate, issued just last month by the \nU.S. intelligence community, found there have been ``measurable \nimprovements'' in Iraq's security situation since last January before \nGeneral Petraeus's implementation of the new strategy.\n  The NIE, or National Intelligence Estimate, found that if our troops \ncontinue to execute the current strategy, Iraq's security environment \nwill continue to improve over the next 6 to 12 months; and that \nchanging the U.S. mission in Iraq would erode security gains achieved \nthus far.\n  Well, it is not just General Petraeus's testimony. It is not just the \nNational Intelligence Estimate that was rendered last month. We had a \ncommission created by the Congress, headed by former Marine GEN James \nJones, and with a group of commissioners whose cumulative military \nexperience exceeds 500 years. Also on this commission were a number of \npolice chiefs and other law enforcement personnel with more than 150 \nyears of law enforcement experience.\n  So it is clear by virtue of their experience they have a solid basis \nfor the judgment they rendered. Well, it is important to note that not \nonly did General Petraeus testify, as I have indicated, not only has \nthe National Intelligence Estimate said what I quoted, the Jones \nCommission also found that the Iraqi Armed Forces--the Army, Special \nForces, Navy, and Air Force--are increasingly effective and are capable \nof assuming greater responsibility for the internal security of Iraq.\n  The commission--we were told before a hearing in the Armed Services \nCommittee, on which I sit--thinks that over the next 12 to 18 months \nthe Iraqi forces will continue to improve their readiness and \ncapability.\n  I noted during the testimony of General Petraeus that this is one of \nthe first times I can think of where the messenger was shot for \ndelivering good news. In other words, this ad run in the New York Times \nbefore the general testified is contradicted by not only his testimony \nbut by the National Intelligence Estimate I mentioned and the Jones \nCommission, representing more than 500 years of military experience. It \nis sad to say but true that this ad represents what I would consider to \nbe a sign of the times.\n\n  Now, I know the distinguished majority whip is on the floor, and I \nrecall that when I offered this bill on the\n\n[[Page S11738]]\n\nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, we \nhad a colloquy talking about: Well, everybody makes mistakes. \nOccasionally, people will misspeak and not accurately say what they \nintend to convey. But since this ad ran, since the time the \ndistinguished majority whip and I had this colloquy, MoveOn.Org has \nexpressed its pride at running this ad. In other words, they said they \nwere glad for what this ad conveys. They are not ashamed of it. They \ndidn't say it was a mistake or they misspoke; they continue to stand \nbehind this slur on the good name of General Petraeus, a man who is \nsworn to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States and to \ndo everything in his professional ability to win the conflict in Iraq.\n  So even before Congress received the Petraeus-Crocker reports, we \nknow some critics had already declared the surge to be a failure. There \nare those who said they didn't care what General Petraeus had to say.\n  Now, after General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have reported, \nsome of these same people are, such as MoveOn.Org, questioning their \njudgment--which is their right--but also their motivation, which I \nthink if they are agreeing with the motivation that is expressed in \nthis ad, I respectfully disagree with them.\n  It is puzzling why some of my colleagues insist on moving the \ngoalpost for our military. In fact, I think what they experience is \nwhat happens when anybody bets against the U.S. military. It is \ndangerous to do because they are going to lose if they are betting \nagainst the men and women of the U.S. military. I cannot fathom how the \nsuccess of our troops in improving the security situation in Iraq could \npossibly be construed as a bad thing for our Nation, but some \napparently, including MoveOn.Org, seem to think it is.\n  I refuse to stand by while a group such as MoveOn.Org demeans the \ngood name of an American soldier who represents, in turn, 170,000 \nAmerican soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen and Coast Guard. I \nrefuse to stand by while this group demeans the good name of our men \nand women in the U.S. military who have given so much for our country. \nThe military service of General Petraeus alone is spotless, and he has \nproven time and time again, with his blood, his sweat and his tears, \nhis patriotism and his love for our country. As a matter of fact, one \nwould be hard-pressed to find another military officer with the \nqualifications that are as impressive as General Petraeus. Currently \nserving his third combat tour in Iraq, he has literally been there and \ndone that, and he has done it with dignity, with honor, and devotion to \nservice.\n  Today, I offer all my colleagues a chance to clear the air and set \nthe record straight. For some of them, voting for this amendment may \nrepresent a chance to show true moral courage and true political \ncourage as well. My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that \nGEN David Petraeus and all the members of our Armed Forces are to be \nsupported and honored and that any effort to attack their honor and \ntheir integrity should be condemned; particularly before the general \nwas able to even deliver his testimony, where MoveOn.Org and these \ncritics could not have known what he was going to say, and that clearly \nthe goal of this ad and MoveOn.Org was to undermine public confidence \nin the messenger before the messenger even had a chance to deliver that \nmessage. My amendment expresses a sense of the Senate that General \nPetraeus and all the members of our Armed Forces should be protected \nand defended against an attack on their honor and integrity.\n  By introducing this amendment, I call on all Senators to tell America \nthey do not condone such character assassination of those who are sworn \nto protect the very freedom we enjoy and the very system of government \nin which we all serve. Our military servicemembers simply deserve \nbetter. I hope all Members of the Senate would join with me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in the 2004 Presidential campaign, I \nmight ask the Senator from Texas, there was a group from Texas that \nattacked Senator John Kerry and said he was undeserving of the \ncommendations and decorations he received for his courage in fighting \nin Vietnam and raised questions about others who served in the military \nwho were part of his swift boat operation. One would have to say, by \nany stretch, that the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth were attacking the \nhonor and integrity of one of our colleagues who served with honor in \nthe Vietnam war.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Texas if he is prepared to \nremain consistent and if he is also prepared to amend his amendment to \nrepudiate the activities, actions, and statements of the Texas-based \nSwift Boat Veterans for Truth organization with their unwarranted \nattacks on our colleague, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, during \nthe 2004 campaign.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am not willing to amend my amendment, \nas the distinguished majority whip requests. He keeps emphasizing this \nis a Texas-based group. I have no idea whether it is. But let me tell \nmy colleague what the differences are between this ad and what \nMoveOn.Org tried to do to this good soldier and the difference between \nthat and a political campaign.\n  Senator Kerry chose to run for President of the United States. You \nand I and others may disagree with the tactics employed by third \nparties in the course of a Presidential campaign, but this is not a \nPresidential campaign. General Petraeus did not volunteer to run for \npolitical office and subject himself to the spears we all sometimes \ncatch as part of the political process. All this general has sworn to \ndo is to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States and to \nprotect this country from attacks from our enemies.\n  So I would say it is apples and oranges to compare what happens in a \npolitical campaign with the attack on this general in such a \npremeditated and vicious way as MoveOn.Org did before he was to deliver \nhis testimony before the Congress.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, my friend and colleague from Texas, \nSenator Cornyn, has offered this amendment before. I so stated on the \nfloor before, and I will state again, I respect GEN David Petraeus. I \nvoted to confirm him as the commanding general of our forces in Iraq. \nHe has served our country with distinction. It has been my good fortune \nto spend time with him in Iraq on two different occasions. Both times I \nhave felt he was forthcoming and answered questions and demonstrated \ntime and again that he was willing to wear our country's uniform and \nrisk his life. I think the language chosen in this ad by this \norganization was wrong and unfortunate.\n\n  Having said that, I am troubled by the conclusion of my colleague \nfrom Texas that the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth could attack Senator \nJohn Kerry for his valor and courage fighting for America in Vietnam \nand that for some reason we shouldn't repudiate that attack; that it is \nOK because it happened, as my colleague said, during a political \ncampaign. If this is about the honor and integrity of our Armed Forces, \npast and present, whether it takes place during a political campaign or \nat half time at a football game should make no difference. If the \nSenator from Texas believes we should stand on a regular basis and \ncondemn those who would attack the honor and integrity of warriors who \nhave served this country with valor in past wars and present wars, then \nhe should be consistent. It is totally inconsistent for him to pick one \norganization and to ignore the obvious: There are others who have done \nthe same thing.\n  Swift Boat Veterans for Truth is a classic example of an organization \nthat distorted the truth about Senator John Kerry and others who served \nour country during the Vietnam war. The fact that they did it during a \nPresidential campaign should have absolutely nothing to do with it, if \nthis is a matter of principle. However, if it is not a matter of \nprinciple and something else, then you would pick and choose those \norganizations you want to condemn or repudiate. Unfortunately, the \nSenator from Texas has picked one organization. He doesn't want to talk \nabout the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. He certainly doesn't want to \nrepudiate them. I think they should be repudiated. What they did cast a \nshadow on the\n\n[[Page S11739]]\n\ncombat decorations given to others during the course of that war.\n  What Senator John Kerry did was to volunteer to serve our country, \nput his life on the line, face combat, stand up and fight for his \nfellow sailors on that swift boat, and then come back to the criticism, \nthe chief criticism of a group known as the Swift Boat Veterans for \nTruth.\n  Now, if the Senator from Texas is going to be filled with rage over \nthose who would cast any disparaging remarks about our military, he \nshould be consistent. He should amend his amendment--and I will seek to \ndo it for him, incidentally--to add the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth \nas a group that should be repudiated. If we are going to get into this \nbusiness of following the headlines, responding to advertisements and \nrepudiating organizations, let's at least be consistent.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will my friend yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague very much \nfor pointing out the inconsistency of an attack on one organization \nthat I guess my friend doesn't admire anyway, and that is his right. It \nis also our right to speak the truth on this floor. The fact of the \nmatter is the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth went after a war hero and \ntold stories to the American people that were not true and tried to \nsully a hero's reputation.\n  But he is not the only Senator who was attacked, as my friend \nremembers what happened to our colleague, Max Cleland. I know he does. \nHere is a veteran who gave three limbs for his country--three limbs. It \nis harder for him, for the first 2 hours of every day, to get ready for \nthe day than it is for the Senator from Texas or myself or the Senator \nfrom Illinois to do our work for a month. Yet this man was viciously \nattacked and his patriotism called into question. Oh, yes, my friend \nmight say, it was during a political campaign. It was disgusting. So we \nraise these issues.\n  What I wish to ask my friend is this: I was thinking--as the Senator \nfrom Texas, my friend and colleague, was speaking--I was thinking about \nsome retired generals who spoke out against this war and said they were \ncalled traitors and worse. So I am looking at ways to incorporate into \nthis a condemnation of anyone who would attack a retired general for \nspeaking out against a war because I think that was low and it was \nhorrible. It was frightening because, in a way, it was saying to these \nretired generals that they had no voice, no independent voice.\n  So I wish to thank my colleague, and I wonder if he recalls these \ngenerals. I will have more details as I put together my second-degree \namendment as well.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would say in response to my colleague \nfrom California that if we are going to get into the business of \nstanding up for members of the military, past and present, who were \nattacked for their positions on issues, then so be it. Let's be \nconsistent about it. Let's remember our fellow colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Max Cleland, and remember what happened to him, when someone, \nduring the course of a campaign, ran an ad suggesting he was somehow \nconsorting with Osama bin Laden--a man who had lost three limbs to a \ngrenade in Vietnam and who was attacked in a way that none of us will \never be able to forget.\n  The Senator from Texas includes in his whereas clauses, his sense-of-\nthe-Senate clauses, to strongly condemn any effort to attack the honor \nand integrity of all the members of the U.S. Armed Forces. I hope if \nthat is his true goal, he will allow us to amend his resolution to not \nonly include the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth but those who attacked \nSenator Max Cleland during the course of his campaign.\n  I don't think the fact that it happens during a campaign absolves \nanybody from the responsibility of telling the truth and honoring those \nwho served. In this case, two Democrats, Senator Max Cleland and \nSenator John Kerry, were attacked, and there wasn't a long line of \npeople on the floor to condemn the attackers. Now that the Senator from \nTexas has decided we should bring this up as part of the Defense \nauthorization bill, I hope he will be consistent, and I hope he will \nconsistently stand up for the reputations of the men and women in \nuniform, starting with General Petraeus but including those who served \nin this war and other wars in the past.\n  Each of them deserves our respect. I might add, parenthetically--it \nis worth saying--even if we disagree with their political views, they \nstill deserve our respect. To attack their honor and integrity is \nwrong.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, last year the Senate enacted legislation \nthat stripped the courts of jurisdiction to hear pending habeas claims \nbrought by unlawful enemy combatants. It was with sadness then, as it \nis now, that the Senate failed to restore and protect this great writ. \nThe writ of habeas corpus is a cornerstone of the rule of law. The \nright of an individual to learn of his or her detention by the \ngovernment in a court of law is fundamental to our Constitution. \nPermanent detention of foreigners, without reason or charges, \nundermines our moral integrity in the world and does violence to our \nConstitution. It troubles me greatly that we have limited the ability \nof the judicial branch to ensure that detainees are being held fairly \nand justly by the American Government. It is my sincere hope that we \nwill take up this amendment again in the near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11739-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will not speak long because I know my \nfriend from Iowa is here to speak in morning business.\n  I do want to say that Senators certainly have every right to offer \nany amendment they choose, but they don't have a right to require me to \nmodify my amendment.\n  I am sorry they don't acknowledge the difference between somebody who \nhas volunteered to become a public figure, a political candidate \nrunning for election, and somebody such as General Petraeus who in the \nperformance of his duty is reporting to the Congress on the progress in \na war in which 170,000 Americans are exposed to loss of life and limb \nright now.\n  To try to resurrect the old political battles of the past with regard \nto what happened in the Georgia Senate race, or what happened in the \nrace for President of the United States, we are not going to achieve \nconsensus here. Those were political races and those people are public \nfigures. I don't like it when I am criticized any more than my \ncolleagues do, including Senator Kerry or Senator Cleland. But that is \nan apples-and-oranges comparison to somebody who is wearing the uniform \nof a U.S. soldier who is performing his duty to report to Congress on \nthe progress of military operations in Iraq.\n  So we may head down that road. As I said, it is every right of my \ncolleagues to offer other amendments. We will take those as they come. \nBut I hope all of our colleagues will, as an act of solidarity and \nsupport for General Petraeus and our men and women in uniform, vote for \nmy resolution and condemn this character assassination on the name of a \ngood man.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I am here to follow through on a \npromise I made back on June 13. At that time, after several speeches on \nthe alternative minimum tax, I said I was going to continue talking \nabout the alternative minimum tax until Congress took action to protect \nthe roughly 19 million families and individuals who will be hit by it \nin 2007 who did not have to pay it in 2006--19 million families now \naffected who weren't affected last year.\n\n[[Page S11740]]\n\n  I am also here to talk about a promise Congress needs to follow \nthrough on, which is to protect these 19 million families and \nindividuals from the alternative minimum tax for the tax year we are in \nright now, 2007.\n  In 2006, 4.2 million families and individuals were captured by the \nAMT. For taxable year 2006, the legislation that temporarily increased \nthe amount of income exempt from the alternative minimum tax expired. \nSo, right now, and for the last 9 months, under current law, we expect \naround 23 million families and individuals to fall victim to the \nalternative minimum tax if Congress doesn't act.\n  This chart illustrates the current situation, using the figures I \nhave already referred to: 4.2 million people were paying the \nalternative minimum tax last year. But what is submerged underneath the \nsurface there is the 19 million people who are affected because \nCongress has not taken action yet. Tax year 2007, then, is represented \nby the boat and is rapidly approaching the AMT iceberg. Right now, most \nof the iceberg--the part that represents the 19 million additional \ntaxpayers who will be caught by the alternative minimum tax this year--\nis under water.\n  The full magnitude of this imminent disaster will become apparent \nwhen those 19 million families and individuals start working on their \n2007 tax returns starting January 2 of next year. Actually, the \nsituation is worse than I implied--if you can imagine that it can be \nany worse than that. I wish to say that many families have already \nfallen victim to the alternative minimum tax. Of course, I am referring \nto those taxpayers who have to file quarterly returns, quarterly \nestimated returns.\n  The last time I spoke to you here on the Senate floor was on the \noccasion of the estimated tax payments for the second quarter due. I \nwish to say I am also speaking to my fellow Senators, but I am not sure \nhow many of them might be listening because between June, when I spoke \nlast, and the 3 months since, estimated tax payments for the third \nquarter were due this past Monday, September 17.\n  Before I go further, I want to specifically address the size of the \npopulation that makes estimated tax payments. In case anyone is \nthinking this is a very small group of people, the statistics of the \nincome division of the IRS state that for tax year 2004, almost 11 \nmillion families and individuals made estimated tax payments. I am not \nsaying each of those filers would be captured this year by the \nalternative minimum tax, but I surely want to remind everybody of the \npossibility that the number of people making estimated tax payments is \nvery large, and that those among them hit by the AMT--we have already \nfailed them by not taking care of this before the first payments were \nmade in January.\n\n  As I have said, I last addressed the AMT on the Senate floor 3 months \nago. In that time, no progress has been made on taking care of the \nproblem of the AMT.\n  The next chart actually portrays what the Senate leadership has \naccomplished in the past 3 months in regard to this issue. It shows a \ngiant goose egg. I have served the people in Iowa in Congress for many \nyears. In that time, I have learned that generally things do not happen \novernight. It takes time to formulate ideas, and it takes time to build \nenough support to take action. That is why I am particularly unhappy \nwith this giant goose egg.\n  The current leadership has indicated that they have much they wish to \naccomplish this year. Time is rapidly running out and a plan for \ndealing with the AMT has not been proposed, much less a specific \nsolution. The prospects of the AMT swallowing huge swaths of taxpayers \nis not a new problem. But until now, we have been able to keep it in \ncheck and not be 3 months away from 19 million more taxpayers being hit \nby it.\n  Since 2001, the Finance Committee has produced bipartisan packages--I \nemphasize bipartisan--that have continually increased the amount of \nincome that is exempt from the alternative minimum tax. This was \npossible thanks to the help of Senator Baucus, currently chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. Together, Senator Baucus and I were able to \nminimize the damage caused by the AMT. These increases in exemptions, \ndesigned to keep pace with inflation and slow the spread of the \nalternative minimum tax, were never what I envisioned as a permanent \nsolution. Rather, I consider a permanent solution to be the policies \nrepresented in a bill with the number S. 55, called the Individual \nAlternative Minimum Tax Repeal Act.\n  Once again, I have to credit Chairman Baucus for his advocacy on \nbehalf of tax fairness, as he introduced this bill with me, with \nSenators Crapo, Kyl, and Schumer signing on as cosponsors, and Senators \nLautenberg, Roberts, and Smith also signed on as cosponsors.\n  In case any of our friends in the House of Representatives are paying \nattention, a companion bill exists in H.R. 1366, called the Individual \nAMT Repeal Act. It was introduced by Congressman Phil English of \nPennsylvania. What these bills--the ones I introduced in the Senate and \nPhil English's bill--accomplish is to completely repeal the AMT without \noffsetting it. That is, these bills do not replace taxes no longer \ncollected from the AMT by raising taxes someplace else. I think it is \nvery important to ensure that revenues that the Federal Government does \nnot collect as a result of the alternative minimum tax reform are not \ncollected someplace else.\n  The alternative minimum tax was never meant to raise revenue from the \nmiddle class of America and was certainly not meant to bring in the \namount of money under existing budget law and, oddly, that the \nCongressional Budget Office has to count. In other words, it should not \nbe counted in the first place if you weren't intended to tax these \nmiddle-income taxpayers, but it happens because the AMT was not \nindexed. The AMT, then, was conceived as a way to promote basic tax \nfairness in response to concern about a very small number of wealthy \ntaxpayers who were able to eliminate their entire income tax liability \nthrough legal means.\n  The tax created to deal with this--the AMT--was originally, back in \n1969, created with the impact at that time of affecting about 1 person \nout of 500,000. Now, over the course of 38 years, this small salute to \ntax fairness has grown into a monstrosity of a revenue raiser.\n  The next chart is taken from the Long-Term Budget Outlook, a \nCongressional Budget Office publication. It was last published in \nDecember 2005. These are the latest figures I have. This illustrates \nhow the alternative minimum tax will swallow more taxpayers as revenue \nis collected from the alternative minimum tax, being the green line on \nthe chart, over a period of the next 45 years almost, or any time \nbetween now and the next 45 years. You can see how it continually \ngrows.\n  That is what the CBO, through the present budget laws, has to count. \nBut they count it from people--remember, the middle-income people who \nwere never supposed to pay it as opposed to the superrich, a very small \nnumber of people, who would take advantage of every legal loophole--I \nemphasize ``legal'' loophole--and not pay a regular income tax but pay \nthe AMT. I suppose that is out of the theory that everybody living in \nthis country, particularly the wealthy, ought to pay a little bit of \ntax as a matter of fairness. You can argue whether that is a good \nrationale, but that was the rationale back in 1969.\n  So you can see that there is a massive amount of revenue projected to \ncome in from people who were never supposed to pay it that somehow you \nare supposed to offset, so that that revenue that was never supposed to \ncome in is not lost. I know that doesn't sound reasonable to the \naverage commonsense American listening to me out there, but that is the \nway our budget laws are, and that is the way Congress has to respond to \nit, whether it makes sense or not.\n  Left alone, the Congressional Budget Office calculates that more than \n60 percent of the families and individuals in America will fall prey to \nthe alternative minimum tax as it absorbs more than 15 percent of the \ntotal tax liability by the year 2050.\n  This next chart, which is taken from the same congressional office \npublication, illustrates how under current law revenues collected by \nthe Government are projected to push above their historical average and \nkeep growing as the AMT brings in more and more money. We can see the \nhistorical average into the future for 40 years, but it\n\n[[Page S11741]]\n\nfollows a historical average going back 40 years before now, and \nbecause of the alternative minimum tax mostly but also for other law \nchanges, current law, we are going to see the revenue coming in to the \nFederal Government growing to almost 25 percent of gross national \nproduct.\n  From a philosophical point of view and economic point of view, what \nis wrong with that? Philosophically, there is less freedom for the \nAmericans. As we spend more of their money, they have less economic \nfreedom. But more importantly, the economic harm that comes from 535 \nMembers of Congress spending 25 percent of the gross national product \ninstead of using the historical average of about 18 percent, that 7 \npercent difference means we are going to make decisions on how to spend \nit instead of the 137 million taxpayers in this country deciding how to \nspend it, where it will turn over the economy more times than if we \nspend it and do more economic good and create more jobs and have more \neconomic freedom.\n  That is what is at stake in this whole debate if we do not do \nanything about the alternative minimum tax and it continues to grow to \n15 percent of the total tax liability by the year 2050. This chart \npoints out the increasing power of Congress through taking more money \nfrom the taxpayers without even changing the law if we do not do \nsomething about this alternative minimum tax.\n  Anyone who maintains that the alternative minimum tax reform or \nrepeal needs to be offset is not actually doing anything about the \nproblem these charts illustrate. The problems the alternative minimum \ntax is responsible for are the ballooning Federal revenues above \nhistorical levels and a burden on middle-class taxpayers that keeps \nincreasing over time. Offsetting the alternative minimum tax revenue \ndoes absolutely nothing to address these issues, and it seems to me to \nbe an attempt to pretend to solve a real problem by actually trying to \nhide that problem.\n  Aside from the long-term problems with the alternative minimum tax \nthat we can solve by repealing it, the alternative minimum tax poses a \nshort-term problem to the taxpayers who will fall into its clutches \nthis year if Congress does not act.\n  Putting aside the legitimacy of keeping this tax, it is not doing \nwhat it was intended to do. Putting aside the long-term solution, we \nare going to end up right now with 19 million more families and \nindividuals being caught by the AMT this year. That 19 million will \nprobably include many taxpayers making estimated tax payments. Some of \nthese families and individuals may not be taking the AMT into account \nas they make their quarterly payments simply because they do not \nrealize they ought to take this into consideration.\n  Additionally, there may be some taxpayers who are required to make \nestimated tax payments when subject to the alternative minimum tax but \nare not required to make the estimated payments under the regular \nincome tax system. At the end of this tax year, not only could those \nwell-meaning filers find themselves subject to the alternative minimum \ntax, but they could also face the increased insult of being fined by \nthe IRS for unintentionally miscalculating their estimated tax \npayments.\n  I do not believe these well-intentioned taxpayers ought to be \npenalized because Congress has not come through on its promise to at \nleast keep the AMT from running wild--in other words, going beyond \nthose 4.5 million taxpayers who are already hit by it and not including \nthe 19 million who are otherwise being hit because of inaction so far.\n  That is why, on July 23, I dealt with this penalty issue by \nintroducing S. 1855, called the AMT Penalty Protection Act. This \nlegislation protects individuals from a penalty for failing to pay \nestimated taxes on amounts attributable to the AMT in cases where the \ntaxpayers were not subject to the AMT last year. This is not a giveaway \nmeant to compensate for the AMT, as it does not protect taxpayers who \npaid the AMT last year. Rather, this bill protects the families and \nindividuals who do not yet appreciate the horrible impact our failure \nto act is going to have on them.\n  I am not the only one who thinks this legislation is a good idea. We \nhave these Senators--Senators Allard, Brownback, Collins, Hutchison, \nSmith, and Snowe--agreeing to cosponsor the legislation.\n  In addition, I have received letters from the Committee on Personal \nIncome Taxation, the New York City Bar, as well as the National \nAssociation of Enrolled Agents in support of the provisions of this \nsafe harbor bill so that the IRS cannot apply interest and penalties \nresulting from the failure to pay estimated taxes on amounts resulting \nfrom the AMT in cases where the taxpayers were not liable for the AMT \nlast year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these letters \nto which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                           of Enrolled Agents,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2007.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Senate Finance Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Grassley: As President of the National \n     Association of Enrolled Agents (NAEA), I write on behalf of \n     40,000 enrolled agents to express our support for S. 1855, \n     the AMT Penalty Protection Act of 2007.\n       In a June hearing held by the Senate Finance Committee on \n     the alternative minimum tax (AMT), NAEA Government Relations \n     Chair Frank Degen, EA, testified that the current short-term \n     approach to dealing with the AMT creates uncertainty and \n     hinders tax-planning. Many taxpayers are constantly faced \n     with an unpleasant choice when calculating their estimated \n     taxes to either assume that Congress will enact another AMT \n     patch, or follow the letter of the law literally. If Congress \n     fails to act, those who choose the former option will suffer \n     the consequences of underpayment. If Congress extends the \n     patch, those who choose the latter will likely receive a \n     large refund, amounting to an interest-free loan to the IRS.\n       S. 1855 would prevent taxpayers who didn't pay AMT last \n     year from being punished for assuming Congress will extend \n     the AMT patch to this year. While not a permanent solution to \n     the AMT problem, this is a step in the direction of \n     certainty.\n       We applaud you for your efforts to ease the burden of the \n     AMT.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Diana Thompson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         New York City Bar, Committee on Personal Income Taxation,\n                                    New York, NY, August 23, 2007.\n     Re 2007 reform of alternative minimum tax.\n     Hon. Max S. Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles B. Rangel,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Longworth House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jim McCrery,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways and Means, Longworth \n         House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus, Chairman Rangel, Senator Grassley and \n     Representative McCrery: The Personal Income Tax Committee of \n     the Association of the Bar of the City of New York would like \n     to respectfully offer comments on the important subject of \n     2007 Reform of the Alternative Minimum Tax. In particular, \n     the areas of main concern addressed by this letter are \n     support of a continued increased AMT exemption amount in 2007 \n     and support of a short term 2007 AMT Estimated Tax Relief \n     provision of safe harbor from IRS interest and penalties \n     (which is particularly relevant for those taxpayers whose \n     estimated tax payments for 2007 have not taken into account \n     an extension of the 2006 increased AMT exemption).\n       A short term 2007 AMT increased exemption is consistent \n     with the short term AMT relief enacted by Congress between \n     2003 and 2006. In so doing, Congress has held down the number \n     of AMT taxpayers to less than there would have been under \n     prior law. This patch expired at the end of 2006 and Congress \n     has not yet enacted a patch for 2007. Without the proposed \n     2007 AMT short term reform, the number of Americans affected \n     by the AMT for 2007 will increase from approximately four \n     million to more than 23 million. The Joint Committee on \n     Taxation projects that most of the 23 million taxpayers \n     affected would earn between $50,000 and $200,000, that is \n     middle income families. The problem with the AMT goes beyond \n     just those paying the tax.\n       The AMT affects a lot of other taxpayers, as well. The AMT \n     forces many taxpayers to have to calculate their tax \n     liability twice, first under the regular tax system, and then \n     again under the AMT. The IRS estimates that the average \n     taxpayer takes about 30 hours filling out a Form 1040. The \n     AMT increases that burden.\n\n[[Page S11742]]\n\n                               background\n\n       The first comprehensive AMT was enacted in 1982. The \n     purpose of the AMT, as stated in the legislative history, was \n     to ensure that no taxpayer with substantial economic income \n     should be able to avoid all tax liability by using \n     exclusions, deductions, and credits. Now, the AMT affects \n     middle income families who are working hard and raising \n     children. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 4.2 \n     million paid AMT in 2006. Among those taxpayers, 25,000 had \n     adjusted gross income of less than $20,000, hardly the \n     category of taxpayer that should have to be subject to \n     increased complexity and taxes due in computing and paying \n     their federal income taxes.\n       In 2006, approximately 200,000 taxpayers subject to AMT had \n     adjusted gross income between $75,000 and $100,000. \n     Approximately 1.3 million AMT taxpayers had adjusted gross \n     income between $100,000 and $200,000. Only about 80,000 \n     taxpayers had adjusted gross income of $1 million and above. \n     In summary, in 2006 more taxpayers earning less than $100,000 \n     were subject to the AMT than taxpayers earning more than $1 \n     million.\n       The AMT has strayed from its original purpose. At its \n     inception, the AMT was enacted to insure that upper-income \n     taxpayers would pay some amount of income tax. Now, it is \n     subjecting middle-income taxpayers to an additional tax.\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       Present law imposes an alternative minimum tax. The \n     alternative minimum tax is the amount by which the tentative \n     minimum tax exceeds the regular income tax. An individual's \n     tentative minimum tax is the sum of (1) 26 percent of so much \n     of the taxable excess as does not exceed $175,000 ($87,500 in \n     the case of a married individual filing a separate return) \n     and (2) 28 percent of the remaining taxable excess. The \n     taxable excess is so much of the alternative minimum taxable \n     income (``AMTI'') as exceeds the exemption amount. The \n     maximum tax rates on net capital gain and dividends used in \n     computing the regular tax are used in computing the tentative \n     minimum tax. Alternative minimum taxable income is the \n     individual's regular taxable income increased by certain \n     adjustments and preference items.\n       The exemption amounts are: (1) $62,550 for taxable years \n     beginning in 2006, and $45,000 for taxable years beginning \n     after 2006, for married individuals filing jointly and \n     surviving spouses; (2) $42,500 for taxable years beginning in \n     2006, and $33,750 for taxable years beginning after 2006, for \n     other unmarried individuals; (3) $31,275 for taxable years \n     beginning in 2006, and $22,500 for taxable years beginning \n     after 2006, for married individuals filing separately; and \n     (4) $22,500 in the case of estates and trusts.\n       The exemption amounts are phased out by an amount equal to \n     25 percent of the amount by which the individual's AMTI \n     exceeds (1) $150,000 in the case of married individuals \n     filing a joint return and surviving spouses, (2) $112,500 in \n     the case of other unmarried individuals, and (3) $75,000 in \n     the case of married individuals filing separate returns or an \n     estate or a trust. These amounts are not indexed for \n     inflation. The AMT has statutory marginal tax rates of 26 and \n     28 percent. However, those with alternative minimum taxable \n     income in the phaseout range of the exemption level ($150,000 \n     to $400,200 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $112,500 \n     to $282,500 for unmarried individuals, in 2006) will have an \n     effective marginal tax rate of 32.5 and 35 percent, \n     respectively.\n\n\n                        proposed 2007 amt reform\n\n       It is our view that Congress should enact an AMT patch for \n     2007. The exemption amounts in effect for 2006 should be put \n     into effect for 2007, adjusted for inflation. Taxpayers \n     should be provided safe harbor from IRS penalties and \n     interest for failure to include estimated tax payments in \n     2007 that take into account an extension of the increased AMT \n     exemption provided in 2006. In computing tax for purposes of \n     the penalties dealing with estimated tax, a taxpayer would be \n     permitted to disregard the alternative minimum tax if the \n     individual was not liable for the alternative minimum tax for \n     the preceeding tax year.\n       The amendments proposed herein should apply to taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 2006.\n       A 2007 AMT short term reform with an increased AMT \n     exemption would prevent expansion of the AMT, reduce \n     taxpayers' compliance costs and make routine tax planning \n     simpler. In addition, the short term reform proposed here \n     will enable Congress to address issues related to substantial \n     changes in our income tax system given the large number of \n     important provisions that are currently scheduled to \n     terminate in the next few years.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                  Babcock MacLean,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to believe this legislation \nis not necessary because we are going to prevent the AMT from \nswallowing 19 million taxpayers in 2000, but I am not optimistic \nconsidering the fact we have not acted yet.\n  In closing, I encourage--and it is meant to encourage--the Democratic \nleadership to keep our promise with the American taxpayers and at least \nmodify the exemption amounts for 2007. Of course, the best option is to \ncompletely repeal the AMT, and I am going to raise this issue with the \nFinance Committee members, and I am going to raise the issue with \nMembers outside the committee. We ought to just get rid of it. It is \nstupid to be saying we are going to collect revenue from people who \nwere never intended to pay, but we are counting that revenue. It is a \nbig shell game. So I will be talking with my colleagues about the \nsensibility of just getting rid of something.\n  I will tell my colleagues another reason for getting rid of the AMT. \nIt is supposed to hit the super-rich. We are told by the IRS right now \nthat there are about 2,500 of these super-rich who ought to be paying \nthe alternative minimum tax--we would expect them to pay the \nalternative minimum tax--but they have found ways legally of even \navoiding the alternative minimum tax. So we ought to just get rid of \nit. But for the time being, the only thing the taxpayers can rely on is \nthe same goose egg we have been sitting on all year.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I also wish to use my time to address \nanother issue. I would like to continue, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11742-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11742-S11744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SECRET HOLDS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the ethics bill has now been signed into \nlaw and, as my colleagues are aware, it contains new requirements about \nwhat we in the Senate call holds, meaning an individual Senator can \nhold up a bill all by himself from coming up.\n  Senators may be wondering what exactly is required under these new \nrequirements about holds and how it is going to work. As a coauthor of \nthe original measure, I have to tell my colleagues that I don't know \nhow it is going to work. The provisions have been rewritten from what \nwe had originally adopted on the floor of the Senate by a very wide \nmargin. I am not even sure by whom this has been rewritten because it \nwas a closed process and Republicans were not invited to participate in \nthat process.\n  Now I am trying to understand how these provisions will work. Let me \ngive a little background.\n  I have been working for some time, along with Senator Wyden of \nOregon, to end the practice of secret holds through a rules change or \nthrough what we call in the Senate a standing order. I do not believe \nthere is any legitimate reason a single Senator should be able to \nanonymously--I emphasize anonymously--block a bill or nomination. I do \nnot argue with an individual Senator blocking a bill. I do that myself. \nBut I do not think it should be secret. We ought to know who is doing \nit because the public's business--and the Senate is all about the \npublic's business; we are on television--the public's business ought to \nbe public, and we ought to know who that person is. If a Senator has \nthe guts to place a hold, they ought to have the guts to say who they \nare and why they think that bill ought to be held up. If there is a \nlegitimate reason for a hold, then Senators should have no fear about \nit being public.\n  I am not talking hypothetically; I am speaking from my experience. I \nhave voluntarily practiced public holds for a decade or more, and I \nhave had absolutely no cause to regret telling all my colleagues and \nthe whole country why I am holding up a bill and who Chuck Grassley is \nso they can come and talk with me if they want to talk with me about \nit, know what the rationale is, and maybe we will want to work \nsomething out.\n  Through the years, there have been several times when the leaders of \nthe two parties have agreed to work with Senator Wyden and me to \naddress this issue, albeit in a way different than what maybe we would \nhave proposed. I have approached these opportunities with optimism, \nonly later on to be disappointed.\n  For instance, in 1999, at the start of the 106th Congress, Majority \nLeader Lott and Minority Leader Daschle sent a ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter to all Senators outlining a new policy that any Senators placing \na hold must notify the sponsor of the legislation and the committee of \njurisdiction. It went on to state that written notification of the \nholds should be provided to respective leaders, and staff holds--in \nother\n\n[[Page S11743]]\n\nwords, staff for the Senator placing holds--would not be honored unless \naccompanied by a written notification. All that sounds good if it \nworked out that way. But I want to tell my colleagues, this policy \nannounced in 1999 was quickly forgotten or ignored by Senators, and the \npeople who could enforce it actually did not enforce it.\n  Then, recognizing that the previous ``Dear Colleague'' letter was not \neffective, Leaders Frist and Daschle sent another ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter in 2003 that purported to have some sort of enforcement \nmechanism. The new policy required notification of the legislation's \nsponsor if and only if a member was of their party, as well as \nnotification of the senior party member on the committee of \njurisdiction. In other words, this new policy required less disclosure \nthan the previous policy since it only affected holds by members of the \nsame party. Nonetheless, the leaders promised that if the disclosure \nwas not made, they would disclose the hold. It also reiterated that \nstaff holds would not be honored unless accompanied by written \nnotification.\n  That policy had more holes in it than Swiss cheese. I am not sure \nanyone understood the policy, and it had no effect that I can tell on \nimproving transparency in a public body, the Senate, where we are on \ntelevision and the public's business--all of the public's business--\nought to be public.\n  No longer willing to settle for half measures such as we had been \ndealt in 1999 and 2003 that do not end secret holds once and for all, \nin the last Congress, Senator Wyden and I then took our own initiative, \nnot waiting for leaders to act. We offered our standing order to \nrequire full public disclosure of all holds as an amendment to the \nlobbying reform bill. It was a well-thought-out measure that was \ndrafted with the help of people who know about how this place \noperates--Senator Lott and Senator Byrd. Remember, Senator Byrd has \nbeen around here for a half century. We used their insights and their \nknowledge of Senate procedures as former majority leaders to write our \nlegislation.\n\n  Our standing order passed the Senate by a vote of 84 to 13. Now think \nof that, this Senate making a decision that holds should not be secret \nanymore by a vote of 84 to 13. But listen to what happened after that \n84-to-13 vote. While that bill did not become law, it became a starting \npoint for the ethics bill passed by the Senate last year.\n  I thought the leaders had finally accepted that we would have full \ndisclosure of holds. In fact, our secret holds provisions remained \nintact in the version of the ethics bill that originally passed the \nSenate earlier this year. Then, even though the secret holds provisions \nrelated only to the Senate--nothing to do with the other body, the \nHouse of Representatives--and had already been passed by the Senate, on \na voice vote this time but reflecting the reality of the 84-to-13 vote \nbefore, they were rewritten behind closed doors by Members of the \nmajority party.\n  Once again, I feel like half measures have been substituted for real \nreform. In other words, the provisions that had passed one time by 84 \nto 13, only affecting us, went to conference--where they didn't have to \ngo to conference because it only affected us, it didn't affect the \nother body--and we end up with no real reform.\n  Under the rewritten provisions, a Senator will only have to disclose \na hold ``following the objections to a unanimous consent to proceeding \nto, and, or passage of, a measure or matter on their behalf.''\n  Now, that is going to puzzle you like it puzzles me. Obviously, in \nthis case, the hold would already have existed well before any \nobjection. In fact, most holds never even get to this stage because the \nmere threat of a hold prevents unanimous consent requests from being \nmade in the first place. This is particularly true if the Senator \nplacing the hold is a member of the majority party. In that case, the \nmajority leader would simply not ask unanimous consent, knowing that a \nmember of his party has a hold.\n  For instance, it is not clear to me what would happen if the minority \nleader asked unanimous consent to proceed to a bill and the majority \nleader objected on his own behalf to protect his prerogative to set the \nagenda but also having the effect of honoring the hold of another \nmember of the majority leader's caucus. Or what if the majority leader \nasked unanimous consent to proceed to a bill and the minority leader \nobjects but does not specify on whose behalf, even though a member of \nthe minority party has a hold. Would the minority Senator with the hold \nthen be required to disclose the hold? I don't know. It is not very \nclear.\n  I asked the Office of the Parliamentarian for an opinion about how \nthe new provision would work in such instances, but with no legislative \nhistory--because this was written behind closed doors there is no \nreport to come out--with no legislative history for the changes that \nwere made to the Wyden-Grassley measure, the intent of the rewritten \nprovisions was not evident is what the Parliamentarian said. Therefore, \nwhat did I do? I wrote to the Senate Rules Committee to provide insight \ninto the content of the rewritten provisions.\n  The response referred me to a section-by-section analysis of the bill \nin the Congressional Record that essentially restates the provisions \nbut once again sheds no light on the specific questions about how this \nworks. Perhaps that is because the answer might be a little \nembarrassing.\n  Depending upon how the new provisions are interpreted in the first \ninstance I mentioned, it is possible that holds by members of the \nmajority party will never be made public. In the second instance, a \nliteral interpretation of the provision might indicate that either \nleader could choose to keep a hold by a member of their party secret so \nlong as they do not specify publicly that their objection is on behalf \nof another Senator.\n  The Rules Committee letter claims the changes were intended to make \nthe provision ``workable.'' It seems to me it is quite obvious that, \nunless somebody can answer these questions--I have asked the \nParliamentarian and the Rules Committee and no answers yet--I don't see \nhow the new provisions are any more workable than the original. On the \ncontrary, they are not only unworkable, they undermine transparency. \nThey make it more difficult for this body that is on television every \nday, where everything we do is the public's business. We want the \npublic to know about it or we wouldn't be on television. Don't you \nthink if a Senator has a hold on a bill, we ought to know who that \nSenator is and why he has a hold?\n  Under the changes, not only is the disclosure of holds only required \nafter formal objection has been made to a unanimous consent request, \nbut Senators then have a full 6 session days to make their disclosure \npublic. What is more, a new provision was added specifying that holds \nlasting up to 6 days may remain secret--remain secret--forever.\n\n  What is the justification for that? Six days is more than enough time \nto kill a bill at the end of the session. And we are saying it is okay \nfor Senators to do that in secret?\n  There are other changes that are puzzling to me. For instance, our \noriginal measure required holds to be submitted in writing in order to \nbe honored, to prevent staff from placing holds without the knowledge \nof the Senator. However, in the rewrite of what Senator Wyden and I \noriginally put in, Senators now must be given written notice to the \nrespective leaders of their ``intent to object'' only after the leader \nhas already objected on the Senator's behalf. This is not only \nunworkable, but I think you would agree it sounds very absurd.\n  I have stated repeatedly and emphatically that as a matter relating \nto Senate procedure, it would be completely illegitimate to alter in \nany way the original Senate-passed measure requiring full disclosure of \nholds. The U.S. Constitution makes clear, ``Each House may determine \nthe rules of its proceedings.''\n  The hold is a unique feature of the Senate arising out of its own \nrules and practices, with no equivalent in the House of \nRepresentatives. As such, there is no legitimate reason why this \nprovision, having already passed the Senate, should have been altered \nin the first place and in any way. Nevertheless, it was altered in a \nvery substantial way. In fact, it was altered in a way that I fear will \nallow secrecy to continue in this institution.\n  Clearly, the so-called Honest Leadership and Open Government Act was\n\n[[Page S11744]]\n\nhandled by the majority party in a way that is anything but what the \ntitle of the bill implies.\n  So as you can tell, I have been frustrated so far in my attempts to \nfind answers about how the rewritten provisions will be applied, but we \nwill find out soon enough. Because I can assure you I will not give up \nuntil I am satisfied the public's business in this Senate is being done \nin a public way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter I wrote to the Rules Committee and the response I got back.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  August 24, 2007.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairwoman, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairwoman Feinstein: I am seeking clarification of \n     the intent of several changes made to the original Senate-\n     passed provisions on disclosure of Senate holds in S. 1, the \n     Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act. As you know, \n     Senator Wyden and I , along with Senators Lott and Byrd, \n     drafted the original provisions that have previously passed \n     the Senate overwhelmingly. I have contacted the office of the \n     Senate Parliamentarian seeking clarification about how the \n     altered provisions would be interpreted and the initial \n     reaction was that, the legislative intent was not \n     sufficiently clear without more information on the \n     legislative history to determine how the provisions would be \n     applied in many circumstances. This is not surprising given \n     the process by which these provisions were altered behind \n     closed doors and rushed through the Senate without debate or \n     amendments. Ironically, the lack of transparency in the \n     process of considering a bill that is supposed to be about \n     legislative transparency has left no legislative history to \n     assist in interpreting this new language. Therefore, I ask \n     that you provide me with written answers to several questions \n     about the intent of the provisions as rewritten in the final \n     version of the Legislative Transparency and Accountability \n     Act.\n       New language was added to the original Senate-passed \n     provision stipulating that senators would only be required to \n     disclose their holds, ``following the objection to a \n     unanimous consent (request?) to proceeding to, and, or \n     passage of, a measure or matter on their behalf . . . '' As \n     such, would the disclosure requirements be triggered for a \n     senator who had placed a hold with their leader only if their \n     leader or the leader's designee objects and specifically \n     states that the objection is on behalf of another senator? \n     For instance, if a member of the minority party has \n     previously contacted the minority leader to place a hold, \n     then the majority leader asks unanimous consent to proceed to \n     a matter and the minority leader objects without giving a \n     reason or specifying that the objection was on behalf of \n     someone else, would the minority senator who had placed the \n     hold be required to disclose or remove the hold within six \n     session days? Would the disclosure provisions be triggered if \n     a member of the majority party has previously placed a hold \n     with the majority leader, the minority leader asks unanimous \n     consent to proceed to a matter, and the majority leader \n     objects on his own behalf to protect his prerogative to set \n     the agenda, but also having the effect of honoring the hold \n     of another member of the majority leader's caucus?\n       Other changes were also made to the original Senate-passed \n     provisions that are more evident in their effect, but where \n     the rationale remains unclear and I would appreciate any \n     insights into the rationale for these changes. For instance, \n     many holds exist for some time without a unanimous consent \n     request and subsequent objection, and they have the effect of \n     dissuading the majority leader from attempting to move to a \n     matter, particularly in the case of hold by members of his \n     own party in which case a unanimous consent request to move \n     to a matter is unlikely ever to be made. Therefore, it isn't \n     clear why a provision was inserted making the disclosure \n     requirements effective only after a unanimous consent request \n     and objection, this allowing holds to remain secret until \n     that time.\n       The original Senate-passed provision also required that any \n     hold be submitted in writing to the appropriate leader to \n     allow the leaders to distinguish between a formal hold and an \n     offhand comment, as well as to prevent staff holds. However, \n     as currently drafted, a senator is required to submit a hold \n     in writing to his respective party leader only after that \n     leader has already honored the hold by objecting to a \n     unanimous consent request on that senator's behalf, making \n     the requirement irrelevant and even absurd.\n       Also, while the original Senate-passed provisions included \n     a short time window to give senators a chance to fill out and \n     submit their disclosure forms for the Congressional Record, \n     the intention was never to sanction secrecy for even a short \n     period of time. However, the new language allows six session \n     days before disclosure is required and includes a new \n     provision clarifying that senators never have to disclose \n     holds so long as they are withdrawn within the six day \n     period. I fail to see the justification for sanctioning \n     secret holds for up to six days, which at the end of a \n     session is more than enough time to effectively kill a bill \n     or nominee in complete secrecy.\n       As I have said repeatedly, the public's business ought to \n     be done in public. Although I believe the altered disclosure \n     requirements for holds are flawed and do not fully eliminate \n     secret holds as I had intended, I hope they will result in \n     some increased transparency. Still, it is not completely \n     clear what is now expected of senators and how these \n     provisions will be interpreted. Therefore, I would appreciate \n     any insights you can provide into the intent of the new, \n     altered language related to disclosure of holds that was \n     inserted into the Legislative Transparency and Accountability \n     Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Rules and Administration,\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2007.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chuck: I appreciate your concern about the provision \n     on Senate holds in S.1, the Honest Leadership and Open \n     Government Act, and I remain deeply committed to ensuring \n     adequate disclosure of Senators who seek to place holds on \n     bills, nominations and other Senate proceedings.\n       In terms of building a legislative history, I refer you to \n     the Section by Section Analysis and Legislative History, \n     which I submitted to the Congressional Record along with \n     Chairman Lieberman and Majority Leader Reid, Volume 153, Nos. \n     125-126, August 2, 2007.\n       ``Section 512 relates to the concept of so-called `secret \n     holds.' Section 512 provides that the Majority Leader or \n     Minority Leader or their designees shall recognize another \n     Senator's notice of intent to object to proceeding to a \n     measure or matter subsequent to the six-day period described \n     below only if that other Senator complies with the provisions \n     of this section. Under the procedure described in section \n     512, after an objection has been made to a unanimous consent \n     request to proceeding to or passage of a measure on behalf of \n     a Senator, that Senator must submit the notice of intent to \n     object in writing to his or her respective leader, and within \n     6 session days after that submit a notice of intent to \n     object, to be published in the Congressional Record and on a \n     special calendar entitled `Notice of Intent to Object to \n     Proceeding.' The Senator may specify the reasons for the \n     objection if the Senator wishes.\n       ``If the Senator notifies the Majority Leader or Minority \n     Leader (as the case may be) that he or she has withdrawn the \n     notice of intent to object prior to the passage of 6 session \n     days, then no notification need be submitted. A notice once \n     filed may be removed after the objecting Senator submits to \n     the Congressional Record a statement that he or she no longer \n     objects to proceeding.''\n       It is important to note that the revisions in the final \n     bill were based largely on concerns raised by the Senate \n     Parliamentarian and the offices of the Majority and Minority \n     Leader that the original language was not workable, \n     especially since procedures on Senate holds are not written \n     in the Standing Rules of the Senate and are not enforceable \n     by the Parliamentarian.\n       The final language was developed in consultation with \n     Senator Wyden,the lead sponsor of the provision, and we were \n     not aware of any further objections.\n       If you have an alternative recommendation, which the \n     Parliamentarian believes is workable and enforceable, I would \n     be interested in reviewing it.\n           With warm personal regards,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, this month is National Preparedness Month, \nand activities are underway that will help educate Americans on actions \nthey can take to safeguard their family and their community. During \nthis time, not only should we be inspired but we should also be mindful \nthat this past August 29 marked the 2-year anniversary of the time in \nwhich Hurricane Katrina decimated parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. \nIn addition, we are now in the midst of a record-setting hurricane \nseason, with an unprecedented two hurricanes making landfall \nsimultaneously from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans on the same day. It \nis also the sixth anniversary of the attack by al-Qaida on our country.\n  These catastrophic events underscored the need for our country, and \neach and every one of its citizens, to be prepared for disaster, \nregardless of its form. Much has been done since these terrible events \nto do so, but so much more needs to be done. As time separates us from \nthose terrible events, we must not become complacent.\n  During this month, we should use this time to reflect on how far we \nhave come and how much further we need to go and what should be done to \nprotect ourselves as individuals and as a country. While we may have \nincident, training, and contingency plans in place to help ensure that \ncertain situations may be appropriately addressed, it is important for \nus to remember that acts of terror may not always be prevented, and \nnature continues to show its fury in many ways.\n  As several reports have indicated, the threats to our homeland have \nnot gone away; they have simply changed form. The July 17, 2007, \nNational Intelligence Estimate, NIE, entitled ``The Terrorist Threat to \nthe U.S. Homeland,'' confirmed that, although many plots to attack the \nUnited States after 9/11 have been disrupted, al-Qaida ``is and will \nremain the most serious terrorist threat to the Homeland'' and that its \n``plotting is likely to continue to focus on prominent political, \neconomic, and infrastructure targets with the goal of producing mass \ncasualties . . .'' Furthermore, and of greater concern, the NIE \nassessed that Hezbollah, which has, until now, only conducted anti-U.S. \nattacks outside the United States, ``may be more likely to consider \nattacking the Homeland over the next three years . . .''\n  In addition to these threats, it is important to note that there are \nsignificant number of vulnerabilities at home. Even as memories of the \nmassive August 14, 2003, North American power outage fade, the tragic \nAugust 1, 2007, bridge collapse in Minneapolis has provided yet another \nreminder that the Federal Government can no longer ignore our aging \ninfrastructure. In the words of author Stephen Flynn, ``we depend on \ncomplex infrastructure built by the hard labor, capital, and ingenuity \nof our forbears, but . . . it is aging--and not very gracefully.'' In \nthis regard, we must be focused on training, resources, and contingency \nplans to ensure that our Nation is prepared.\n  Another point of concern is the impact severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome, SARS, had on the health infrastructure in Ontario, Canada, \nthat revealed a vulnerable system unable to cope with an epidemic that \noriginated outside its borders. The World Health Organization, WHO, \npredicted that the deadly H5N1 avian influenza would likely be the \nsource of the next global pandemic. In the United States, a new study \npublished by researchers from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research \nCenter and the University of Washington has confirmed the first \nincidence of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 avian influenza, a \nbeginning step in its becoming a human pandemic. The impact of such a \npandemic would be enormous. A February 2006 study by the Lowy Institute \nfor International Policy at the Australian National University \nconcluded that, in a worst-case scenario, a global influenza pandemic \nwould result in 142.2 million deaths and a $4.4 trillion loss in GDP. \nGiven these studies and cases, it is imperative that United States be \nprepared for such a pandemic. We should not wait for another disaster \nto hit the United States--we must prepare now.\n  I commend the Department of Homeland Security for conducting its \nNational Preparedness Month campaign and am pleased that more than \n1,700 State- and local-level organizations will be participating in \npreparedness activities around the country. I urge all Americans to \ntake responsibility for their own preparedness, for that of their \nfamilies, their businesses, and their schools. As the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce, and the District of Columbia under the Homeland Security \nCommittee, I am committed to making sure that the Federal, State and \nlocal governments are properly organized for the next natural or \nmanmade disaster and to holding these agencies responsible when they \nare not. The passage of time since Katrina and 9/11 has done nothing to \nlessen the threat to the United States either from outside or within. \nIt is not a matter of if such an event will occur but when it will \noccur. We must take the necessary precautions to be better able to deal \nwith the disasters or incidents that will occur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11745-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ANNOUNCING THE BIRTH OF CHARLES McDONALD LUGAR\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, today I congratulate the Marine \nCorps Logistics Command Maintenance Center at the Marine Corps \nLogistics Base in Albany, GA. The Maintenance Center Albany was the \n2007 winner of the Robert T. Mason Depot Maintenance Award, and was \nalso named Marine Logistics Unit of the Year.\n  This prestigious award, established in 2004, commemorates the former \nAssistant Deputy Secretary of Defense for Maintenance Policy, Programs, \nand Resources, Robert T. Mason, a staunch supporter of excellence in \norganic depot maintenance operations throughout his three decades of \nGovernment service. In winning this award, the Maintenance Center \nAlbany has exemplified responsive and effective depot level support to \noperating units.\n  The Maintenance Center Albany's Dedicated Design and Prototype Effort \nTeam was singled out for its outstanding support to our men and\n\n[[Page S11746]]\n\nwomen in uniform through their hands-on innovation. I could not provide \nhigher tribute than the Marine Corps itself when it described the \nAlbany team as clearly demonstrating the ability to be responsive, \nresourceful, agile, and creative by designing and prototyping multiple \nsystems in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  This is not the first time the tenant organization of Albany's Marine \nCorps Logistics Base has received this great honor. In 2005, the \nMaintenance Center was recognized for its Design and Manufacture \nVehicle Armor Protective Kits Program which provided protective armor \nkits for U.S. Marine Corps combat vehicles, making the Marines a more \neffective fighting force and profoundly impacting both safety and \nmorale.\n  I also want to individually recognize Christopher Tipper, a \nMaintenance Center Albany employee who was named Civilian Marine \nLogistician of the Year.

Mr. President, today I honor Montclair State \nUniversity of New Jersey as they celebrate 100 years of service to the \nstudents of our State.\n  The 100th anniversary of Montclair State University is a wonderful \ncause for celebration. However, the real celebration lies in the \nextraordinary success of the faculty and administration of Montclair \nState University in preparing some of New Jersey's finest students to \nbe the next leaders of this country and to succeed in a global economy.\n  While much has changed since Montclair State University first opened \nits doors as a normal school in 1908, the university has remained true \nto its mission of providing an exceptional educational experience to a \ndiverse student body that is reflective of the population of New \nJersey. Montclair State University has become one of the leading \neducational institutions in our State, quickly turning into the second-\nlargest and the fastest-growing university in New Jersey.\n  Montclair State University is leading the way to help develop the \nnext generation of teachers by training promising students to be \nsuccessful, innovative teachers in schools across the State. The \nuniversity has also maintained an active and positive role in the local \ncommunity, by bridging education and community service.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me as I honor Montclair State \nUniversity for its extraordinary success in providing 100 years of \nworld-class education to New Jersey's students and for providing \nservice to our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11746-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING WINDOWS ON THE WATER\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the \noutstanding accomplishments of Windows on the Water, a popular \nrestaurant from my home State of Maine. Windows on the Water's chef and \nowner, John Hughes, was recently awarded the National Restaurant \nAssociation Award for his active role in assisting the local community.\n  Founded in June 1985, Windows on the Water has been a favorite of \nlocals and visitors to the Kennebunk-Kennebunkport area for over 20 \nyears. Known for its fresh seafood and made-from-scratch desserts, \nWindows on the Water boasts a diverse menu with something for everyone. \nMoreover, it is committed to preparing healthy meals for diners. As \nsuch, most of the cooking products used are either organic, all-\nnatural, or sustainable. In its 22 years of business, Windows on the \nWater has received 27 awards for various accomplishments. As patrons of \nthe restaurant will tell you, Windows on the Water is also renowned for \nits creativity. In addition to providing fresh, quality food, Chef \nHughes frequently offers programs such as cooking class dinners, which \ninclude a multicourse demonstration and meal, combined with a question-\nand-answer session.\n  Chef Hughes's National Restaurant Association award is truly \nsomething to be proud of. Dedicating his life to helping others, \nincluding by way of his culinary skills, Mr. Hughes cofounded the \nCommunity Harvest organization in 1999, a nonprofit community service \ngroup that provides food to those in need. The organization's motto, \n``people loving people is the heart of the journey, the heart of our \ncommunity,'' is exemplified well in Chef Hughes's work. Each \nThanksgiving and Christmas, he prepares countless dinners for the \ncommunity, which volunteers then deliver to local underprivileged \nhouseholds and individuals. Mr. Hughes began the home delivery service \nbecause he noticed that Meals on Wheels did not deliver on Christmas \nand Thanksgiving.\n  While Chef Hughes routinely uses his cooking skills to benefit \nvulnerable members of his community, he is also at the forefront of \nnumerous other community efforts. He leads an annual scholarship \nprogram for select local students who demonstrate a commitment to \ncommunity service. Moreover, in keeping with his background as a chef, \nMr. Hughes spearheads an annual scholarship program for recipients in \nthe greater Kennebunk area who have displayed an interest in the \nculinary arts. Having begun his culinary studies at age 15, Chef Hughes \nrecognizes that nurturing an ambition from a young age can lead to \ngreat success.\n  Windows on the Water is not only a restaurant; it is also a fount of \nunbridled service to others, thanks to Chef Hughes. While Chef Hughes \nhas reached the top of his profession, being appointed to the Master \nChefs Institute of America, he still sees the crucial role that \ngenerosity and giving play in the livelihood of a community. I commend \nChef John Hughes and everyone at Windows on the Water who set a \nvaluable example for the Kennebunks, and for all of Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11746-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. I would like to commemorate the \n20th anniversary of the U.S. Special Operations Command, USSOCOM.\n  In 1987, USSOCOM was officially established to create a unified \ncommand structure for the special operations forces of all military \nbranches. Since that time, the special operations forces from the Army, \nNavy, Air Force, and Marine Corps have deployed to all parts of the \nglobe and participated in every major American military operation in \nsupport of USSOCOM missions.\n  It is with good reason that the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines \nof USSOCOM are considered the most elite military forces in the world. \nThese individuals complete extremely rigorous training and are called \nupon to accomplish the most difficult and dangerous missions in our \nmilitary.\n  We in New Mexico are excited that USSOCOM's 16th Special Operations \nWing will soon be making the move to Cannon Air Force Base. Though we \nare sad to see the men and women of the 27th Fighter Wing go, we are \nproud to be the new home of this elite unit.\n  Since its inception, the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines of \nUSSOCOM have served with the utmost distinction. I salute their bravery \nand dedication to duty, and I hope that New Mexicans will take time to \nthank the members of USSOCOM who have served and honor the memory of \nthose who have given their lives in our defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11746-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11746-S11747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING MR. VIRGIL E. BROWN, SR.\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I wish to honor and congratulate \nan outstanding community and business leader from my hometown of \nCleveland, OH. Virgil E. Brown, Sr., has become a well-recognized name \nin Cleveland after serving our community and great State of Ohio for \nnearly three decades. On August 12, 2007, Virgil celebrated his 90th \nbirthday. Also this year, his lovely wife Lurtissia celebrated her\n\n[[Page S11747]]\n\n87th birthday, and together they celebrated an amazing 68 years of \nmarriage. What an accomplishment.\n  Virgil grew up in humble beginnings. He was born in Louisville, KY, \nto George and Sarah Brown. He is the eldest of six children. He moved \nto Cleveland with his parents and siblings when he was 12 years old. He \ngraduated from Central High School in Cleveland in 1937 and attended \nFenn College, now Cleveland State University.\n  Throughout Virgil's long and distinguished career of public service, \nhe has made history and opened many doors through a number of \n``firsts'' he attained. He served as the first African-American to be \nthe director of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections; the first \nAfrican-American to be elected as a Cuyahoga County commissioner; and \nthe first African-American to serve as director of the Ohio Lottery \nCommission.\n  His political career started in 1966 with an unsuccessful bid for a \nState representative position. He rebounded quickly, however, and in \n1967 he won a seat on the Cleveland City Council, where he served for \nthree terms. In 1972, when there was a breakdown in the countywide \nelection system and the position of director of the Cuyahoga County \nBoard of Elections became available, Virgil resigned his city council \nseat to accept an appointment as director of the Board of Elections. He \nserved nearly 7 years in this position, and during his tenure he \nrestored the integrity and efficiency of the election process.\n  When I left the position of Cuyahoga County commissioner to serve as \nLieutenant Governor of Ohio in 1979, Virgil was appointed as my \nreplacement. He was reelected and served three additional terms. While \nin his last term as commissioner, I was serving as Governor, and I \nasked Virgil if he would serve as the director of the Ohio State \nLottery. Virgil graciously accepted, even though he was planning to \nretire. I appointed him in 1991, and he remained as director until \n1995, when he officially retired at the age of 74.\n  Virgil has had many notable achievements throughout his life. In \n1976, he delivered the nominating speech for President Gerald Ford at \nthe Republican National Convention. He was honored by the Cuyahoga \nCounty Board of Commissioners when they named their human services \nbuilding the Virgil E. Brown Center. In 2002, he was inducted by the \nCuyahoga County Republicans into the inaugural class of the James A. \nGarfield Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Glenville Hall of \nFame, the Senior Citizens Hall of Fame, and the National Forum for \nBlack Public Administrators'--Cleveland chapter--Hall of Fame. He is \nalso a past president of the National Bowling Association.\n  Virgil has served the greater Cleveland community and the State of \nOhio with distinction. Whether it was through his political career, his \nmentorship of numerous young adults, his tenure on the board of \ndirectors for various community based organizations and commissions, \nthrough his home church, Bethany Baptist Church, or through his \nsuccessful insurance company, Virgil Brown has touched and improved the \nlives of many.\n  Throughout all of his accomplishments, his loving and supportive wife \nLurtissia has been by his side. Without a doubt, she has been his \ngreatest blessing. Together they have two children, Veretta Garrison, \nwho is a businesswoman in Connecticut, and Virgil, Jr., who is an \nattorney in Cleveland and also a member of the State Board of \nEducation.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to thank Virgil E. \nBrown, Sr., for his exceptional leadership and for serving as a stellar \nrole model. Congratulations, Virgil, on all you have and will continue \nto achieve. Our lives are better as a result of having been touched by \nyou. May God continue to bless you and your family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11747-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING DAVID PERRY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

While shopping at a local grocery store \na man collapsed in front of him, and Airman Perry responded quickly. \nTaking control of the situation, Airman Perry directed another \nbystander to call 9-1-1 while he checked the fallen man's vital signs \nand then began CPR. Through his quick thinking and swift actions the \nman's life was saved.\n  Airman Perry will be awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal. This \nmedal is awarded to Air Force personnel for outstanding achievement or \nmeritorious service rendered specifically on behalf of the Air Force.\n  Airman Perry volunteered and was selected, to be part of the Air \nForce Financial Services Center initial cadre. At the time, he was one \nof six airmen assigned to the Air Force Financial Services Center and \nwas the only airman instructor at Ellsworth.\n  Airman Perry truly deserves this award and our commendations for his \nactions; his service is a shining example of the dedication and bravery \nthat makes America's soldiers the greatest in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11747-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN COMMEMORATION OF SUMMIT ROAD'S 70TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate \nthe 70th anniversary of historic Summit Road, a significant highway \nwhich remains in use to this day as a popular tourist attraction and \nhistoric site within the State of Nebraska.\n  It was Sunday, September 19, 1937, that the Summit Road leading to \nthe top of Scotts Bluff National Monument in the Nebraska Panhandle was \ncompleted. The Summit Road is believed to be the oldest existing \nconcrete road in the State of Nebraska. The road allows visitors to \ndrive to the top of the bluff through three tunnels for a spectacular \nview of the valley 800 feet below.\n  Summit Road was built entirely by the Civilian Conservation Corps, \nCCC, at a time when dry winds and dust storms were blowing across the \nwestern High Plains. The CCC was created by President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt when the entire country was in the grip of the Great \nDepression to employ jobless men who were struggling to earn enough \nmoney to buy food for their families.\n  Scotts Bluff National Monument is named for a fur trapper by the name \nof Hiram Scott, who was wounded and deserted by his companions in 1828. \nHe gained immortality by making his way to a magnificent formation of \nbluffs along the North Platte River before succumbing to his wounds. It \nwas for Hiram Scott that Scotts Bluff National Monument, Scotts Bluff \nCounty, and the city of Scottsbluff have been named.\n  Scotts Bluff National Monument, which rises 4,649 feet above sea \nlevel, was an imposing landmark, guiding wagon trains along the Oregon, \nMormon, California, and Pony Express Trails. Native Americans \noriginally called this natural formation Ma-a-pa-te, which translates \ninto ``hill that is hard to go around.''\n  Today, Scotts Bluff National Monument is home to an excellent museum \nproviding information about the historic pioneer trails, together with \nan impressive collection of art from William Henry Jackson, a \nphotographer and painter, best known as the first person to photograph \nthe wonders of Yellowstone National Park.\n  It was reported that 550 cars drove to the top of Scotts Bluff \nNational Monument when the Summit Road was opened 70 years ago. Since \nthen, thousands of vehicles have made the trip and are still able to do \nso today, thanks to the efforts of the CCC which built it and the \nNational Park Service which now maintains the road.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11747-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill, which was previously signed by the Speaker of \nthe House:\n\n       H.R. 954.

FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Women around the world are especially vulnerable to \n     poverty. They tend to work longer hours, are compensated \n     less, and have less income stability and fewer economic \n     opportunities than men.\n       (2) Women's share of the labor force is increasing in \n     almost all regions of the world. Women comprise more than 40 \n     percent of the labor force in eastern and southeastern Asia, \n     sub-Saharan Africa, and the Caribbean, nearly a third of the \n     labor force in Central America, and nearly one-third of total \n     employment in South Asia. About 250 million young women will \n     enter the labor force worldwide between 2003 and 2015.\n       (3) Women are more likely to work in informal employment \n     relationships in poor countries compared to men. In sub-\n     Saharan Africa, 84 percent of female non-agricultural workers \n     are informally employed compared to 63 percent of men. In \n     Latin America, 58 percent of women are informally employed \n     compared to 48 percent of men. Informal employment is \n     characterized by lower wages and greater variability of \n     earnings, less stability, absence of labor organization, and\n\n[[Page S11754]]\n\n     fewer social protections than formal employment.\n       (4) Changes in the economy of a poor country affect women \n     and men differently; women are disproportionately affected by \n     long-term recessions, crises, and economic restructuring and \n     they often miss out on many of the benefits of growth.\n       (5) International trade can be an important tool of \n     economic development and poverty reduction and its benefits \n     should extend to all members of society, particularly the \n     world's poor women.\n       (6) Promoting fair labor practices for women, and access to \n     information, education, land, credit, physical capital, and \n     social services is a means of boosting productivity and \n     earnings for the economies of developing nations. For \n     example, according to the World Bank, in sub-Saharan Africa, \n     inequality between men and women in employment and education \n     suppressed annual per capita growth during the period 1960-\n     1992 by .8 percentage points per year.\n       (7) Expanding economic opportunity for women in developing \n     countries can have a positive effect on child nutrition, \n     health, and education, as women often invest their income in \n     their families. Increasing women's income can also decrease \n     women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence, and \n     trafficking, and make them more resistant to the impact of \n     natural disasters.\n       (8) Economic opportunities for women, including \n     microfinance and microenterprise development and the \n     promotion of women's small- and medium-sized businesses, are \n     a means of generating gainful, safe, and dignified employment \n     for the poor.\n       (9) Women play a vital, but often unrecognized, role in \n     averting violence, resolving conflict, and rebuilding \n     economies in post-conflict societies. Women in conflict-\n     affected areas face even greater challenges in accessing \n     employment, training, property rights, credit, and financial \n     and non-financial resources for business development. \n     Ensuring economic opportunity for women in conflict-affected \n     areas plays a significant role in economic rehabilitation and \n     consolidation of peace.\n       (10) Given the important role of women in the economies of \n     poor nations, poverty alleviation programs funded by the \n     Government of the United States in poor countries should seek \n     to enhance the level of economic opportunity available to \n     women in those countries.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is, therefore, the policy of \n     the United States to actively promote development and \n     economic opportunities for women, including programs and \n     policies to--\n       (1) promote women's ability to start micro, small, or \n     medium-sized business enterprises, and enable women to grow \n     such enterprises, particularly from micro to small \n     enterprises and from small to medium-sized enterprises, or \n     sustain current business capacity;\n       (2) promote the rights of women to own, manage, and inherit \n     property, including land, encourage adoption of laws and \n     policies that support the rights of women to enforce these \n     claims in administrative and judicial tribunals, and address \n     conflicts with customary laws and practices to increase the \n     security of women's tenure;\n       (3) increase women's access to employment, enable women to \n     access higher quality jobs with better remuneration and \n     working conditions in both informal and formal employment, \n     and improve the quality of jobs in sectors dominated by women \n     by improving the remuneration and working conditions of those \n     jobs; and\n       (4) bring the benefits of international trade policy to \n     women in developing countries and continue to ensure that \n     trade policies and agreements adequately reflect the \n     respective needs of poor women and men.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to enhance the ability to combat methamphetamine; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenators Baucus, Boxer, Obama, Clinton, and Ben Nelson, the Combat \nMethamphetamine Enhancement Act.\n  This act is designed to address problems that the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, DEA, has identified in the implementation of the Combat \nMethamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005. I was pleased to join former \nSenator Talent in drafting, introducing and securing the passage of the \noriginal bill. I am pleased to introduce this legislation today to \nensure that it operates as Congress intended.\n  The bill that I introduce today would: clarify that all retailers, \nincluding mail order retailers, who sell products that contain \nchemicals often used to make methamphetamine--like ephedrine, \npseudoepedrine and phenylpropanolamine--must self-certify that they \nhave trained their personnel and will comply with the Combat Meth Act's \nrequirements; require distributors to sell these products only to \nretailers who have certified that they will comply with the law; \nrequire the DEA to publish the list of all retailers who have filed \nself-certifications, on the DEA's website; and clarify that any \nretailer who negligently fails to file self-certification as required, \nmay be subject to civil fines and penalties.\n  The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act that we passed last year has \nbeen a resounding success. The number of methamphetamine labs in the \nUnited States has declined dramatically now that the ingredients used \nto make methamphetamine are harder to get.\n  The Combat Meth Act that became effective in September 2006 included \nimportant new provisions for retailer self-certification, employee \ntraining, requiring products to be placed behind counters, packaging \nrequirements, required sales logbooks, and limits on the amounts that a \nperson can purchase in a given day and over a 30-day period.\n  Now, because of that law's implementation, the number of \nmethamphetamine labs decreased from about 12,000 labs to about 7,300 \nlabs--a 41 percent decrease in just one year. Once the bill was enacted \ninto law, the number of meth ``super labs'' in my home State of \nCalifornia declined from 30 in 2005 to only 17 in 2006.\n  Fewer meth labs means more than just less illegal drug production. As \nthe Fresno Bee reported today, the DEA has noted that in 2003, 3663 \nchildren were reported exposed to toxic meth labs nationwide--but so \nfar this year, the number of exposed children is only 319.\n  So things are moving in the right direction, and that is good news. \nBut with more than 7,000 methamphetamine labs in the U.S., and children \nstill being exposed to their toxins, it is also clear that there is \nstill work to be done.\n  After the Combat Meth Act became law, DEA examined how the retailer \nself-certification process was working. On May 16, 2007, DEA sent \nletters to the 1600 distributors who they believed were selling \nproducts that contained ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, asking them to \nturn over lists of the retail stores that they sell to, so that DEA \ncould check to see how many of those retailers had self-certified as \nthat law requires.\n  Rather than actively assisting the DEA in its efforts, about \\3/4\\ of \nthe distributors failed or declined to provide any information about \nthe retail stores.\n  The distributors who did cooperate provided DEA with the names of \n12,375 retail customers. When DEA checked those out, it found that \nabout 8,300 of those retail stores had never self-certified as the law \nrequires.\n  Based on these findings, the DEA estimates that nationwide, as many \nas 30,000 additional retail sellers of products are not complying with \nthe law.\n  In short, retailers' noncompliance with the self-certification \nrequirement appears to be widespread, and undercuts the effectiveness \nof the Combat Meth Act.\n  Unfortunately, there is no effective way for law enforcement to \ndetermine the universe of who is, and who is not, obeying the law. \nCurrently, there is no requirement that retailers notify the DEA before \nthey start selling products with these listed chemicals.\n\n[[Page S11757]]\n\n  Retailers can likely avoid negative consequences if they are ever \nconfronted with their failure to self-certify. Currently, the law \nimposes sanctions only for willful and reckless refusals to self-\ncertify. There is no punishment available if a retailer negligently \nfails to self-certify as required. Not even civil sanctions are \navailable.\n  In short, without distributors restricting the supply of these \nproducts to retailers who have self-certified, retailers may simply \ntake their chances, rather than self-certifying as the law intended, \nfiguring that they will never get caught, or if they do get caught, \nthat they will never be punished.\n  It is unacceptable that, a year after the Combat Meth Act imposed \nthis requirement and became fully effective, tens of thousands of \nretailers still are not following the law. It is unacceptable that \ndistributors of these products can continue to profit off of their \nsales to retailers who are not complying, or are even refusing to \ncomply with the law.\n  So this bill is designed to make the Combat Meth Act more effective, \nby putting in place a process that will ensure that every retailer who \norders these products that can be used to make methamphetamine must \ncomply with the law before they can get and resell the products.\n  First, it will require that all retail sellers of products with these \nlisted chemicals must file self-certifications, closing a loophole that \nnow exists for mail-order retailers.\n  Second, the DEA will be required to post all self-certified retailers \non its website, so that advocacy groups and others who are concerned \nabout methamphetamine in their communities can identify retailers who \nare selling these products without complying with the law, and can \nnotify the authorities.\n  Third, distributors of these products will only be allowed to sell to \nretailers who have self-certified which they will be able to verify by \nchecking the DEA's public website. Once recalcitrant retailers are \nfaced with the real and immediate economic consequence of a possible \ncut-off of their desire to purchase these products, I am confident that \nmost will file self-certifications as the law requires.\n  Finally, the bill clarifies that even a negligent failure to self-\ncertify, if proven, can give rise to civil sanctions.\n  This is a common-sense bill, designed to strengthen the \nimplementation of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act. This bill \nwould create incentives to ensure that the self-certification process \nof the law is made both effective and enforceable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows.\n\n                                S. 2071\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 321\n\n       Whereas ending the violence and terror that have devastated \n     the State of Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza since September \n     2000 is in the vital interests of the United States, Israel, \n     and the Palestinian people;\n       Whereas the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict \n     strengthens extremists and opponents of peace throughout the \n     region;\n       Whereas more than 7 years of violence, terror, and military \n     engagement have demonstrated that armed force alone will not \n     solve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute;\n       Whereas the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians want \n     to put an end to decades of confrontation and conflict and \n     live in peaceful coexistence, mutual dignity, and security, \n     based on a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace;\n       Whereas on May 24, 2006, addressing a Joint Session of the \n     United States Congress, Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert \n     reiterated the Government of Israel's position that ``In a \n     few years, [the Palestinians] could be living in a \n     Palestinian state, side by side in peace and security with \n     Israel, a Palestinian state which Israel and the \n     international community would help thrive'';\n       Whereas, in his speech before the Palestinian Legislative \n     Council on February 18, 2006, Palestinian Authority President \n     Mahmoud Abbas said, ``We are confident that there is no \n     military solution to the conflict. Negotiations between us as \n     equal partners should put a long-due end to the cycle of \n     violence . . . Let us live in two neighboring states'';\n       Whereas, in June 2002, the President of the United States \n     presented his vision of ``two states, living side by side in \n     peace and security'', and has since repeatedly reaffirmed \n     this position;\n       Whereas events of the past 18 months, including the victory \n     of Hamas in Palestinian legislative elections, the continued \n     firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel, and the escalating \n     intra-Palestinian violence and chaos, culminating in the June \n     2007 brutal takeover of Gaza by Hamas, make the achievement \n     of President Bush's vision even more difficult;\n       Whereas, on June 27, 2007, the Quartet (the United States, \n     Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations) appointed \n     former British Prime Minister Tony Blair special envoy to the \n     Middle East with a focus on mobilizing assistance to the \n     Palestinians and promoting economic development and \n     institutional governance;\n       Whereas a robust and high-level American diplomatic \n     presence on the ground is critical to bringing Israelis and \n     Palestinians together to make the tough decisions necessary \n     to achieving a permanent resolution to the conflict;\n       Whereas June 2007 marked the 40th anniversary of the Six-\n     Day War between Israel and a coalition of Arab states;\n       Whereas all parties should use the occasion of this \n     anniversary to redouble their efforts to achieve peace; and\n       Whereas achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace could have \n     significant positive impacts on security and stability in the \n     region: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its commitment to a true and lasting solution \n     to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the \n     establishment of 2 states, the State of Israel and Palestine, \n     living side by side in peace and security, and with \n     recognized borders;\n       (2) denounces the use of violence and terror and reaffirms \n     its unwavering commitment to Israel's security;\n\n[[Page S11758]]\n\n       (3) calls on President Bush to pursue a robust diplomatic \n     effort to engage the State of Israel and the Palestinian \n     Authority, begin negotiations, and make a 2-state settlement \n     a top priority;\n       (4) urges President Bush to consider appointing as Special \n     Envoy for Middle East Peace an individual who has held \n     cabinet rank or someone equally qualified, with an extensive \n     knowledge of foreign affairs generally and the Middle East \n     region in particular;\n       (5) calls on Hamas to recognize the State of Israel's right \n     to exist, to renounce and end all terror and incitement, and \n     to accept past agreements and obligations with the State of \n     Israel;\n       (6) calls on moderate Arab states in the region to \n     intensify their diplomatic efforts toward a 2-state solution \n     and welcomes the Arab League Peace Initiative; and\n       (7) calls on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to embrace \n     efforts to achieve peace and refrain from taking any actions \n     that would prejudice the outcome of final status \n     negotiations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11758-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 322--HONORING THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENTS OF GENERAL \n     GEORGE SEARS GREENE ON THE OCCASION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY \n               REDEDICATION OF THE MONUMENT IN HIS HONOR\n\n  Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Schumer) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 322\n\n       Whereas George Sears Greene was one of 9 children born to \n     Caleb and Sarah Robinson Wicks Greene in Apponaug, Rhode \n     Island, attended grammar school in Warwick, Rhode Island, and \n     moved to New York as a teenager;\n       Whereas Greene attended the United States Military Academy \n     at West Point, where he graduated 2nd in his class in 1823;\n       Whereas Greene entered the Army as a 2nd lieutenant in the \n     3rd United States Artillery regiment, and, due to his superb \n     scholarship, was appointed to teach mathematics at the \n     Military Academy following his graduation;\n       Whereas, after resigning his commission in the Army in \n     1836, Greene worked as a civil engineer, became a founder of \n     the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects, and \n     constructed railroads and canals in several states and \n     designed aqueducts and municipal sewage and water systems for \n     New York, Providence, and several other cities;\n       Whereas, at the outset of the Civil War, Greene returned to \n     the defense of the Nation and, at the age of 60, was \n     appointed colonel of the 60th New York Infantry regiment;\n       Whereas, on April 28, 1862, Greene was promoted to \n     Brigadier General, United States Volunteers;\n       Whereas, on July 2, 1863, on the 2nd day of the Battle of \n     Gettysburg, Greene led the 3rd Brigade of New Yorkers on \n     Culp's Hill, and his regiment's defense of the Union right \n     flank at Culp's during the battle was a contributing factor \n     in the Union's victory;\n       Whereas Greene passed away at the age of 97 in 1899 and, in \n     1907, a monument on Culp's Hill was erected in Greene's \n     honor; and\n       Whereas the General George Sears Greene monument will be \n     rededicated on September 22, 2007: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, in honor of the 100th \n     anniversary rededication of the General George Sears Greene \n     monument at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, commends the lifetime \n     achievements of General Greene, his commitment to public \n     service, and his decisive and heroic defense of Culp's Hill \n     in the crucial Battle of Gettysburg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11758-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11758-S11759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2909.

MINIMUM PERIODS BETWEEN DEPLOYMENT FOR UNITS AND \n                   MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES DEPLOYED FOR \n                   OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND OPERATION ENDURING \n                   FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress expresses its grateful thanks to the men and \n     women of the Armed Forces of the United States for having \n     served their country with great distinction under enormously \n     difficult circumstances since September 11, 2001.\n       (2) The all-volunteer force of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States is bearing a disproportionate share of national \n     wartime sacrifice, and, as stewards of this national \n     treasure, Congress must not place that force at unacceptable \n     risk.\n       (3) The men and women members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States and their families are under enormous strain \n     from multiple, extended combat deployments to Iraq and \n     Afghanistan.\n       (4) Extended, high-tempo deployments to Iraq and \n     Afghanistan have adversely affected the readiness of non-\n     deployed Army and Marine Corps units, thereby jeopardizing \n     their capability to respond quickly and effectively to other \n     crises or contingencies in the world, and complicating the \n     all-volunteer policy of recruitment, as well as the \n     retention, of career military personnel.\n       (5) Optimal time between operational deployments, commonly \n     described as ``dwell time'', is critically important to allow \n     members of the Armed Forces to readjust from combat \n     operations, bond with families and friends, generate more \n     predictable operational tempos, and provide sufficient time \n     for units to retrain, reconstitute, and assimilate new \n     members.\n       (6) It is the goal of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     to achieve an optimal minimum period between the previous \n     deployment of a unit or member of a regular component of the \n     Armed Forces and a subsequent deployment of such a unit or \n     member that is equal to or longer than twice the period of \n     such previous deployment, commonly described as a 1:2 \n     deployment-to-dwell ratio.\n       (7) It is the goal of the Department of Defense that units \n     and members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States should not be mobilized continuously for \n     more than one year, and that a period of five years should \n     elapse between the previous deployment of such a unit or \n     member and a subsequent deployment of such unit or member.\n       (8) In support of continuous operations in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and other contested areas, the Army has been \n     required to deploy units and members to Iraq for 15 months \n     with a 12-month dwell-time period between deployments, \n     resulting in a less than 1:1 deployment-to-dwell ratio.\n       (9) In support of continuous operations in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and other contested areas, the Marine Corps \n     currently is deploying units and members to Iraq for \n     approximately seven months, with a seven-month dwell-time \n     period between deployments, but it is not unusual for \n     selected units and members of the Marine Corps to be deployed \n     with less than a 1:1 deployment-to-dwell ratio.\n       (10) In support of continuous operations in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and other contested areas, the Department of \n     Defense has relied upon the reserve components of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States to a degree that is unprecedented \n     in the history of the all-volunteer force. Units and members \n     of the reserve components are frequently mobilized and \n     deployed for periods beyond the stated goals of the \n     Department.\n       (11) The Commander of the Multi-National Force-Iraq \n     recently testified to Congress that he would like Soldiers, \n     Marines, and other forces have more time with their families \n     between deployments, a reflection of his awareness of the \n     stress and strain placed on United States ground forces, in \n     particular, and on other high-demand, low-density assets, by \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (b) Minimum Period for Units and Members of the Regular \n     Components.--\n       (1) In general.--No unit or member of the Armed Forces \n     specified in paragraph (3) may be deployed for Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom (including \n     participation in the NATO International Security Assistance \n     Force (Afghanistan)) unless the period between the deployment \n     of the unit or member is equal to or longer than the period \n     of such previous deployment.\n       (2) Sense of congress on optimal minimum period between \n     deployments.--It is the sense of Congress that the optimal \n     minimum period between the previous deployment of a unit or \n     member of the Armed Forces specified in paragraph (3) to \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and a \n     subsequent deployment of the unit or member to Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom should be equal \n     to or longer than twice the period of such previous \n     deployment.\n       (3) Covered units and members.--The units and members of \n     the Armed Forces specified in this paragraph are as follows:\n       (A) Units and members of the regular Army.\n       (B) Units and members of the regular Marine Corps.\n       (C) Units and members of the regular Navy.\n       (D) Units and members of the regular Air Force.\n       (E) Units and members of the regular Coast Guard.\n       (c) Minimum Period for Units and Members of the Reserve \n     Components.--\n       (1) In general.--No unit or member of the Armed Forces \n     specified in paragraph (3) may be deployed for Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom (including \n     participation in the NATO International Security Assistance \n     Force (Afghanistan)) if the unit or member has been deployed \n     at any time within the three years preceding the date of the \n     deployment covered by this subsection.\n       (2) Sense of congress on mobilization and optimal minimum \n     period between deployments.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that--\n       (A) the units and members of the reserve components of the \n     Armed Forces should not be mobilized continuously for more \n     than one year; and\n       (B) the optimal minimum period between the previous \n     deployment of a unit or member of the Armed Forces specified \n     in paragraph (3) to Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation \n     Enduring Freedom and a subsequent deployment of the unit or \n     member to Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring \n     Freedom should be five years.\n       (3) Covered units and members.--The units and members of \n     the Armed Forces specified in this paragraph are as follows:\n       (A) Units and members of the Army Reserve.\n       (B) Units and members of the Army National Guard.\n       (C) Units and members of the Marine Corps Reserve.\n       (D) Units and members of the Navy Reserve.\n       (E) Units and members of the Air Force Reserve.\n       (F) Units and members of the Air National Guard.\n       (G) Units and members of the Coast Guard Reserve.\n\n[[Page S11760]]\n\n       (d) Inapplicability to Special Operations Forces.--The \n     limitations in subsections (b) and (c) shall not apply with \n     respect to forces that are considered special operations \n     forces for purposes of section 167(i) of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n       (e) Waiver by the President.--The President may waive the \n     limitation in subsection (b) or (c) with respect to the \n     deployment of a unit or member of the Armed Forces specified \n     in such subsection if the President certifies to Congress \n     that the deployment of the unit or member is necessary to \n     meet an operational emergency posing a threat to vital \n     national security interests of the United States.\n       (f) Waiver by Miliary Chief of Staff or Commandant for \n     Voluntary Mobilizations.--\n       (1) Army.--With respect to the deployment of a member of \n     the Army who has voluntarily requested mobilization, the \n     limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be waived by the \n     Chief of Staff of the Army (or the designee of the Chief of \n     Staff of the Army).\n       (2) Navy.--With respect to the deployment of a member of \n     the Navy who has voluntarily requested mobilization, the \n     limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be waived by the \n     Chief of Naval Operations (or the designee of the Chief of \n     Naval Operations).\n       (3) Marine corps.--With respect to the deployment of a \n     member of the Marine Corps who has voluntarily requested \n     mobilization, the limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be \n     waived by the Commandant of the Marine Corps (or the designee \n     of the Commandant of the Marine Corps).\n       (4) Air force.--With respect to the deployment of a member \n     of the Air Force who has voluntarily requested mobilization, \n     the limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be waived by the \n     Chief of Staff of the Air Force (or the designee of the Chief \n     of Staff of the Air Force).\n       (5) Coast guard.--With respect to the deployment of a \n     member of the Coast Guard who has voluntarily requested \n     mobilization, the limitation in subsection (b) or (c) may be \n     waived by the Commandant of the Coast Guard (or the designee \n     of the Commandant of the Coast Guard).\n       (g) Effective Date.--In order to afford the Department of \n     Defense sufficient time to plan and organize the \n     implementation of the provisions of this section, the \n     provisions of this section shall go into effect 120 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2910.

Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Specter) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed to amendment SA 2011 proposed by Mr. \nNelson of Nebraska (for Mr. Levin) to the bill H.R. 1585, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2008 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1070. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON A MEMORIAL FOR MEMBERS OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES WHO DIED IN AN AIR CRASH IN BAKERS \n                   CREEK, AUSTRALIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Army Air Corps \n     established rest and recreation facilities in Mackay, \n     Queensland, Australia.\n       (2) From the end of January 1943 until early 1944, \n     thousands of United States servicemen were ferried from \n     jungle battlefields in New Guinea to Mackay.\n       (3) These servicemen traveled by air transport to spend an \n     average of 10 days on a rest and relaxation furlough.\n       (4) They usually were carried by two B-17C Flying \n     Fortresses converted for transport duty.\n       (5) On Monday, June 14, 1943, at about 6 a.m., a B-17C, \n     Serial Number 40-2072, took off from Mackay Airport for Port \n     Moresby, New Guinea.\n       (6) There were 6 crew members and 35 passengers aboard.\n       (7) The aircraft took off into fog and soon made two left \n     turns at low altitude.\n       (8) A few minutes after takeoff, when it was five miles \n     south of Mackay, the plane crashed at Bakers Creek, killing \n     everyone on board except Corporal Foye Kenneth Roberts of \n     Wichita Falls, Texas, the sole survivor of the accident.\n       (9) The cause of the crash remains a mystery, and the \n     incident remains relatively unknown outside of Australia.\n       (10) United States officials, who were under orders not to \n     reveal the presence of Allied troops in Australia, kept the \n     crash a military secret during the war.\n       (11) Due to wartime censorship, the news media did not \n     report the crash.\n       (12) Relatives of the victims received telegrams from the \n     United States War Department stating little more than that \n     the serviceman had been killed somewhere in the South West \n     Pacific.\n       (13) The remains of the 40 crash victims were flown to \n     Townsville, Queensland, where they were buried in the Belgian \n     Gardens United States military cemetery on June 19, 1943.\n       (14) In early 1946, they were disinterred and shipped to \n     Hawaii, where 13 were reburied in the National Memorial \n     Cemetery of the Pacific, and the remainder were returned to \n     the United States mainland for reburial.\n       (15) 15 years ago, Robert S. Cutler was reading his \n     father's wartime journal and found a reference to the tragic \n     B-17C airplane accident.\n       (16) This discovery inspired Mr. Cutler to embark upon a \n     research project that would consume more than a decade and \n     take him to Australia.\n       (17) Retired United States Air Force Chief Master Sergeant \n     Teddy W. Hanks, of Wichita Falls, Texas, who lost 4 of his \n     World War II buddies in the crash, compiled a list of the \n     casualties from United States archives in 1993 and began \n     searching for their families.\n       (18) The Bakers Creek Memorial Association, in conjunction \n     with the Washington Post and retired United States Army \n     genealogy experts Charles Gailey and Arvon Staats, located 23 \n     additional families of victims of the accident during the \n     past 2 years.\n       (19) The commander of the United States Fifth Air Force \n     officially had notified the relatives of 36 of the 40 \n     victims.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that an \n     appropriate site in Arlington National Cemetery should be \n     provided for a memorial marker to honor the memory of the 40 \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States who lost \n     their lives in the air crash at Bakers Creek, Australia, on \n     June 14, 1943, provided that the Secretary of the Army has \n     exclusive authority to approve the design and site for the \n     memorial marker.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2912.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FEES AND ADJUSTMENTS UNDER THE \n                   TRICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) career members of the uniformed services and their \n     families endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n     extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-\n     year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans;\n       (2) these demands and sacrifices are such that few \n     Americans are willing to accept them for a multi-decade \n     career;\n\n[[Page S11761]]\n\n       (3) a primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a system of \n     exceptional retirement benefits that a grateful Nation \n     provides for those who choose to subordinate much of their \n     personal life to the national interest for so many years;\n       (4) proposals to compare cash fees paid by retired military \n     members and their families to fees paid by civilians fail to \n     recognize adequately that military members prepay the \n     equivalent of very large advance premiums for health care in \n     retirement through their extended service and sacrifice, in \n     addition to cash fees, deductibles, and copayments;\n       (5) the Department of Defense and the Nation have a \n     committed obligation to provide health care benefits to \n     active duty, National Guard, Reserve and retired members of \n     the uniformed services and their families and survivors that \n     considerably exceeds the obligation of corporate employers to \n     provide health care benefits to their employees; and\n       (6) the Department of Defense has options to constrain the \n     growth of health care spending in ways that do not \n     disadvantage retired members of the uniformed services, and \n     should pursue any and all such options as a first priority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2913.

Petraeus, Commander of the \n     Multinational Force-Iraq, stated on March 8, 2007, ``There is \n     no military solution to a problem like that in Iraq.''\n       (3) President George W. Bush reiterated on July 12, 2007, \n     that the United States troop surge implemented in 2007 \n     ``seeks to open space for Iraq's political leaders to advance \n     the difficult process of national reconciliation, which is \n     essential to lasting security and stability''.\n       (4) Greater involvement and diplomatic engagement by Iraq's \n     neighbors and key international actors can help facilitate \n     the national political reconciliation so essential to \n     sustainable success in Iraq.\n       (5) The United States troop surge carried out in 2007 has \n     not, as of yet, been matched by a comparable diplomatic surge \n     designed to ensure that Iraqi national leaders carry through \n     on the process of national reconciliation.\n       (6) The final report of the Iraq Study Group, released in \n     December 2006, declared, ``The United States must build a new \n     international consensus for stability in Iraq and the region. \n     In order to foster such consensus, the United States should \n     embark on a robust diplomatic effort to establish an \n     international support structure intended to stabilize Iraq \n     and ease tensions in other countries in the region. This \n     support structure should include every country that has an \n     interest in averting a chaotic Iraq, including all of Iraq's \n     neighbors.''\n       (7) On August 10, 2007, the United Nations Security Council \n     voted unanimously to expand the mandate of its mission in \n     Iraq to assist the national government with political \n     reconciliation, bring together Iraq's neighbors to discuss \n     border security and energy access, and facilitate much needed \n     humanitarian assistance.\n       (8) The United States Ambassador to Iraq, the Honorable \n     Ryan C. Crocker, asserted on September 11, 2007, in testimony \n     before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, \n     ``With respect, again, to [Iraq's] neighbors and others, that \n     is exactly our intent to have a more intensive, positive, \n     more regulated engagement between Iraq and its neighbors.. . \n     . The United Nations is now positioned to play a more active \n     and involved role.''\n       (9) General Petraeus said on September 11, 2007, in \n     response to a question on the need for greater civilian \n     activity in Iraq, ``I agree with the chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff who has said repeatedly that certain elements \n     of our government are at war, DoD, State, AID, but not all of \n     the others.. . . We can use help in those areas. Some of the \n     areas are quite thin, agriculture, health, and some others.''\n       (10) The United States troop surge carried out in 2007 has \n     not, as of yet, been matched by a comparable civilian surge \n     designed to help the Government of Iraq strengthen its \n     capabilities in providing essential government services.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States Government should take the lead in \n     organizing a comprehensive diplomatic offensive, consisting \n     of bilateral, regional, and international initiatives, to \n     assist the Government of Iraq in achieving national \n     reconciliation and successfully meeting key security, \n     political, and economic benchmarks;\n       (2) it is in the interest of the United States and the \n     people of Iraq that Iraq is not seen as a uniquely \n     ``American'' problem, but rather as of enduring importance to \n     the security and prosperity of its neighbors, the entire \n     Middle East region, and the broader international community;\n       (3) the greater involvement in a constructive fashion of \n     Iraq's neighbors, whether through a regional conference or \n     another mechanism, can help stabilize Iraq and end the \n     outside flows of weapons, explosive materials, foreign \n     fighters, and funding that contribute to the current \n     sectarian warfare in Iraq;\n       (4) the President and the Secretary of State should invest \n     their personal time and energy in these diplomatic efforts to \n     ensure that they receive the highest priority within the \n     United States Government and are viewed as a serious effort \n     in the region and elsewhere;\n       (5) the President, in order to demonstrate that a regional \n     diplomacy strategy enjoys attention at the highest levels of \n     the United States Government, should appoint a seasoned, \n     high-level Presidential envoy to the Middle East region to \n     supplement the efforts of Ambassador Crocker and focus on the \n     establishment of a regional framework to help stabilize Iraq;\n       (6) the United States Government should build upon \n     tentative progress achieved by the International Compact for \n     Iraq and the Iraq Neighbors Conference to serve as the basis \n     for a more intensive and sustained effort to construct an \n     effective regional mechanism;\n       (7) the President should direct the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations to use the voice and \n     vote of the United States at the United Nations to seek the \n     appointment of an international mediator in Iraq, under the \n     auspices of the United Nations Security Council, to engage \n     political, religious, ethnic, and tribal leaders in Iraq to \n     foster national reconciliation efforts;\n       (8) the United States Government should begin planning for \n     a wide-ranging dialogue on the mandate governing \n     international support for Iraq when the current United \n     Nations mandate authorizing the United States-led coalition \n     expires at the end of 2007;\n       (9) the United States Government should more directly press \n     Iraq's neighbors to open fully operating embassies in Baghdad \n     and establish inclusive diplomatic relations with the \n     Government of Iraq to help ensure the Government is viewed as \n     legitimate throughout the region;\n       (10) the United States Government should strongly urge the \n     governments of those countries that have previously pledged \n     debt forgiveness and economic assistance to the Government of \n     Iraq to fully carry through on their commitments on an \n     expedited basis;\n       (11) a key objective of any diplomatic offensive should be \n     to ameliorate the suffering and deprivation of Iraqi \n     refugees, both those displaced internally and those who have \n     fled to neighboring countries, through coordinated \n     humanitarian assistance and the development of a regional \n     framework to establish long-term solutions to the future of \n     displaced Iraqi citizens;\n       (12) the United States Government should reallocate \n     diplomats and Department of State funds as required to ensure \n     that any comprehensive diplomatic offensive to stabilize Iraq \n     on an urgent basis has the needed resources to succeed; and\n       (13) the United States Government should reallocate \n     civilian expertise to help governmental entities in Iraq \n     strengthen their ability to provide essential government \n     services to the people of Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2932.

Mr. President, I have submitted this resolution with my \ncolleagues, Senator Whitehouse and Senator Clinton, to honor the life \nand accomplishments of George Sears Greene, the distinguished general \nfrom Rhode Island who helped lead the Union to victory at the Battle of \nGettysburg.\n  General Greene was born and raised in Apponaug, RI before moving to \npursue work in New York. At the age of 18, he was appointed to the \nUnited States Military Academy at West Point and excelled in his \nstudies there, graduating second in his class.\n  After resigning his commission in the Army in 1836, Greene went on to \nbecome a founder of the American Society of Civil Engineers and \nArchitects. As an engineer, Greene designed projects throughout the \nUnited States including a reservoir in Manhattan's Central Park and \nmunicipal water and sewage systems for several cities, including \nProvidence.\n  But General Greene is perhaps best known for his heroism at \nGettysburg. Greene returned voluntarily to the defense of the Nation at \nthe age of 60, when the governor of New York appointed him colonel of \nthe New York 60th Infantry regiment. At Gettysburg, General Greene led \nthe 3rd Brigade of New York at Culp's Hill. His regiment's defense of \nthe Union army's right flank helped secure victory for the Nation at \nthat decisive battle.\n  General Greene's memory will be honored this Saturday at the 100th \nanniversary rededication ceremony of his monument on Culp's Hill. I ask \nthat you join Senators Whitehouse, Clinton and me in recognizing his \nexemplary public service.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, en bloc, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 322) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows\n\n                              S. Res. 322\n\n       Whereas George Sears Greene was one of 9 children born to \n     Caleb and Sarah Robinson Wicks Greene in Apponaug, Rhode \n     Island, attended grammar school in Warwick, Rhode Island, and \n     moved to New York as a teenager;\n       Whereas Greene attended the United States Military Academy \n     at West Point, where he graduated 2nd in his class in 1823;\n       Whereas Greene entered the Army as a 2nd lieutenant in the \n     3rd United States Artillery regiment, and, due to his superb \n     scholarship, was appointed to teach mathematics at the \n     Military Academy following his graduation;\n       Whereas, after resigning his commission in the Army in \n     1836, Greene worked as a civil engineer, became a founder of \n     the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects, and \n     constructed railroads and canals in several states and \n     designed aqueducts and municipal sewage and water systems for \n     New York, Providence, and several other cities;\n       Whereas, at the outset of the Civil War, Greene returned to \n     the defense of the Nation and, at the age of 60, was \n     appointed colonel of the 60th New York Infantry regiment;\n       Whereas, on April 28, 1862, Greene was promoted to \n     Brigadier General, United States Volunteers;\n       Whereas, on July 2, 1863, on the 2nd day of the Battle of \n     Gettysburg, Greene led the 3rd Brigade of New Yorkers on \n     Culp's Hill, and his regiment's defense of the Union right \n     flank at Culp's during the battle was a contributing factor \n     in the Union's victory;\n       Whereas Greene passed away at the age of 97 in 1899 and, in \n     1907, a monument on Culp's Hill was erected in Greene's \n     honor; and\n       Whereas the General George Sears Greene monument will be \n     rededicated on September 22, 2007: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, in honor of the 100th \n     anniversary rededication of the General George Sears Greene \n     monument at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, commends the lifetime \n     achievements of General Greene, his commitment to public \n     service, and his decisive and heroic defense of Culp's Hill \n     in the crucial Battle of Gettysburg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/19/senate-section/article/S11774-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2070\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
