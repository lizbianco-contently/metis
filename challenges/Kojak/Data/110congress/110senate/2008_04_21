Mr. President, following my remarks, there will be a period \nfor the transaction of morning business. Senators will be allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each. There will be no rollcall votes today \nbecause of the Passover holiday. Tomorrow at 12 noon, the Senate will \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. \n1315, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act.\n  Tomorrow, in addition to the usual recess for the caucus luncheons \nfrom 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m., the Senate will recess from 3:30 p.m. to \n4:30 p.m. for the unveiling of Majority Leader Daschle's portrait.

Also on that same day, \nAdmiral Mullen will brief us from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. We will be in \nrecess from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday. There will be a briefing in \nroom 407.\n  Again, tomorrow afternoon, we are going to, hopefully, invoke cloture \non the veterans' benefits matter, and we will also have the unveiling \nof Senator Daschle's portrait. From 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., we will be \nin recess. On Wednesday, we will be in recess from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. \nfor the Dr. DeBakey Gold Medal ceremony and will be in recess from 4 \np.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday for a Senators-only briefing by Admiral \nMullen in room S-407.

Mr. President, maybe an hour ago, my wonderful assistant \nJanice Shelton said: I have bad news. I said: What is it, Janice? Carol \nChadburn worked for me for many years. She was my scheduler. She was a \nwonderful woman. She was so happy. She loved to have parties at her \nhome\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\nfor staff. She came from Nevada. She was a legal secretary to my friend \nwho then was an attorney and later became a justice on the Nevada \nSupreme Court for many years, 18 years. She came back here. Her husband \nwas a labor leader. They moved back here from Nevada. He died within 18 \nmonths. He was dead. He was a young man. He just dropped dead. Carol \nkept their home in Centreville. It was a long drive back and forth for \na long time working for me. She was such a hard worker and was so \nhappy.\n  Many years after her husband died and her daughter returned to \nNevada--she raised the girl here--she met a retired colonel, and they \nwere married and moved to Florida. She had a wonderful--I don't know \nhow many years it has been, maybe 8 years. Time goes fast. I don't know \nhow long it has been.\n  Janice said to me: I was going to tell you last week that she had \nbreast cancer and you should give her a call. She said she died \nyesterday. I feel very bad about that. She was such a good woman and \nworked so hard and found happiness. She was not an old woman--maybe 58, \n59. I don't really know how old she was.\n  Every year, hundreds of thousands of women just like Carol are \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. Breast cancer will strike approximately \none in eight American women, and a new case is diagnosed every 2 \nminutes. We have made progress in breast cancer diagnosis and \ntreatment, but we still do not know the cause. We do not know the \ncause. I don't really know if Carol died from lung cancer or breast \ncancer, but I want to direct my attention today to breast cancer.\n  Scientists have identified some risk factors. Those risk factors \nexplain fewer than 30 percent of the cases. The Breast Cancer and \nEnvironmental Research Act that I started with Lincoln Chafee, a former \nSenator from Rhode Island, to establish a national strategy to study \nthe possible connection between breast cancer and the environment would \nauthorize funding for research.\n  Many people believe these cases of breast cancer have something to do \nwith the changing environment. The resulting discoveries of this \nresearch could be critical to improving our knowledge of this complex \nillness, which could lead to better prevention, treatment, and maybe \neven one day a cure.\n  Although we first introduced this legislation in 2000, despite strong \nbipartisan support, Congress has yet to act and send this bill to \nPresident Bush. In the last session of Congress, the bill was reported \nout of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, but one of \nour colleagues prevented final passage. This session, we worked in good \nfaith to address concerns that may have been raised about this \nlegislation. As a result, this legislation, the Breast Cancer and \nEnvironmental Research Act, was once again reported out of the HELP \nCommittee and cosponsored by two-thirds of the Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  It is long past time for the Senate to take up this broadly supported \nbipartisan legislation. Too many women and their families have waited \nfor so long. I agree with them, they waited far too long.\n  There are examples we can all give, as I talked about Carol, who died \nyesterday of cancer. In January 2007, Nevada lost a lifelong resident, \nsomebody who worked so hard on this issue. Her name was Deanna Wright \nJensen. She was a lobbyist without pay. She just thought something \nshould be done. She thought something in the environment was causing \nthis illness. I don't know if she was right, but we should find out. \nMany people agree with her. Scientists agree with her. Even as she was \nenduring a grueling regimen of radiation and chemotherapy, she \ncontinued to remind me and my staff through e-mails and letters about \nthe importance of this legislation. In Deanna's words, passing the \nBreast Cancer and Environmental Research Act is a real opportunity for \nCongress to ``step up for women and breast cancer.'' For her, it is too \nlate. She did not want others to have a similar fate.\n  One person, one Senator is holding up this legislation. That is why I \nwill be asking unanimous consent--I am not going to do it now. We do \nnot have a Republican on the floor. But I told staff I am going to come \nback at 3:30 p.m. or thereafter. The Republicans have had adequate \nnotice. I cannot make the entire Senate schedule convenient for one \nSenator who is objecting, causing this problem for all the Senate.\n  It is time to offer more than words of encouragement to those \naffected by breast cancers. Our wives, sisters, mothers, daughters, and \nfriends have waited far too long. I am going to come back maybe at 3:30 \np.m., maybe at 3:45 p.m., but I am going to come back and ask unanimous \nconsent to take up this bill, and the Republicans are going to have to \nobject to it if they are going to follow the lead of one person holding \nup this legislation.\n  Why, Mr. President? Why can't we take up this bill? Why wouldn't the \nminority go along with this effort? That is my concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/21/senate-section/article/S3178-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3178-S3179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VETERANS' BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a similar vein, 9 months ago, in August \nof last year, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee reported the \nVeterans' Benefits Enhancement Act to the Senate floor.\n  Today, there are about 150,000 young Americans serving, sacrificing, \nand suffering in Iraq. This legislation, which is on the Senate floor \ntoday--we are trying to get it so we can debate this bill--would \nprovide much needed and long overdue benefits for veterans young and \nold.\n  This legislation on which we had to file cloture--here it is: \nRepublican filibusters, 66 and still counting. They are going up, it \nseems, a couple times a week. It is hard to comprehend, but we have had \nto file cloture on allowing the Senate to proceed to debate on an issue \nof this importance. We should have gone to it Thursday night. No, we \nhad to file cloture on it. We are going to vote on cloture tomorrow, \nand then, if we get cloture, they will make us use the 30 hours, waste \nthe 30 hours, just eat up time.\n  This bill has 38 provisions and 8 titles, all extremely important. It \nexpands eligibility for traumatic injury insurance, extends eligibility \nfor specially adapted housing benefits to veterans who have been burned \nseverely. As the Presiding Officer knows, those improvised explosive \ndevices cause infernos, and people are burned often. The bill increases \nbenefits for veterans pursuing apprenticeships or on-the-job training \nprograms. It restores veteran status to Filipino veterans who served \nunder U.S. command during World War II. As I mentioned last Friday, all \none needs to do is watch the Tom Hanks World War II series, and you can \nsee what the Filipinos did for us side by side in fighting the Japanese \nduring World War II. We want them to have the benefits that are so long \noverdue.\n  We have had to file cloture and break filibusters 66 times. The prior \nrecord was 57 or 58 in a single Congress; that is 2 years. They broke \nthat before Christmas last year. They did it in far less than a year. \nThey broke the 2-year record.\n  America's commitment to the men and women who have served in uniform \nmust never waver. At a time when one in five young men and women \nreturns from Iraq and Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorders \nand other psychological problems, this legislation should have come to \nthe Senate floor with no delay. At a time when tens of thousands of our \ntroops are returning from war with wounds, many of them grievous, this \nlegislation should have passed overwhelmingly, if not unanimously.\n  On many days, there is a tour guide in the Capitol who, when he spots \na veteran in one of the tours, talks with them, and he has a little \nthing that we sign, and many times he brings them by my office.\n  I have seen, at Walter Reed and in my office, what this war has done \nto our troops' bodies. I have had a chance to visit with these young \nmen and women, after they have been to war and come back, out of Walter \nReed--sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently. They are still \nteenagers. I have seen their scars. I have heard how their lives have \nbeen changed. I asked them, talked to them in detail: How did you get \nhurt?\n  The last one who was in, I said: How long were you in the vehicle?\n  He said: Twenty seconds. Went from the house, jumped in the vehicle--\nit blew up almost immediately.\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\n  He is hurt; lost his leg above his knee. He had scars that you could \nsee on the one where he has a whole leg. He showed me the scars on \nthat. He said it causes him more trouble than the one that is missing.\n  No matter what position we take on the war in Iraq, we should all \nagree on providing for these veterans and those who wore the uniform \nbefore them. That is a solemn responsibility we have now. This act we \nare trying to get on the Senate floor now helps fulfill the \nresponsibility we have as Senators.\n  Every Senator has a right to oppose this legislation or try to change \nit. In my time as majority leader, I have tried to work with the \nRepublican leader to reach consensus on legislation on which minority \nMembers have objections. I have made repeated efforts to try to do so \non the Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act. I am told my Republican \ncounterparts--if the Republican side of the aisle doesn't like this, \nlet's legislate it and take parts of it out. Unfortunately, the \nRepublican leader has not responded positively. As a result, I was \nforced Thursday night to file cloture on the motion to proceed simply \nso we could start debating this legislation.\n  I would have preferred not to have had to file cloture. I wish we \ncould just move forward on it, as we have wanted to do 65 other times. \nBut when legislation to honor and care for our veterans languishes for \n9 months because Republicans are unwilling to work with us or just \nsimply legislate, I have no other choice. As dedicated Government \nwatchers and C-SPAN watchers know, this is far from the first time the \nRepublican minority has rejected our good-faith efforts on reaching \ncompromise. Time and time again they have chosen obstruction over \nnegotiation.\n  It seems to me what the Republicans want is a graveyard of no \nprogress. We are going to continue to fight. We are going to do \neverything we can to get this legislation passed. We believe there \nshould be progress; filing cloture as we have had to do is going to \nhelp us get progress. It is going to be slow, but we are going to \ncontinue doing it.\n  It seems in times like this our Republican friends would rather we \naccomplish nothing. Maybe they see political advantage in slow-walking. \nBut the American people are left to suffer for their actions.\n  Some may not like provisions in the Veterans Benefits Enhancement \nAct. Let them move to change them. Some say: If it weren't for the \nFilipino veterans, we would allow you to move to this bill. Filipino \nveterans--they fought alongside U.S. troops during World War II. I do \nnot think the valor of these Filipino troops should be questioned. \nThese troops may have been born on foreign soil, but they served \nshoulder to shoulder under one flag, our flag, the American flag. It is \nour moral obligation to recognize the reward they are due. It is long \npast time we do so.\n  It is time for our Republican colleagues to choose. Will they stand \nin lockstep with an obstinate few, intent on dragging their heels on \nthe care and support our veterans need? I hope not. We need just nine \nRepublicans to join with us.\n  As you know, Mr. President, there are 51 of us. We need 9 of them to \nget to 60. I hope there are surely nine Republicans willing to stand on \nthe side of our veterans, our troops. Tomorrow we will have a chance to \npass the Veterans Benefits Extension Act. I extend my hand once more to \nthe Republican leader and all my colleagues in the minority. If they \nwould end their needless obstruction, we could get on this legislation \ntoday. We would deliver an important victory to the men and women who \nhave served us--and will serve us today--with courage, valor, and \ndistinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/21/senate-section/article/S3179-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 579\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I would like to ask the majority leader \nbefore he leaves the floor--I know he has a very busy schedule--the \nmajority leader alluded to a bill on which we will take up a cloture \nmotion tomorrow. I want the majority leader to know before he leaves \nthe floor that the only thing that is contentious in the veterans bill \nthat he has referred to is a new special pension that has been created \nin this bill of $300 to Filipino veterans who live in the Philippines, \nwho have no service-connected injuries. If that were stripped from the \nbill, then this bill is one that I believe we could pass by unanimous \nconsent on the Senate floor.\n  In the absence of that----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURR. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, I understand. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, that \npeople have a problem with that. But I say to my friend, we should go \non the bill. If people don't like that, offer an amendment, and we will \ndebate that, vote on it, and go about our way. I think that would be \nsuch a good way to do this.\n  Some of us feel very strongly about these Filipino veterans, as you \nknow. I have mentioned this before. They fought valiantly. All you need \nto do to prove that is to see what happened in the Tom Hanks movie.\n  I would also say to my friend that we need to do something about \nthis. The average age of one of these Filipinos is about 84 years now. \nIt is not as if we are breaking the bank to help these people who \nfought side by side with us. I understand the concern of my friend, but \nI suggest, let's move to the bill, offer an amendment, it can be the \nfirst amendment. We will have you offer the first amendment, or whoever \nwants to.\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\n  Mr. BURR. Let me assure the majority leader, as ranking member of the \ncommittee, I do not intend to vote against cloture. I intend to proceed \nto the bill. I intend to offer an amendment that strips out the \nprovision of $300 of a special pension that I think prioritizes that \ngroup above our veterans who are coming back. My amendment would hold \neverything else in Senator Akaka's bill in place, but we would also \nmake additions by using that $21 million for additional funding for our \ntroops who are coming out of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I hope the majority leader would at least consider voting for my \namendment when it comes up. We have a rich history on this issue. It \nstarts with the conclusion of the Second World War, when the United \nStates made some very important gifts to the Philippines--the total of \ntwo hospitals, equipment, grants to rebuild the Philippines--to make \nsure those who served were in fact taken care of.\n  I might also add for the majority leader, incorporated into Senator \nAkaka's bill, which is a very good bill on balance, there is only one \narea that we have any problems with. We hold intact those Filipino \nveterans who are in the United States receiving full VA benefits. Those \nwho are outside the United States, living in the Philippines but with \nservice-connected injuries, they receive compensation. It is those who \nlive outside the United States, in the Philippines, with no service-\nconnected injury whatsoever, that creating a special pension is not the \nright thing to do, as we have troops who are coming back at this time.\n  I pledge to the majority leader my willingness to move forward to \nconsideration of the bill--to have a spirited debate, I am sure, but \nclearly to try to address what I think are the priorities, or should be \nthe priorities, of this Senate, and that is to focus on our troops.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could just say to my friend, I do not \nin any way question the seriousness of my friend's concern. The Senator \nasked me would I consider it? Sure, I will be happy to consider it. But \nlet me just say this: Part of mine is basic frustration; that is, why \nin the world would we have to file cloture on a motion to proceed to \nthis bill? It happens so many times. It is something that has not \nhappened very much in the past, and now it happens on every piece of \nlegislation.\n  Again, it sounds like we agree on this legislation. Why could we not \njust move to it and save the 30 hours and all the wasted time on filing \nthis motion?\n  Understand, I am not at all upset at my friend for having a concern \nabout this bill--not whatsoever. I just am frustrated with the need to \nhave to file cloture to proceed to the bill.\n  Mr. BURR. I share the leader's frustration and do not think, in that \ncase, cloture was necessary. But with the restrictions that are placed \non me as ranking member, that I can only agree to a bill if there are \nno amendments and there is a limit set of debate time and I have to \nspeak for 48 others who might not share that limited debate time or a \nset amount of amendments, I think the leader knows that is something \nthat is impossible for me to do and impossible for me to suggest to my \nleadership.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would just go back and say what I said \nearlier. We have suggested over the 9 months there be limited \namendments, there be relevant amendments. We are not there. We cannot \ngo back where we want to be. We are where we are.\n  I hope we would not even need to do the vote tomorrow at 12 noon. I \nhope maybe you can talk to your folks and we can start legislating this \nbill in the morning. That would be the best thing to do because we have \na lot to do. I ask my friend to check that out and maybe that is \nsomething we can do.\n  Anyway, I am glad you are here. I appreciate your concern for the \nbill--part of it. I know you are not the only person who is concerned \nabout that. I know that. But I repeat, there is a thing we call \noffering an amendment. You have one ready to go, and I will look \nforward to debating that amendment.\n  Mr. BURR. I have had the amendment ready to go for months. I think it \nis a shame the majority in the committee was not willing to talk about \nany changes to the bill. Now I think we are to a point where it is \nhealthy for the Senate in total to debate the merits and priorities of \nour country.\n  Were Filipino veterans promised a VA benefit? According to all the \ninformation I have researched and the information provided in 1998 at a \ncongressional hearing with the Department of the Army--it examined its \nholdings of the Douglas MacArthur and President Franklin Roosevelt \npapers and found no references by either of those wartime leaders to \npostwar benefits for Filipino veterans.\n  Let me be very specific. This bill, S. 1315, does two things: No. 1, \nit enhances some benefits for our veterans.\n  I think that receives unanimous support in the Senate. But, two, it \ndiverts $221 million over the next 10 years to create a special pension \nfor a very specific slice of Filipino veterans, those who live in the \nPhilippines, those who had no service-connected injury, those who have \ngone post the war with the understanding that the United States stepped \nin by gifting two hospitals, by gifting medical equipment, by gifting \neverything, and rebuilding the Philippines.\n  At a time of war where we are fighting on two fronts, Afghanistan and \nIraq, I believe the important thing and prudent thing is to take the \n$221 million, over 10 years, and devote it to our men and women who are \ncoming out of combat. S. 1315 has the wrong priorities. So I put \ntogether a substitute proposal, S. 2640. I will offer that as an \namendment at the appropriate point in the debate.\n  In that bill, we do one specific thing: We increase what is in S. \n1315, minus the special pensions, and we propose increasing housing \ngrants for profoundly disabled veterans who need their homes modified \nto accommodate their disabilities; we increase the auto grants for \nprofoundly disabled veterans who need that freedom of the platform, the \nplatform for mobility to live independently; it improves the education \nbenefits for our Guard and Reserves; it increases the burial benefits \nto lessen the financial burden on families of deceased veterans.\n  I did not come over today to debate the merits of S. 1350. I see the \nchairman, Chairman Akaka, is here. The chairman has known since last \nyear that I had problems with that portion of the bill, and we have \ntried to work out the differences. But as I said earlier, for it to be \ncommunicated that we have reached this point because of stall and delay \nand because we are against things, it is flatly wrong. I am for 99 \npercent of the bill. Drop the part that prioritizes someone else in \nfront of our veterans, and I am ready to go forward, I am ready to pass \nit by unanimous consent.\n  But by the same token, I believe when given the responsibility to \nmake sure our veterans are taken care of, to make sure that those with \nsevere disabilities are taken care of, to devote $221 million to a new \nspecial pension, I believe, is the wrong priority at this point in \ntime.\n  I believe we should look at the history and find out: Did we make a \ncommitment? Well, I cannot find that. I cannot find where we promised \nsomebody something we have not fulfilled. Tomorrow, I will take the \nopportunity to go through a very indepth bit of research, not just done \nby me but done over the years that goes back to 1946 in great detail; \nlooks at what the promises were that were made by the United States; \nbut, more importantly, again, the generosity already displayed by this \ncountry to the Philippines to reward them for their participation, and, \nby the way, our help to liberate their country from the siege of an \nenemy.\n  I am convinced the right thing to do is to prioritize that $221 \nmillion for our troops, for our kids from Afghanistan, for our kids \nfrom Iraq, to make sure that those who have paid a sacrifice, and in \nsome cases the ultimate sacrifice, are the beneficiaries of this money.\n  I am committed to come to the floor and debate, as I have made a \npromise to the chairman. I am not going to block the motion to proceed. \nBy the same token, I am not going to vote for limiting the amount of \ntime Members want to spend on this because I think it is too important. \nOur veterans deserve as much time as it takes for us to debate where \nour priorities on money are. If at the end of the day this body votes \nwe send it in the form of a special pension to Filipinos in the \nPhilippines who have no service-connected injury, I will live with \nthat.\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\n  But I will not live with it by agreeing to less than the amount of \ntime that is needed to debate an issue about the future of our kids, \nour service personnel, the men and women who put on a uniform and risk \ntheir lives every day. I believe they should sit at the top of the \nlist. And S. 1315 does not put them there. S. 1315 puts at the top of \nthe list a new special pension program for people who have never had a \nservice-connected injury.\n  I am as sympathetic to those who fall into the category of having \nhelped us. I might mention again, the Filipinos who live in the United \nStates who fought in the Philippines for us, we take care of; we have \nintegrated them fully into the Veterans' Administration. They receive \nevery service our veterans do. To those Filipinos who live in the \nPhilippines who have service-connected injuries, we have made sure \ncompensation is in this bill to take care of them.\n  But for those who do not have service-connected injuries, I cannot \nsee where they fit at the top of the list of $221 million and our kids \ngo below it, as it relates to what they need for the severely disabled \ninjuries they have been faced with.\n  I have a number of soldiers in North Carolina, at least they are \nstationed in North Carolina, that fall into this category. When we see \nEric Edmundson's family spend $47,000 on a van, and $14,000 of that \ncomes out-of-pocket, I have to ask: Where are our priorities? Where are \nthe priorities of the Congress in defense of these kids? Well, they are \nin $221 million getting ready to go to the Philippines. That is where \nthey are. That is the debate we are going to have over the next several \ndays. If it takes a week or if it takes a month, then we will have that \ndebate. At some point, we will take a vote. I believe the American \npeople will see the advantage, the need, to make sure the No. 1 \npriority is our kids in uniform, our veterans who come back who will be \nserviced by this very important piece of legislation.\n  I am committed to Chairman Akaka that once we can dispose of the \nissue of this special pension, I am more than willing to vote for the \nrest of the bill because it is a good bill. It brings some needed \nbenefits to our veterans.\n  It never should have been locked up for the length of period this \nwas. But make no mistake about it, no matter how good a bill is, if you \nwant to structure it in a way that debate does not flourish in the \nSenate, then we have done an injustice to the American people. The most \ndeliberative body in the world is supposed to be one that you are not \ncorralled into agreeing to a certain amount of time to debate on an \nissue; it is where everybody's voice is heard, it is where every bit of \ninformation about an issue can be presented. It is where charts can \ndisplay what words cannot explain.\n  That is what the next several days will be about with S. 1315. I am \nconvinced that at the end of this process, not only will Members in \nthis body be enlightened by what we are able to talk about, but the \nAmerican people will be enlightened, and hopefully this body will vote, \nhopefully in the majority way, that the priority, the No. 1 priority is \nour men and women in uniform when they come home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/21/senate-section/article/S3181-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VETERANS BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support \nconsideration of S. 1315, as reported by the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, the proposed Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. This \nis a comprehensive bill that would improve benefits and services for \nveterans, both young and old, and it should be debated and voted on.\n  I believe that a brief recap of how we came to seek cloture on this \nveterans bill would be helpful in assisting my colleagues in their \ndeliberation on cloture.\n  Last June the committee held a markup during which the then-ranking \nmember, the Senator from Idaho, offered an amendment that would have \nmodified a provision of the bill relating to Filipino veterans of World \nWar II. This amendment would have reduced the amount of pension that \nFilipino veterans residing in the Philippines would receive.\n  I stress that the amendment was not to eliminate pension benefits for \nthese veterans from the bill entirely--it was merely to reduce the \nbenefit in line with what the Senator from Idaho viewed as appropriate. \nI disagreed with his assessment and we debated the issue. Ultimately, \nhis amendment was not adopted.\n  As that markup concluded, the Senator from Idaho noted that he \nintended to bring his amendment regarding the pension issue to the \nfloor during consideration of S. 1315, a step I certainly understood \nand accepted.\n  The report on S. 1315 was filed in August and I expected that it \nwould come to the floor in September. However, there was an unexpected \nchange in the committee's Republican leadership in early September, \nwith the Senator from Idaho being replaced by the Senator from North \nCarolina. I did not push for consideration of S. 1315 while the new \nranking member took over the responsibilities of the position.\n  When in October, committee staff began, at my direction, to seek \nagreement for the bill to be brought to the floor, those efforts were \nnot successful.\n  Later in the fall, despite his suggestion that there was need for \ndebate, the former ranking member curiously objected to my attempt to \ngain unanimous consent to debate the bill. I wrote to my colleague in \nan attempt to find a middle ground between the level of pension \nbenefits in the bill as reported, and the level that he had sought \nduring the June markup.\n  On December 13, 2007, I received a letter from the former ranking \nmember that indicated that he did not feel that we were far apart from \nfinding a compromise on the bill, and that he looked forward to working \nwith me to gain final passage.\n  However, my optimism was short-lived. On that same day, the majority \nstaff received a counteroffer from the minority staff, on behalf of the \ncommittee's new ranking member, the Senator from North Carolina, which \nproposed to entirely eliminate pension benefits for Filipino veterans \nresiding in the Philippines from the bill.\n  Shortly thereafter, I was surprised to learn that this counteroffer \nwas embraced by the committee's former ranking member--rendering his \noffer to negotiate null and void.\n  Additional efforts earlier this year to find a compromise or, at a \nminimum, to enter into an agreement for debate, were again rejected.\n  Now, after over 7 months of obstruction in bringing this bill to the \nfloor, we have to resort to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to \nthe bill, an action unprecedented in the history of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee.\n  I am dismayed that, along with the Filipino veterans provisions \nincluded in the bill, a number of other worthy provisions have not been \nenacted because of obstruction by the minority.\n  Among other things, S. 1315, as reported, would: Establish a new \nprogram of insurance for service-connected veterans; expand eligibility \nfor retroactive benefits from traumatic injury protection coverage \nunder the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program; increase the \nmaximum amount of veterans mortgage life insurance that a service-\nconnected disabled veteran may purchase; recognize that individuals \nwith severe burn injuries need specially adapted housing benefits; and \nextend for 2 years the monthly educational assistance allowance for \napprenticeship or other on-the-job training.\n  This is by no means a comprehensive recitation of the 8 titles and 38 \nprovisions that are in this omnibus legislation. However, I hope it \ngives our colleagues an overview of the types of benefits that \nservicemembers and veterans stand to gain by passage of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask our colleagues to vote in favor of cloture so as to bring this \nmeasure to the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it has been commonplace for critics of the \nwar in Iraq to minimize, if not actually dismiss entirely, the links \nbetween Saddam Hussein and terrorists generally and al-Qaida \nspecifically. This is part of a systematic effort by some, especially \nnow that there are irrefutable signs of progress from the military\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\nsurge in Iraq, to change the narrative on the war. Instead of debating \nthe way forward, they prefer instead to relitigate the past. In fact, \nearlier this month the distinguished majority leader stated:\n\n       Prior to the invasion of Iraq, there was not a terrorist in \n     Iraq. And now, of course, there are lots of them.\n\n  It is true that there are a lot of terrorists in Iraq which, of \ncourse, is the reason why we are still there fighting them and need to \nstay there until they are defeated. But it is not true that there were \nno terrorists in Iraq prior to our invasion. In fact, Saddam's ties to \nterrorists are well known and were confirmed yet again in a recent \nreport commissioned by the Pentagon's Joint Forces Command. This report \nfound that Saddam Hussein actively supported and financed terrorist \nactivities during the years he controlled Iraq. The report, entitled \n``Iraqi Perspectives Project: Saddam and Terrorism: Emerging Insights \nfrom Captured Iraqi Documents,'' was released on March 13. It was the \nproduct of the analysis of over 600,000 documents captured in Iraq \nsince 2003. It concluded that Saddam's security forces and Osama bin \nLaden's terrorist network ``operated with similar aims (at least in the \nshort term).''\n  According to the report:\n\n       Though the execution of Iraqi terror plots was not always \n     successful, evidence shows that Saddam's use of terrorist \n     tactics and his support for terrorist groups remained strong \n     up until the collapse of his regime.\n\n  The report found that Saddam Hussein worked with several different \nterrorist groups, including groups with direct ties to al-Qaida. Many \nwere engaged in a jihad against the United States and its allies. It \nwasn't necessary to read with excruciating detail the entire 1,600-page \nreport to find proof of these links; all of the above was available for \nall to see in the brief abstract that accompanied the report.\n  Stephen Hayes offers extensive analysis of the entire report by the \nJoint Forces Command in the Weekly Standard magazine on March 24, 2008.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have his article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Weekly Standard, Mar. 24, 2008]\n\n  Saddam's Dangerous Friends: What a Pentagon Review of 600,000 Iraqi \n                           Documents Tells us\n\n                         (By Stephen F. Hayes)\n\n       This ought to be big news. Throughout the early and mid-\n     1990s, Saddam Hussein actively supported an influential \n     terrorist group headed by the man who is now al Qaeda's \n     second-in-command, according to an exhaustive study issued \n     last week by the Pentagon. ``Saddam supported groups that \n     either associated directly with al Qaeda (such as the \n     Egyptian Islamic Jihad, led at one time by bin Laden's \n     deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri) or that generally shared al \n     Qaeda's stated goals and objectives.'' According to the \n     Pentagon study, Egyptian Islamic Jihad was one of many \n     jihadist groups that Iraq's former dictator funded, trained, \n     equipped, and armed.\n       The study was commissioned by the Joint Forces Command in \n     Norfolk, Virginia, and produced by analysts at the Institute \n     for Defense Analyses, a federally funded military think tank. \n     It is entitled ``Iraqi Perspectives Project: Saddam and \n     Terrorism: Emerging Insights from Captured Iraqi Documents.'' \n     The study is based on a review of some 600,000 documents \n     captured in postwar Iraq. Those ``documents'' include \n     letters, memos, computer files, audiotapes, and videotapes \n     produced by Saddam Hussein's regime, especially his \n     intelligence services. The analysis section of the study \n     covers 59 pages. The appendices, which include copies of some \n     of the captured documents and translations, put the entire \n     study at approximately 1,600 pages.\n       An abstract that describes the study reads, in part:\n       Because Saddam's security organizations and Osama bin \n     Laden's terrorist network operated with similar aims (at \n     least in the short term), considerable overlap was inevitable \n     when monitoring, contacting, financing, and training the same \n     outside groups. This created both the appearance of and, in \n     some way, a `de facto' link between the organizations. At \n     times, these organizations would work together in pursuit of \n     shared goals but still maintain their autonomy and \n     independence because of innate caution and mutual distrust. \n     Though the execution of Iraqi terror plots was not always \n     successful, evidence shows that Saddam's use of terrorist \n     tactics and his support for terrorist groups remained strong \n     up until the collapse of the regime.''\n       Among the study's other notable findings:\n       In 1993, as Osama bin Laden's fighters battled Americans in \n     Somalia, Saddam Hussein personally ordered the formation of \n     an Iraqi terrorist group to join the battle there.\n       For more than two decades, the Iraqi regime trained non-\n     Iraqi jihadists in training camps throughout Iraq.\n       According to a 1993 internal Iraqi intelligence memo, the \n     regime was supporting a secret Islamic Palestinian \n     organization dedicated to ``armed jihad against the Americans \n     and Western interests.''\n       In the 1990s, Iraq's military intelligence directorate \n     trained and equipped ``Sudanese fighters.''\n       In 1998, the Iraqi regime offered ``financial and moral \n     support'' to a new group of jihadists in Kurdish-controlled \n     northern Iraq.\n       In 2002, the year before the war began, the Iraqi regime \n     hosted in Iraq a series of 13 conferences for non-Iraqi \n     jihadist groups.\n       That same year, a branch of the Iraqi Intelligence Service \n     (IIS) issued hundreds of Iraqi passports for known \n     terrorists.\n       There is much, much more. Documents reveal that the regime \n     stockpiled bombmaking materials in Iraqi embassies around the \n     world and targeted Western journalists for assassination. In \n     July 2001, an Iraqi Intelligence agent described an al Qaeda \n     affiliate in Bahrain, the Army of Muhammad, as ``under the \n     wings of bin Laden.'' Although the organization ``is an \n     offshoot of bin Laden,'' the fact that it has a different \n     name ``can be a way of camouflaging the organization.'' The \n     agent is told to deal with the al Qaeda group according to \n     ``priorities previously established.''\n       In describing the relations between the Army of Muhammad \n     and the Iraqi regime, the authors of the Pentagon study come \n     to this conclusion: ``Captured documents reveal that the \n     regime was willing to co-opt or support organizations it knew \n     to be part of al Qaeda--as long as that organization's near-\n     term goals supported Saddam's long-term vision.''\n       As I said, this ought to be big news. And, in a way, it \n     was. A headline in the New York Times, a cursory item in the \n     Washington Post, and stories on NPR and ABC News reported \n     that the study showed no links between al Qaeda and Saddam \n     Hussein.\n       How can a study offering an unprecedented look into the \n     closed regime of a brutal dictator, with over 1,600 pages of \n     ``strong evidence that links the regime of Saddam Hussein to \n     regional and global terrorism,'' in the words of its authors, \n     receive a wave-of-the-hand dismissal from America's most \n     prestigious news outlets? All it took was a leak to a \n     gullible reporter, one misleading line in the study's \n     executive summary, a boneheaded Pentagon press office, an \n     incompetent White House, and widespread journalistic \n     negligence.\n       On Monday, March 10, 2008, Warren P. Strobel, a reporter \n     from the McClatchy News Service first reported that the new \n     Pentagon study was coming. ``An exhaustive review of more \n     than 600,000 Iraqi documents that were captured after the \n     2003 U.S. invasion has found no evidence that Saddam \n     Hussein's regime had any operational links with Osama bin \n     Laden's al Qaida terrorist network.'' McClatchy is a \n     newspaper chain that serves many of America's largest cities. \n     The national security reporters in its Washington bureau have \n     earned a reputation as reliable outlets for anti-Bush \n     administration spin on intelligence. Strobel quoted a ``U.S. \n     official familiar with the report'' who told him that the \n     search of Iraqi documents yielded no evidence of a ``direct \n     operational link'' between Iraq and al Qaeda. Strobel used \n     the rest of the article to attempt to demonstrate that this \n     undermined the Bush administration's prewar claims with \n     regard to Iraq and terrorism.\n       With the study not scheduled for release for two more days, \n     this article shaped subsequent coverage, which was no doubt \n     the leaker's purpose. Stories from other media outlets \n     tracked McClatchy very closely but began to incorporate a \n     highly misleading phrase taken from the executive summary: \n     ``This study found no `smoking gun' (i.e. direct connection) \n     between Saddam's Iraq and al Qaeda.'' This is how the \n     Washington Post wrote it up:\n       An examination of more than 600,000 Iraqi documents, audio \n     and video records collected by U.S. forces since the March \n     2003 invasion has concluded that there is `no smoking gun' \n     supporting the Bush administration's prewar assertion of an \n     `operational relationship' between Saddam Hussein and the al-\n     Qaeda terrorist network, sources familiar with the study \n     said.''\n       Much of the confusion might have been avoided if the Bush \n     administration had done anything to promote the study. An \n     early version of the Pentagon study was provided to National \n     Security Adviser Steve Hadley more than a year ago, before \n     November 2006. In recent weeks, as the Pentagon handled the \n     rollout of the study, Hadley was tasked with briefing \n     President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. It's unclear \n     whether he shared the study with President Bush, and NSC \n     officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \n     But sources close to Cheney say the vice president was \n     blindsided.\n       After the erroneous report from McClatchy, two officials \n     involved with the study became very concerned about the \n     misreporting of its contents. One of them said in an \n     interview that he found the media coverage of the study \n     ``disappointing.'' Another, James Lacey, expressed his \n     concern in an email to Karen Finn in the Pentagon press \n     office, who was handling the rollout of the study. On \n     Tuesday, the day before it was scheduled for release, Lacey \n     wrote: ``1. The story has been leaked. 2. ABC News is doing a \n     story based on the executive summary tonight. 3. The \n     Washington Post is doing a\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\n     story based on rumors they heard from ABC News. The document \n     is being misrepresented. I recommend we put [it] out and on a \n     website immediately.''\n       Finn declined, saying that members of Congress had not been \n     told the study was coming. ``Despite the leak, there are \n     Congressional notifications and then an official public \n     release. This should not be posted on the web until these \n     actions are complete.''\n       Still under the misimpression that the Pentagon study \n     undermined the case for war, McClatchy's Warren Strobel saw \n     this bureaucratic infighting as a conspiracy to suppress the \n     study:\n       The Pentagon on Wednesday canceled plans for broad public \n     release of a study that found no pre-Iraq war link between \n     late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the al Qaida \n     terrorist network. . . . The reversal highlighted the \n     politically sensitive nature of its conclusions, which were \n     first reported Monday by McClatchy.\n       In making their case for invading Iraq in 2002 and 2003, \n     President Bush and his top national security aides claimed \n     that Saddam's regime had ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaida \n     terrorist network.\n       But the study, based on more than 600,000 captured \n     documents, including audio and video files, found that while \n     Saddam sponsored terrorism, particularly against opponents of \n     his regime and against Israel, there was no evidence of an al \n     Qaida link.\n       An examination of the rest of the study makes the White \n     House decision to ignore the Pentagon study even more \n     curious. The first section explores ``Terror as an Instrument \n     of State Power'' and describes documents detailing Fedayeen \n     Saddam terrorist training camps in Iraq. Graduates of the \n     terror training camps would be dispatched to sensitive sites \n     to carry out their assassinations and bombings. In May 1999, \n     the regime plotted an operation code named ``Blessed July'' \n     in which the top graduates of the terrorist training courses \n     would be sent to London, Iran, and Kurdistan to conduct \n     assassinations and bombings.\n       A separate set of documents presents, according to the \n     Pentagon study, ``evidence of logistical preparation for \n     terrorist operations in other nations, including those in the \n     West.'' In one letter, a director of the Iraqi Intelligence \n     Service (IIS) responds to a request from Saddam for an \n     inventory of weapons stockpiled in Iraqi embassies throughout \n     the world. The terrorist tools include missile launchers and \n     missiles, ``American missile launchers,'' explosive \n     materials, TNT, plastic explosive charges, Kalashnikov \n     rifles, and ``booby-trapped suitcases.''\n       The July 2002 Iraqi memo describes how these weapons were \n     distributed to the operatives in embassies.\n       Between the year 2000 and 2002 explosive materials were \n     transported to embassies outside Iraq for special work, upon \n     the approval of the Director of the Iraqi Intelligence \n     Service. The responsibility for these materials is in the \n     hands of heads of stations. Some of these materials were \n     transported in the political mail carriers [Diplomatic \n     Pouch]. Some of these materials were transported by car in \n     booby-trapped briefcases.\n       Saddam also recruited non-Iraqi jihadists to serve as \n     suicide bombers on behalf of the Iraqi regime. According to \n     the study, captured documents ``indicate that as early as \n     January 1998, the scheduling of suicide volunteers was \n     routine enough to warrant not only a national-level policy \n     letter but a formal schedule--during summer vacation--\n     built around maximizing availability of Arab citizens in \n     Iraq on Saddam-funded scholarships.''\n       The second section of the Pentagon study concerns ``State \n     Relationships with Terrorist Groups.'' An IIS document dated \n     March 18, 1993, lists nine terrorist ``organizations that our \n     agency [IIS] cooperates with and have relations with various \n     elements in many parts of the Arab world and who also have \n     the expertise to carry out assignments'' on behalf of the \n     regime. Several well-known Palestinian terrorist \n     organizations make the list, including Abu Nidal's Fatah-\n     Revolutionary Council and Abu Abbas's Palestinian Liberation \n     Front. Another group, the secret ``Renewal and Jihad \n     Organization'' is described this way in the Iraqi memo:\n       It believes in armed jihad against the Americans and \n     Western interests. They also believe our leader [Saddam \n     Hussein], may God protect him, is the true leader in the war \n     against the infidels. The organization's leaders live in \n     Jordan when they visited Iraq two months ago they \n     demonstrated a willingness to carry out operations against \n     American interests at any time.''\n       Other groups listed in the Iraqi memo include the ``Islamic \n     Scholars Group'' and the ``Pakistan Scholars Group.''\n       There are two terrorist organizations on the Iraqi \n     Intelligence list that deserve special consideration: the \n     Afghani Islamic Party of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and the Egyptian \n     Islamic Jihad of Ayman al Zawahiri.\n       This IIS document provides this description of the Afghani \n     Islamic Party:\n       It was founded in 1974 when its leader [Gulbuddin \n     Hekmatyar] escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan. It is \n     considered one of the extreme political religious movements \n     against the West, and one of the strongest Sunni parties in \n     Afghanistan. The organization relies on financial support \n     from Iraq and we have had good relations with Hikmatyar since \n     1989.\n       In his book Holy War, Inc., Peter Bergen, a terrorism \n     analyst who has long been skeptical of Iraq-al Qaeda \n     connections, describes Hekmatyar as Osama bin Laden's ``alter \n     ego.'' Bergen writes: ``Bin Laden and Hekmatyar worked \n     closely together. During the early 1990s al-Qaeda's training \n     camps in the Khost region of eastern Afghanistan were \n     situated in an area controlled by Hekmatyar's party.''\n       It's worth dwelling for a moment on that set of facts. An \n     internal Iraqi Intelligence document reports that Iraqis have \n     ``good relations'' with Hekmatyar and that his organization \n     ``relies on financial support from Iraq.'' At precisely the \n     same time, Hekmatyar ``worked closely'' with Osama bin Laden \n     and his Afghani Islamic Party hosted ``al Qaeda's terrorist \n     training camps'' in eastern Afghanistan.\n       The IIS document also reveals that Saddam was funding \n     another close ally of bin Laden, the EIJ organization of \n     Ayman al Zawahiri.\n       In a meeting in the Sudan we agreed to renew our relations \n     with the Islamic Jihad Organization in Egypt. Our information \n     on the group is as follows:\n       It was established in 1979.\n       Its goal is to apply the Islamic shari'a law and establish \n     Islamic rule.\n       It is considered one of the most brutal Egyptian \n     organizations. It carried out numerous successful operations, \n     including the assassination of [Egyptian President Anwar] \n     Sadat.\n       We have previously met with the organization's \n     representative and we agreed on a plan to carry out commando \n     operations against the Egyptian regime.\n       Zawahiri arrived in Afghanistan in the mid-1980s, and \n     ``from the start he concentrated his efforts on getting close \n     to bin Laden,'' according to Lawrence Wright, in The Looming \n     Tower. The leaders of EIJ quickly became leaders of bin \n     Laden's organizations. ``He soon succeeded in placing trusted \n     members of Islamic Jihad in key positions around bin Laden,'' \n     Wright reported in the definitive profile of Zawahiri, \n     published in the New Yorker in September 2002. ``According to \n     the Islamist attorney Montasser al-Zayat, 'Zawahiri \n     completely controlled bin Laden. The largest share of bin \n     Laden's financial support went to Zawahiri and the Jihad \n     organization.''\n       Later, Wright describes the founding of al Qaeda.\n       Toward the end of 1989, a meeting took place in the Afghan \n     town of Khost at a mujahideen camp. A Sudanese fighter named \n     Jamal al-Fadl was among the participants, and he later \n     testified about the event in a New York courtroom during one \n     of the trials connected with the 1998 bombing of the American \n     embassies in East Africa. According to Fadl, the meeting was \n     attended by ten men--four or five of them Egyptians, \n     including Zawahiri. Fadl told the court that the chairman of \n     the meeting, an Iraqi known as Abu Ayoub, proposed the \n     formation of a new organization that would wage jihad beyond \n     the borders of Afghanistan. There was some dispute about the \n     name, but ultimately the new organization came to be called \n     Al Qaeda--the Base. The alliance was conceived as a loose \n     affiliation among individual mujahideen and established \n     groups, and was dominated by Egyptian Islamic Jihad. The \n     ultimate boss, however, was Osama bin Laden, who held the \n     checkbook.\n       Once again, it's worth dwelling on these facts for a \n     moment. In 1989, Ayman al Zawahiri attended the founding \n     meeting of al Qaeda. He was literally present at the \n     creation, and his EIJ ``dominated'' the new organization \n     headed by Osama bin Laden.\n       In the early 1990s, Zawahiri and bin Laden moved their \n     operations to Sudan. After a fundraising trip to the United \n     States in the spring of 1993, Zawahiri returned to Sudan \n     where, again according to Wright, he ``began working more \n     closely with bin Laden, and most of the Egyptian members of \n     Islamic Jihad went on the Al Qaeda payroll.'' Although some \n     members of EIJ were skeptical of bin Laden and his global \n     aspirations, Zawahiri sought a de facto merger with al \n     Qaeda. One of his top assistants would later say Zawahiri \n     had told him that ``joining with bin Laden [was] the only \n     solution to keeping the Jihad organization alive.''\n       Again, at precisely the same time Zawahiri was ``joining \n     with bin Laden,'' the spring of 1993, he was being funded by \n     Saddam Hussein's Iraq. As Zawahiri's jihadists trained in al \n     Qaeda camps in Sudan, his representative to Iraq was planning \n     ``commando operations'' against the Egyptian government with \n     the IIS.\n       Another captured Iraqi document from early 1993 ``reports \n     on contact with a large number of terrorist groups in the \n     region, including those that maintained an office or liaison \n     in Iraq.'' In the same folder is a memo from Saddam Hussein \n     to a member of his Revolutionary Council ordering the \n     formation of ``a group to start hunting Americans present on \n     Arab soil, especially Somalia.'' A second memo to the \n     director of the IIS, instructs him to revise the plan for \n     ``operations inside Somalia.''\n       More recently, captured ``annual reports'' of the IIS \n     reveal support for terrorist organizations in the months \n     leading up the U.S. invasion in March 2003. According to the \n     Pentagon study, ``the IIS hosted thirteen conferences in 2002 \n     for a number of Palestinian and other organizations, \n     including delegations from the Islamic Jihad Movement and the \n     Director General for the Popular Movement for the Liberation \n     of al-Ahwaz.'' The same annual report ``also notes that among \n     the 699 passports, renewals and other official\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\n     documentation that the IIS issued, many were issued to known \n     members of terrorist organizations.''\n       The Pentagon study goes on to describe captured documents \n     that instruct the IIS to maintain contact with all manner of \n     Arab movement and others that ``reveal that later IIS \n     activities went beyond just maintaining contact.'' Throughout \n     the 1990s, the Iraqi regime's General Military Intelligence \n     Directorate ``was training Sudanese fighters inside Iraq.''\n       The second section of the Pentagon study also discusses \n     captured documents related to the Islamic Resistance \n     organization in Kurdistan from 1998 and 1999. The documents \n     show that the Iraqi regime provided ``financial and moral \n     support'' to members of the group, which would later become \n     part of the al Qaeda affiliate in the region, Ansar al Islam.\n       The third section of the Pentagon study is called ``Iraq \n     and Terrorism: Three Cases.'' One of the cases is that of the \n     Army of Muhammad, the al Qaeda affiliate in Bahrain. A series \n     of memoranda order an Iraqi Intelligence operative in Bahrain \n     to explore a relationship with its leaders. On July 9, 2001, \n     the agent reports back: ``Information available to us is that \n     the group is under the wings of bin Laden. They receive their \n     directions from Yemen. Their objectives are the same as bin \n     Laden.'' Later, he lists the organization's objectives.\n       Jihad in the name of God.\n       Striking the embassies and other Jewish and American \n     interests anywhere in the world.\n       Attacking the American and British military bases in the \n     Arab land.\n       Striking American embassies and interests unless the \n     Americans pull out their forces from the Arab lands and \n     discontinue their support for Israel.\n       Disrupting oil exports [to] the Americans from Arab \n     countries and threatening tankers carrying oil to them.\n       A separate memo reveals that the Army of Muhammad has \n     requested assistance from Iraq. The study authors summarize \n     the response by writing, ``the local IIS station has been \n     told to deal with them in accordance with priorities \n     previously established. The IIS agent goes on to inform the \n     Director that this organization is an offshoot of bin Laden, \n     but that their objectives are similar but with different \n     names that can be a way of camouflaging the organization.''\n       We never learn what those ``previous priorities'' were and \n     thus what, if anything, came of these talks. But it is \n     instructive that the operative in Bahrain understood the \n     importance of disguising relations with al Qaeda and that the \n     director of IIS, knowing that the group was affiliated with \n     bin Laden and sought to attack Americans, seemed more \n     interested in continuing the relationship than in ending it.\n       The fourth and final section of the Pentagon study is \n     called ``The Business of Terror.'' The authors write: ``An \n     example of indirect cooperation is the movement led by Osama \n     bin Laden. During the 1990s, both Saddam and bin Laden wanted \n     the West, particularly the United States, out of Muslim lands \n     (or in the view of Saddam, the ``Arab nation''). . . . In \n     pursuit of their own separate but surprisingly `parallel' \n     visions, Saddam and bin Laden often found a common enemy in \n     the United States.''\n       They further note that Saddam's security organizations and \n     bin Laden's network were recruiting within the same \n     demographic, spouting much of the same rhetoric, and \n     promoting a common historical narrative that promised a \n     return to a glorious past. That these movements (pan-Arab and \n     pan-Islamic) had many similarities and strategic parallels \n     does not mean they saw themselves in that light. \n     Nevertheless, these similarities created more than just the \n     appearance of cooperation. Common interests, even without \n     common cause, increased the aggregate terror threat.\n       As much as we have learned from this impressive collection \n     of documents, it is only a fraction of what we will know in \n     10, 20, or 50 years. The authors themselves acknowledge the \n     limits of their work.\n       In fact, there are several captured Iraqi documents that \n     have been authenticated by the U.S. government that were not \n     included in the study but add to the picture it sketches. One \n     document, authenticated by the Defense Intelligence Agency \n     and first reported on 60 Minutes, is dated March 28, 1992. It \n     describes Osama bin Laden as an Iraqi intelligence asset \n     ``in good contact'' with the IIS station in Syria.\n       Another Iraqi document, this one from the mid-1990s, was \n     first reported in the New York Times on June 25, 2004. \n     Authenticated by a Pentagon and intelligence working group, \n     the document was titled ``Iraqi Effort to Cooperate with \n     Saudi Opposition Groups and Individuals.'' The working group \n     concluded that it ``corroborates and expands on previous \n     reporting'' on contacts between Iraq and al Qaeda. It \n     revealed that a Sudanese government official met with Uday \n     Hussein and the director of the IIS in 1994 and reported that \n     bin Laden was willing to meet in Sudan. Bin Laden, according \n     to the Iraqi document, was then ``approached by our side'' \n     after ``presidential approval'' for the liaison was given. \n     The former head of Iraqi Intelligence Directorate 4 met with \n     bin Laden on February 19, 1995. The document further states \n     that bin Laden ``had some reservations about being labeled an \n     Iraqi operative''--a comment that suggests the possibility \n     had been discussed.\n       Bin Laden requested that Iraq's state-run television \n     network broadcast anti-Saudi propaganda, and the document \n     indicates that the Iraqis agreed to do this. The al Qaeda \n     leader also proposed ``joint operations against foreign \n     forces'' in Saudi Arabia. There is no Iraqi response provided \n     in the documents. When bin Laden left Sudan for Afghanistan \n     in May 1996, the Iraqis sought ``other channels through which \n     to handle the relationship, in light of his current \n     location.'' The IIS memo directs that ``cooperation between \n     the two organizations should be allowed to develop freely \n     through discussion and agreement.''\n       In another instance, the new Pentagon study makes reference \n     to captured documents detailing the Iraqi relationship with \n     Abu Sayyaf, the al Qaeda affiliate in the Philippines founded \n     by Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law. But the Pentagon study \n     does not mention the most significant element of those \n     documents, first reported in these pages. In a memo from \n     Ambassador Salah Samarmad to the Secondary Policy Directorate \n     of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, we learn that the Iraqi regime \n     had been funding and equipping Abu Sayyaf, which had been \n     responsible for a series of high-profile kidnappings. The \n     Iraqi operative informs Baghdad that such support had been \n     suspended. ``The kidnappers were formerly (from the previous \n     year) receiving money and purchasing combat weapons. From now \n     on we (IIS) are not giving them this opportunity and are not \n     on speaking terms with them.'' That support would resume soon \n     enough, and shortly before the war a high-ranking Iraqi \n     diplomat named Hisham Hussein would be expelled from the \n     Philippines after his cell phone number appeared on an Abu \n     Sayyaf cell phone used to detonate a bomb.\n       What's happening here is obvious. Military historians and \n     terrorism analysts are engaged in a good faith effort to \n     review the captured documents from the Iraqi regime and \n     provide a dispassionate, fact-based examination of Saddam \n     Hussein's long support of jihadist terrorism. Most reporters \n     don't care. They are trapped in a world where the Bush \n     administration lied to the country about an Iraq-al Qaeda \n     connection, and no amount of evidence to the contrary--not \n     even the words of the fallen Iraqi regime itself--can \n     convince them to reexamine their mistaken assumptions.\n       Bush administration officials, meanwhile, tell us that the \n     Iraq war is the central front in the war on terror and that \n     American national security depends on winning there. And yet \n     they are too busy or too tired or too lazy to correct these \n     fundamental misperceptions about the case for war, the most \n     important decision of the Bush presidency.\n       What good is the truth if nobody knows it?\n\n  Mr. KYL. The Joint Forces Command report sheds light on the \nrelationship between Saddam Hussein and Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin \nLaden's second in command.\n  I quote:\n\n       Saddam supported groups either associated directly with al \n     Qaeda (such as the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), led at one \n     time by bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri) or that \n     generally shared al Qaeda's stated goals and objectives.\n\n  Mr. Hayes notes in his article that Zawahiri's organization was being \nfinanced by Saddam Hussein at the very time Zawahiri was working almost \nexclusively with bin Laden. In fact, Zawahiri had been working with al-\nQaida from its inception in late 1989. By 1993, Zawahiri, as the leader \nof the EIJ, sought to merge the organization with al-Qaida and, in \nfact, the two terrorist organizations eventually merged in 1998.\n  The Standard further reported that:\n\n       Captured documents revealed that the regime was willing to \n     co-opt support organizations it knew to be part of al Qaeda \n     as long as that organization's near-term goals supported \n     Saddam's long-term vision.\n\n  The more than 600,000 documents likely revealed only a fraction of \nwhat we will ultimately know of the true relationship between bin \nLaden, the global jihad, and Saddam Hussein. Given this information, it \nis a surprise that many in the mainstream media have concluded only \nthat there was no smoking gun linking al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein, thus \nfailing to report the key findings in the report to the American \npeople.\n  I am not one who supports relitigating why it was necessary for the \nUnited States to remove Saddam Hussein from power. But for those who \nfind themselves stuck in the past, the Iraqi Perspective Project \nprovides yet another substantial body of evidence, adding to that which \nwas before the Congress when we authorized the Iraq mission. I want to \nrefer to one item in that body of evidence, a letter, dated October 7, \n2002, from CIA Director George Tenet to the Honorable Bob Graham, then \nchairman of the Select Committee on intelligence. Among the things he \nwrites in this letter, these are the items that were available to us\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\nbefore we authorized the invasion of Iraq. He refers to a question by \nSenator Bayh about Iraqi links to al-Qaida. He says Senators could draw \nthe following points from unclassified documents. There was, of course, \nmuch more that was classified. I will quote this brief portion of his \nletter:\n\n       Our understanding of relationship between Iraq and al-\n     Qa'ida is evolving and is based on sources of varying \n     reliability. Some of the information we have received comes \n     from detainees, including some of high rank.\n       We have solid reporting of senior level contacts between \n     Iraq and al-Qa'ida going back a decade.\n       Credible information indicates that Iraq and al-Qa'ida have \n     discussed safe haven and reciprocal non-aggression.\n       Since Operation Enduring Freedom, we have solid evidence of \n     the presence in Iraq of al-Qa'ida members, including some \n     that have been in Baghdad.\n       We have credible reporting that al-Qa'ida leaders sought \n     contacts in Iraq who could help them acquire WMD \n     capabilities. The reporting also stated that Iraq has \n     provided training to al-Qa'ida members in the areas of \n     poisons and gases and making conventional bombs.\n       Iraq's increasing support to extremist Palestinians, \n     coupled with growing indications of a relationship with al-\n     Qa'ida, suggest that Baghdad's links to terrorists will \n     increase, even absent US military action.\n\n  I commend the Joint Forces Command for its ongoing, exhaustive review \nof this record of intelligence collected in Iraq. I urge all colleagues \nto take the time to educate themselves on its findings. I urge the \nadministration to undertake a serious effort to correct the \nmisimpressions formed in recent years about this important issue.\n  There can be no doubt. Saddam Hussein was a threat. He actively \nsupported terrorists both in and outside of Iraq, and the world is a \nsafer place for him having been removed from power.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/21/senate-section/article/S3185-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3185-S3186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, tomorrow is Equal Pay Day. What is Equal \nPay Day? That is the day that symbolizes how far into the year a woman \nmust work from the previous year on average to earn as much as a man \nearned by December 31 of last year. It is unbelievable to me that more \nthan four decades after passage of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil \nRights Act, women are still making only 77 cents on the dollar to what \na man makes. In Iowa, it is even worse. The Iowa Workforce Development \nAgency found that across all industries, women in my State make less \nthan 62 percent of what men make.\n  Discrimination takes many forms. Sometimes it is brazen and in your \nface, like Jim Crow and apartheid. Sometimes discrimination is silent \nand insidious. That is what is happening in workplaces across America \ntoday. Millions of female-dominated jobs--social workers, teachers, \nchildcare workers, nurses, so many more--are equivalent to male-\ndominated jobs, but they pay dramatically less. The Census Bureau has \ncompiled data on hundreds of job categories, but it found only five job \ncategories where women typically earn as much as a man. Defenders of \nthis status quo offer all manner of bogus explanations on why women \nmake less. How many times have you heard the fairy tale that women work \nfor fulfillment and men work to support their families? Of course, this \nignores the great majority of single women who work to support \nthemselves and married women whose paycheck is all that allows their \nfamilies to make ends meet, to put a little bit of money away for a \nrainy day or perhaps to send a child to college.\n  It ignores the harsh reality that so many women face in the workplace \nwhere they have to work twice as hard to be taken seriously or, say, \nget pushed into being a cashier when they had applied for a better \npaying sales job. These pervasive acts of discrimination deny women \nfair pay and they also deny women basic dignity.\n  Let me cite one example of the discrimination I am talking about. \nLast year in a hearing in our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, we heard remarkable testimony from Dr. Philip Cohen of the \nUniversity of North Carolina. Dr. Cohen compared nurses' aides, who are \noverwhelmingly women, and truck drivers who are overwhelmingly men. In \nboth groups, the average age is 43. Both require ``medium'' amounts of \nstrength. Nurses' aides on average have more education and training. \nBut nurses' aides make less than 60 percent of what truck drivers make.\n  Given that this discrimination is so obvious and pervasive, you would \nexpect that women would have no trouble at all obtaining simple justice \nin our court system. But in a major decision last June, in the case of \nLedbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, the Supreme Court actually \ntook us backward. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the Court made it extremely \ndifficult for women to go to court to pursue claims of pay \ndiscrimination, even in cases where the discrimination is flagrant.\n  A jury acknowledged that Lilly Ledbetter, a former supervisor at \nGoodyear, had been paid $6,000 less than her lowest paid male \ncounterpart. But the Supreme Court rejected her discrimination claim. \nWhy? The Court held that women workers must file a discrimination claim \nwithin 180 days of their pay being set, even if they were not aware at \nthe time that their pay was significantly lower than their male \ncounterparts.\n  Justice Ginsburg said, in a forceful dissent, this is totally out of \ntouch with the real world of the workplace. In the real world, pay \nscales are often kept secret and employees are in the dark about their \ncoworkers' salaries. Lacking such information, it is difficult to \ndetermine when pay discrimination begins. Furthermore, vast \ndiscrepancies are often a function of time. If your original pay was a \nlittle bit lower than your colleague's pay, and then over 20 years you \nget smaller raises every year, you end up with a huge gap after 20 \nyears. But if you can only sue for the most recent pay determination, \nthis misses 20 years of discrimination. As a result, in Ms. Ledbetter's \ncase, she is going to get a dramatically smaller pension for the rest \nof her life based upon that lower pay level.\n  Ms. Ledbetter, who testified before our committee last year, is \ninjured twice: Over 20 years of flagrant discrimination in the \nworkplace and getting paid less, and now for the remainder of her life, \nas a retired person, she will get less pension because of that \ndiscrimination. Twice she is injured.\n  What the Ledbetter decision means is that once the 180-day window for \nbringing a lawsuit is passed, the discrimination gets grandfathered in. \nThis creates a free harbor for employers who have paid female workers \nless than men over a long period of time. Basically it gives the worst \noffenders a free pass to continue their gender discrimination.\n  Ledbetter was a bad decision, but there is one thing we can do with \nSupreme Court decisions. We can pass legislation to fix them. So I have \njoined with Senator Kennedy and others to reverse the damage done by \nthat decision. Our bill would establish that the ``unlawful employment \npractice'' under the Civil Rights Act is the payment of a \ndiscriminatory salary, not the original setting of the pay level.\n  Well, this is a good start, but it is not enough. It is not good \nenough to go back to the way the law worked last year because women, as \nI said, are still making less than 77 cents on the dollar as compared \nto men. That is intolerable. Moreover, if pay scales are still kept \nsecret, if there is not transparency, how can women know if they are \nbeing discriminated against?\n  That is why we need to pass my Fair Pay Act, a bill which I have \nintroduced in every Congress going back to 1996. I just keep \nintroducing it every Congress. Here is what it does. It is very simple. \nIn addition to requiring that employers provide equal pay for \nequivalent jobs, my bill would require disclosure of pay scales and \nrates for all job categories in a given company. Now, I did not say \nthey had to disclose every single person's pay, I said pay scales for \ncategories of jobs. Now, this would give women the information they \nneed to identify discriminatory pay practices, and this could reduce \nthe need for costly litigation in the first place.\n  When Lilly Ledbetter testified before our committee last year, I \nasked her--I told her about the bill; I told her what kind of \ninformation it would provide--I asked her if she had that information, \ncould she have, 20 years ago, negotiated for better pay and avoided \nlitigation? She answered: Of course.\n  Well, there are countless more Lilly Ledbetters out there who are \npaid less\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\nthan their male coworkers, but they will never know about it unless we \nget them this information.\n  My Fair Pay Act amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex, \nrace, or national origin. Most importantly, it requires each individual \nemployer to provide equal pay for jobs that are comparable in skill, \neffort, responsibility, and working conditions--skill, effort, \nresponsibility, and working conditions.\n  Now, you might say: Haven't we already passed the Equal Pay Act? Yes, \nbut the Equal Pay Act only says you have to be paid the same if you are \ndoing exactly the same job. Well, what about if you are doing a job \nlike a nurse's aide, in which you require medium strength, in which you \nrequire training, and you compare it to what a truckdriver does? Why \nshould a truckdriver get 60 percent more than someone who is taking \ncare of you when you are ill or your mother or your grandmother or \ngrandparents in assisted living or in a nursing home or in hospice care \nor a number of other things where nurses' aides are vitally important?\n  You might say: Well, has this ever been done? The fact is, 20 \nStates--20 State governments--right now have fair pay laws and policies \nin place for their employees, including my State of Iowa. I point out \nthat Iowa had a Republican legislature and Republican Governor in 1985 \nwhen this bill was passed into law. So ending wage discrimination \nagainst women should not be a partisan issue.\n  I am just saying let's take what 20 State governments have done and \nlet's extend it to the private sector. Well, some would say we do not \nneed any more laws; market forces will take care of the wage gap. Well, \nmaybe so, but we all know from basic economics 101 that for a free \nmarket to work there has to be not only a number of players where they \nhave equivalent purchasing power--not an employer-employee situation--\nsecondly, what else is most important for a market to work? \nTransparency, knowledge, knowing what the game is, openness. But when \npay scales are kept secret and you do not know what they are, how can \nmarket forces ever, ever close this wage gap?\n  Experience also shows there are some injustices market forces cannot \nrectify. That is why we passed the Equal Pay Act, the Civil Rights \nActs, the Family Medical Leave Act, and here, in 1990, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. Market forces did not break down the barriers of \ndiscrimination against people with disabilities in our country. But \nthat is what we did with the Americans with Disabilities Act. We broke \nthe barriers down and let people with disabilities not only get \neducated, not only travel--go out to restaurants and things--but also \nget jobs in which we can look not at their disabilities but at their \nabilities.\n  Mr. President, I would like to close with a story of a woman from my \nState named Angie. She was employed as a field office manager at a temp \nfirm. The employees there were not allowed to talk about pay with their \ncoworkers. Only inadvertently did she discover that a male office \nmanager at a similar branch, who had less education and less \nexperience, was earning more than she was. In this case, the story did \nend happily. She cited this information in negotiations with her \nemployer, and she was able to get a raise.\n  But I think there is a twofold lesson in this story. The first lesson \nis that if we give women information about what their male colleagues \nare getting, they can negotiate a better deal for themselves in the \nworkplace. The second lesson is that pay discrimination is a harsh \nreality in the workplace. It is not only unfair, but it is demeaning, \nit is demoralizing, and it is pervasive--pervasive--throughout our \nsociety. Individual women should not have to do battle in order to win \nequal pay. We need more inclusive national laws to make equal pay for \nequal work--equal pay for equivalent work--a basic standard and a legal \nright in the American workplace.\n  So it is time, after all these years, to pass the Fair Pay Act. Do \nnot confuse it with the Paycheck Protection Act. I am also a cosponsor \nof the Paycheck Protection Act. That legislation will improve the \nenforcement of the laws we already have on the books. But we already \nknow those laws are not sufficient, as the Ledbetter case shows us. So \nin order to really open the marketplace for women to earn what they \nshould be earning and to make the equivalent of what their male \ncounterparts are making, we need to pass the Fair Pay Act.\n  Tomorrow, when we recognize Equal Pay Day--just think about it: Equal \nPay Day tomorrow, April 22. So it took women all the way from January, \nFebruary, March, and April, on average, to earn as much as a man did by \nDecember 31 of last year. That is just grossly unfair. It is also time \nto start paying women equivalent pay to what their male counterparts \nare making, when their job requires the same skill, effort, \nresponsibility, and working conditions.\n  When you take all those factors into account, there is no reason why \nwe should not pass the Fair Pay Act. Let's do for the private sector \nwhat 20 States have already done in their governments. With that, maybe \nwe will start getting some justice in the workplace for American women.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to address the \nSenate on a matter of fundamental fairness to millions of our fellow \ncitizens: to women, working women in our society, and to do it at a \ntime when we know those who are working are hard pressed in the \neconomy. We are all familiar with the anxiety among working families--\nworking fathers and working mothers. Today I will address what \nunderlies the efforts in which many of us are involved in what we call \nthe Ledbetter case.\n  It is legislation to override a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision named \nafter Lilly Ledbetter, an extraordinary woman who had worked for a tire \ncompany for a number of years and had been discriminated against in her \npay and had received judgments to make up for the damages she had \nexperienced over a period of years. The Supreme Court then undermined \nthe previous courts and effectively left her without any remedy at all, \nin effect saying unscrupulous employers could discriminate against an \nemployee, and if they do not get caught within 100 days, they are free \nand clear and they can continue to discriminate against that \nindividual.\n  That is not only against women, which is the Ledbetter case, but it \nis also true if they had done the same with regard to African Americans \nor Latino Americans or if they discriminated against the disabled or if \nthey discriminated on the basis of religion or national origin--all of \nthose cases with a simple 5-to-4 decision, the rights of those workers, \npeople who are working, working hard, are virtually out the window.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to review what this Senate has done with \nregard to what we will call the equal pay issue over a period of time. \nIt is an extraordinary record. It is a record of progress and fairness.\n  It will be amazing to me when my friends and colleagues on the other \nside rise to oppose this simple act of fairness and equity this \nsituation demands. For over 40 years, this Senate has gone on record \ntime and again saying that we will not discriminate against our fellow \ncitizens on the basis of pay. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has \nreached a different conclusion, and we will have the opportunity on \nWednesday to change that conclusion and restore the record of the \nSenate to what it has been over the last 40 years.\n  This chart shows the different laws that have been passed in Congress \nto establish equal pay for equal work. The Equal Pay Act under \nPresident Kennedy was done by a voice vote. It was pointed out at that \ntime that women were getting 60 cents on the dollar. That was wrong. We \nought to strive for equal pay for equal work. That legislation was \npassed at that time.\n  We thought we had made progress on that legislative effort, but we \nhad not made as much progress as we thought.\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\nSo in 1964, the great Civil Rights Act, known because of the public \naccommodations provisions, included in title VII a provision that \nprovided equal pay, nondiscrimination on the basis of race, religion, \nand national origin, signed by President Johnson. It passed 73 to 27.\n  Then we had the Age Discrimination in Employment Act because there \nwere many forms of discrimination in our country on the basis of \npeople's age. We wanted to free ourselves of discriminating against the \nelderly in our country, those who contributed so much to our Nation, so \nwe passed the Age Discrimination Act. There was much support for that \neffort. It was passed under the Johnson administration by voice vote.\n\n  We had the Rehabilitation Act that dealt with the disabled. Make no \nmistake about it, under the current Supreme Court holding, if you have \na disabled person who is able to perform a job as well as somebody who \ndoes not have that disability, if the employer discriminates against \nthat individual, that individual will be covered by the existing \nSupreme Court decision, and we may very well see those individuals \ndiscriminated against because they are disabled, even though they are \nable to perform the work, and they are being denied a remedy.\n  We debated those issues back with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and \nsaid we were not going to permit that.\n  Then the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 under President Reagan \nand the Americans with Disabilities Act restated those goals. Look at \nthe votes: 92 to 6 and 93 to 5.\n  All of this legislation, from early 1963 all the way to 1991, \nprovided the kinds of protections that we are including in this \nlegislation that will be before the Senate on Wednesday, called the \nLedbetter legislation, named after Lilly Ledbetter who was \ndiscriminated against.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned those pieces of legislation. Look at this \nchart. Pay discrimination hurts all kinds of American workers. In 2007, \nEEOC received more than 7,000 pay discrimination charges: on the basis \nof disability, 480 cases; on the basis of national origin, 760; on the \nbasis of age discrimination, 978; on the basis of race, 2,352; and on \nthe basis of gender, some 2,470.\n  These were individuals who were working hard but finally found out \nthey were being discriminated against--7,000 cases. So we can ask: What \nhad been the law previously when we had those kinds of situations? This \nchart reflects what the law was. The paycheck accrual rule was the law \nof the land. That meant if people discriminated against those \nindividuals and the individuals found out about it and brought a case, \nthey were able to gain damages or they were able to get remedies by the \nEEOC. This was under Republican and Democratic administrations alike. \nThat has been the law of the land, with the exception of three States. \nThat was the law of the land. That is what we want to return to, and we \nwill have the opportunity to return to it.\n  Some will say if we return to it, it will mean a lot of burdensome \nbureaucracy and expenditures on the employers. Look what CBO says. CBO \nagrees that ``the Fair Pay Restoration Act would not establish a new \ncause of action for claims of pay discrimination. . . . CBO expects \nthat the bill would not significantly affect the number of filings with \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.''\n  So this argument that it is going to make it much more cumbersome and \nmuch more troublesome and much more expensive is not true. What it will \ndo is provide protections.\n  What are we basically talking about with Lilly Ledbetter? She was a \nhard-working woman. Here is what Lilly Ledbetter received: $5,000 less \nthan the lowest paid male coworker during her last year at Goodyear. \nThat was $44,000. The lowest paid male was $51,000, and the highest \npaid male, who did virtually the same job, was paid $62,000. This is a \nyear. She was doing exactly the same as this paid worker; the only \ndifference was she was a woman.\n  What did the courts say, even though she was awarded the damages? You \ndidn't bring the case in the first 180 days. You didn't bring the case \nand, therefore, you don't have the case at all.\n  How was Lilly Ledbetter supposed to know she had a case? The payroll \nwas kept secret from all the workers. How was she supposed to know? How \nin the world was she supposed to know? She couldn't know; she didn't \nknow. It took her years to find out that she was the subject of this \nkind of discrimination, and the Supreme Court says: We don't care; we \ndon't mind if the employers are going to keep that payroll all locked \nup and keep it secret. Lilly Ledbetter should have known what was in \nthat secret safe of that employer.\n  Come on. Come on. That is a system of justice in the United States of \nAmerica? They were able to get five votes for that theory over in the \nSupreme Court of the United States? It defies common sense, of \nreasonableness and equity for people in this country, and that is what \nwe are striving for.\n  This is all against an extraordinary background of what is happening \nto working women at the present time. Look at what is happening to \nworking women now. For women who are employed now, their earnings are \nfalling faster. Women who are working now are experiencing unemployment \ntwo or three times faster than men in our economy. Their earnings are \ngoing down faster than men in our economy. Incidents of foreclosure for \nwomen are a good deal higher than men in our economy, and they are, at \nthe present time, still only earning, for the same job, 77 cents out of \nevery dollar. So they are already facing an uphill battle in our \neconomy, the difficult economy we are facing at the present time, and \nthis Supreme Court decision is just going to make it all that more \ncomplicated and more difficult.\n  This issue, as I said, is one of fundamental fairness.\n  We have an extraordinary group supporting us in terms of the \ndisability groups--the American Association of People with \nDisabilities; the elderly groups--the AARP, they know they can \nexperience the same kinds of discrimination; Business and Professional \nWomen; the NAACP--because of what this can mean in discriminating \nagainst minorities, Blacks; the auto workers, because we can see the \ndiscrimination that could be against other workers; the National \nCongress of Black Women; the Religious Action Center--there was an \nexcellent letter they sent pointing out the moral issues raised about \nthis; and then the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce--understanding this \nis plainly simply wrong. It is wrong in our society. It was wrong at \nany other time.\n  This is an issue that cries out for a remedy. It should not take the \nLedbetter legislation--which passed overwhelmingly. It passed with \nRepublican support in the House of Representatives and strong \nDemocratic support. We have a number of our Republican friends and \ncolleagues who are a part of this effort. This is a very simple and \nfundamental issue: Are we going to permit discrimination against women \nin the workplace to continue? That is what it is.\n  We have to understand, as a practical matter, employers are going to \nkeep the payroll confidential and secret. They do that. They have done \nit and will do it in the future. What the Supreme Court says is that is \ntoo bad, too bad you don't know, but if you do not do it within 180 \ndays you will lose your rights. They can effectively discriminate \nagainst you for the rest of your life if you are working in that \ncompany. They can go ahead, completely freely, without any threat of \nany kind of lawsuit, go ahead and discriminate for the rest of your \nlife, if you are working there. Tell me what the common sense of that \nproposal is. Where is the justice on that issue? Where is it?\n  We have addressed that issue and similar issues over a long period of \ntime under a variety of Presidents, under Democratic Presidents and \nRepublican Presidents--President Nixon, President Reagan, the two \nPresidents Bush. Look at the vote on these, 91 to 6, and 93 to 5, with \nvirtually similar issues that are presented here.\n  We should not have to spend the time other than having a rollcall on \nthis issue, it is so compelling. We await eagerly those who support the \ncurrent Supreme Court decision. We await them out here on the floor of \nthe Senate. We awaited them last week to come out and tell us what \ntheir rationale is, what their excuse is, what their reasons are for \ndenying fairness and equity in the workplace to millions of\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\nour fellow citizens who happen to be women. What is their right? What \nis their purpose? What is their justification--whether those \nindividuals are disabled, whether they are elderly, whether they are \nbeing discriminated against on the basis of religion--we are going to \ncontinue to permit that here in the United States when we have the \nopportunity to overturn it? That is what is going to be before the \nSenate on Wednesday.\n  It is simple; it is fundamental; it is basic. It is a defining issue \nof fairness in this country and we will have more to say about this \ntomorrow and on Wednesday as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nfrom the Office of Compliance be printed in the Record today, pursuant \nto section 304(b)(1) of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 \nU.S.C. 1384(b)(1)).\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n        from the board of directors of the office of compliance\n\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, and Request for Comments From Interested \n                                Parties\n\n       New proposed regulations implementing certain substantive \n     employment rights and protections for veterans, as required \n     by 2 U.S.C. 1316, The Congressional Accountability Act of \n     1995, as amended (``CAA'').\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The purpose of this Notice is to issue proposed substantive \n     regulations which will implement Section 206 of the CAA which \n     applies certain veterans' employment and reemployment rights \n     and protections to employing offices and employees covered by \n     the CAA.\n     What is the authority under the CAA for these proposed \n         substantive regulations?\n       The authority under the CAA for these proposed substantive \n     regulations is found in two sections of the CAA. Section 206 \n     of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316, applies certain provisions of \n     the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n     (``USERRA''), Title 38, Chapter 43 of the United States Code. \n     Section 1316 of the CAA provides protections to eligible \n     employees in the uniformed services from discrimination, \n     denial of reemployment rights, and denial of employee \n     benefits. Subsection 1316(c) requires the Board not only to \n     issue regulations to implement these protections, but to \n     issue regulations which are ``the same as the most relevant \n     substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor \n     . . .'' This section provides that the Board may only modify \n     the Department of Labor regulations if it can establish good \n     cause as to why a modification would be more effective for \n     application of the protections to the legislative branch.\n       The second section that provides authority to the Board to \n     propose these regulations is found in section 1384. Section \n     1384 provides procedures for the rulemaking process in \n     general.\n     Will these regulations, if approved, apply to all employees \n         otherwise covered by the CAA?\n       Yes. USERRA's provisions, as applied by Section 206 of the \n     CAA, prohibit discrimination and retaliation against eligible \n     employees, who are defined by the CAA as covered employees \n     performing service in the uniformed services. Section 207(a) \n     of the CAA prohibits retaliation against covered employees \n     under the CAA, regardless of whether they have performed \n     service in the uniformed services. The distinction between \n     eligible employees and covered employees is the performance \n     of service in the uniformed services: eligible employees have \n     performed service in the uniformed services; covered \n     employees have not.\n     Do other veterans' employment rights apply via the CAA to the \n         legislative branch employing offices and covered \n         employees?\n       No. However, another statutory scheme regarding uniformed \n     service members' employment rights is incorporated, in part, \n     through section 1316a of the CAA. Section 1316a applies \n     sections 2108, 3309 through 3312 of the Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (``VEOA''), and subchapter I of chapter 35 \n     of Title 5. These provisions accord certain hiring and \n     retention rights to veterans of the uniformed services. The \n     VEOA language of the CAA also requires the Board of Directors \n     to issue substantive regulations patterned upon the most \n     relevant substantive regulations (applicable with respect to \n     the executive branch) which are promulgated to implement the \n     provisions of VEOA. After engaging in extensive discussions \n     with various stakeholders across Congress and the legislative \n     branch to determine how best to address certain provisions \n     within the regulations, the Board adopted the VEOA \n     regulations and submitted them to Congress on March 21, 2008. \n     Section 1316a of the CAA becomes effective once the \n     regulations for this section are passed by Congress.\n     Which employment and reemployment protections are applied to \n         eligible employees in 2 U.S.C. 1316?\n       USERRA was enacted in December 1994, and the Department of \n     Labor final regulations for the executive branch became \n     effective in 2006. USERRA's provisions ensure that entry and \n     re-entry into the civilian workforce are not hindered by \n     participation in military service. USERRA provides certain \n     reemployment rights, protection from discrimination based on \n     military service, denial of an employment benefit as a result \n     of military service, and retaliation for enforcing USERRA \n     protections.\n       The selected statutory provisions which Congress \n     incorporated into the CAA and determined ``shall apply'' to \n     eligible employees in the legislative branch include nine \n     sections: sections 4303(13), 4304, 4311(a)(b), 4312, 4313, \n     4316, 4317, 4318, and paragraphs (1), (2)(A), and (3) of \n     4323(c) of title 38.\n       The first section, section 4303(13), provides a definition \n     for ``service in the uniformed services.'' This is the only \n     definition in USERRA that Congress made applicable to the \n     legislative branch. Section 4303(13) references Section 4304, \n     which describes the ``character of service'' and illustrates \n     situations which would terminate eligible employees' rights \n     to USERRA benefits.\n       Congress applied section 4311 to the legislative branch in \n     order to provide discrimination and retaliation protections, \n     respectively to eligible and covered employees. \n     Interestingly, although Congress adopted these protections, \n     it did not adopt the legal standard by which to establish a \n     violation of this section of the regulations.\n       Sections 4312 and 4313 outline the reemployment rights that \n     are provided to eligible employees. These rights are \n     automatic under the statute, and if an employee meets the \n     eligibility requirements, he or she is entitled to the rights \n     provided therein.\n       Sections 4316, 4317, and 4318 provide language on the \n     benefits given to eligible employees. The language in these \n     sections is largely statutory and has been altered very \n     little by the Board.\n     Are there veterans' employment regulations already in force \n         under the CAA?\n       No. The Board has issued to the Speaker of the House and \n     the President Pro Tempore of\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\n     the Senate its Notice of Adoption of Substantive Regulations \n     and Transmittal for Congressional Approval for VEOA. The \n     Board awaits Congressional approval of those regulations.\n\n\n                           Procedural Summary\n\n     How are substantive regulations proposed and approved under \n         the CAA?\n       Pursuant to section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384, the \n     procedure for proposing and approving such substantive \n     regulations provides that:\n       (1) the Board of Directors propose substantive regulations \n     and publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the \n     Congressional Record;\n       (2) there be a comment period of at least 30 days after the \n     date of publication of the general notice of proposed \n     rulemaking;\n       (3) after consideration of comments by the Board of \n     Directors, the Board adopt regulations and transmit notice of \n     such action (together with the regulations and a \n     recommendation regarding the method for Congressional \n     approval of the regulations) to the Speaker of the House and \n     President [P]ro [T]empore of the Senate for publication in \n     the Congressional Record;\n       (4) there be committee referral and action on the proposed \n     regulations by resolution in each House, concurrent \n     resolution, or by joint resolution; and\n       (5) final publication of the approved regulations in the \n     Congressional Record, with an effective date prescribed in \n     the final publication.\n       For more detail, please reference the text of 2 U.S.C. \n     1384. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is step (1) of the \n     outline set forth above.\n     Are these proposed regulations also recommended by the Office \n         of Compliance's Executive Director, the Deputy Executive \n         Director for the Senate, and the Deputy Executive \n         Director for the House of Representatives?\n       As required by section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     1384(b)(1), the substance of these regulations is also \n     recommended by the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive \n     Director for the Senate and the Deputy Executive Director for \n     the House of Representatives.\n     Has the Board of Directors previously proposed substantive \n         regulations implementing these veterans' employment \n         rights and benefits pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 1316?\n       No.\n     What is the approach taken by these proposed substantive \n         regulations?\n       The Board will follow the procedure as enumerated above and \n     as required by statute. Once these regulations are proposed, \n     the Board anticipates engaging in extensive discussion with \n     stakeholders to ensure that the regulations contemplate and \n     reflect the practices and policies particular to the \n     legislative branch.\n     What responsibilities would employing offices have in \n         effectively implementing these regulations?\n       The Board charges the employing offices with the \n     responsibility to implement the applicable USERRA provisions, \n     including the prohibitions on discrimination and retaliation, \n     the obligation to reemploy service members who timely apply \n     for reemployment, and to provide the eligible, covered \n     employee with the employment benefits to which he or she is \n     entitled under USERRA, as applied by the CAA.\n     Are there substantive differences in the proposed regulations \n         for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the \n         other employing offices?\n       No. The Board of Directors has identified no ``good cause'' \n     for varying the text of these regulations. Therefore, if \n     these regulations are approved as proposed, there will be one \n     text applicable to all employing offices and covered \n     employees.\n     Are these proposed substantive regulations available to \n         persons with disabilities in an alternate format?\n       This Notice of Proposed Regulations is available on the \n     Office of Compliance web site, www.compliance.gov, which is \n     compliant with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n     as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794d. This Notice can also be made \n     available in large print or Braille. Requests for this Notice \n     in an alternative format should be made to: Annie Leftwood, \n     Executive Assistant, Office of Compliance, 110 2nd Street, \n     S.E., Room LA-200, Washington, D.C. 20540; 202-724-9250; TDD: \n     202-426-1912; FAX: 202-426-1913.\n\n\n        30-Day Comment Period Regarding the Proposed Regulations\n\n     How long do I have to submit comments regarding the proposed \n         regulations?\n       Comments regarding the proposed regulations of the Office \n     of Compliance set forth in this Notice are invited for a \n     period of thirty (30) days following the date of the \n     appearance of this Notice in the Congressional Record.\n     How do I submit comments?\n       Comments must be made in writing to the Executive Director, \n     Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E., Room LA-200, \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. It is requested, but not \n     required, that an electronic version of any comments be \n     provided either on an accompanying computer disk or e-mailed \n     to the Office of Compliance via its web site. Comments may \n     also be submitted by facsimile to the Executive Director at \n     202-426-1913 (a non-toll-free number). Those wishing to \n     receive confirmation of the receipt of their comments are \n     requested to provide a self-addressed, stamped post card with \n     their submission.\n     Am I allowed to view copies of submitted comments by others?\n       Yes. Copies of submitted comments will be available for \n     review on the Office's web site at www.compliance.gov, and at \n     the Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E., \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999, on Monday through Friday (non-\n     Federal holidays) between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 \n     p.m.\n     Supplementary Information:\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, PL 104-1, was \n     enacted into law on January 23, 1995. The CAA, as amended, \n     applies the rights and protections of 12 federal labor and \n     employment statutes to covered employees and employing \n     offices within the legislative branch of the federal \n     government. Included among those rights are the protections \n     provided, in Section 206 of the CAA, to employees performing \n     service in the uniformed services. These protections are the \n     subject of these regulations.\n       Section 301 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381) establishes the \n     Office of Compliance as an independent office within the \n     legislative branch.\n\n    More Detailed Discussion of the Text of the Proposed Regulations\n\n       Please note in the accompanying regulations that USERRA is \n     applied by the CAA almost in its entirety. The subparts on \n     eligibility and reemployment rights (subparts C, D, and E) \n     were applied with minimal, if any, changes by the Board. The \n     Board relied heavily on Section 1316(c) of the CAA which \n     requires that these regulations be the same as those \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor unless the Board finds \n     and demonstrates good cause as to why a modification is \n     needed to be more effective for implementation in the \n     legislative branch. Where the Board determined that good \n     cause existed to require a modification, the Board so \n     modified. Otherwise, pursuant to Section 1316(c) of the CAA, \n     the Board made no changes to the Department of Labor \n     regulations.\n\n\nSubpart A--Introduction to the Regulations under the Uniformed Services \n   Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 General Provisions\n\n     The purpose of subpart A\n       This subpart gives an introduction to USERRA as applied by \n     the CAA and clarifies the rights and benefits USERRA \n     establishes for employees, and the duties it places on \n     employing offices. USERRA affects employment, reemployment, \n     and retention in employment, when employees serve or have \n     served in the uniformed services.\n       It is noted that nothing in these regulations shall be \n     construed to require an employing office to reduce any \n     returning service members' employment and reemployment rights \n     and protections that the office may currently afford to \n     eligible employees. Nor does USERRA serve to place an \n     eligible employee in a better position than he or she would \n     have been in had he or she not performed service in the \n     uniformed services.\n       It is also important to note that Section 1316(d)(2) of the \n     CAA applies these protections to the Government \n     Accountability Office and the Library of Congress. Should \n     Congress extend Board jurisdiction over the Government \n     Printing Office (``GPO'') in the future, Congress should take \n     GPO's existing veterans' preference policies into account, \n     which may be based on independent statutory mandates.\n     USERRA is not new law\n       USERRA, as applied by the CAA, became effective as of \n     January 23, 1996. Its purpose was to strengthen previous \n     veterans' rights laws, such as the Veterans' Reemployment \n     Rights Act (``VRRA''), which was enacted as section 404 of \n     the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of \n     1974. The Department of Labor issued its USERRA regulations, \n     effective January 18, 2006.\n     Role of the Executive Director of the Office of Compliance\n       The role of the Executive Director of the Office of \n     Compliance, under USERRA as applied by the CAA, differs from \n     the role of the Secretary of Labor under the DOL regulations. \n     The Executive Director provides a program of education and \n     information to employees and employing offices regarding the \n     application of the USERRA provisions and the Office of \n     Compliance, and the Executive Director provides \n     administrative procedures for the consideration of alleged \n     violations. Because the Office of Compliance is an entity of \n     the legislative branch, the Executive Director is not guided \n     by Secretary's order 1-83, which allows the Secretary of \n     Labor to delegate authority for the administration of the \n     veterans reemployment rights program. (Memorandum of April \n     22, 2002 (67 FR 31827) Nor is the Executive Director \n     responsible for carrying out the same functional authority \n     vested in the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to USERRA. \n     Similarly, unlike the Secretary of Labor, the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance has rulemaking \n     authority, not the Executive Director.\n     Applicable definitions\n       Section 206 of the CAA specifically makes applicable only \n     one definition from USERRA to the CAA: service in the \n     uniformed services. Rules of construction found in Section \n     225 (f)(1) of the CAA allow that except where inconsistent \n     with definitions and exemptions provided elsewhere in the \n     CAA, the definitions and exemptions found in USERRA will\n\n[[Page S3190]]\n\n     apply. Therefore, the definitions that are provided in these \n     regulations are derived either from USERRA or from similar \n     definitions under the CAA.\n     Types of service in the uniformed services that are covered \n         by USERRA\n       Because the definition of ``service in the uniformed \n     services'' was applied directly to the legislative branch as \n     it was written in USERRA, the types of service which receive \n     protection under the CAA are the same types of service which \n     receive protection under DOL regulations: all categories of \n     military training and service, including duty performed on a \n     voluntary or involuntary basis, in time of peace or war; \n     persons serving in the active components of the Armed Forces; \n     and certain types of service specified in 42 U.S.C. 300hh-11 \n     by members of the National Disaster Medical System. However, \n     the CAA limits protections to covered employees who are \n     deemed eligible under Section 206(a).\n     USERRA vis-a-vis other laws, public contracts, and employing \n         office practices\n       This subpart underscores the fact that USERRA allows an \n     employing office to provide rights and benefits that are \n     greater than those required by USERRA, but not lesser. It \n     clarifies that an employing office is not required to place \n     an eligible employee in a better place than he/she would \n     have been had he/she not served in the uniformed services. \n     It clarifies that USERRA supersedes any State law, \n     contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice, or other \n     matter that reduces any right or benefit provided by \n     USERRA. It does not, however, supersede, nullify, or \n     diminish any Federal or State law, contract, agreement, \n     policy, plan, practice, or other matter that establishes \n     an employment right or benefit that is more beneficial \n     than that provided under USERRA.\n\n\n Subpart B--Anti-discrimination and Anti-retaliation; Protection from \n                Employer Discrimination and Retaliation\n\n       This subpart provides protections for eligible employees \n     against discrimination, as well as protections for both \n     eligible and covered employees against retaliation. The Board \n     has maintained the general application of this subpart and \n     has determined that the prohibitions against discrimination \n     and retaliation apply to all positions. Also consistent with \n     DOL regulations, the Board maintains that reemployment rights \n     and benefits do not apply to brief, nonrecurrent positions. \n     The Board found good cause, however, to differentiate from \n     the DOL regulations in certain sections of this subpart. \n     Consequently, the Board has modified this subpart to be more \n     effective for implementation in the legislative branch.\n       Unlike DOL, the Board makes a distinction between \n     discrimination and retaliation. By not including in the CAA \n     the USERRA standard to establish a violation of this subpart, \n     Congress specifically excluded the ``but for'' standard which \n     is applied in DOL's USERRA regulations. Notably, the Board \n     chose a different standard for 207(a) retaliation in its \n     decision in Britton v. Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol, 02-AC-20 (CV, RP). In Britton, the Board considered \n     Congress' intentional exclusion of the ``but for'' standard \n     in USERRA. As a result, the Board applied the McDonnell \n     Douglas three-part standard, which it applies to 207 claims \n     of retaliation.\n       Because Congress adopted a uniform remedy for most \n     retaliation claims under the CAA, the Board has rejected an \n     ad hoc approach and has chosen to apply this Britton standard \n     to all claims of retaliation brought under Section 207(a) of \n     the CAA. The Board also has chosen to apply the Britton \n     standard for cases of retaliation brought under section 206. \n     The Board does not propose a particular standard for claims \n     of discrimination or retaliation brought by eligible \n     employees under section 206.\n       As the Board has found good cause to make significant \n     changes to this subpart, the numbering of the particular \n     sections contained therein differs from those found in DOL's \n     regulations. To aid in a comparative review of the two sets \n     of regulations, the Board has included an index, comparing \n     DOL's numbering and the Board's numbering within each \n     subpart.\n     USERRA's discrimination protections\n       This subpart sets out that basic non-discrimination and \n     non-retaliation protections of USERRA are applied to the \n     legislative branch through these regulations. An employing \n     office may not deny initial employment, reemployment, \n     retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of \n     employment to an individual on the basis of his or her \n     membership, application for membership, performance of \n     service, application for service, or obligation for service \n     in the uniformed services.\n     USERRA's retaliation protections\n       An employing office may not take any adverse employment \n     action that is reasonably likely to deter future protected \n     activity because of an eligible employee's service in the \n     uniformed services or an eligible or covered employee's \n     exercise of their rights under the statute. These protections \n     are similar to those found in DOL's regulations, except that \n     they are broadened to include retaliation protections as \n     found in section 207(a) of the CAA.\n     USERRA's application to covered employees who do not actually \n         perform service in the uniformed services\n       The CAA makes the protections under Section 206 of the CAA \n     strictly applicable to ``eligible employees.'' Such \n     ``eligible employees'' are defined as those performing \n     service in the uniformed services as defined by USERRA. \n     Section 207 of the CAA provides protections against \n     retaliation to those employees who are not eligible but who \n     are otherwise covered by the CAA. So, there are three types \n     of protection an ``eligible employee'' may receive under the \n     CAA: Discrimination protection as provided by Section 206 of \n     the CAA, retaliation protection as provided by Section 206 of \n     the CAA, and retaliation protection as provided by Section \n     207 of the CAA. Those employees who are not eligible for \n     protection under Section 206 because they have not performed \n     service in the uniformed services, but who otherwise are \n     covered by the CAA, receive retaliation protections as \n     provided by Section 207 of the CAA.\n\n\n                Subpart C--Eligibility for Reemployment\n\n       This subpart closely follows the Department of Labor \n     regulations, as well as Section 4316 of USERRA. The Board saw \n     no good cause to modify the regulations from those \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor.\n       One item to note, however, is the multi-employer language, \n     The Board recognizes that it is possible for an employee to \n     work for two employing offices of the legislative branch, \n     although it is not permitted for an employee to work for a \n     Member office and a Committee at the same time. However, \n     Section 1002.101 was included to discuss the five-year \n     service limit requirement.\n\n\n  Subpart D--Rights, Benefits, and Obligations of Persons Absent from \n          Employment Due to Service in the Uniformed Services\n\n       This subpart closely follows the Department of Labor \n     regulations, as well as Section 4316 of USERRA. The Board saw \n     no good cause to modify the regulations from those \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor.\n\n\n              Subpart E--Reemployment Rights and Benefits\n\n       This subpart closely follows the Department of Labor \n     regulations, as well as Section 4316 of USERRA. The Board saw \n     no good cause to modify the regulations from those \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, with the exception of \n     deleting language regarding assistance to employees from the \n     Office of Personnel Management.\n       The DOL regulations explain that the Office of Personnel \n     Management would assist an agency in obtaining suitable \n     employment for a returning employee who was unable to qualify \n     for the pre-service position or any other position. The \n     corresponding statutory section is not one of the sections \n     Congress applied to the legislative branch through Section \n     1316 of the CAA. Therefore, this language was removed from \n     the text of the proposed regulations.\n\n\n       Subpart F--Compliance Assistance, Enforcement and Remedies\n\n     Compliance assistance\n       This section discusses the role of the Office of Compliance \n     in providing assistance to the covered community regarding \n     the rights and benefits under USERRA, as applied by the CAA. \n     The Board found ``good cause'' to modify the regulations in \n     this subpart. The DOL regulations delineate the \n     responsibilities of the Veterans' Employment and Training \n     Service (``VETS'') in providing assistance to persons and \n     entities regarding their rights and benefits under USERRA. \n     The Board realizes that this service is available to all \n     service members by virtue of their service in the uniformed \n     services and section 225(d)(2) of the CAA specifies that \n     eligible employees may utilize any provisions of chapter 43 \n     of title 38, USERRA, that are applicable.\n       The CAA, however, limits the application of USERRA to \n     certain provisions, and provides a unique enforcement \n     mechanism for eligible covered employees to remedy violations \n     of USERRA, as applied by the CAA. Section 301(h) of the CAA \n     charges the Office with providing a program of education and \n     information for covered employees and employing offices. This \n     subpart clarifies that covered employees and employing \n     offices may seek education and information on USERRA, as \n     applied by the CAA, from the Office of Compliance pursuant to \n     section 301(h) of the CAA.\n     Initiating a claim\n       The Board, in this subpart, sets out the procedures \n     available for consideration of an allegation of a violation \n     of USERRA brought under the CAA. The procedures are \n     substantially the same as those followed by an employee who \n     initiates a claim of discrimination under the CAA.\n     Enforcement of rights and benefits against an employing \n         office\n       The Board makes clear that eligible covered employees must \n     utilize the procedures outlined in the CAA to bring a USERRA \n     claim against a covered employing office. The Board modified \n     these regulations where the CAA gives standing to bring an \n     action under section 206 only to ``eligible employees.'' The \n     Board makes clear that covered employees who are not also \n     eligible, as defined in Subpart A, are protected from \n     retaliation under section 207 of the CAA.\n       With respect to a necessary party in an action under CAA's \n     USERRA provisions, the Board found that only a covered \n     employing office may be a necessary party respondent and that \n     the confidentiality requirements of the CAA provide good \n     cause to modify the regulation to disallow interested parties \n     to\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\n     intervene in an action at the hearing stage. However, the \n     hearing officer has authority to require the filing of \n     briefs, memoranda of law and the presentation of oral \n     argument, as well as order the production of evidence and the \n     appearance of witnesses.\n       The Board found that DOL regulations permitting an award of \n     fees and court costs for an individual who has obtained \n     counsel and prevailed in their claim against their employer \n     is consistent with Section 225(a) of the CAA that permits a \n     prevailing covered employee to be awarded reasonable fees and \n     costs. However, to be more fully consistent with the CAA, the \n     Board modified the language removing the requirement that the \n     individual retain private counsel as a condition of such an \n     award. The Board saw no cause to modify the USERRA regulation \n     that does not permit costs to be assessed against an \n     individual who has made a claim under USERRA, regardless of \n     whether or not they prevailed in their claim.\n       The Board clarifies that while USERRA does not have a \n     statute of limitations, the procedures for bringing a claim \n     under part A of subchapter II which incorporates USERRA, \n     requires that an action be commenced by requesting counseling \n     by the Office of Compliance not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the alleged violation.\n       The Board found that the remedies available under USERRA, \n     as applied by the CAA, are the same as those available to \n     other claimants under USERRA because the CAA adopts USERRA's \n     equitable and legal remedies and directs the hearing officer \n     to award such remedies as are provided in the statute. In \n     order to vest this authority in the hearing officer, the \n     Board found that the authority of the hearing officer under \n     the CAA is the same as the authority of the court under the \n     DOL regulations in that the hearing officer, and not the \n     Board, has the responsibility and authority to develop the \n     record of proceedings and issue a decision that is the final \n     agency decision, unless it is appealed to the Board. The \n     Board's authority to review a hearing officer's decision is \n     limited to a review of the record.\n       The Board deleted from its regulations the section on \n     initiating actions in the name of the United States because \n     such actions are not permissible under the CAA. And, in the \n     final section of this subpart, the Board found no cause to \n     modify the equity powers permitted under USERRA, as they are \n     consistent with the authority permitted under the CAA, as \n     stated above.\n\n                             DOL's Sections\n\n\n                               Subpart A\n\n       Sec. 1002.1 What is the purpose of this subpart?\n       Sec.

Regulations Under the Uniformed Services \n   Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 General Provisions\n\n     Sec. 1002.1  What is the purpose of this part?\n       This part implements certain provisions of the Uniformed \n     Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 \n     (``USERRA'' or ``the Act''), as applied by the Congressional \n     Accountability Act (``CAA''). 2 U.S.C. 1316. USERRA is a law \n     that establishes certain rights and benefits for employees, \n     and duties for employers. USERRA affects employment, \n     reemployment, and retention in employment, when employees \n     serve or have served in the uniformed services. There are \n     five subparts to these regulations. Subpart A gives an \n     introduction to the USERRA regulations. Subpart B describes \n     USERRA's anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation provisions. \n     Subpart C explains the steps that must be taken by a \n     uniformed service member who wants to return to his or her \n     previous civilian employment. Subpart D describes the rights, \n     benefits, and obligations of persons absent from employment \n     due to service in the uniformed services, including rights \n     and obligations related to health plan coverage. Subpart E \n     describes the rights, benefits, and obligations of the \n     returning veteran or service member. Subpart F explains the \n     role of the Office of Compliance in administering USERRA as \n     applied by the CAA.\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\n     Sec. 1002.2  Is USERRA a new law?\n       USERRA is the latest in a series of laws protecting \n     veterans' employment and reemployment rights going back to \n     the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. USERRA's \n     immediate predecessor was commonly referred to as the \n     Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act (``VRRA''), which was \n     enacted as section 404 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' \n     Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. In enacting USERRA, \n     Congress emphasized USERRA's continuity with the VRRA and its \n     intention to clarify and strengthen that law. Congress also \n     emphasized that Federal laws protecting veterans' employment \n     and reemployment rights for the past fifty years had been \n     successful and that the large body of case law that had \n     developed under those statutes remained in full force and \n     effect, to the extent it is consistent with USERRA. USERRA \n     authorized the Department of Labor to publish regulations \n     implementing the Act for State, local government, and private \n     employers. USERRA also authorized the Office of Personnel \n     Management to issue regulations implementing the Act for \n     Federal executive agencies, with the exception of certain \n     Federal intelligence agencies. For those Federal intelligence \n     agencies, USERRA established a separate program for \n     employees. Section 206 of the CAA requires the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance to issue regulations to \n     implement the statutory provisions relating to employment and \n     reemployment rights of members of the uniformed services. The \n     regulations are required to be the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, except \n     where a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections of the Act. The Department of Labor issued its \n     regulations, effective January 18, 2006. The regulations set \n     forth herein are the substantive regulations that the Board \n     of Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated for \n     the legislative branch, for the implementation of the USERRA \n     provisions of the CAA. All references to USERAA in these \n     regulations, means USERRA, as applied by the CAA.\n     Sec. 1002.3  When did USERRA become effective?\n       USERRA, as applied by the CAA, became effective for \n     employing offices of the legislative branch on January 23, \n     1996. These regulations will become effective upon approval \n     by Congress.\n     Sec. 1002.4  What is the role of the Executive Director of \n         the Office of Compliance under the USERRA provisions of \n         the CAA?\n       (a) As applied by the CAA, the Executive Director of the \n     Office of Compliance is responsible for providing education \n     and information to any covered employing office or employee \n     with respect to their rights, benefits, and obligations under \n     the USERRA provisions of the CAA.\n       (b) The Office of Compliance, under the direction of the \n     Executive Director, is responsible for the processing of \n     claims filed pursuant to these regulations. More information \n     about the Office of Compliance's role is contained in Subpart \n     F.\n     Sec. 1002.5  What definitions apply to these USERRA \n         regulations?\n       (a) Act or USERRA means the Uniformed Services Employment \n     and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as applied by the CAA.\n       (b) Benefit, benefit of employment, or rights and benefits \n     means any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, \n     account, or interest (other than wages or salary for work \n     performed) that accrues to the employee because of an \n     employment contract, employment agreement, or employing \n     office policy, plan, or practice. The term includes rights \n     and benefits under a pension plan, health plan, insurance \n     coverage and awards, bonuses, severance pay, supplemental \n     unemployment benefits, vacations, and, where applicable, the \n     opportunity to select work hours or the location of \n     employment.\n       (c) Board means Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (d) CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, \n     as amended (Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 \n     U.S.C.Sec. Sec. 301-1438).\n       (e) Covered employee means any employee, including an \n     applicant for employment, of (1) the House of \n     Representatives; (2) the Senate; (3) the Capitol Guide \n     Board or the Capitol Guide Service; (4) the Capitol Police \n     Board or the Capitol Police; (5) the Congressional Budget \n     Office; (6) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol; \n     (7) the Office of the Attending Physician; (8) the \n     Government Accountability Office; (9) the Library of \n     Congress; and (10) the Office of Compliance.\n       (f) Eligible employee means a covered employee performing \n     service in the uniformed services, as defined in 1002.5 (u) \n     of this subpart, whose service has not been terminated upon \n     occurrence of any of the events enumerated in section \n     1002.135 of these regulations.\n       (g) Employee of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol \n     includes any employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol, the Botanic Gardens, or the Senate Restaurants.\n       (h) Employee of the Capitol Police Board includes any \n     member or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (i) Employee of the House of Representatives includes an \n     individual occupying a position for which the pay is \n     disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (2) through (10) of paragraph \n     (e) above.\n       (j) Employee of the Senate includes an individual occupying \n     a position for which the pay is disbursed by the Secretary of \n     the Senate, but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (1) and (3) through (10) of \n     paragraph (e) above.\n       (k) Employing office means (1) the personal office of a \n     Member of the House of Representatives or of a Senator; (2) a \n     committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate or a \n     joint committee; (3) any other office headed by a person with \n     the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the \n     terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the House of Representatives; (4) any other \n     office headed by a person with the final authority to \n     appoint, or be directed by a Member of Congress to appoint, \n     hire, discharge, and set the terms, conditions, or privileges \n     of the employment of an employee of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate; (5) the Capitol Guide Board; \n     (6) the Capitol Police Board; (7) the Congressional Budget \n     Office; (8) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (9) \n     the Office of the Attending Physician; (10) the Government \n     Accountability Office; (11) the Library of Congress; (12) or \n     the Office of Compliance.\n       (l) Health plan means an insurance policy, insurance \n     contract, medical or hospital service agreement, membership \n     or subscription contract, or other arrangement under which \n     health services for individuals are provided or the expenses \n     of such services are paid.\n       (m) Notice, when the employee is required to give advance \n     notice of service, means any written or oral notification of \n     an obligation or intention to perform service in the \n     uniformed services provided to an employing office by the \n     employee who will perform such service, or by the uniformed \n     service in which the service is to be performed.\n       (n) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (o) Qualified, with respect to an employment position, \n     means having the ability to perform the essential tasks of \n     the position.\n       (p) Reasonable efforts, in the case of actions required of \n     an employing office, means actions, including training \n     provided by an employing office that do not place an undue \n     hardship on the employing office.\n       (q) Seniority means longevity in employment together with \n     any benefits of employment that accrue with, or are \n     determined by, longevity in employment.\n       (r) Service in the uniformed services means the performance \n     of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed \n     service under competent authority. Service in the uniformed \n     services includes active duty, active and inactive duty for \n     training, National Guard duty under Federal statute, and a \n     period for which a person is absent from a position of \n     employment for an examination to determine the fitness of the \n     person to perform such duty. The term also includes a period \n     for which a person is absent from employment to perform \n     funeral honors duty as authorized by law (10 U.S.C. 12503 or \n     32 U.S.C. 115). The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism \n     Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-188, \n     provides that service as an intermittent disaster-response \n     appointee upon activation of the National Disaster Medical \n     System (NDMS) or as a participant in an authorized training \n     program is deemed ``service in the uniformed services.'' 42 \n     U.S.C. 300hh-11(e)(3).\n       (s) Undue hardship, in the case of actions taken by an \n     employing office, means an action requiring significant \n     difficulty or expense, when considered in light of--\n       (1) The nature and cost of the action needed under USERRA \n     and these regulations;\n       (2) The overall financial resources of the employing \n     office; the overall size of the business of an employing \n     office with respect to the number of its employees; the \n     number, type, and location of its facilities; and,\n       (3) The type of operation or operations of the employing \n     office, including the composition, structure, and functions \n     of the work force of such employing office; the geographic \n     separateness, administrative, or fiscal relationship of the \n     State, District, or satellite office in question to the \n     employing office.\n       (t) Uniformed services means the Armed Forces; the Army \n     National Guard and the Air National Guard when engaged in \n     active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full-\n     time National Guard duty; the commissioned corps of the \n     Public Health Service; and any other category of \n     persons designated by the President in time of war or \n     national emergency. For purposes of USERRA coverage only, \n     service as an intermittent disaster response appointee of \n     the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) when federally \n     activated or attending authorized training in support of \n     their Federal mission is deemed ``service in the uniformed \n     services,'' although such appointee is not a member of the \n     ``uniformed services'' as defined by USERRA.\n     Sec. 1002.6  What types of service in the uniformed services \n         are covered by USERRA?\n       The definition of ``service in the uniformed services'' \n     covers all categories of military training and service, \n     including duty performed on a voluntary or involuntary basis, \n     in time of peace or war. Although most often understood as \n     applying to National Guard and reserve military personnel, \n     USERRA also applies to persons serving in the active \n     components of the Armed Forces. Certain\n\n[[Page S3193]]\n\n     types of service specified in 42 U.S.C. 300hh-11 by members \n     of the National Disaster Medical System are covered by \n     USERRA.\n     Sec. 1002.7  How does USERRA, as applied by the Congressional \n         Accountability Act, relate to other laws, public and \n         private contracts, and employing office practices?\n       (a) USERRA establishes a floor, not a ceiling, for the \n     employment and reemployment rights and benefits of those it \n     protects. In other words, an employing office may provide \n     greater rights and benefits than USERRA requires, but no \n     employing office can refuse to provide any right or benefit \n     guaranteed by USERRA, as applied by the CAA.\n       (b) USERRA supersedes any State law (including any local \n     law or ordinance), contract, agreement, policy, plan, \n     practice, or other matter that reduces, limits, or eliminates \n     in any manner any right or benefit provided by USERRA, \n     including the establishment of additional prerequisites to \n     the exercise of any USERRA right or the receipt of any USERRA \n     benefit. For example, an office policy that determines \n     seniority based only on actual days of work in the place of \n     employment would be superseded by USERRA, which requires that \n     seniority credit be given for periods of absence from work \n     due to service in the uniformed services.\n       (c) USERRA does not supersede, nullify or diminish any \n     Federal or State law (including any local law or ordinance), \n     contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice, or other matter \n     that establishes an employment right or benefit that is more \n     beneficial than, or is in addition to, a right or benefit \n     provided under the Act. For example, although USERRA does not \n     require an employing office to pay an employee for time away \n     from work performing service, an employing office policy, \n     plan, or practice that provides such a benefit is permissible \n     under USERRA.\n       (d) If an employing office provides a benefit that exceeds \n     USERRA's requirements in one area, it cannot reduce or limit \n     other rights or benefits provided by USERRA. For example, \n     even though USERRA does not require it, an employing office \n     may provide a fixed number of days of paid military leave per \n     year to employees who are members of the National Guard or \n     Reserve. The fact that it provides such a benefit, however, \n     does not permit an employing office to refuse to provide an \n     unpaid leave of absence to an employee to perform service in \n     the uniformed services in excess of the number of days of \n     paid military leave.\n\n          Subpart B--Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Retaliation\n\n\n        Protection From Employer Discrimination and Retaliation\n\n     Sec. 1002.18  What status or activity is protected from \n         employer discrimination by USERRA?\n       An employing office must not deny initial employment, \n     reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any \n     benefit of employment to an individual on the basis of his or \n     her membership, application for membership, performance of \n     service, application for service, or obligation for service \n     in the uniformed services.\n     Sec. 1002.19  What activity is protected from employer \n         retaliation by USERRA?\n       An employing office must not retaliate against an \n     individual by taking any adverse employment action against \n     him or her because the individual has taken an action to \n     enforce a protection afforded any person under USERRA; \n     testified or otherwise made a statement in or in connection \n     with a proceeding under USERRA; assisted or participated in a \n     USERRA investigation; exercised a right provided for by \n     USERRA; or is performing service in the uniformed services \n     within the meaning of 1002.5 of Subpart A of these \n     regulations.\n     Sec. 1002.20  Do the Act's prohibitions against \n         discrimination and retaliation apply to all employment \n         positions?\n       Under USERRA, as applied by the CAA, the prohibitions \n     against discrimination and retaliation apply to all positions \n     within covered employing offices, including those that are \n     for a brief, nonrecurrent period, and for which there is no \n     reasonable expectation that the employment position will \n     continue indefinitely or for a significant period. However, \n     USERRA's reemployment rights and benefits do not apply to \n     such brief, non-recurrent positions of employment.\n     Sec. 1002.21  Does USERRA protect a covered employee who does \n         not actually perform service in the uniformed services?\n       USERRA's provisions, as applied by Section 206 of the CAA, \n     prohibit discrimination and retaliation against eligible \n     employees. Section 207(a) of the CAA prohibits retaliation \n     against those non-eligible, covered employees under the CAA \n     who have not performed service in the uniformed services.\n\n                Subpart C--Eligibility For Reemployment\n\n\n           General Eligibility Requirements for Reemployment\n\n     Sec. 1002.32  What criteria must the employee meet to be \n         eligible under USERRA for reemployment after service in \n         the uniformed services?\n       (a) In general, if the employee has been absent from a \n     position of civilian employment by reason of service in the \n     uniformed services, he or she will be eligible for \n     reemployment under USERRA by meeting the following criteria:\n       (1) The employer had advance notice of the employee's \n     service;\n       (2) The employee has five years or less of cumulative \n     service in the uniformed services in his or her employment \n     relationship with a particular employer;\n       (3) The employee timely returns to work or applies for \n     reemployment; and,\n       (4) The employee has not been separated from service with a \n     disqualifying discharge or under other than honorable \n     conditions.\n       (b) These general eligibility requirements have important \n     qualifications and exceptions, which are described in detail \n     in Sec. Sec. 1002.73 through 1002.138. If the employee meets \n     these eligibility criteria, then he or she is eligible for \n     reemployment unless the employer establishes one of the \n     defenses described in Sec. 1002.139. The employment position \n     to which the employee is entitled is described in \n     Sec. Sec. 1002.191 through 1002.199.\n     Sec. 1002.33  Does the covered employee have to prove that \n         the employing office discriminated against him or her in \n         order to be eligible for reemployment?\n       No. The covered employee is not required to prove that the \n     employing office discriminated against him or her because of \n     the employee's uniformed service in order to be eligible for \n     reemployment.\n\n\n                  Coverage of Employers and Positions\n\n     Sec. 1002.34  Which employing offices are covered by these \n         regulations?\n       (a) USERRA applies to all covered employing offices of the \n     legislative branch as defined in Subpart A, section 1002.5, \n     subsection (e) of these regulations.\n     Sec. 1002.40  Does USERRA protect against discrimination in \n         initial hiring decisions?\n       Yes. The definition of employer in the USERRA provision as \n     applied by the CAA includes an employing office that has \n     denied initial employment to an individual in violation of \n     USERRA's anti-discrimination provisions. An employing office \n     need not actually employ an individual to be his or her \n     ``employer'' under the Act, if it has denied initial \n     employment on the basis of the individual's membership, \n     application for membership, performance of service, \n     application for service, or obligation for service in the \n     uniformed services. Similarly, the employing office would be \n     liable if it denied initial employment on the basis of the \n     individual's action taken to enforce a protection afforded to \n     any person under USERRA, his or her testimony or statement in \n     connection with any USERRA proceeding, assistance or other \n     participation in a USERRA investigation, or the exercise of \n     any other right provided by the Act. For example, if the \n     individual has been denied initial employment because of his \n     or her obligations as a member of the National Guard or \n     Reserves, the employing office denying employment is an \n     employer for purposes of USERRA. Similarly, if an employing \n     office withdraws an offer of employment because the \n     individual is called upon to fulfill an obligation in the \n     uniformed services, the employing office withdrawing the \n     employment offer is an employer for purposes of USERRA.\n     Sec. 1002.41  Does an employee have rights under USERRA even \n         though he or she holds a temporary, part-time, \n         probationary, or seasonal employment position?\n       USERRA rights are not diminished because an employee holds \n     a temporary, part-time, probationary, or seasonal employment \n     position. However, an employing office is not required to \n     reemploy an employee if the employment he or she left to \n     serve in the uniformed services was for a brief, nonrecurrent \n     period and there is no reasonable expectation that the \n     employment would have continued indefinitely or for a \n     significant period. The employing office bears the burden of \n     proving this affirmative defense.\n     Sec. 1002.42  What rights does an employee have under USERRA \n         if he or she is on layoff or on a leave of absence?\n       (a) If an employee is laid off with recall rights, or on a \n     leave of absence, he or she is an employee for purposes of \n     USERRA. If the employee is on layoff and begins service in \n     the uniformed services, or is laid off while performing \n     service, he or she may be entitled to reemployment on return \n     if the employing office would have recalled the employee to \n     employment during the period of service. Similar principles \n     apply if the employee is on a leave of absence from work when \n     he or she begins a period of service in the uniformed \n     services.\n       (b) If the employee is sent a recall notice during a period \n     of service in the uniformed services and cannot resume the \n     position of employment because of the service, he or she \n     still remains an employee for purposes of the Act. Therefore, \n     if the employee is otherwise eligible, he or she is entitled \n     to reemployment following the conclusion of the period of \n     service, even if he or she did not respond to the recall \n     notice.\n       (c) If the employee is laid off before or during service in \n     the uniformed services, and the employing office would not \n     have recalled him or her during that period of service, the \n     employee is not entitled to reemployment following the period \n     of service simply because he or she is a covered employee. \n     Reemployment rights under USERRA cannot put the employee in a \n     better position than if he or she had remained in the \n     civilian employment position.\n     Sec. 1002.43  Does an individual have rights under USERRA \n         even if he or she is an executive, managerial, or \n         professional employee?\n       Yes. USERRA applies to all covered employees. There is no \n     exclusion for executive, managerial, or professional \n     employees.\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\n     Sec. 1002.44  Does USERRA cover an independent contractor?\n       (a) No. USERRA, as applied by the CAA, does not provide \n     protections for an independent contractor.\n\n\n             Coverage of Service in the Uniformed Services\n\n     Sec. 1002.54  Are all military fitness examinations \n         considered ``service in the uniformed services?''\n       Yes. USERRA's definition of ``service in the uniformed \n     services'' includes a period for which an employee is absent \n     from a position of employment for the purpose of an \n     examination to determine his or her fitness to perform duty \n     in the uniformed services. Military fitness examinations can \n     address more than physical or medical fitness, and include \n     evaluations for mental, educational, and other types of \n     fitness. Any examination to determine an employee's fitness \n     for service is covered, whether it is an initial or recurring \n     examination. For example, a periodic medical examination \n     required of a Reserve component member to determine fitness \n     for continued service is covered.\n     Sec. 1002.55  Is all funeral honors duty considered ``service \n         in the uniformed services?''\n       (a) USERRA's definition of ``service in the uniformed \n     services'' includes a period for which an employee is absent \n     from employment for the purpose of performing authorized \n     funeral honors duty under 10 U.S.C. 12503 (members of Reserve \n     ordered to perform funeral honors duty) or 32 U.S.C. 115 \n     (Member of Air or Army National Guard ordered to perform \n     funeral honors duty).\n       (b) Funeral honors duty performed by persons who are not \n     members of the uniformed services, such as members of \n     veterans' service organizations, is not ``service in the \n     uniformed services.''\n     Sec. 1002.56  What types of service in the National Disaster \n         Medical System are considered ``service in the uniformed \n         services?''\n       Under a provision of the Public Health Security and \n     Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, 42 U.S.C. \n     300hh 11(e)(3), ``service in the uniformed services'' \n     includes service performed as an intermittent disaster-\n     response appointee upon activation of the National Disaster \n     Medical System or participation in an authorized training \n     program, even if the individual is not a member of the \n     uniformed services.\n     Sec. 1002.57  Is all service as a member of the National \n         Guard considered ``service in the uniformed services?''\n       No. Only Federal National Guard service is considered \n     ``service in the uniformed services.'' The National Guard has \n     a dual status. It is a Reserve component of the Army, or, in \n     the case of the Air National Guard, of the Air Force. \n     Simultaneously, it is a State military force subject to call-\n     up by the State Governor for duty not subject to Federal \n     control, such as emergency duty in cases of floods or riots. \n     National Guard members may perform service under either \n     Federal or State authority, but only Federal National Guard \n     service is covered by USERRA.\n       (a) National Guard service under Federal authority is \n     protected by USERRA. Service under Federal authority includes \n     active duty performed under Title 10 of the United States \n     Code. Service under Federal authority also includes duty \n     under Title 32 of the United States Code, such as active duty \n     for training, inactive duty training, or full-time National \n     Guard duty.\n       (b) National Guard service under authority of State law is \n     not protected by USERRA. However, many States have laws \n     protecting the civilian job rights of National Guard members \n     who serve under State orders. Enforcement of those State laws \n     is not covered by USERRA or these regulations.\n     Sec. 1002.58  Is service in the commissioned corps of the \n         Public Health Service considered ``service in the \n         uniformed services?''\n       Yes. Service in the commissioned corps of the Public Health \n     Service (PHS) is ``service in the uniformed services'' under \n     USERRA.\n     Sec. 1002.59  Are there any circumstances in which special \n         categories of persons are considered to perform ``service \n         in the uniformed services?''\n       Yes. In time of war or national emergency, the President \n     has authority to designate any category of persons as a \n     ``uniformed service'' for purposes of USERRA. If the \n     President exercises this authority, service as a member of \n     that category of persons would be ``service in the uniformed \n     services'' under USERRA.\n     Sec. 1002.60  Does USERRA cover an individual attending a \n         military service academy?\n       Yes. Attending a military service academy is considered \n     uniformed service for purposes of USERRA. There are four \n     service academies: The United States Military Academy (West \n     Point, New York), the United States Naval Academy (Annapolis, \n     Maryland), the United States Air Force Academy (Colorado \n     Springs, Colorado), and the United States Coast Guard Academy \n     (New London, Connecticut).\n     Sec. 1002.61  Does USERRA cover a member of the Reserve \n         Officers Training Corps?\n       Yes, under certain conditions:\n       (a) Membership in the Reserve Officers Training Corps \n     (ROTC) or the Junior ROTC is not ``service in the uniformed \n     services.'' However, some Reserve and National Guard enlisted \n     members use a college ROTC program as a means of qualifying \n     for commissioned officer status. National Guard and Reserve \n     members in an ROTC program may at times, while participating \n     in that program, be receiving active duty and inactive duty \n     training service credit with their unit. In these cases, \n     participating in ROTC training sessions is considered \n     ``service in the uniformed services,'' and qualifies a person \n     for protection under USERRA's reemployment and anti-\n     discrimination provisions.\n       (b) Typically, an individual in a College ROTC program \n     enters into an agreement with a particular military service \n     that obligates such individual to either complete the ROTC \n     program and accept a commission or, in case he or she does \n     not successfully complete the ROTC program, to serve as an \n     enlisted member. Although an individual does not qualify for \n     reemployment protection, except as specified in (a) above, he \n     or she is protected under USERRA's anti-discrimination \n     provisions because, as a result of the agreement, he or she \n     has applied to become a member of the uniformed services and \n     has incurred an obligation to perform future service.\n     Sec. 1002.62  Does USERRA cover a member of the Commissioned \n         Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n         Administration, the Civil Air Patrol, or the Coast Guard \n         Auxiliary?\n       No. Although the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a ``uniformed \n     service'' for some purposes, it is not included in USERRA's \n     definition of this term. Service in the Civil Air Patrol and \n     the Coast Guard Auxiliary similarly is not considered \n     ``service in the uniformed services'' for purposes of USERRA. \n     Consequently, service performed in the Commissioned Corps of \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), \n     the Civil Air Patrol, and the Coast Guard Auxiliary is not \n     protected by USERRA.\n\n\nAbsence From a Position of Employment Necessitated by Reason of Service \n                       in the Uniformed Services\n\n     Sec. 1002.73  Does service in the uniformed services have to \n         be an employee's sole reason for leaving an employment \n         position in order to have USERRA reemployment rights?\n       No. If absence from a position of employment is \n     necessitated by service in the uniformed services, and the \n     employee otherwise meets the Act's eligibility requirements, \n     he or she has reemployment rights under USERRA, even if the \n     employee uses the absence for other purposes as well. An \n     employee is not required to leave the employment position for \n     the sole purpose of performing service in the uniformed \n     services, although such uniformed service must be the main \n     reason for departure from employment. For example, if the \n     employee is required to report to an out of State location \n     for military training and he or she spends off-duty time \n     during that assignment moonlighting as a security guard or \n     visiting relatives who live in that State, the employee will \n     not lose reemployment rights simply because he or she used \n     some of the time away from the job to do something other than \n     attend the military training. Also, if an employee receives \n     advance notification of a mobilization order, and leaves his \n     or her employment position in order to prepare for duty, but \n     the mobilization is cancelled, the employee will not lose any \n     reemployment rights.\n     Sec. 1002.74  Must the employee begin service in the \n         uniformed services immediately after leaving his or her \n         employment position in order to have USERRA reemployment \n         rights?\n       No. At a minimum, an employee must have enough time after \n     leaving the employment position to travel safely to the \n     uniformed service site and arrive fit to perform the service. \n     Depending on the specific circumstances, including the \n     duration of service, the amount of notice received, and the \n     location of the service, additional time to rest, or to \n     arrange affairs and report to duty, may be necessitated by \n     reason of service in the uniformed services. The following \n     examples help to explain the issue of the period of time \n     between leaving civilian employment and beginning service in \n     the uniformed services:\n       (a) If the employee performs a full overnight shift for the \n     civilian employer and travels directly from the work site to \n     perform a full day of uniformed service, the employee would \n     not be considered fit to perform the uniformed service. An \n     absence from that work shift is necessitated so that the \n     employee can report for uniformed service fit for duty.\n       (b) If the employee is ordered to perform an extended \n     period of service in the uniformed services, he or she may \n     require a reasonable period of time off from the civilian job \n     to put his or her personal affairs in order, before beginning \n     the service. Taking such time off is also necessitated by the \n     uniformed service.\n       (c) If the employee leaves a position of employment in \n     order to enlist or otherwise perform service in the uniformed \n     services and, through no fault of his or her own, the \n     beginning date of the service is delayed, this delay does not \n     terminate any reemployment rights.\n\n\n                         Requirement of Notice\n\n     Sec. 1002.85  Must the employee give advance notice to the \n         employing office of his or her service in the uniformed \n         services?\n       (a) Yes. The employee, or an appropriate officer of the \n     uniformed service in which his or her service is to be \n     performed, must notify the employing office that the employee \n     intends to leave the employment position to\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\n     perform service in the uniformed services, with certain \n     exceptions described below. In cases in which an employee is \n     employed by more than one employing office, the employee, or \n     an appropriate officer of the uniformed service in which his \n     or her service is to be performed, must notify each employing \n     office that the employee intends to leave the employment \n     position to perform service in the uniformed services, with \n     certain exceptions described below.\n       (b) The Department of Defense USERRA regulations at 32 CFR \n     104.3 provide that an ``appropriate officer'' can give notice \n     on the employee's behalf. An ``appropriate officer'' is a \n     commissioned, warrant, or non-commissioned officer authorized \n     to give such notice by the military service concerned.\n       (c) The employee's notice to the employing office may be \n     either oral or written. The notice may be informal and does \n     not need to follow any particular format.\n       (d) Although USERRA does not specify how far in advance \n     notice must be given to the employing office, an employee \n     should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable \n     under the circumstances. In regulations promulgated by the \n     Department of Defense under USERRA, 32 CFR 104.6(a)(2)(i)(B), \n     the Defense Department ``strongly recommends that advance \n     notice to civilian employers be provided at least 30 days \n     prior to departure for uniformed service when it is feasible \n     to do so.''\n     Sec. 1002.86  When is the employee excused from giving \n         advance notice of service in the uniformed services?\n       The employee is required to give advance notice of pending \n     service unless giving such notice is prevented by military \n     necessity, or is otherwise impossible or unreasonable under \n     all the circumstances.\n       (a) Only a designated authority can make a determination of \n     ``military necessity,'' and such a determination is not \n     subject to judicial review. Guidelines for defining \n     ``military necessity'' appear in regulations issued by the \n     Department of Defense at 32 CFR 104.3. In general, these \n     regulations cover situations where a mission, operation, \n     exercise or requirement is classified, or could be \n     compromised or otherwise adversely affected by public \n     knowledge. In certain cases, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, can \n     make a determination that giving of notice by intermittent \n     disaster-response appointees of the National Disaster Medical \n     System is precluded by ``military necessity.'' See 42 U.S.C. \n     300hh-11(e)(3)(B).\n       (b) It may be impossible or unreasonable to give advance \n     notice under certain circumstances. Such circumstances may \n     include the unavailability of the employee's employing office \n     or the employing office's representative, or a requirement \n     that the employee report for uniformed service in an \n     extremely short period of time.\n     Sec. 1002.87  Is the employee required to get permission from \n         his or her employer before leaving to perform service in \n         the uniformed services?\n       No. The employee is not required to ask for or get the \n     employing office's permission to leave to perform service in \n     the uniformed services. The employee is only required to give \n     the employing office notice of pending service.\n     Sec. 1002.88  Is the employee required to tell the employing \n         office that he or she intends to seek reemployment after \n         completing uniformed service before the employee leaves \n         to perform service in the uniformed services?\n       No. When the employee leaves the employment position to \n     begin a period of service, he or she is not required to tell \n     the employing office that he or she intends to seek \n     reemployment after completing uniformed service. Even if the \n     employee tells the employing office before entering or \n     completing uniformed service that he or she does not intend \n     to seek reemployment after completing the uniformed service, \n     the employee does not forfeit the right to reemployment after \n     completing service. The employee is not required to decide in \n     advance of leaving the civilian employment position whether \n     he or she will seek reemployment after completing uniformed \n     service.\n\n\n                           Period of Service\n\n     Sec. 1002.99  Is there a limit on the total amount of service \n         in the uniformed services that an employee may perform \n         and still retain reemployment rights with the employer?\n       Yes. In general, the employee may perform service in the \n     uniformed services for a cumulative period of up to five (5) \n     years and retain reemployment rights with the employing \n     office. The exceptions to this rule are described below.\n     Sec. 1002.100  Does the five-year service limit include all \n         absences from an employment position that are related to \n         service in the uniformed services?\n       No. The five-year period includes only the time the \n     employee spends actually performing service in the uniformed \n     services. A period of absence from employment before or after \n     performing service in the uniformed services does not count \n     against the five-year limit. For example, after the employee \n     completes a period of service in the uniformed services, he \n     or she is provided a certain amount of time, depending upon \n     the length of service, to report back to work or submit an \n     application for reemployment. The period between completing \n     the uniformed service and reporting back to work or seeking \n     reemployment does not count against the five-year limit.\n     Sec. 1002.101  Does the five-year service limit include \n         periods of service that the employee performed when he or \n         she worked for a previous employing office?\n       No. An employee is entitled to a leave of absence for \n     uniformed service for up to five years with each employing \n     office for whom he or she works or has worked. When the \n     employee takes a position with a new employing office, the \n     five-year period begins again regardless of how much service \n     he or she performed while working in any previous employment \n     relationship. If an employee is employed by more than one \n     employing office, a separate five-year period runs as to each \n     employing office independently, even if those employing \n     offices share or co-determine the employee's terms and \n     conditions of employment. For example, an employee of the \n     legislative branch may work part-time for two employing \n     offices. In this case, a separate five-year period would run \n     as to the employee's employment with each respective \n     employing office.\n     Sec. 1002.102  Does the five-year service limit include \n         periods of service that the employee performed before \n         USERRA was enacted?\n       It depends. Under the CAA, USERRA provides reemployment \n     rights to which a covered employee may become entitled \n     beginning on or after January 23, 1996, but any uniformed \n     service performed before January 23, 1996, that was counted \n     against the service limitations of the previous law (the \n     Veterans Reemployment Rights Act), also counts against \n     USERRA's five-year limit.\n     Sec. 1002.103  Are there any types of service in the \n         uniformed services that an employee can perform that do \n         not count against USERRA's five-year service limit?\n       (a) USERRA creates the following exceptions to the five-\n     year limit on service in the uniformed services:\n       (1) Service that is required beyond five years to complete \n     an initial period of obligated service. Some military \n     specialties require an individual to serve more than five \n     years because of the amount of time or expense involved in \n     training. If the employee works in one of those specialties, \n     he or she has reemployment rights when the initial period of \n     obligated service is completed;\n       (2) If the employee was unable to obtain orders releasing \n     him or her from service in the uniformed services before the \n     expiration of the five-year period, and the inability was not \n     the employee's fault;\n       (3)(i) Service performed to fulfill periodic National Guard \n     and Reserve training requirements as prescribed by 10 U.S.C. \n     10147 and 32 U.S.C. 502(a) and 503; and, (ii) Service \n     performed to fulfill additional training requirements \n     determined and certified by a proper military authority as \n     necessary for the employee's professional development, or to \n     complete skill training or retraining;\n       (4) Service performed in a uniformed service if he or she \n     was ordered to or retained on active duty under:\n       (i) 10 U.S.C. 688 (involuntary active duty by a military \n     retiree);\n       (ii) 10 U.S.C. 12301(a) (involuntary active duty in \n     wartime);\n       (iii) 10 U.S.C. 12301(g) (retention on active duty while in \n     captive status);\n       (iv) 10 U.S.C. 12302 (involuntary active duty during a \n     national emergency for up to 24 months);\n       (v) 10 U.S.C. 12304 (involuntary active duty for an \n     operational mission for up to 270 days);\n       (vi) 10 U.S.C. 12305 (involuntary retention on active duty \n     of a critical person during time of crisis or other specific \n     conditions);\n       (vii) 14 U.S.C. 331 (involuntary active duty by retired \n     Coast Guard officer);\n       (viii) 14 U.S.C. 332 (voluntary active duty by retired \n     Coast Guard officer);\n       (ix) 14 U.S.C. 359 (involuntary active duty by retired \n     Coast Guard enlisted member);\n       (x) 14 U.S.C. 360 (voluntary active duty by retired Coast \n     Guard enlisted member);\n       (xi) 14 U.S.C. 367 (involuntary retention of Coast Guard \n     enlisted member on active duty); and\n       (xii) 14 U.S.C. 712 (involuntary active duty by Coast Guard \n     Reserve member for natural or man-made disasters).\n       (5) Service performed in a uniformed service if the \n     employee was ordered to or retained on active duty (other \n     than for training) under any provision of law because of a \n     war or national emergency declared by the President or the \n     Congress, as determined by the Secretary concerned;\n       (6) Service performed in a uniformed service if the \n     employee was ordered to active duty (other than for training) \n     in support of an operational mission for which personnel have \n     been ordered to active duty under 10 U.S.C. 12304, as \n     determined by a proper military authority;\n       (7) Service performed in a uniformed service if the \n     employee was ordered to active duty in support of a critical \n     mission or requirement of the uniformed services as \n     determined by the Secretary concerned; and,\n       (8) Service performed as a member of the National Guard if \n     the employee was called to respond to an invasion, danger of \n     invasion, rebellion, danger of rebellion, insurrection, or \n     the inability of the President with regular forces to execute \n     the laws of the United States.\n       (b) Service performed in a uniformed service to mitigate \n     economic harm where the employee's employing office is in \n     violation of its employment or reemployment obligations to \n     him or her.\n\n[[Page S3196]]\n\n     Sec. 1002.104  Is the employee required to accommodate his or \n         her employer's needs as to the timing, frequency or \n         duration of service?\n       No. The employee is not required to accommodate his or her \n     employing office's interests or concerns regarding the \n     timing, frequency, or duration of uniformed service. The \n     employing office cannot refuse to reemploy the employee \n     because it believes that the timing, frequency or duration of \n     the service is unreasonable. However, the employing office \n     is permitted to bring its concerns over the timing, \n     frequency, or duration of the employee's service to the \n     attention of the appropriate military authority. \n     Regulations issued by the Department of Defense at 32 CFR \n     104.4 direct military authorities to provide assistance to \n     an employer in addressing these types of employment \n     issues. The military authorities are required to consider \n     requests from employers of National Guard and Reserve \n     members to adjust scheduled absences from civilian \n     employment to perform service.\n\n\n                      Application for Reemployment\n\n     Sec. 1002.115  Is the employee required to report to or \n         submit a timely application for reemployment to his or \n         her pre-service employer upon completing the period of \n         service in the uniformed services?\n       Yes. Upon completing service in the uniformed services, the \n     employee must notify the pre-service employing office of his \n     or her intent to return to the employment position by either \n     reporting to work or submitting a timely application for \n     reemployment. Whether the employee is required to report to \n     work or submit a timely application for reemployment depends \n     upon the length of service, as follows:\n       (a) Period of service less than 31 days or for a period of \n     any length for the purpose of a fitness examination. If the \n     period of service in the uniformed services was less than 31 \n     days, or the employee was absent from a position of \n     employment for a period of any length for the purpose of an \n     examination to determine his or her fitness to perform \n     service, the employee must report back to the employing \n     office not later than the beginning of the first full \n     regularly-scheduled work period on the first full calendar \n     day following the completion of the period of service, and \n     the expiration of eight hours after a period allowing for \n     safe transportation from the place of that service to the \n     employee's residence. For example, if the employee completes \n     a period of service and travel home, arriving at ten o'clock \n     in the evening, he or she cannot be required to report to the \n     employing office until the beginning of the next full \n     regularly-scheduled work period that begins at least eight \n     hours after arriving home, i.e., no earlier than six o'clock \n     the next morning. If it is impossible or unreasonable for the \n     employee to report within such time period through no fault \n     of his or her own, he or she must report to the employing \n     office as soon as possible after the expiration of the eight-\n     hour period.\n       (b) Period of service more than 30 days but less than 181 \n     days. If the employee's period of service in the uniformed \n     services was for more than 30 days but less than 181 days, he \n     or she must submit an application for reemployment (written \n     or oral) with the employing office not later than 14 days \n     after completing service. If it is impossible or unreasonable \n     for the employee to apply within 14 days through no fault of \n     his or her own, he or she must submit the application not \n     later than the next full calendar day after it becomes \n     possible to do so.\n       (c) Period of service more than 180 days. If the employee's \n     period of service in the uniformed services was for more than \n     180 days, he or she must submit an application for \n     reemployment (written or oral) not later than 90 days after \n     completing service.\n     Sec. 1002.116  Is the time period for reporting back to an \n         employing office extended if the employee is hospitalized \n         for, or convalescing from, an illness or injury incurred \n         in, or aggravated during, the performance of service?\n       Yes. If the employee is hospitalized for, or convalescing \n     from, an illness or injury incurred in, or aggravated during, \n     the performance of service, he or she must report to or \n     submit an application for reemployment to the employing \n     office at the end of the period necessary for recovering from \n     the illness or injury. This period may not exceed two years \n     from the date of the completion of service, except that it \n     must be extended by the minimum time necessary to accommodate \n     circumstances beyond the employee's control that make \n     reporting within the period impossible or unreasonable. This \n     period for recuperation and recovery extends the time period \n     for reporting to or submitting an application for \n     reemployment to the employing office, and is not applicable \n     following reemployment.\n     Sec. 1002.117  Are there any consequences if the employee \n         fails to report for or submit a timely application for \n         reemployment?\n       (a) If the employee fails to timely report for or apply for \n     reemployment, he or she does not automatically forfeit \n     entitlement to USERRA's reemployment and other rights and \n     benefits. However, the employee does become subject to any \n     conduct rules, established policy, and general practices of \n     the employing office pertaining to an absence from scheduled \n     work.\n       (b) If reporting or submitting an employment application to \n     the employing office is impossible or unreasonable through no \n     fault of the employee, he or she may report to the employing \n     office as soon as possible (in the case of a period of \n     service less than 31 days) or submit an application for \n     reemployment to the employing office by the next full \n     calendar day after it becomes possible to do so (in the case \n     of a period of service from 31 to 180 days), and the employee \n     will be considered to have timely reported or applied for \n     reemployment.\n     Sec. 1002.118  Is an application for reemployment required to \n         be in any particular form?\n       An application for reemployment need not follow any \n     particular format. The employee may apply orally or in \n     writing. The application should indicate that the employee is \n     a former employee returning from service in the uniformed \n     services and that he or she seeks reemployment with the pre-\n     service employing office. The employee is permitted but not \n     required to identify a particular reemployment position in \n     which he or she is interested.\n     Sec. 1002.119  To whom must the employee submit the \n         application for reemployment?\n       The application must be submitted to the pre-service \n     employing office or to an agent or representative of the \n     employing office who has apparent responsibility for \n     receiving employment applications. Depending upon the \n     circumstances, such a person could be a personnel or human \n     resources officer, or a first-line supervisor.\n     Sec. 1002.120  If the employee seeks or obtains employment \n         with an employer other than the pre-service employing \n         office before the end of the period within which a \n         reemployment application must be filed, will that \n         jeopardize reemployment rights with the pre-service \n         employing office?\n       No. The employee has reemployment rights with the pre-\n     service employing office provided that he or she makes a \n     timely reemployment application to that employing office. The \n     employee may seek or obtain employment with an employer other \n     than the pre-service employing office during the period of \n     time within which a reemployment application must be made, \n     without giving up reemployment rights with the pre-service \n     employing office. However, such alternative employment during \n     the application period should not be of a type that would \n     constitute cause for the employing office to discipline or \n     terminate the employee following reemployment. For instance, \n     if the employing office forbids outside employment, violation \n     of such a policy may constitute cause for discipline or even \n     termination.\n     Sec. 1002.121  Is the employee required to submit \n         documentation to the employing office in connection with \n         the application for reemployment?\n       Yes, if the period of service exceeded 30 days and if \n     requested by the employing office to do so. If the employee \n     submits an application for reemployment after a period of \n     service of more than 30 days, he or she must, upon the \n     request of the employing office, provide documentation to \n     establish that:\n       (a) The reemployment application is timely;\n       (b) The employee has not exceeded the five-year limit on \n     the duration of service (subject to the exceptions listed at \n     1002.103); and,\n       (c) The employee's separation or dismissal from service was \n     not disqualifying.\n     Sec. 1002.122  Is the employing office required to reemploy \n         the employee if documentation establishing the employee's \n         eligibility does not exist or is not readily available?\n       Yes. The employing office is not permitted to delay or deny \n     reemployment by demanding documentation that does not exist \n     or is not readily available. The employee is not liable for \n     administrative delays in the issuance of military \n     documentation. If the employee is re-employed after an \n     absence from employment for more than 90 days, the employing \n     office may require that he or she submit the documentation \n     establishing entitlement to reemployment before treating the \n     employee as not having had a break in service for pension \n     purposes. If the documentation is received after reemployment \n     and it shows that the employee is not entitled to \n     reemployment, the employing office may terminate employment \n     and any rights or benefits that the employee may have been \n     granted.\n     Sec. 1002.123  What documents satisfy the requirement that \n         the employee establish eligibility for reemployment after \n         a period of service of more than thirty days?\n       (a) Documents that satisfy the requirements of USERRA \n     include the following:\n       (1) DD (Department of Defense) 214 Certificate of Release \n     or Discharge from Active Duty;\n       (2) Copy of duty orders prepared by the facility where the \n     orders were fulfilled carrying an endorsement indicating \n     completion of the described service;\n       (3) Letter from the commanding officer of a Personnel \n     Support Activity or someone of comparable authority;\n       (4) Certificate of completion from military training \n     school;\n       (5) Discharge certificate showing character of service; \n     and,\n       (6) Copy of extracts from payroll documents showing periods \n     of service;\n       (7) Letter from NDMS Team Leader or Administrative Officer \n     verifying dates and times of NDMS training or Federal \n     activation.\n       (b) The types of documents that are necessary to establish \n     eligibility for reemployment will vary from case to case. Not \n     all of\n\n[[Page S3197]]\n\n     these documents are available or necessary in every instance \n     to establish reemployment eligibility.\n\n\n                          Character of Service\n\n     Sec. 1002.134  What type of discharge or separation from \n         service is required for an employee to be entitled to \n         reemployment under USERRA?\n       USERRA does not require any particular form of discharge or \n     separation from service. However, even if the employee is \n     otherwise eligible for reemployment, he or she will be \n     disqualified if the characterization of service falls within \n     one of four categories. USERRA requires that the employee not \n     have received one of these types of discharge.\n     Sec. 1002.135  What types of discharge or separation from \n         uniformed service will make the employee ineligible for \n         reemployment under USERRA?\n\n\n         Reemployment rights are terminated if the employee is:\n\n       (a) Separated from uniformed service with a dishonorable or \n     bad conduct discharge;\n       (b) Separated from uniformed service under other than \n     honorable conditions, as characterized by regulations of the \n     uniformed service;\n       (c) A commissioned officer dismissed as permitted under 10 \n     U.S.C. 1161(a) by sentence of a general court-martial; in \n     commutation of a sentence of a general court-martial; or, in \n     time of war, by order of the President; or,\n       (d) A commissioned officer dropped from the rolls under 10 \n     U.S.C. 1161(b) due to absence without authority for at least \n     three months; separation by reason of a sentence to \n     confinement adjudged by a court-martial; or, a sentence to \n     confinement in a Federal or State penitentiary or \n     correctional institution.\n     Sec. 1002.136  Who determines the characterization of \n         service?\n       The branch of service in which the employee performs the \n     tour of duty determines the characterization of service.\n     Sec. 1002.137  If the employee receives a disqualifying \n         discharge or release from uniformed service and it is \n         later upgraded, will reemployment rights be restored?\n       Yes. A military review board has the authority to \n     prospectively or retroactively upgrade a disqualifying \n     discharge or release. A retroactive upgrade would restore \n     reemployment rights providing the employee otherwise meets \n     the Act's eligibility criteria.\n     Sec. 1002.138  If the employee receives a retroactive upgrade \n         in the characterization of service, will that entitle him \n         or her to claim back wages and benefits lost as of the \n         date of separation from service?\n       No. A retroactive upgrade allows the employee to obtain \n     reinstatement with the former employing office, provided the \n     employee otherwise meets the Act's eligibility criteria. Back \n     pay and other benefits such as pension plan credits \n     attributable to the time period between discharge and the \n     retroactive upgrade are not required to be restored by the \n     employing office in this situation.\n\n\n                      Employer Statutory Defenses\n\n     Sec. 1002.139  Are there any circumstances in which the pre-\n         service employing office is excused from its obligation \n         to reemploy the employee following a period of uniformed \n         service? What statutory defenses are available to the \n         employing office in an action or proceeding for \n         reemployment benefits?\n       (a) Even if the employee is otherwise eligible for \n     reemployment benefits, the employing office is not required \n     to reemploy him or her if the employing office establishes \n     that its circumstances have so changed as to make \n     reemployment impossible or unreasonable. For example, an \n     employing office may be excused from re-employing the \n     employee where there has been an intervening reduction in \n     force that would have included that employee. The employing \n     office may not, however, refuse to reemploy the employee on \n     the basis that another employee was hired to fill the \n     reemployment position during the employee's absence, even if \n     reemployment might require the termination of that \n     replacement employee;\n       (b) Even if the employee is otherwise eligible for \n     reemployment benefits, the employing office is not required \n     to reemploy him or her if it establishes that assisting the \n     employee in becoming qualified for reemployment would impose \n     an undue hardship, as defined in Sec. 1002.5(s) and discussed \n     in Sec. 1002.198, on the employing office; or,\n       (c) Even if the employee is otherwise eligible for \n     reemployment benefits, the employing office is not required \n     to reemploy him or her if it establishes that the employment \n     position vacated by the employee in order to perform service \n     in the uniformed services was for a brief, nonrecurrent \n     period and there was no reasonable expectation that the \n     employment would continue indefinitely or for a significant \n     period.\n       (d) The employing office defenses included in this section \n     are affirmative ones, and the employing office carries the \n     burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that any \n     one or more of these defenses is applicable.\n\n  Subpart D--Rights, Benefits, and Obligations of Persons Absent from \n          Employment Due to Service in the Uniformed Services\n\n\n                     Furlough and Leave of Absence\n\n     Sec. 1002.149  What is the employee's status with the \n         employing office while performing service in the \n         uniformed services?\n       During a period of service in the uniformed services, the \n     employee is deemed to be on leave of absence from the \n     employing office. In this status, the employee is entitled to \n     the non-seniority rights and benefits generally provided by \n     the employing office to other employees with similar \n     seniority, status, and pay that are on leave of absence. \n     Entitlement to these non-seniority rights and benefits is not \n     dependent on how the employing office characterizes the \n     employee's status during a period of service. For example, if \n     the employing office characterizes the employee as \n     ``terminated'' during the period of uniformed service, this \n     characterization cannot be used to avoid USERRA's requirement \n     that the employee be deemed on leave of absence, and \n     therefore, entitled to the non-seniority rights and benefits \n     generally provided to employees on leave of absence.\n     Sec. 1002.150  Which non-seniority rights and benefits is the \n         employee entitled to during a period of service?\n       (a) The non-seniority rights and benefits to which an \n     employee is entitled during a period of service are those \n     that the employing office provides to similarly situated \n     employees by an agreement, policy, practice, or plan in \n     effect at the employee's workplace. These rights and benefits \n     include those in effect at the beginning of the employee's \n     employment and those established after employment began. They \n     also include those rights and benefits that become effective \n     during the employee's period of service and that are provided \n     to similarly situated employees on leave of absence.\n       (b) If the non-seniority benefits to which employees on \n     leave of absence are entitled vary according to the type of \n     leave, the employee must be given the most favorable \n     treatment accorded to any comparable form of leave when he or \n     she performs service in the uniformed services. In order to \n     determine whether any two types of leave are comparable, the \n     duration of the leave may be the most significant factor to \n     compare. For instance, a two-day funeral leave will not be \n     ``comparable'' to an extended leave for service in the \n     uniformed service. In addition to comparing the duration of \n     the absences, other factors such as the purpose of the leave \n     and the ability of the employee to choose when to take the \n     leave should also be considered.\n       (c) As a general matter, accrual of vacation leave is \n     considered to be a non-seniority benefit that must be \n     provided by an employing office to an employee on a military \n     leave of absence only if the employing office provides that \n     benefit to similarly situated employees on comparable leaves \n     of absence.\n       (d) Nothing in this section gives the employee rights or \n     benefits to which the employee otherwise would not be \n     entitled if the employee had remained continuously employed \n     with the employing office.\n     Sec. 1002.151  If the employing office provides full or \n         partial pay to the employee while he or she is on \n         military leave, is the employing office required to also \n         provide the non-seniority rights and benefits ordinarily \n         granted to similarly situated employees on furlough or \n         leave of absence?\n       Yes. If the employing office provides additional benefits \n     such as full or partial pay when the employee performs \n     service, the employing office is not excused from providing \n     other rights and benefits to which the employee is entitled \n     under the Act.\n     Sec. 1002.152  If employment is interrupted by a period of \n         service in the uniformed services, are there any \n         circumstances under which the employee is not entitled to \n         the non-seniority rights and benefits ordinarily granted \n         to similarly situated employees on furlough or leave of \n         absence?\n       If employment is interrupted by a period of service in the \n     uniformed services and the employee knowingly provides \n     written notice of intent not to return to the position of \n     employment after service in the uniformed services, he or she \n     is not entitled to those non-seniority rights and benefits. \n     The employee's written notice does not waive entitlement to \n     any other rights to which he or she is entitled under the \n     Act, including the right to reemployment after service.\n     Sec. 1002.153  If employment is interrupted by a period of \n         service in the uniformed services, is the employee \n         permitted upon request to use accrued vacation, annual or \n         similar leave with pay during the service? Can the \n         employer require the employee to use accrued leave during \n         a period of service?\n       (a) If employment is interrupted by a period of service, \n     the employee must be permitted upon request to use any \n     accrued vacation, annual, or similar leave with pay during \n     the period of service, in order to continue his or her \n     civilian pay. However, the employee is not entitled to use \n     sick leave that accrued with the employing office during a \n     period of service in the uniformed services, unless the \n     employing office allows employees to use sick leave for any \n     reason, or allows other similarly situated employees on \n     comparable furlough or leave of absence to use accrued paid \n     sick leave. Sick leave is usually not comparable to annual or \n     vacation leave; it is generally intended to provide income \n     when the employee or a family member is ill and the employee \n     is unable to work.\n       (b) The employing office may not require the employee to \n     use accrued vacation, annual, or similar leave during a \n     period of service in the uniformed services.\n\n[[Page S3198]]\n\n                          Health Plan Coverage\n\n     Sec. 1002.163  What types of health plans are covered by \n         USERRA?\n       (a) USERRA defines a health plan to include an insurance \n     policy or contract, medical or hospital service agreement, \n     membership or subscription contract, or arrangement under \n     which the employee's health services are provided or the \n     expenses of those services are paid.\n       (b) USERRA covers group health plans as defined in the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) at 29 \n     U.S.C. 1191b(a). USERRA applies to group health plans that \n     are subject to ERISA, and plans that are not subject to \n     ERISA, such as those sponsored by State or local governments \n     or religious organizations for their employees.\n       (c) USERRA covers multi-employer plans maintained pursuant \n     to one or more collective bargaining agreements between \n     employers and employee organizations. USERRA applies to \n     multi-employer plans as they are defined in ERISA at 29 \n     U.S.C. 1002(37). USERRA contains provisions that apply \n     specifically to multi-employer plans in certain situations.\n     Sec. 1002.164  What health plan coverage must the employing \n         office provide for the employee under USERRA?\n       If the employee has coverage under a health plan in \n     connection with his or her employment, the plan must permit \n     the employee to elect to continue the coverage for a certain \n     period of time as described below:\n       (a) When the employee is performing service in the \n     uniformed services, he or she is entitled to continuing \n     coverage for himself or herself (and dependents if the plan \n     offers dependent coverage) under a health plan provided in \n     connection with the employment. The plan must allow the \n     employee to elect to continue coverage for a period of time \n     that is the lesser of:\n       (1) The 24-month period beginning on the date on which the \n     employee's absence for the purpose of performing service \n     begins; or,\n       (2) The period beginning on the date on which the \n     employee's absence for the purpose of performing service \n     begins, and ending on the date on which he or she fails to \n     return from service or apply for a position of employment as \n     provided under sections 1002.115 123 of these regulations.\n       (b) USERRA does not require the employing office to \n     establish a health plan if there is no health plan coverage \n     in connection with the employment, or, where there is a plan, \n     to provide any particular type of coverage.\n       (c) USERRA does not require the employing office to permit \n     the employee to initiate new health plan coverage at the \n     beginning of a period of service if he or she did not \n     previously have such coverage.\n     Sec. 1002.165  How does the employee elect continuing health \n         plan coverage?\n       USERRA does not specify requirements for electing \n     continuing coverage. Health plan administrators may develop \n     reasonable requirements addressing how continuing coverage \n     may be elected, consistent with the terms of the plan and the \n     Act's exceptions to the requirement that the employee give \n     advance notice of service in the uniformed services. For \n     example, the employee cannot be precluded from electing \n     continuing health plan coverage under circumstances where it \n     is impossible or unreasonable for him or her to make a timely \n     election of coverage.\n     Sec. 1002.166  How much must the employee pay in order to \n         continue health plan coverage?\n       (a) If the employee performs service in the uniformed \n     service for fewer than 31 days, he or she cannot be required \n     to pay more than the regular employee share, if any, for \n     health plan coverage.\n       (b) If the employee performs service in the uniformed \n     service for 31 or more days, he or she may be required to pay \n     no more than 102% of the full premium under the plan, which \n     represents the employing office's share plus the employee's \n     share, plus 2% for administrative costs.\n       (c) USERRA does not specify requirements for methods of \n     paying for continuing coverage. Health plan administrators \n     may develop reasonable procedures for payment, consistent \n     with the terms of the plan.\n     Sec. 1002.167  What actions may a plan administrator take if \n         the employee does not elect or pay for continuing \n         coverage in a timely manner?\n       The actions a plan administrator may take regarding the \n     provision or cancellation of an employee's continuing \n     coverage depend on whether the employee is excused from the \n     requirement to give advance notice, whether the plan has \n     established reasonable rules for election of continuation \n     coverage, and whether the plan has established reasonable \n     rules for the payment for continuation coverage.\n       (a) No notice of service and no election of continuation \n     coverage:\n       If an employing office provides employment-based health \n     coverage to an employee who leaves employment for uniformed \n     service without giving advance notice of service, the plan \n     administrator may cancel the employee's health plan coverage \n     upon the employee's departure from employment for uniformed \n     service. However, in cases in which an employee's failure to \n     give advance notice of service was excused under the statute \n     because it was impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by \n     military necessity, the plan administrator must reinstate the \n     employee's health coverage retroactively upon his or her \n     election to continue coverage and payment of all unpaid \n     amounts due, and the employee must incur no administrative \n     reinstatement costs. In order to qualify for an exception to \n     the requirement of timely election of continuing health care, \n     an employee must first be excused from giving notice of \n     service under the statute.\n       (b) Notice of service but no election of continuing \n     coverage:\n       Plan administrators may develop reasonable requirements \n     addressing how continuing coverage may be elected. Where \n     health plans are also covered under the Consolidated Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, 26 U.S.C. 4980B (COBRA), \n     it may be reasonable for a health plan administrator to adopt \n     COBRA-compliant rules regarding election of continuing \n     coverage, as long as those rules do not conflict with any \n     provision of USERRA or this rule. If an employing office \n     provides employment-based health coverage to an employee who \n     leaves employment for uniformed service for a period of \n     service in excess of 30 days after having given advance \n     notice of service but without making an election regarding \n     continuing coverage, the plan administrator may cancel the \n     employee's health plan coverage upon the employee's departure \n     from employment for uniformed service, but must reinstate \n     coverage without the imposition of administrative \n     reinstatement costs under the following conditions:\n       (1) Plan administrators who have developed reasonable rules \n     regarding the period within which an employee may elect \n     continuing coverage must permit retroactive reinstatement of \n     uninterrupted coverage to the date of departure if the \n     employee elects continuing coverage and pays all unpaid \n     amounts due within the periods established by the plan;\n       (2) In cases in which plan administrators have not \n     developed rules regarding the period within which an employee \n     may elect continuing coverage, the plan must permit \n     retroactive reinstatement of uninterrupted coverage to the \n     date of departure upon the employee's election and payment of \n     all unpaid amounts at any time during the period established \n     in section 1002.164(a).\n       (c) Election of continuation coverage without timely \n     payment:\n       Health plan administrators may adopt reasonable rules \n     allowing cancellation of coverage if timely payment is not \n     made. Where health plans are covered under COBRA, it may be \n     reasonable for a health plan administrator to adopt COBRA-\n     compliant rules regarding payment for continuing coverage, as \n     long as those rules do not conflict with any provision of \n     USERRA or this rule.\n     Sec. 1002.168  If the employee's coverage was terminated at \n         the beginning of or during service, does his or her \n         coverage have to be reinstated upon reemployment?\n       (a) If health plan coverage for the employee or a dependent \n     was terminated by reason of service in the uniformed \n     services, that coverage must be reinstated upon reemployment. \n     An exclusion or waiting period may not be imposed in \n     connection with the reinstatement of coverage upon \n     reemployment, if an exclusion or waiting period would not \n     have been imposed had coverage not been terminated by reason \n     of such service.\n       (b) USERRA permits a health plan to impose an exclusion or \n     waiting period as to illnesses or injuries determined by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or \n     aggravated during, performance of service in the uniformed \n     services. The determination that the employee's illness or \n     injury was incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance \n     of service may only be made by the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs or his or her representative. Other coverage, for \n     injuries or illnesses that are not service-related (or for \n     the employee's dependents, if he or she has dependent \n     coverage), must be reinstated subject to paragraph (a) of \n     this section.\n     Sec. 1002.169  Can the employee elect to delay reinstatement \n         of health plan coverage until a date after the date he or \n         she is reemployed?\n       USERRA requires the employing office to reinstate health \n     plan coverage upon request at reemployment. USERRA permits \n     but does not require the employing office to allow the \n     employee to delay reinstatement of health plan coverage until \n     a date that is later than the date of reemployment.\n     Sec. 1002.170  In a multi-employer health plan, how is \n         liability allocated for employer contributions and \n         benefits arising under USERRA's health plan provisions?\n       Liability under a multi-employer plan for employer \n     contributions and benefits in connection with USERRA's health \n     plan provisions must be allocated either as the plan sponsor \n     provides, or, if the sponsor does not provide, to the \n     employee's last employer before his or her service. If the \n     last employer is no longer functional, liability for \n     continuing coverage is allocated to the health plan.\n     Sec. 1002.171  How does the continuation of health plan \n         benefits apply to a multi-employer plan that provides \n         health plan coverage through a health benefits account \n         system?\n       (a) Some employees receive health plan benefits provided \n     pursuant to a multi-employer plan that utilizes a health \n     benefits account system in which an employee accumulates \n     prospective health benefit eligibility, also commonly \n     referred to as ``dollar bank,'' ``credit bank,'' and ``hour \n     bank'' plans. In such cases, where an employee with a \n     positive health benefits account balance elects to continue \n     the coverage, the employee may further elect either option \n     below:\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\n       (1) The employee may expend his or her health account \n     balance during an absence from employment due to service in \n     the uniformed services in lieu of paying for the continuation \n     of coverage as set out in Sec. 1002.166. If an employee's \n     health account balance becomes depleted during the applicable \n     period provided for in Sec. 1002.164(a), the employee must be \n     permitted, at his or her option, to continue coverage \n     pursuant to Sec. 1002.166. Upon reemployment, the plan must \n     provide for immediate reinstatement of the employee as \n     required by Sec. 1002.168, but may require the employee to \n     pay the cost of the coverage until the employee earns the \n     credits necessary to sustain continued coverage in the plan.\n       (2) The employee may pay for continuation coverage as set \n     out in Sec. 1002.166, in order to maintain intact his or her \n     account balance as of the beginning date of the absence from \n     employment due to service in the uniformed services. This \n     option permits the employee to resume usage of the account \n     balance upon reemployment.\n       (b) Employers or plan administrators providing such plans \n     should counsel employees of their options set out in this \n     subsection.\n\n              Subpart E--Reemployment Rights and Benefits\n\n\n                          Prompt Reemployment\n\n     Sec. 1002.180  When is an employee entitled to be reemployed \n         by the employing office?\n       The employing office must promptly reemploy the employee \n     when he or she returns from a period of service if the \n     employee meets the Act's eligibility criteria as described in \n     Subpart C of these regulations.\n     Sec. 1002.181  How is ``prompt reemployment'' defined?\n       ``Prompt reemployment'' means as soon as practicable under \n     the circumstances of each case. Absent unusual circumstances, \n     reemployment must occur within two weeks of the employee's \n     application for reemployment. For example, prompt \n     reinstatement after a weekend National Guard duty generally \n     means the next regularly scheduled working day. On the other \n     hand, prompt reinstatement following several years of active \n     duty may require more time, because the employing office may \n     have to reassign or give notice to another employee who \n     occupied the returning employee's position.\n\n\n                         Reemployment Position\n\n     Sec. 1002.191  What position is the employee entitled to upon \n         reemployment?\n       As a general rule, the employee is entitled to reemployment \n     in the job position that he or she would have attained with \n     reasonable certainty if not for the absence due to uniformed \n     service. This position is known as the escalator position. \n     The principle behind the escalator position is that, if not \n     for the period of uniformed service, the employee could have \n     been promoted (or, alternatively, demoted, transferred, or \n     laid off) due to intervening events. The escalator principle \n     requires that the employee be reemployed in a position that \n     reflects with reasonable certainty the pay, benefits, \n     seniority, and other job perquisites, that he or she would \n     have attained if not for the period of service. Depending \n     upon the specific circumstances, the employing office may \n     have the option, or be required, to reemploy the employee in \n     a position other than the escalator position.\n     Sec. 1002.192  How is the specific reemployment position \n         determined?\n       In all cases, the starting point for determining the proper \n     reemployment position is the escalator position, which is the \n     job position that the employee would have attained if his or \n     her continuous employment had not been interrupted due to \n     uniformed service. Once this position is determined, the \n     employing office may have to consider several factors before \n     determining the appropriate reemployment position in any \n     particular case. Such factors may include the employee's \n     length of service, qualifications, and disability, if any. \n     The actual reemployment position may be either the escalator \n     position; the pre-service position; a position comparable to \n     the escalator or pre-service position; or, the nearest \n     approximation to one of these positions.\n     Sec. 1002.193  Does the reemployment position include \n         elements such as seniority, status, and rate of pay?\n       (a) Yes. The reemployment position includes the seniority, \n     status, and rate of pay that an employee would ordinarily \n     have attained in that position given his or her job history, \n     including prospects for future earnings and advancement. The \n     employing office must determine the seniority rights, status, \n     and rate of pay as though the employee had been continuously \n     employed during the period of service. The seniority rights, \n     status, and pay of an employment position include those \n     established (or changed) by a collective bargaining \n     agreement, employer policy, or employment practice. The \n     sources of seniority rights, status, and pay include \n     agreements, policies, and practices in effect at the \n     beginning of the employee's service, and any changes that may \n     have occurred during the period of service. In particular, \n     the employee's status in the reemployment position could \n     include opportunities for advancement, general working \n     conditions, job location, shift assignment, rank, \n     responsibility, and geographical location.\n       (b) If an opportunity for promotion, or eligibility for \n     promotion, that the employee missed during service is based \n     on a skills test or examination, then the employing office \n     should give him or her a reasonable amount of time to adjust \n     to the employment position and then give a skills test or \n     examination. No fixed amount of time for permitting \n     adjustment to reemployment will be deemed reasonable in all \n     cases. However, in determining a reasonable amount of time to \n     permit an employee to adjust to reemployment before \n     scheduling a makeup test or examination, an employing office \n     may take into account a variety of factors, including but not \n     limited to the length of time the returning employee was \n     absent from work, the level of difficulty of the test itself, \n     the typical time necessary to prepare or study for the test, \n     the duties and responsibilities of the reemployment position \n     and the promotional position, and the nature and \n     responsibilities of the service member while serving in the \n     uniformed service. If the employee is successful on the \n     makeup exam and, based on the results of that exam, there is \n     a reasonable certainty that he or she would have been \n     promoted, or made eligible for promotion, during the time \n     that the employee served in the uniformed service, then the \n     promotion or eligibility for promotion must be made effective \n     as of the date it would have occurred had employment not been \n     interrupted by uniformed service.\n     Sec. 1002.194  Can the application of the escalator principle \n         result in adverse consequences when the employee is \n         reemployed?\n       Yes. The Act does not prohibit lawful adverse job \n     consequences that result from the employee's restoration on \n     the seniority ladder. Depending on the circumstances, the \n     escalator principle may cause an employee to be reemployed in \n     a higher or lower position, laid off, or even terminated.\n       For example, if an employee's seniority or job \n     classification would have resulted in the employee being laid \n     off during the period of service, and the layoff continued \n     after the date of reemployment, reemployment would reinstate \n     the employee to layoff status. Similarly, the status of the \n     reemployment position requires the employing office to \n     assess what would have happened to such factors as the \n     employee's opportunities for advancement, working \n     conditions, job location, shift assignment, rank, \n     responsibility, and geographical location, if he or she \n     had remained continuously employed. The reemployment \n     position may involve transfer to another shift or \n     location, more or less strenuous working conditions, or \n     changed opportunities for advancement, depending upon the \n     application of the escalator principle.\n     Sec. 1002.195  What other factors can determine the \n         reemployment position?\n       Once the employee's escalator position is determined, other \n     factors may allow, or require, the employing office to \n     reemploy the employee in a position other than the escalator \n     position. These factors, which are explained in \n     Sec. Sec. 1002.196 through 1002.199, are:\n       (a) The length of the employee's most recent period of \n     uniformed service;\n       (b) The employee's qualifications; and,\n       (c) Whether the employee has a disability incurred or \n     aggravated during uniformed service.\n     Sec. 1002.196  What is the employee's reemployment position \n         if the period of service was less than 91 days?\n       Following a period of service in the uniformed services of \n     less than 91 days, the employee must be reemployed according \n     to the following priority:\n       (a) The employee must be reemployed in the escalator \n     position. He or she must be qualified to perform the duties \n     of this position. The employing office must make reasonable \n     efforts to help the employee become qualified to perform the \n     duties of this position.\n       (b) If the employee is not qualified to perform the duties \n     of the escalator position after reasonable efforts by the \n     employing office, the employee must be reemployed in the \n     position in which he or she was employed on the date that the \n     period of service began. The employee must be qualified to \n     perform the duties of this position. The employing office \n     must make reasonable efforts to help the employee become \n     qualified to perform the duties of this position.\n       (c) If the employee is not qualified to perform the duties \n     of the escalator position or the pre-service position, after \n     reasonable efforts by the employing office, he or she must be \n     reemployed in any other position that is the nearest \n     approximation first to the escalator position and then to the \n     pre-service position. The employee must be qualified to \n     perform the duties of this position. The employing office \n     must make reasonable efforts to help the employee become \n     qualified to perform the duties of this position.\n     Sec. 1002.197  What is the reemployment position if the \n         employee's period of service in the uniformed services \n         was more than 90 days?\n       Following a period of service of more than 90 days, the \n     employee must be reemployed according to the following \n     priority:\n       (a) The employee must be reemployed in the escalator \n     position or a position of like seniority, status, and pay. He \n     or she must be qualified to perform the duties of this \n     position. The employing office must make reasonable efforts \n     to help the employee become qualified to perform the duties \n     of this position.\n       (b) If the employee is not qualified to perform the duties \n     of the escalator position or a like position after reasonable \n     efforts by the employing office, the employee must be \n     reemployed in the position in which he or she was employed on \n     the date that the period of service began or in a position of \n     like seniority, status, and pay. The employee must be\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\n     qualified to perform the duties of this position. The \n     employing office must make reasonable efforts to help the \n     employee become qualified to perform the duties of this \n     position.\n       (c) If the employee is not qualified to perform the duties \n     of the escalator position, the pre-service position, or a \n     like position, after reasonable efforts by the employing \n     office, he or she must be reemployed in any other position \n     that is the nearest approximation first to the escalator \n     position and then to the pre-service position. The employee \n     must be qualified to perform the duties of this position. The \n     employing office must make reasonable efforts to help the \n     employee become qualified to perform the duties of this \n     position.\n     Sec. 1002.198  What efforts must the employing office make to \n         help the employee become qualified for the reemployment \n         position?\n       The employee must be qualified for the reemployment \n     position. The employing office must make reasonable efforts \n     to help the employee become qualified to perform the duties \n     of this position. The employing office is not required to \n     reemploy the employee on his or her return from service if he \n     or she cannot, after reasonable efforts by the employing \n     office, qualify for the appropriate reemployment position.\n       (a)(1) ``Qualified'' means that the employee has the \n     ability to perform the essential tasks of the position. The \n     employee's inability to perform one or more non-essential \n     tasks of a position does not make him or her unqualified.\n       (2) Whether a task is essential depends on several factors, \n     and these factors include but are not limited to:\n       (i) The employing office's judgment as to which functions \n     are essential;\n       (ii) Written job descriptions developed before the hiring \n     process begins;\n       (iii) The amount of time on the job spent performing the \n     function;\n       (iv) The consequences of not requiring the individual to \n     perform the function;\n       (v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement;\n       (vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; \n     and/or\n       (vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar \n     jobs.\n       (b) Only after the employing office makes reasonable \n     efforts, as defined in Sec. 1002.5(p), may it determine that \n     the employee is not qualified for the reemployment position. \n     These reasonable efforts must be made at no cost to the \n     employee.\n     Sec. 1002.199  What priority must the employing office follow \n         if two or more returning employees are entitled to \n         reemployment in the same position?\n       If two or more employees are entitled to reemployment in \n     the same position and more than one employee has reported or \n     applied for employment in that position, the employee who \n     first left the position for uniformed service has the first \n     priority on reemployment in that position. The remaining \n     employee (or employees) is entitled to be reemployed in a \n     position similar to that in which the employee would have \n     been re-employed according to the rules that normally \n     determine a reemployment position, as set out in \n     Sec. Sec. 1002.196 and 1002.197.\n\n\n                     Seniority Rights and Benefits\n\n     Sec. 1002.210  What seniority rights does an employee have \n         when reemployed following a period of uniformed service?\n       The employee is entitled to the seniority and seniority-\n     based rights and benefits that he or she had on the date the \n     uniformed service began, plus any seniority and seniority-\n     based rights and benefits that the employee would have \n     attained if he or she had remained continuously employed. The \n     employee is not entitled to any benefits to which he or she \n     would not have been entitled had the employee been \n     continuously employed with the employing office. In \n     determining entitlement to seniority and seniority-based \n     rights and benefits, the period of absence from employment \n     due to or necessitated by uniformed service is not considered \n     a break in employment. The rights and benefits protected by \n     USERRA upon reemployment include those provided by the \n     employing office and those required by statute.\n       For example, under USERRA, a reemployed service member \n     would be eligible for leave under the Family and Medical \n     Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. 2601-2654 (FMLA), if the number \n     of months and the number of hours of work for which the \n     service member was employed by the employing office, together \n     with the number of months and the number of hours of work for \n     which the service member would have been employed by the \n     employing office during the period of uniformed service, meet \n     FMLA's eligibility requirements. In the event that a service \n     member is denied FMLA leave for failing to satisfy the FMLA's \n     hours of work requirement due to absence from employment \n     necessitated by uniformed service, the service member may \n     have a cause of action under USERRA but not under the FMLA.\n     Sec. 1002.211  Does USERRA require the employing office to \n         use a seniority system?\n       No. USERRA does not require the employing office to adopt a \n     formal seniority system. USERRA defines seniority as \n     longevity in employment together with any employment benefits \n     that accrue with, or are determined by, longevity in \n     employment. In the absence of a formal seniority system, such \n     as one established through collective bargaining, USERRA \n     looks to the custom and practice in the place of employment \n     to determine the employee's entitlement to any employment \n     benefits that accrue with, or are determined by, longevity in \n     employment.\n     Sec. 1002.212  How does a person know whether a particular \n         right or benefit is a seniority-based right or benefit?\n       A seniority-based right or benefit is one that accrues \n     with, or is determined by, longevity in employment. \n     Generally, whether a right or benefit is seniority-based \n     depends on three factors:\n       (a) Whether the right or benefit is a reward for length of \n     service rather than a form of short-term compensation for \n     work performed;\n       (b) Whether it is reasonably certain that the employee \n     would have received the right or benefit if he or she had \n     remained continuously employed during the period of service; \n     and,\n       (c) Whether it is the employing office's actual custom or \n     practice to provide or withhold the right or benefit as a \n     reward for length of service.\n       Provisions of an employment contract or policies in the \n     employee handbook are not controlling if the employing \n     office's actual custom or practice is different from what is \n     written in the contract or handbook.\n     Sec. 1002.213  How can the employee demonstrate a reasonable \n         certainty that he or she would have received the \n         seniority right or benefit if he or she had remained \n         continuously employed during the period of service?\n       A reasonable certainty is a high probability that the \n     employee would have received the seniority or seniority-based \n     right or benefit if he or she had been continuously employed. \n     The employee does not have to establish that he or she would \n     have received the benefit as an absolute certainty. The \n     employee can demonstrate a reasonable certainty that he or \n     she would have received the seniority right or benefit by \n     showing that other employees with seniority similar to that \n     which the employee would have had if he or she had remained \n     continuously employed received the right or benefit. The \n     employing office cannot withhold the right or benefit based \n     on an assumption that a series of unlikely events could have \n     prevented the employee from gaining the right or benefit.\n\n\n                           Disabled Employees\n\n     Sec. 1002.225  Is the employee entitled to any specific \n         reemployment benefits if he or she has a disability that \n         was incurred in, or aggravated during, the period of \n         service?\n       Yes. A disabled service member is entitled, to the same \n     extent as any other individual, to the escalator position he \n     or she would have attained but for uniformed service. If the \n     employee has a disability incurred in, or aggravated during, \n     the period of service in the uniformed services, the \n     employing office must make reasonable efforts to accommodate \n     that disability and to help the employee become qualified to \n     perform the duties of his or her reemployment position. If \n     the employee is not qualified for reemployment in the \n     escalator position because of a disability after reasonable \n     efforts by the employing office to accommodate the disability \n     and to help the employee to become qualified, the employee \n     must be reemployed in a position according to the following \n     priority. The employing office must make reasonable efforts \n     to accommodate the employee's disability and to help him or \n     her to become qualified to perform the duties of one of these \n     positions:\n       (a) A position that is equivalent in seniority, status, and \n     pay to the escalator position; or,\n       (b) A position that is the nearest approximation to the \n     equivalent position, consistent with the circumstances of the \n     employee's case, in terms of seniority, status, and pay.\n       A position that is the nearest approximation to the \n     equivalent position may be a higher or lower position, \n     depending on the circumstances.\n     Sec. 1002.226  If the employee has a disability that was \n         incurred in, or aggravated during, the period of service, \n         what efforts must the employing office make to help him \n         or her become qualified for the reemployment position?\n       (a) USERRA requires that the employee be qualified for the \n     reemployment position regardless of any disability. The \n     employing office must make reasonable efforts to help the \n     employee to become qualified to perform the duties of this \n     position. The employing office is not required to reemploy \n     the employee on his or her return from service if he or she \n     cannot, after reasonable efforts by the employing office, \n     qualify for the appropriate reemployment position.\n       (b) ``Qualified'' has the same meaning here as in \n     Sec. 1002.198.\n\n\n                              Rate of Pay\n\n     Sec. 1002.236  How is the employee's rate of pay determined \n         when he or she returns from a period of service?\n       The employee's rate of pay is determined by applying the \n     same escalator principles that are used to determine the \n     reemployment position, as follows:\n       (a) If the employee is reemployed in the escalator \n     position, the employing office must compensate him or her at \n     the rate of pay associated with the escalator position. The \n     rate of pay must be determined by taking into account any pay \n     increases, differentials, step increases, merit increases, or \n     periodic increases that the employee would have attained with \n     reasonable certainty had he or she remained continuously \n     employed during\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\n     the period of service. In addition, when considering whether \n     merit or performance increases would have been attained with \n     reasonable certainty, an employing office may examine the \n     returning employee's own work history, his or her history of \n     merit increases, and the work and pay history of employees in \n     the same or similar position.\n       For example, if the employee missed a merit pay increase \n     while performing service, but qualified for previous merit \n     pay increases, then the rate of pay should include the merit \n     pay increase that was missed. If the merit pay increase that \n     the employee missed during service is based on a skills test \n     or examination, then the employing office should give the \n     employee a reasonable amount of time to adjust to the \n     reemployment position and then give him or her the skills \n     test or examination. No fixed amount of time for permitting \n     adjustment to reemployment will be deemed reasonable in all \n     cases. However, in determining a reasonable amount of time to \n     permit an employee to adjust to reemployment before \n     scheduling a makeup test or examination, an employing office \n     may take into account a variety of factors, including but not \n     limited to the length of time the returning employee was \n     absent from work, the level of difficulty of the test itself, \n     the typical time necessary to prepare or study for the test, \n     the duties and responsibilities of the reemployment position \n     and the promotional position, and the nature and \n     responsibilities of the service member while serving in the \n     uniformed service. The escalator principle also applies in \n     the event a pay reduction occurred in the reemployment \n     position during the period of service. Any pay adjustment \n     must be made effective as of the date it would have occurred \n     had the employee's employment not been interrupted by \n     uniformed service.\n       (b) If the employee is reemployed in the pre-service \n     position or another position, the employing office must \n     compensate him or her at the rate of pay associated with the \n     position in which he or she is reemployed. As with the \n     escalator position, the rate of pay must be determined by \n     taking into account any pay increases, differentials, step \n     increases, merit increases, or periodic increases that the \n     employee would have attained with reasonable certainty had he \n     or she remained continuously employed during the period of \n     service.\n\n\n                      Protection Against Discharge\n\n     Sec. 1002.247  Does USERRA provide the employee with \n         protection against discharge?\n       It depends. If the employee's most recent period of service \n     in the uniformed services was more than 30 days, a discharge \n     without cause may create a rebuttable presumption that there \n     has been a violation of USERRA--\n       (a) For 180 days after the employee's date of reemployment \n     if his or her most recent period of uniformed service was \n     more than 30 days but less than 181 days; or,\n       (b) For one year after the date of reemployment if the \n     employee's most recent period of uniformed service was more \n     than 180 days.\n     Sec. 1002.248  What constitutes cause for discharge under \n         USERRA?\n       The employee may be discharged for cause based either on \n     conduct or, in some circumstances, because of the application \n     of other legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons.\n       (a) In a discharge action based on conduct, the employing \n     office bears the burden of proving that it is reasonable to \n     discharge the employee for the conduct in question, and that \n     he or she had notice, which was express or can be fairly \n     implied, that the conduct would constitute cause for \n     discharge.\n       (b) If, based on the application of other legitimate \n     nondiscriminatory reasons, the employee's job position is \n     eliminated, or the employee is placed on layoff status, \n     either of these situations would constitute cause for \n     purposes of USERRA. The employing office bears the burden of \n     proving that the employee's job would have been eliminated or \n     that he or she would have been laid off.\n\n\n                         Pension Plan Benefits\n\n     Sec. 1002.259  How does USERRA protect an employee's pension \n         benefits?\n       On reemployment, the employee is treated as not having a \n     break in service with the employing office maintaining a \n     pension plan, for purposes of participation, vesting and \n     accrual of benefits, by reason of the period of absence from \n     employment due to or necessitated by service in the uniformed \n     services.\n       (a) Depending on the length of the employee's period of \n     service, he or she is entitled to take from one to ninety \n     days following service before reporting back to work or \n     applying for reemployment (See Sec. 1002.115). This period of \n     time must be treated as continuous service with the employing \n     office for purposes of determining participation, vesting and \n     accrual of pension benefits under the plan.\n       (b) If the employee is hospitalized for, or convalescing \n     from, an illness or injury incurred in, or aggravated during, \n     service, he or she is entitled to report to or submit an \n     application for reemployment at the end of the time period \n     necessary for him or her to recover from the illness or \n     injury. This period, which may not exceed two years from the \n     date the employee completed service, except in circumstances \n     beyond his or her control, must be treated as continuous \n     service with the employing office for purposes of determining \n     the participation, vesting and accrual of pension benefits \n     under the plan.\n     Sec. 1002.260  What pension benefit plans are covered under \n         USERRA?\n       (a) The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \n     (ERISA) defines an employee pension benefit plan as a plan \n     that provides retirement income to employees, or defers \n     employee income to a period extending to or beyond the \n     termination of employment. Any such plan maintained by the \n     employing office is covered under USERRA. USERRA also covers \n     certain pension plans not covered by ERISA, such as those \n     sponsored by a State, government entity, or church for its \n     employees.\n       (b) USERRA does not cover pension benefits under the \n     Federal Thrift Savings Plan; those benefits are covered under \n     5 U.S.C. 8432b.\n     Sec. 1002.261  Who is responsible for funding any plan \n         obligation to provide the employee with pension benefits?\n       With the exception of multi-employer plans, which have \n     separate rules discussed below, the employing office is \n     liable to the pension benefit plan to fund any obligation of \n     the plan to provide benefits that are attributable to the \n     employee's period of service. In the case of a defined \n     contribution plan, once the employee is reemployed, the \n     employing office must allocate the amount of its make-up \n     contribution for the employee, if any; the employee's make-up \n     contributions, if any; and the employee's elective deferrals, \n     if any; in the same manner and to the same extent that it \n     allocates the amounts for other employees during the period \n     of service. In the case of a defined benefit plan, the \n     employee's accrued benefit will be increased for the period \n     of service once he or she is reemployed and, if applicable, \n     has repaid any amounts previously paid to him or her from the \n     plan and made any employee contributions that may be required \n     to be made under the plan.\n     Sec. 1002.262  When is the employing office required to make \n         the plan contribution that is attributable to the \n         employee's period of uniformed service?\n       (a) The employing office is not required to make its \n     contribution until the employee is reemployed. For employer \n     contributions to a plan in which the employee is not required \n     or permitted to contribute, the employing office must make \n     the contribution attributable to the employee's period of \n     service no later than ninety days after the date of \n     reemployment, or when plan contributions are normally due for \n     the year in which the service in the uniformed services was \n     performed, whichever is later. If it is impossible or \n     unreasonable for the employing office to make the \n     contribution within this time period, the employer must make \n     the contribution as soon as practicable.\n       (b) If the employee is enrolled in a contributory plan, he \n     or she is allowed (but not required) to make up his or her \n     missed contributions or elective deferrals. These makeup \n     contributions, or elective deferrals, must be made during a \n     time period starting with the date of reemployment and \n     continuing for up to three times the length of the employee's \n     immediate past period of uniformed service, with the \n     repayment period not to exceed five years. Makeup \n     contributions or elective deferrals may only be made \n     during this period and while the employee is employed with \n     the post-service employing office.\n       (c) If the employee's plan is contributory and he or she \n     does not make up his or her contributions or elective \n     deferrals, he or she will not receive the employer match or \n     the accrued benefit attributable to his or her contribution. \n     This is true because the employing office is required to make \n     contributions that are contingent on or attributable to the \n     employee's contributions or elective deferrals only to the \n     extent that the employee makes up his or her payments to the \n     plan. Any employing office contributions that are contingent \n     on or attributable to the employee's make-up contributions or \n     elective deferrals must be made according to the plan's \n     requirements for employer matching contributions.\n       (d) The employee is not required to make up the full amount \n     of employee contributions or elective deferrals that he or \n     she missed making during the period of service. If the \n     employee does not make up all of the missed contributions or \n     elective deferrals, his or her pension may be less than if he \n     or she had done so.\n       (e) Any vested accrued benefit in the pension plan that the \n     employee was entitled to prior to the period of uniformed \n     service remains intact whether or not he or she chooses to be \n     reemployed under the Act after leaving the uniformed service.\n       (f) An adjustment will be made to the amount of employee \n     contributions or elective deferrals that the employee will be \n     able to make to the pension plan for any employee \n     contributions or elective deferrals he or she actually made \n     to the plan during the period of service.\n     Sec. 1002.263  Does the employee pay interest when he or she \n         makes up missed contributions or elective deferrals?\n       No. The employee is not required or permitted to make up a \n     missed contribution in an amount that exceeds the amount he \n     or she would have been permitted or required to contribute \n     had he or she remained continuously employed during the \n     period of service.\n     Sec. 1002.264  Is the employee allowed to repay a previous \n         distribution from a pension benefits plan upon being \n         reemployed?\n       Yes, provided the plan is a defined benefit plan. If the \n     employee received a distribution\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\n     of all or part of the accrued benefit from a defined benefit \n     plan in connection with his or her service in the uniformed \n     services before he or she became reemployed, he or she must \n     be allowed to repay the withdrawn amounts when he or she is \n     reemployed. The amount the employee must repay includes any \n     interest that would have accrued had the monies not been \n     withdrawn. The employee must be allowed to repay these \n     amounts during a time period starting with the date of \n     reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length \n     of the employee's immediate past period of uniformed service, \n     with the repayment period not to exceed five years (or such \n     longer time as may be agreed to between the employing office \n     and the employee), provided the employee is employed with the \n     post-service employing office during this period.\n     Sec. 1002.265  If the employee is reemployed with his or her \n         pre-service employing office, is the employee's pension \n         benefit the same as if he or she had remained \n         continuously employed?\n       The amount of the employee's pension benefit depends on the \n     type of pension plan.\n       (a) In a non-contributory defined benefit plan, where the \n     amount of the pension benefit is determined according to a \n     specific formula, the employee's benefit will be the same as \n     though he or she had remained continuously employed during \n     the period of service.\n       (b) In a contributory defined benefit plan, the employee \n     will need to make up contributions in order to have the same \n     benefit as if he or she had remained continuously employed \n     during the period of service.\n       (c) In a defined contribution plan, the benefit may not be \n     the same as if the employee had remained continuously \n     employed, even though the employee and the employing office \n     make up any contributions or elective deferrals attributable \n     to the period of service, because the employee is not \n     entitled to forfeitures and earnings or required to \n     experience losses that accrued during the period or periods \n     of service.\n     Sec. 1002.266  What are the obligations of a multi-employer \n         pension benefit plan under USERRA?\n       A multi-employer pension benefit plan is one to which more \n     than one employer is required to contribute, and which is \n     maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining \n     agreements between one or more employee organizations and \n     more than one employer. The Act uses ERISA's definition of a \n     multi-employer plan. In addition to the provisions of USERRA \n     that apply to all pension benefit plans, there are provisions \n     that apply specifically to multi-employer plans, as follows:\n       (a) The last employer that employed the employee before the \n     period of service is responsible for making the employer \n     contribution to the multi-employer plan, if the plan sponsor \n     does not provide otherwise. If the last employer is no longer \n     functional, the plan must nevertheless provide coverage to \n     the employee.\n       (b) An employer that contributes to a multi-employer plan \n     and that reemploys the employee pursuant to USERRA must \n     provide written notice of reemployment to the plan \n     administrator within 30 days after the date of reemployment. \n     The returning service member should notify the reemploying \n     employer that he or she has been reemployed pursuant to \n     USERRA. The 30-day period within which the reemploying \n     employer must provide written notice to the multi-\n     employer plan pursuant to this subsection does not begin \n     until the employer has knowledge that the employee was re-\n     employed pursuant to USERRA.\n       (c) The employee is entitled to the same employer \n     contribution whether he or she is reemployed by the pre-\n     service employer or by a different employer contributing to \n     the same multi-employer plan, provided that the pre-service \n     employer and the post-service employer share a common means \n     or practice of hiring the employee, such as common \n     participation in a union hiring hall.\n     Sec. 1002.267  How is compensation during the period of \n         service calculated in order to determine the employee's \n         pension benefits, if benefits are based on compensation?\n       In many pension benefit plans, the employee's compensation \n     determines the amount of his or her contribution or the \n     retirement benefit to which he or she is entitled.\n       (a) Where the employee's rate of compensation must be \n     calculated to determine pension entitlement, the calculation \n     must be made using the rate of pay that the employee would \n     have received but for the period of uniformed service.\n       (b)(1) Where the rate of pay the employee would have \n     received is not reasonably certain, the average rate of \n     compensation during the 12-month period prior to the period \n     of uniformed service must be used.\n       (2) Where the rate of pay the employee would have received \n     is not reasonably certain and he or she was employed for less \n     than 12 months prior to the period of uniformed service, the \n     average rate of compensation must be derived from this \n     shorter period of employment that preceded service.\n\n       Subpart F--Compliance Assistance, Enforcement and Remedies\n\n\n                         Compliance Assistance\n\n     Sec. 1002.277  What assistance does the Office of Compliance \n         provide to employees and employers concerning employment, \n         reemployment, or other rights and benefits under USERRA?\n       The Office of Compliance provides assistance to any person \n     or entity who is covered by the CAA with respect to \n     employment and reemployment rights and benefits under USERRA \n     as applied by the CAA. This assistance includes responding to \n     inquiries, and providing a program of education and \n     information on matters relating to USERRA.\n\n\n                       Investigation and Referral\n\n     Sec. 1002.288  How does a covered employee initiate a claim \n         alleging a violation of USERRA under the CAA?\n       (a) If an individual is claiming entitlement to employment \n     rights or benefits or reemployment rights or benefits and \n     alleges that an employing office has failed or refused, or is \n     about to fail or refuse, to comply with the Act, the \n     individual may file a complaint with the Office of \n     Compliance, after a required period of counseling and \n     mediation.\n       (b) To commence a proceeding, a covered employee alleging a \n     violation of the rights and protections of USERRA must \n     request counseling by the Office of Compliance no later than \n     180 days after the date of the alleged violation. If a \n     covered employee misses this deadline, the claim may be time \n     barred under the CAA.\n       (c) The following procedures are available under subchapter \n     IV of the CAA for covered employees who believe their rights \n     under USERRA as made applicable by the CAA have been \n     violated:\n       (1) counseling;\n       (2) mediation; and\n       (3) election of either--\n       (A) a formal complaint filed with the Office of Compliance \n     (which must meet the requirements as set forth in the Office \n     of Compliance Procedural Rules, Section 5.01(c)), and a \n     hearing before a hearing officer, subject to review by the \n     Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance, and judicial \n     review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \n     Circuit; or\n       (B) a civil action in a district court of the United \n     States.\n       (d) Regulations of the Office of Compliance describing and \n     governing these procedures can be found at 141 Cong. Rec. \n     H15645-H15655 (December 22, 1995) and 141 Cong. Rec. \n     19239, 143 Cong. Rec. H8316-H8317 (as amended, applying \n     USERRA to the Government Accountability Office and the \n     Library of Congress).\n\n\n     Enforcement of Rights and Benefits Against an Employing Office\n\n     Sec. 1002.303  Is a covered employee required to bring his or \n         her claim to the Office of Compliance?\n       Yes. All covered employees who file claims under Part A of \n     subchapter II of the CAA, which includes USERRA, are required \n     to go through counseling and mediation before electing to \n     file a civil action or a complaint with the Office of \n     Compliance.\n     Sec. 1002.308  Who has legal standing to bring a USERRA claim \n         under the CAA?\n       An action under Section 206 of the CAA may be brought by an \n     eligible employee, as defined by Section 1002.5 (f) of \n     Subpart A of these regulations. An action under 207(a) of the \n     CAA may be brought by a covered employee, as defined by \n     section 1002.5 (e) of Subpart A of these regulations. An \n     employing office, prospective employing office or other \n     similar entity may not bring an action under the Act.\n     Sec. 1002.309  Who is a necessary party in an action under \n         USERRA?\n       In an action under USERRA, only the covered employing \n     office or a potential covered employing office, as the case \n     may be, is a necessary party respondent. Under the Office of \n     Compliance Procedural Rules, a hearing officer has authority \n     to require the filing of briefs, memoranda of law, and the \n     presentation of oral argument. A hearing officer also may \n     order the production of evidence and the appearance of \n     witnesses.\n     Sec. 1002.310  How are fees and court costs charged or taxed \n         in an action under USERRA?\n       No fees or court costs may be charged or taxed against an \n     individual if he or she is claiming rights under the Act. If \n     a covered employee is a prevailing party with respect to any \n     claim under USERRA, the hearing officer, Board, or court may \n     award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and \n     other litigation expenses.\n     Sec. 1002.311  Is there a statute of limitations in an action \n         under USERRA?\n       USERRA does not have a statute of limitations. However, \n     Section 402 of the CAA requires an individual to bring a \n     request for counseling alleging a violation of the CAA no \n     later than 180 days after the date of the alleged violation. \n     A claim alleging a USERRA violation as applied by the CAA \n     would follow this requirement.\n     Sec. 1002.312  What remedies may be awarded for a violation \n         of USERRA?\n       In any action or proceeding the following relief may be \n     awarded:\n       (a) The court and/or hearing officer may require the \n     employing office to comply with the provisions of the Act;\n       (b) The court and/or hearing officer may require the \n     employing office to compensate the individual for any loss of \n     wages or benefits suffered by reason of the employing \n     office's failure to comply with the Act;\n       (c) The court and/or hearing officer may require the \n     employing office to pay the individual an amount equal to the \n     amount of lost wages and benefits as liquidated damages, if \n     the court and/or hearing officer determines that the \n     employing office's failure\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\n     to comply with the Act was willful. A violation shall be \n     considered to be willful if the employing office either knew \n     or showed reckless disregard for whether its conduct was \n     prohibited by the Act.\n       (d) Any wages, benefits, or liquidated damages awarded \n     under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are in addition \n     to, and must not diminish, any of the other rights and \n     benefits provided by USERRA (such as, for example, the right \n     to be employed or reemployed by the employing office).\n     Sec. 1002.314  May a court and/or hearing officer use its \n         equity powers in an action or proceeding under the Act?\n       Yes. A court and/or hearing officer may use its full equity \n     powers, including the issuance of temporary or permanent \n     injunctions, temporary restraining orders, and contempt \n     orders, to vindicate the rights or benefits guaranteed under \n     the Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/21/senate-section/article/S3203-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND WORK OF ALDO LEOPOLD\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, today I commemorate the life \nand work of Aldo Leopold, who is remembered as a pivotal figure in the \nconservation movement of the early 20th century. Today marks the 60th \nanniversary of Leopold's death, and it offers us an opportunity to \nreflect on the lasting contributions that he made to our country.\n  Born in Burlington, IA, in 1887, Aldo Leopold was raised near the \nMississippi River surrounded by a vibrant ecosystem that sustained \nabundant waterfowl and other wildlife. Early on, Leopold developed a \nkeen interest in the natural world, devoting much of his spare time to \ncataloguing his observations. Graduating from Yale in 1909 with a \nmaster of forestry degree, he soon joined the nascent U.S. Forest \nService with his first field assignments in the American Southwest. His \ncareer with the Forest Service brought him to my home State of New \nMexico, spending time working in the Gila National Forest in the \nsouthwest part of the State before subsequently moving north to the \nCarson National Forest, where he reached the post of forest supervisor \non the Carson.\n  Leopold felt that preservation had been neglected on the national \nforests. He foresaw the importance of preserving the biological \ndiversity and natural systems giving way to development. He argued \nagainst the proposed expansion of a road system into the back country \nof the Gila National Forest. And in Albuquerque in 1922, he proposed \ninstead that a large area be left roadless and preserved for wilderness \nrecreation. He defined this new concept as ``a continuous stretch of \ncountry preserved in its natural state, open to lawful hunting and \nfishing, big enough to absorb a 2 week's pack trip, and kept devoid of \nroads, artificial trails, cottages, or other works of man.'' On June 3, \n1924, the Forest Service gave its final approval and designated 755,000 \nacres of national forest land as the Gila Wilderness. This \nunprecedented act took place 40 years prior to passage of the \nWilderness Act and was the first such designation in the world.\n  Leopold once wrote that ``a thing is right when it tends to preserve \nthe integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.'' Today \nthe Gila Wilderness is inhabited by bear, wolf, deer, elk, beaver, \nbobcat, mountain lion, antelope, and wild turkey. It is a favorite \ndestination for hikers, backpackers, hunters and anglers who enjoy its \nmiles of fishing streams. The Gila Wilderness contains the cliff \ndwellings of the ancient Mogollon civilization as well as the campsites \nand battlegrounds of the Apache and the U.S. Cavalry. In fact, John \nMurray wrote in his book, ``The Gila Wilderness: A Hiking Guide,'' that \n``no other wilderness area in the Southwest so much embodies and \nreflects this national history and natural philosophy as does the \nGila.''\n  Aldo Leopold's concept of wilderness evolved over time and heavily \ninfluenced policy makers and the growing conservation community. He \nwrote, ``Wilderness is the raw material out of which man has hammered \nthe artifact called civilization. . . . To the laborer in the sweat of \nhis labor, the raw stuff on his anvil is an adversary to be conquered. \nSo was wilderness an adversary to the pioneer. But to the laborer in \nrepose, able for the moment to cast a philosophical eye on his world, \nthat same raw stuff is something to be loved and cherished, because it \ngives definition and meaning to his life.'' One person who shared that \ndefinition and meaning with Aldo Leopold was former New Mexico Senator \nClinton P. Anderson. In fact, due in large part to the conversations he \nhad with Leopold 40 years earlier, Senator Anderson led the effort in \nCongress to pass the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n  On April 21, 1948, at the age of 61, Aldo Leopold died of a heart \nattack while helping his neighbors fight a brush fire near his farm. \nJust 1 week earlier, Leopold had received word that his book of essays \nhad finally found a publisher. Published over a year after his death, \n``A Sand County Almanac'' remains one of Aldo Leopold's greatest \nlegacies to the conservation movement.\n  Leopold laments in ``A Sand County Almanac'' that progress in \nconservation is slow--a fact that hasn't changed much in modern times. \n``Despite nearly a century of propaganda,'' he wrote, ``conservation \nstill proceeds at a snail's pace; progress still consists largely of \nletterhead pieties and convention oratory. On the back forty we still \nslip two steps backward for each forward stride.'' On this anniversary \nof Aldo Leopold death, I am pleased that the Senate is once again \nmaking progress on protecting wilderness, through bills such as the \nWild Sky Wilderness Act that passed last week, and upcoming bills that \nare making their way through the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources. These bills are effective steps to preserve our heritage for \nfuture generations, consistent with the values for which Leopold \nadvocated so eloquently during his life, and I am pleased that so many \nSenators, on both sides of the aisle, have supported them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/21/senate-section/article/S3203-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3203-S3204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GLENNA GOODACRE\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Glenna \nGoodacre, who was recently named the Notable New Mexican of 2008 by the \nAlbuquerque Museum Foundation. Glenna is a nationally acclaimed \nsculptor whose works include designing the Sacagawea dollar coin and \nsculpting the Vietnam Women's Memorial here in Washington, DC.\n  A resident of New Mexico since 1983, Glenna was born in Lubbock, TX. \nShe graduated from Colorado College in Colorado Springs, CO. While \nobtaining her undergraduate degree, Glenna first showed her strong \nability to persevere in spite of defeatist-minded individuals. She \npursued her dream to become a sculptor despite the discouragement she \nfaced from her professor. At her graduation, she gave a commencement \naddress titled, ``Success Is the Greatest Revenge,'' a speech which \nreflected back on to the opposition she once faced.\n  Throughout her career, Glenna has created many awe-inspiring bronze \nsculptures. Her most ambitious piece, the Irish Memorial installed at \nPenn's Landing in Philadelphia, contains 35 life-size figures. She is \nalso credited with the creation of two 8-foot standing figures of \nRonald Reagan. One stands in the Reagan Library in California and the \nother at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma \nCity.\n  Glenna's countless accomplishments have won her the recognition of \nthe New Mexico Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts and the \nTexas Medal of Arts. In addition to these honors, she has also been \ninducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth. Although a fall \nin early 2007 threatened to end her dreams, Glenna bounced back to make \nexcellent progress in her rehabilitation and recovery. Her experience \neven inspired her to dedicate her piece titled ``Crossing the Prairie'' \nto St. Vincent Regional Medical Center, a facility which was credited \nwith saving her life.\n  The Notable New Mexican program celebrates the extraordinary \naccomplishments of people like Glenna. Every year since 2001, the \nAlbuquerque Museum Foundation honors a Notable for his or her high \nachievements, strong ties to New Mexico, and contributions to the \npublic good. This year, Glenna will join the ranks of former Notables \nsuch as artists Wilson Hurley and Georgia O'Keeffe, authors Tony \nHillerman and Rudolfo Anaya, and former Governor Bruce King.\n  It is with great honor that I speak before you today, Mr. President, \nto\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\ncommemorate the countless accomplishments of Glenna Goodacre. Again, I \ncongratulate her on being named the Notable New Mexican of \n2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/21/senate-section/article/S3204-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF JOHN DRUMMOND\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, today I ask the Senate to join me \nin recognizing State Senator John W. Drummond on the occasion of his \nretirement from the South Carolina State Senate. As a decorated \nmilitary hero, a successful businessman, and a respected public figure, \nSenator Drummond has left an indelible mark on the Palmetto State. He \nis a true public servant, guided not by desire for recognition but by \nthe desire to achieve great good for the state he serves.\n  Born in Greenwood, SC, John Drummond was the fourth of Jim and Fannie \nDrummond's seven children. His father worked for the Greenwood Cotton \nMill for many years before moving his family to a new mill village in \nNinety Six, where he excelled in academics and athletics. Eager to \nexpand his horizons, he seized the opportunity to serve in the military \nby joining the 263rd South Carolina Coast Artillery Regiment based in \nCharleston.\n  Senator Drummond distinguished himself in his training and landed a \npost as a bomber-fighter pilot in the 405th Fighter Group. The group \nreported for duty in the European theater of the war in March 1944. In \nhis initial months of service, Drummond provided air interdiction and \nclose air support, including involvement in a successful attack on a SS \nmess hall identified by information from the French Resistance.\n  After attaining the rank of captain, Drummond led his squadron while \nproviding air coverage for the Allied armada from German artillery \npositions on D-day and for ground troops in the months that followed.\n  On July 29, 1944, Drummond's plane was downed by antiaircraft fire. \nHe was badly injured after parachuting out at a low level and was \ncaptured by Germans and imprisoned for 10 months in a POW camp in \nBarth, Germany.\n  Finally freed by the Russian army after V-E Day, Drummond's valor \nearned him the Distinguished Flying Cross, two Purple Hearts, nine Air \nMedals, three Battle Stars, and a Presidential Citation.\n  Following a jubilant homecoming, Drummond gradually transitioned to \ncivilian life, marrying a hometown girl, Holly Self, and starting his \nyoung family which eventually included three sons.\n  After inheriting the Greenwood Petroleum Company, his aptitude for \nbusiness led him to the establishment of the Drummond Oil Company. \nSenator Drummond still serves as president of both of these successful \nenterprises.\n  Senator Drummond and his wife, fondly known as ``Ms. Holly,'' have \nlong played a leading role in the civic affairs of Greenwood County and \nthe town of Ninety Six. Both were devoted church members, and Ms. Holly \nis remembered for her dedication to the missions of the Ninety-Six \nBaptist Church as well as for her role as an enthusiastic advocate of \ntown preservation.\n  Interested in the economic prosperity of Greenwood, Senator Drummond \ndevoted his considerable talents as a respected business leader to the \nissues of business development and rural electrification affecting its \ncitizens.\n  After serving 2 years in the South Carolina House of Representatives, \nSenator Drummond campaigned and won a seat in the State Senate, a \nposition he has held for over forty years.\n  The longest serving State Senator in South Carolina history, his time \nin the legislature will be remembered for his ability to forge \nrelationships across racial, gender, and political lines, and his \nsincere desire to provide excellent representation and service for the \npeople of Greenwood County.\n  He has been widely described as a statesman, a position that is \nreflected by his current position as the senate's President Pro Tempore \nEmeritus.\n  As further proof of his remarkable leadership, he has been honored by \nthe establishment of the Drummond Center, an institute at Erskine \nCollege dedicated to promoting civil discourse across party lines for \nthe benefit of all South Carolinians.\n  Throughout his career, he has been the recipient of countless \nlegislative achievement and appreciation awards from a wide range of \ngroups and individuals, including the Order of the Palmetto, the \nhighest civilian honor awarded by the Governor.\n  John Drummond has served his State and Nation.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to maintain \neligibility, for Federal PLUS loans, of borrowers who are 90 or more \ndays delinquent on mortgage loan payments, or for whom foreclosure \nproceedings have been initiated, with respect to their primary \nresidence; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kennedy, Senator \nBrown, Senator Murray, Senator Sanders, and Senator Clinton to \nintroduce the PLUS Loan Borrower Protection Act of 2008. This bill is \ndesigned to ensure that students and parents can get access to PLUS \nLoans even if they have been caught up in the subprime mortgage crisis.\n  In recent months there have been indications that students may face a \nchallenge getting access to some Federal Stafford loans and private \neducation loans because of the growing credit crisis in the financial \nmarkets. While I am unaware of an instance to date when a student has \nbeen unable to secure a loan, the withdrawal of certain lenders, the \nongoing turmoil in U.S. credit markets and the absence of liquidity in \nthe student loan market have fueled concerns that a potential student \nloan credit crunch may be looming. One which could leave millions of \nstudents in a last-minute dash to secure the financial assistance they \nneed to attend college this academic year.\n  Last week I held a hearing in the Senate Banking Committee to examine \nthis issue and consider how to address this situation. Based on what I \nheard in that hearing I have contacted Treasury Secretary Paulson and \nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Bernanke to urge each of them to utilize \nall existing tools, including options allowing federally-backed and \nAAA-rated private student loans to be used as collateral at the Fed's \ntemporary secured lending facility, TSLF, and using the Federal \nFinancing Bank under Treasury to help prime the pump of liquidity, in \norder to help avert a funding crisis in the student loan market. I have \nalso cosponsored the Strengthening Student Aid for All Act to bring \nstability and certainty to several Federal financial aid programs. Sen. \nKennedy took the lead in introducing that legislation and I am proud to \nsupport him.\n  But during the hearing another element of this issue came to my \nattention--Federal PLUS loans. PLUS loans are supposed to be available \nto individuals who do not meet the financial needs tests of other \nFederal financial aid programs. But current law and regulation prevent \nindividuals who have been more than 90 days delinquent on a mortgage \npayment or who have gone through a foreclosure within the previous 5 \nyears from getting a PLUS loan. Normally that is a good standard to \nhave--it helps ensure that individuals do not get themselves so much \ninto debt that they cannot get out. But with our recent history in the \nsubprime mortgage market and the ensuing credit crisis, this \nrequirement can have a much broader and more damaging result--denying \ncollege education to the next generation. Individuals who may need PLUS \nloans more than ever this fall because other sources of aid and lending \nmay be unavailable, might be denied this aid because of the \nmismanagement of our housing market. This is unacceptable.\n  Ensuring that students have available and affordable access to a \ncollege education should be among our highest priorities. Our world is \ngrowing more complex by the day. Never has higher education been more \ncrucial to the success of our people and our country. Today, 60 percent \nof the new jobs being created by our economy require at least some \npost-secondary education. Compare that to a half-century ago, when only \n15 per cent of new jobs required some amount of college. If our \nchildren are to achieve their highest aspirations, and if our Nation's \neconomic backbone is to continue to remain strong, then we must ensure \nthat the doors of higher education remain open for all who have the \ndesire and ability to walk through them.\n  That is why we are introducing the PLUS Loan Borrower Protection Act \nof 2008 today. It would eliminate delinquency and foreclosures during \nthis tumultuous time from being a disqualifying factor in awarding PLUS \nloans. Lenders would still be able to make judgments about the credit \nof a PLUS loan borrower on the basis of other parts of their credit \nhistory. But if the only mark against a borrower is being caught up in \nthe current mortgage crisis, the lender could not disqualify them. \nGiven the current upheaval in our economy, this is a simple and \nnecessary step to make sure our children can still get a needed \neducation.\n  As the Congress moves to address access to student loans and the \ncurrent credit crisis, I will work to include this bill in our \nresponse.

We agreed today that \n     these countries will become members of NATO. Both nations \n     have made valuable contributions to Alliance operations.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a resolution \nSenator Specter and I have introduced supporting the goals and ideals \nof National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, which occurs \nthis month of April.\n  In the U.S. a person is sexually assaulted on average every two and a \nhalf minutes. One in six women and one in 33 men have been victims of \nrape or attempted rape. According to the Department of Justice, 191,670 \npeople in the United States were sexually assaulted in 2005. These are \ndisturbing statistics.\n  National Sexual Awareness and Prevention Month serves many valuable \npurposes. It provides a special opportunity to educate people about \nsexual violence and increase public awareness about the impact of this \ncrime that changes many lives forever and sometimes irrevocably.\n  It pays tribute to the many survivors of sexual violence and honors \ntheir compassionate efforts to help others in the face of their own \nanguish. Many courageous individuals, themselves survivors of sexual \nassault, rise above their own suffering to help assuage the pain of \nothers and assist in the prevention of sexual assault.\n  This resolution also recognizes and applauds the work of community \norganizations and other supporters who help survivors and promote \nprevention and awareness. These are important and vital services in the \nlives not only of those who have been assaulted but all of us. \nIncreasing public awareness helps in the fight to prevent sexual \nassault and reduce the number of people who are sexually assaulted, \nsaving those individuals from the nightmare others know all too well.\n  Sexual violence is a crime we must all work to eradicate. While women \ncomprise the majority of victims, this crime is perpetrated against \nwomen, children, and men. It is my goal that this resolution helps us \nto understand our role in assisting these individuals and preventing \nthis crime from happening in the future.\n  I ask all my colleagues to support this important resolution and \nencourage communities across our country to pay tribute to all those \nwhose lives have been touched by sexual assault and those who have \ndedicated their lives to work to end it.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/21/senate-section/article/S3210-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.
