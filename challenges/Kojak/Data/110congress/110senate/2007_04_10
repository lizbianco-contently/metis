Madam President, I too wish to welcome everyone back.\n  It had been my hope that the House of Representatives would have \nappointed conferees on the supplemental appropriations bill for the \ntroops before their departure. I think it is extremely important we \nfinish that bill and get it down to the President for the veto we \nbelieve is forthcoming over the language with regard to the troops, the \nlanguage which, in effect, dictates a withdrawal date and also the \nexcessive spending that is also a part of that\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n\nbill. So the sooner we can get through this process, the better.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a letter to me, week before last, \nindicating that if we push this into late April, it creates a lot of \nproblems for the troops. So we hope we can get through this process, \nresolve our differences, and get the money for the troops at the \nearliest possible time.\n  As the majority leader has indicated, we will be going forward with \nthe stem cell issue. There is an alternative proposal by Senator \nColeman and Senator Isakson that we think solves some of the ethical \nconcerns and which will be considered by the Senate. Both will be \nsubjected to the 60-vote threshold, and it is my hope the Coleman-\nIsakson bill, which could be signed by the President and will actually \nmake a difference, will make it through the legislative process and \ndown to the President for his signature.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before I go to my formal remarks I have \nprepared, as I indicated, I have had extensive conversations during the \npast week with Chairman Obey, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nand I think we have made progress as to where we need to go in order to \ndo this as soon as possible. There is some controversy over the time \nlimit. We know the President has indicated he needs the money right \naway, but even last year, when the Republicans were in charge, we \nfinished the supplemental bill in June and there were no complaints at \nthat time.\n  We have had a statement from the Congressional Research Service that \nthe money will last until sometime in July. Even the Pentagon itself \nhas indicated the money will last until around the first part of June. \nSo we are going to do the very best we can to complete this as quickly \nas possible. We know it is important, and we will move forward as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  During this week, since the House is not here, I intend to continue \nmy dialog with Chairman Obey. I have not spoken to the Speaker today, \nbut I have a meeting with her later, at 5 o'clock, and so we will move \nforward, and I appreciate the remarks of the Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4232-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4232-S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OPENING OF THE THIRD WORK PERIOD\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, throughout the world, Easter has been \ncelebrated. This was done on Sunday. On that joyous day, Pope Benedict \nspoke of the human condition with a very heavy heart, and I quote:\n\n       How many wounds--how much suffering there is in the world. \n     Nothing positive comes from Iraq, torn apart by continual \n     slaughter as the civilian population flees.\n\n  As we open the third work period this year, Pope Benedict's words \nweigh on my mind. I hope we will honor them as we continue to work in a \nbipartisan manner to address that suffering by moving America in a new \ndirection at home and abroad.\n  That was the promise we made to the American people when the 110th \nCongress opened 3 months ago; not a promise made only by Democrats but \nby Democrats and Republicans. Although we have only completed the first \ntwo work periods of the session, we have made considerable progress.\n  When we began in January, we knew all our goals depended on changing \nthe way Washington works. So our first order of business was passing \nthe toughest lobbying ethics reform legislation in our Nation's \nhistory. We were guided through that by the chairman of our Rules \nCommittee, Senator Feinstein.\n  Next, with the skill of Senators Kennedy and Baucus, we voted to give \nworking Americans a much deserved and long overdue raise by finally \nincreasing the minimum wage.\n  After the minimum wage, we addressed the fiscal mess left by the last \nCongress and passed a continuing resolution on a bipartisan basis, then \nenacted tough spending limits and limited earmarks for this fiscal \nyear.\n  We then set our sights on keeping our country safe by finally passing \nthe recommendations set forth by the 9/11 Commission, recommendations \nthat came many years ago. This legislation was led by Senator \nLieberman, as he skillfully led us on this long overdue legislation.\n  Next, we passed, under the guidance of our brilliant chairman, Kent \nConrad, a balanced budget that put American families first by cutting \ntaxes for working people, increasing investment for education, \nveterans, health care, and implementing the same pay-as-you-go rules \nthat every American family must follow.\n  While addressing these crucial priorities here at home--ethics \nreform, minimum wage, homeland security, a return to fiscal \nresponsibility, and a balanced budget for working families--we have \nalso continued to seek a new direction for the war in Iraq at every \nopportunity, as the American people called for us to do last November. \nThat is why we passed--with Senator Byrd and Senator Murray--last week \nan emergency supplemental appropriations bill that fully funded our \ntroops while also setting forth a new course in Iraq.\n  The President has put our troops in the middle of a civil war. That \nwas never supposed to be their mission. Every day the price we pay \ngrows worse--soon to be 3,300 American lives lost, tens of thousands \nmore wounded, and according to the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, 600,000 Iraqis have been killed. Our American Treasury has \nbeen depleted by about a $\\1/2\\ trillion because of this war. Yet there \nis still no end in sight for our troops or our taxpayers.\n  Let me be clear. Democrats are committed to giving our troops the \nfunds they need. The supplemental appropriations bill that we are \ntrying to send to President Bush will provide every dollar the \ncommander has requested and it will go further by providing funding to \naddress the unconscionable conditions at Walter Reed and the other \nmilitary health care facilities the President's budget left out.\n  Democrats are united in our commitment to fully funding our troops on \nthe ground in Iraq and here at home, but we are also committed to \nproviding our troops a strategy for success in Iraq, which President \nBush has failed to do from the very start of this war more than 4 years \nago.\n  Virtually all experts, military and civilian, agree the war cannot be \nwon militarily. Success can only come when all the political leaders in \nIraq reach a settlement. Even General Petraeus, who is our commander on \nthe ground there, said that only 20 percent of the war can be won \nmilitarily. It can only be won politically, diplomatically, and \neconomically. Eighty percent of the war must be conducted through \neconomics, through politics, and through diplomacy.\n  Pope Benedict, the spiritual leader of more than a billion people, \nsaid on Easter Sunday, and again I quote:\n\n       Nothing positive comes from Iraq, torn apart by continual \n     slaughter as the civilian population flees.\n\n  That is why we are telling the President he needs to make good on his \npromise to get the Iraqi people to meet the benchmarks they set for \nthemselves but have never followed through on. After 4 years, it is \nlong past time for Iraq to take responsibility for its own failures and \nits own future.\n  American troops are putting their lives at risk every single day, but \nIraqi leaders are not willing to take the political risk of governing \ntheir own country. That must change. That is what Congress is \ndemanding, that is what the American people, by a large majority, \ndemand. The President should be leading us in that direction, not \nthreatening to veto funding for our troops unless we rubberstamp his \nflawed plan.\n  Over the next 2 weeks, the President has an opportunity to work with \nCongress to let his views be heard on how to improve this bill. Speaker \nPelosi and I invited him last month to sit down and work with us to \ndevelop a strategy together. We remain ready to do that. But this will \nrequire a commitment by the President to move beyond the political \ntheater and take a seat at the table of negotiation, of compromise, of \ndirection change.\n  Recall the Pope's Easter message: ``Nothing positive comes from \nIraq.''\n  While we continue to press the President and his supporters in \nCongress to chart a new course in Iraq, we will move to the next set of \nissues crucial to the American people: expanding Federal funding for \nstem cell research, lowering Medicare prescription drug costs, \ndelivering a new national energy\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\npolicy, and implementing tough, fair immigration reform.\n  This week, we will focus the Senate's attention on S. 5, the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act. We will be led by Senators Harkin, \nKennedy, and Feinstein. Democrats and Republicans joined together last \nyear to pass legislation that would have made stem cell lines more \navailable to scientists, while at the same time strictly regulating how \nthey could be used. This legislation gives hope to millions of \nAmericans.\n  The actions of the Senate and House gave hope to as many as 100 \nmillion Americans and tens of thousands of Nevadans who suffer from \ncancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, heart \ndisease, and Lou Gehrig's disease. Sadly, President Bush vetoed that \nbipartisan bill, and as a result we must take on this urgent cause \nagain. This week, we will debate the Stem Cell Research Enhance Act and \nwill fight to see that it becomes law.\n\n  Following debate on the stem cell bill, we will turn our attention to \nreducing drug costs for senior citizens. The flaws in the Medicare drug \nprogram are well documented, but many of them can be traced back to one \nsimple fact: The current law puts drug companies and insurance \ncompanies ahead of seniors. Regardless of whether we supported or \nopposed the law that created the Medicare drug benefit, all of us want \nto make the program work better for seniors and people with \ndisabilities, and right now they are paying too much because the \nFederal Government is unable to negotiate lower priced drugs. S. 3, the \nMedicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 1967, will fix that \ninjustice by making it easier for the most vulnerable in our society to \nafford the medicine they need.\n  We are being told by the minority that they are not going to allow a \nprovision to be changed in the law which says Medicare can negotiate \nfor lower price drugs. Why? I guess they and the President believe that \nHMOs and insurance companies and all these managed care entities \ndeserve to have an advantage over Medicare. It is unfair. Medicare \nshould be able to negotiate for lower prices and, in effect, compete \nwith these money-hungry HMOs and insurance companies.\n  Next, we will move to energy legislation that will improve our \nnational security and protect our environment. For the past several \nweeks, gas prices have risen dramatically. Last week, they rose 11 \ncents--in 1 week. The average price I heard in this morning's news is \nabout $2.90 a gallon. In places in California, it is approaching $4 a \ngallon for gasoline. One reason for this spike is the fear premium \ncaused partially by the administration's inept foreign policy. Another \nreason is the empty words and unfunded promises of the administration's \nshortsighted energy policy. President Bush's budget choices have robbed \nthe Treasury of the funds we need to invest in a better, more \nsustainable energy policy, and his friends in the oil and energy \nindustry have failed to fill the void by investing in alternatives to \noil.\n  I am hopeful in the coming weeks the Senate will consider legislation \nthat will put us on the right track toward increased production and use \nof renewable fuels, renewable electricity, and energy-efficient \nproducts, buildings, and vehicles. This will improve our energy \nsecurity and reduce the risk of global warming.\n  After energy policy, we will focus on the challenge of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. We all agree America's immigration system is \nbroken; our borders remain unsecured. Our laws remain underenforced. \nEleven or twelve million undocumented immigrants continue to live in \nthe shadows. Last year, the Senate passed bipartisan immigration reform \nthat would have fixed our broken borders. Unfortunately, the \nlegislation fell victim to partisan politics in the House and to \ninaction by the President, so we must readdress the issue--again. We \nwill start with a bill that takes a tough and smart approach to fixing \nthe borders, cracking down on enforcement, and laying out a path to \nearned legal status for undocumented immigrants already here and \ncontributing to our society.\n  In January, we promised the American people a new era of open, honest \nGovernment. We promised a new direction that will put families and \nworking people, college students and senior citizens first. We also \npromised a new course in Iraq that honors the service of our men and \nwomen in uniform. Heaven knows we have tried, but the President is \ncharging forward with the same mindless strategy in Iraq that the Pope \ncalls a continual slaughter. Defined in the dictionary, slaughter is to \nkill in a bloody and violent manner and in large numbers. This \nslaughter must end. For the sake of humanity and our country, it should \nbe no more.\n  In these first few months, we have made progress. As we begin our \nthird work period, there is much left to be done, but I am confident \nthat with a continued commitment to bipartisanship, we will rise to the \nchallenges ahead and answer the call for renewal of the American dream.\n  It would be wrong for me not to end by saying we have had the \ncooperation, most of the time, from the minority. It has been most \nhelpful. We could not have passed these bills without the help of the \nRepublicans. I have a warm, cordial relationship with my counterpart, \nSenator McConnell. He is easy to work with. We have had some procedural \nbumps in the road, but we have worked through those, and as a result of \nthis we have been able to accomplish some good things for our country.\n  I apologize to my colleagues for taking the time I did, but I ask \nthat there will be a full hour for morning business--is that true?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4233-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I will take my 10 minutes this morning. \nI wanted to speak a little bit about the Iraq supplemental bill which \nis really the issue that is pending. We are not going to be able to get \nto it today, but nevertheless it is the pending unfinished business.\n  Despite what the majority leader has indicated, it is too bad we have \nnot been able to move this forward. The Senate went on Easter recess, \nof course. The majority stressed the importance of completing the bill \nbefore the end of March and getting it to the President without delay. \nDemocrats in the Senate, of course, have blocked votes on the amendment \nto supplement the part that we could have--where they indicated they \nwanted to speed up the process. Regrettably, we are now on the 64th day \nsince the President submitted his request to Congress, and we have \nstill not sent up a bill.\n  To make matters worse, we don't even have a conference committee in \nplace to work out the differences between the bill that has been passed \nin the Senate and the bill that has been passed in the House. The \nSenate is ready for a conference for this bill. The committee of the \nconferees has been announced, and they are prepared to get this work \ndone. On the other hand, the House of Representatives is on recess and \nno House conferees. So we are still held up, and will be, on the bill \nthat is really important and needs to be moved. While our troops at \nhome and overseas are facing funding uncertainties, the Democratic \nHouse leadership is taking a couple of weeks off. This makes it very \ndifficult.\n  We talked about what we are going to accomplish. It is interesting to \naccomplish it in the Senate, but it has to go through the House and the \nSenate and then to the President to have the impact the bill is \nsupposed to have. The Speaker of the House should call the Members back \nto Washington to complete the supplemental bill and get it to the \nPresident by the end of the week. I would like to associate myself with \nthe letter that was sent to the Speaker of the House asking her to call \nthe body back to Washington.\n  It is important to remind people that our troops did not take the \nweek off.\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nOur military leaders are in the best position to know the needs of our \ntroops. They have left no doubt that the funding is urgent and needed \nwithout strings and pork.\n  Last week, my staff met with General Mattis and General Lehnert of \nthe U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton. For those of you who do not \nknow General Mattis, he is a straight-shooter, my kind of marine. He \noffered a grim assessment of the barracks the marines will be returning \nhome to. His report concluded that conditions are unacceptable for the \nmarines and sailors who have just returned from the combat environment. \nRepairs and maintenance are needed. The service is ready to act. \nUnfortunately, the first items that will be cut when funding begins to \ndry up will be this maintenance. So, even though certainly we will have \nto get money to the troops, this delay will have an impact on the \ntroops who are returning. More and more marines and their families will \nbe seeking counseling, and there will be cuts in the counseling \nprograms that are available for our returning service people. These \nprograms may not be available if we do not move forward. Of course, as \nI said, it has been 64 days since the start of this issue. Certainly we \nneed to take care of our marines' mental health and see to it that they \nare not living in dilapidated barracks and we are going to have to work \nhard to get this done. It is very simple. We can do that.\n  Over the Easter break, I joined with others welcoming home the \nWyoming Army National Guard's 2nd Battalion, 300th Field Artillery \nUnit. Let me tell you, to get these troops back home was one of the \ngreat events I have seen in a very long time. Like those who came home \nbefore them, I am so proud of their service and their sacrifices. Given \nthe lack of passage of the supplemental that was submitted to Congress \n64 days ago, I am not sure their return would have happened if it had \nbeen scheduled for a few months from now.\n  Our first and only priority should be the funding to our troops in \nthe field. Unfortunately, the emergency legislation is larded up with \npork and extraneous measures. Not only does the legislation attempt to \ntie the President's hands by micromanaging, but the majority is trying \nto push through pet projects at the expense of funding our troops.\n  When the House does return and finally appoints conferees, I hope \nthis Congress does the responsible thing and sends the President a \nclean bill. Our troops deserve that the Congress give them the funding \nthey need to succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, during the week we were back in our \nhome States getting acquainted with our constituents, there was more \ngood news on the economy. I had expected to spend my 10 minutes here \ntalking about the economy. I will do that briefly, but I intend to move \nto another issue which came out during the week of recess which I think \ndeserves comment.\n  The news came out about the number of new jobs created in the month \nof March and a revision upward of the number of new jobs created in \nFebruary. Without going through the details, I will summarize what this \nnews really means with respect to the recovery as a whole.\n  Ever since the economy started its recovery after the recession that \nbegan in mid-2000, we have created, now, more than 150,000 new jobs \nevery month; every month, 150,000 new jobs over a period of more than \n40 months. That sounds impressive, but let's go behind the figures and \nlook at what is really happening in the economy to understand how \nimpressive it should be.\n  Oversimplifying but taking a number that describes what is happening, \nevery month approximately 900,000 Americans lose their jobs. Their \ncompany goes out of business, the company cuts back, things change, \nthey retire and the job is not replaced--whatever it may be, every \nmonth roughly 900,000 jobs disappear.\n  In order for us to be able to say accurately that we have created \nmore than 150,000 new jobs every month, that means the number of new \njobs created every month is not 150,000, it is 1,050,000, to produce a \nnet of 150,000. To produce 1,050,000 new jobs every month for over 41 \nmonths--which is the record of this economy and this recovery--is \npretty extraordinary. Frankly, it is unusual. We take it for granted in \nAmerica because it happens in our dynamic economy almost automatically. \nIf you go to other economies in the world, you find that this does not \nhappen. Unemployment is high, is stagnant, is continual.\n  I was in Europe a month or so ago, and picking up an international \npaper, it said: The German economy is coming back. Unemployment is now \ndown. And then there was another headline that said: The American \neconomy is fairly stagnant; unemployment is stable.\n  We found, during the break, unemployment hit 4.4 percent. It is as \nlow as it was at the end of the last economic boom. The Germans were \nexcited that their unemployment record was now out of double digits, \ngetting down into the 9, maybe even 8 percent level. That is exciting \nfor them.\n  The American economy is doing well and does not get the credit it \ndeserves. Perhaps it is the political atmosphere in which we operate, \nbut we keep hearing this described as the Rodney Dangerfield recovery.\n  It is strong. It is powerful. It is creating new jobs. But if you \nlisten to some, it is in a state of constant disaster. The figures that \ncame out during the break made it clear: The economy is not in a state \nof constant disaster; the economy is still strong.\n  However, there was something else that came out during the break \nwhich I think deserves some comment. I turn for my text in this matter \nto a source that is not usually thought of as being particularly \nfriendly to Republicans. I am talking about the Washington Post \neditorial page.\n  I was a little stunned, out in Utah dealing with my constituents and \ngetting reacquainted with some real people who have different kinds of \npriorities than those we normally have here in Washington, to read \nabout Speaker Pelosi's venture into the Middle East. I picked up, via \nthe Internet, an e-mail, a copy of the editorial that ran in the \nWashington Post.\n  I think it deserves some review. It is entitled: ``Pratfall in \nDamascus,'' and the subhead is: ``Nancy Pelosi's foolish shuttle \ndiplomacy.'' The opening paragraph begins this way: House Speaker  \nNancy Pelosi offered an excellent demonstration yesterday of why \nMembers of Congress should not attempt to supplant the Secretary of \nState when traveling abroad.\n  I have traveled abroad, Madam President, as have you. I went abroad \nwhen Bill Clinton was the President of the United States, and I \ntraveled with Phil Gramm of Texas. I do not think anybody has ever \naccused Phil Gramm of Texas of being particularly fond of Bill Clinton. \nEvery country we went to where Senator Gramm was leading the \ndelegation, the first place we went was to the Embassy. Senator Gramm \nsaid over and over again to these ambassadors, every one of whom had \nbeen appointed by President Clinton: We are here to help you, Mr. \nAmbassador, or Madam Ambassador. Tell us what we can do in this country \nwhere you are representing the United States that can be of value to \nyou. How can a congressional delegation of varying sizes--usually \nfairly large--be supportive of the work you are doing in this country?\n  Then when we met with leaders of the country, whether it would be the \nchief of government or the chief of state, sometimes both, or lower \nlevel officials, we always had in mind what we could say and do to \nsupport the Clinton State Department's position as represented by the \nClinton Ambassador.\n  I have traveled with the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid. We have \ngone to various places in Europe and in South America. In every \ninstance, Senator Reid went out of his way to make contact with the \nU.S. Ambassador appointed by President Bush, and to make sure our \ndelegation was properly briefed by that ambassador to make sure we did \nnot do something stupid out of our ignorance while we were in that \nparticular country.\n  I contrast that behavior by Republicans traveling abroad, behavior by \nDemocrats traveling abroad, with the kind of behavior we saw from \nSpeaker\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\nPelosi. I go back to the Washington Post editorial. I must read in its \nentirety the final paragraph, because it lays it out far better than I \ncan.\n  The paragraph refers to a statement by Nancy Pelosi:\n\n       We came in friendship, hope and determined that the road to \n     Damascus is a road to peace.\n\n  Then the editorial says, and I quote:\n\n       Never mind that that statement is ludicrous: As any \n     diplomat with knowledge of the region could have told Ms. \n     Pelosi, Mr. Assad is a corrupt thug whose overriding priority \n     at the moment is not peace with Israel but heading off U.N. \n     charges that he orchestrated the murder of the former \n     Lebanese prime minister. The really striking development here \n     is the attempt by a Democratic Congressional leader to \n     substitute her own foreign policy for that of the sitting \n     Republican President. Two weeks ago Ms. Pelosi rammed \n     legislation through the House of Representatives that would \n     strip Mr. Bush of his authority as commander-in-chief to \n     manage troop movements in Iraq. Now she is attempting to \n     introduce a new Middle East policy that directly conflicts \n     with that of the President.\n       We have found much to criticize in Mr. Bush's military \n     strategy and regional diplomacy, but Ms. Pelosi's attempt to \n     establish a shadow Presidency is not only counterproductive, \n     it is foolish.\n\n  That happened while we were on break. There are some who hope it \ndisappears in memory, and in the words of George Orwell, that it goes \ndown the memory hole and never gets called up again.\n  I was going to talk entirely about the economy, but I think this is \nsomething, now that we are back in session, that we should take time to \ntalk about. I hope with this kind of scolding from the Washington \nPost--I understand there were other newspapers also that took the same \nposition, newspapers that are not favorable to Republicans generally--I \nwould hope the Speaker would realize she has made a rookie mistake and \nthat she will not do it again.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4235-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, listening to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, I could not help but agree with him that it is refreshing to \ngo back to our States to talk to people whose priorities are different \nfrom those in Washington, DC, and to sort of decompress a little bit \nand get in touch with reality once again.\n  Washington, DC is a fascinating place, but it is kind of like coming \nto Disneyland in some ways. It is not real in many respects, although \nas we all know, important decisions are made here that affect the lives \nof all 300 million people in the United States and people all across \nthe world.\n  It is one of those decisions, or should I say nondecisions, that I \nwill rise to speak on briefly this morning. It is more in sorrow than \nin anger, but I am speaking specifically of the fact that it has been \nmore than 60 days since the President sent up an emergency war spending \nbill to Congress. Now 60 days, more than 60 days, have passed, and the \ntroops still do not have the money and the House of Representatives has \nyet to appoint conferees so we can move forward on getting that money \nto our troops. In fact, the House is in recess for an additional week. \nOur men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan, of course, do not have the \nliberty of taking a recess in the middle of the battle they have so \nnobly and valiantly committed themselves to fight. While they are \nliving up to their responsibilities, I think it is important for \nCongress to live up to its responsibilities too. Of course, the message \nthey are seeing is more than a little bit confusing, and I regret that, \nhonestly, because while the Senate majority leader, Senator Reid, at \none point has said we are not going to do anything to limit funding or \nto cut off funds--he made that comment on November 30, 2006--on April \n2, 2007, he made the announcement that, in fact, he was going to \ncosponsor Senator Feingold's legislation that would do exactly what he \nsaid he wouldn't do a few short months before; that is, cut off funds \nto support the troops.\n\n  Notwithstanding that position, we did, in fact, pass the funding \nbill, but, unfortunately, it contained unnecessary spending and in \neffect a surrender date for our enemy to see. I cannot bring myself to \nunderstand how someone can say they support the troops with the \nsurrender date or porkbarrel spending necessary to secure the votes to \npass it, because it could not pass on its own merits.\n  I have, in fact, joined the rest of the Senate and House Republican \nleadership in sending a letter to Speaker Pelosi, urging her to call \nthe House back into session immediately so Congress can finish its work \non this important emergency spending bill.\n  Keep in mind, funding for these troops has been pending since \nFebruary 5, and because of the unnecessary strictures on the \nPresident's authority as Commander in Chief, where Congress has, in \neffect, deemed to act like an armchair general, all 535 of us, to \ndictate the tactics of the battle 6,000 miles away, the President said \nhe is likely to veto the bill unless it is changed substantially \nthrough a conference committee. The Senate, of course, appointed \nconferees on March 29, but the House never did, despite passing the \nbill a week earlier.\n  Senator Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, said he hoped the \nconference committee would begin on March 30, but, unfortunately, that \nhasn't happened, and again our troops still do not have the resources \nthey need.\n  Lest there be any doubt, this is what the Army Chief of Staff, \nGeneral Schoomaker, has said: Without approval of the supplemental \nfunds in April, we will be forced to take increasingly Draconian \nmeasures which will impact Army readiness and impose hardships on our \nsoldiers and their families.\n  Secretary of Defense Gates also emphasized the danger of delay. He \nsaid: This kind of disruption to key programs will have a genuinely \nadverse effect on the readiness of the Army and the quality of life for \nsoldiers and their families.\n  Some have suggested this is all a bluff, and that our military can \nwait until July to get the funding from this emergency supplemental. \nThat is simply not correct. As a matter of fact, Secretary Gates listed \nthe specific cuts the Army would be forced to consider in the upcoming \nmonths. He said: If the supplemental is not passed by April 15, the \nArmy--which has the majority of all forces in Iraq--could have to \ncurtail and suspend home station training for National Guard units, \nslow the training of units headed to the wars, stop paying for \nfacilities upgrades at home bases, and stop repairing gear needed for \npredeployment training.\n  He said: If May 15 comes and goes without passage and seeing the \nfunds go to the troops, even more devastating cuts would result, \nincluding a slowdown in depot repair work, slowing brigade combat team \ntraining, which would force the extension of units in theater--in other \nwords, the troops could not rotate back on a timely basis as they and \ntheir families expect they will--and it would cause the implementation \nof a hiring freeze, among other moves.\n  I cannot understand how we can claim to support our troops and yet \nput them in increased jeopardy as a result of our failure to act. That \nis why I believe it is so important that we get these funds to the \ntroops as soon as we can, stripped of these extraneous strictures on \nour troops, artificial deadlines sending a white flag of surrender, \nletting our enemy know when we are going to quit. It needs to be \nstripped of those provisions as well as the porkbarrel spending our \ntroops ought not to have to bear, in addition to the other burden they \nand their families bear on our behalf.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka).

Mr. President, I rise today in morning business to \nspeak about the passing of an extraordinary man. Today, in Baton Rouge, \nin the capital, the son of a sharecropper will lie in state. It is a \nfitting tribute to Coach Eddie Robinson, the winningest\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\ncoach in the history of football, but a man who excelled beyond the \nplaying field, a man whose life touched hundreds and thousands of \nathletes, on the field and off, and millions of lives in a positive way \naround the world.\n  I rise to pay him tribute today. He is a true American hero. He began \ncoaching in 1941 at Grambling State University. During his 57-year \ncoaching tenure, he won more than 400 football games--more than any \nother coach before him--and 17 championships in the Southwestern \nAthletic Conference.\n  Coach Robinson shattered the glass ceiling that had always held back \nthe true potential of African-American players and coaches. He did it \nwith a strong and indomitable spirit and with determination and love of \ncountry.\n  In a time before the civil rights movement, when overt and state-\nsponsored racism was the order of the day and permeated both college \nand professional sports, Coach Robinson proved that all athletes \ndeserve to compete on the same playing field.\n  Through the years, more than 200 of his players have played in the \nNFL, including Paul ``Tank'' Younger, the first NFL player from a \npredominantly African-American college.\n  Coach Robinson was personally responsible for paving the way for \nhundreds of African-American players to have the opportunity to play in \nthe NFL and, as well, to play in majority White colleges and \nuniversities throughout the country.\n  His legacy includes one of the most exciting annual matchups in \ncollege sports held every year: the Thanksgiving Bayou Classic football \ngame, held usually in New Orleans, LA, between Grambling State, his \nbeloved university, and Southern University of Baton Rouge.\n  But his achievements are not limited to his athletic victories. He \ntaught the players the meaning of teamwork and patriotism, self-respect \nand hard work. He provided them with real lessons of life that extended \nfar beyond the playing field.\n  After their experience at Grambling, I know how proud he was to see \nhis young athletes excel and move all over the world, impacting the \nwider community in business and in athletics, as well as in general \ncommunity service in multiple ways.\n  He leaves behind a vibrant legacy. He leaves behind a legacy of \nmentorship that is truly unmatched. He leaves behind a loving and \nwonderful family, a faith that permeated his entire life and had impact \nthroughout the community. He leaves behind a life well lived and a \nmodel for all.\n  One of his former players said it best when he said: ``Everyone \nwanted to be like Eddie.''\n  Mr. President, I close these remarks today by saying that I, like \nmost everyone in Louisiana, knew Coach Robinson. We had been in his \npresence. We had watched him coach. We had heard him laugh. I had the \ngreat privilege of spending some time with him recently at his home in \nGrambling, with his wife Doris and some of the family members. I could \nnot help to be, even at his late age of 88, impressed with his strong \nand wonderful spirit. When he was just a few years younger, as he \nwalked into the room, you could feel that spirit immediately.\n  So it is with great sadness that we say good-bye to Coach Eddie \nRobinson. But it is with great joy we share with the world this man, \nthe son of a sharecropper, a man who refused to let the limits of even \nthe laws of those times and the limits of the culture in which he lived \nto stop him or to stop his belief in the young men and women he coached \nand served.\n  So we say good-bye today. But he is getting a proper tribute lying in \nstate at our State capital in Baton Rouge, and we are confident his \nlegacy will live on.\n  In my last visit with his family, I hoped and suggested we could \nbuild a museum in his honor. I am hoping it is something in which \nMembers of this Congress will join with our leaders at home--not just \nany museum but a museum that will honor his life and legacy; a place \nwhere athletes, professional and amateur, could receive ongoing \ntraining and support both scholastically as well as in terms of general \nleadership, so his legacy could live on. Perhaps this place or the \ncenter of learning and leadership should be located either on or \nsomewhere very near the Grambling campus where he served for so many \nyears.\n  So, again, it is with great sadness we say good-bye, but with great \npride in a true American hero, Eddie Robinson.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \nrepresentation of the Committee on Finance in a proceeding in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. The Finance Committee has \nobtained from that court, in connection with a hearing the committee is \nholding this Thursday, a writ compelling the production of a Federal \nprisoner, whom the committee has scheduled to appear as a witness \nbefore it.\n  Notwithstanding the long history of congressional committee seeking, \nand the court's approving, such writs to authorize the production of \nFederal prisoners to provide needed testimony before Congress, the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice has moved to quash the writ in response to \nobjections made by the Bureau of Prisons to decisions the committee \nmade about the organization of its hearing and presentation of its \nwitnesses. The Justice Department's motion to quash challenges the \nauthority of the court to issue a writ compelling a federal prisoner to \nbe produced to appear in a congressional as opposed to a judicial \nproceeding.\n  This resolution will authorize the Senate legal counsel to represent \nthe Finance Committee in connection with this proceeding in order to \nprotect the committee's interests in obtaining testimony it needs.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration en bloc of S. 5 and S. 30, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 5) to amend the Public Health Service Act to \n     provide for human embryonic stem cell research.\n       A bill (S. 30) to intensify research to derive human \n     pluripotent stem cell lines.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I noted as the clerk reported the bill, S. \n5, she reported it as an amendment to the Public Health Service Act, \nand that is what this debate is all about and that is what this vote is \ngoing to be about. It is going to be about public health of people in \nthis country and around the world and whether they are going to have \nhope that they will see a future in which modern medical science can \nactually overcome and cure things such as Parkinson's disease, \nAlzheimer's, heart disease, spinal cord injuries, and a host of other \nillnesses. That is what this debate is about. It is about hope. It is \nabout health. So today begins 20 hours of Senate debate on a bill to \nlift the administration's restrictions on stem cell research and bring \nhope to millions of people in this country who are suffering from \nillnesses such as ALS, juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's, spinal cord \ninjuries, and so many other devastating diseases and conditions.\n  Most Americans probably find it hard to believe we are still arguing \nabout this issue. They want more stem cell research. They have listened \nto the scientists. They have watched the House and Senate vote \noverwhelmingly during the last Congress to expand the administration's \npolicy. Then they went to the polls in November and more often than not \nelected candidates who support stem cell research. So why are we still \ndebating this? The answer, unfortunately, is simple: President Bush \nused his first--and so far only--veto of his administration to reject \nlast year's stem cell bill and dash the hopes of millions of Americans. \nSo we are back once again.\n  I thank my colleagues in the Senate who have worked together on this \nissue, starting, of course, with my colleague Senator Arlen Specter of \nPennsylvania. He chaired the very first hearing in Congress on \nembryonic stem cells in December of 1998. In all, our Labor, Health, \nand Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee has held \n20 hearings on this research since then under the chairmanship of \nSenator Specter. I also thank the other Senate leaders on stem cell \nresearch, including Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, Senator Smith, and \nSenator Feinstein. So counting Senator Specter and me, there are three \nRepublicans and three Democrats on that list, and this has truly been a \nbipartisan effort all the way. I thank our majority leader Senator Reid \nfor scheduling this debate and making sure it is one of the first \nissues we vote on in the 110th Congress. I also thank our Republican \nleader Senator McConnell for working with us to schedule this debate \nand this vote tomorrow.\n  Most of all, I thank the hundreds of thousands of families and \npatients who never gave up, who kept up the pressure to bring this bill \nto the floor and who were so eager to see S. 5 sent to the President's \ndesk. They have kept the faith and now it is our job to see that they \nare not disappointed.\n  There is probably one other entity I should thank and that is the \nHouse of Representatives, under the able leadership of Speaker Pelosi, \nwhich passed this bill earlier this year and sent it over to the \nSenate. I will talk a little bit later about how our bill differs from \ntheirs, but nonetheless, the bill they passed is a bill that mirrors \nthe same thing we are doing here, and that is to lift the restrictions \non embryonic stem cell research.\n  Under this unanimous consent agreement we have, for information, we \nwill debate and vote on two bills. Make no mistake, however: The only \none that matters is S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The \nother bill is S. 30. This is the one bill that at long last will \nunleash some of the most exciting and promising research of modern \ntimes. Think of it this way: S. 5, the bill we will be debating and \nvoting on, will take the handcuffs off of our scientists. It will take \nthe handcuffs off so they can now begin to do the research that will \nlead to miraculous cures and interventions.\n\n  It is a good time to step back and ask: Why is there so much support \nfor S. 5? Well, I have a letter signed by 525 groups endorsing this \nbill, including patient advocacy groups, health organizations, research \nuniversities, scientific societies, religious groups. There are 525 \ngroups in all. They all agree Congress should pass S. 5. Why is that? \nBecause it offers hope. I have a series of charts here which I will \npoint to. S. 5 offers hope. I think this chart illustrates many--not \nall but many--of the ailments which scientists tell us embryonic stem \ncells could lead to interventions and cures for, including Lou Gehrig's \ndisease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, muscular dystrophy, anemias, \nsevere burns, leukemia, lymphoma, bone marrow disorders, diabetes, \nimmune deficiencies, heart disease, and spinal cord injuries. That is \njust to name a few. There are many more, but my colleagues get the idea \nof how all encompassing the approach would be if we were to get into \nembryonic stem cell research. It is not just focused on one thing; it \nis broader than that. It encompasses so many illnesses and afflictions. \nAll told, more than 100 million Americans have diseases that one day \ncould be treated or cured with embryonic stem cell research.\n  But it is not just Members of Congress saying that. No one should \ntake our word alone. Three weeks ago Dr. Elias Zerhouni, who is the \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health, appeared before our \nAppropriations subcommittee. I asked him whether scientists would have \na better chance of finding new cures and treatments if the \nadministration's current restrictions on embryonic stem cell research \nwere lifted. Dr. Zerhouni said unequivocally: Yes. Now, Dr. Zerhouni is \nthe Federal Government's top scientist in the area of medical research. \nPresident Bush appointed him to be the Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health. So it took great courage on his part to say in \npublic we need to change direction on stem cell research, but he did so \nbecause it is the truth.\n  This is his quote. This is what the Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health said before the subcommittee:\n\n       It is clear today that American science would be better \n     served and the Nation would be better served if we let our \n     scientists have access to more cell lines.\n\n  It is not only NIH scientists who believe this way. Dr. J. Michael \nBishop, who won the Nobel Prize in medicine, wrote recently:\n\n       The vast majority of the biomedical research community \n     believes that human embryonic stem cells are likely to be the \n     source of key discoveries related to many debilitating \n     diseases.\n\n  Dr. Harold Varmus, the former Director of the National Institutes of \nHealth, who just preceded Dr. Zerhouni and who himself is a Nobel Prize \nwinner, wrote in a letter dated yesterday:\n\n       S. 5 represents an important step forward for human \n     embryonic stem cell research, a new field that offers great \n     promise for the replacement of damaged cells, the \n     understanding of the mechanics of disease, and the \n     development and testing of new drugs. Unfortunately, current \n     Federal policy has not kept pace with the speed of scientific \n     discovery and is today of limited value to the scientific \n     community.\n\n  I could go on and on. We have a lot of scientists all over this \ncountry and the world who agree we should be pursuing embryonic stem \ncell research because it offers enormous hope for easing\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\nhuman suffering. Some may ask: I thought the Federal Government already \nsupports embryonic stem cell research. Well, here we have an \ninteresting situation in terms of Federal funding for embryonic stem \ncell research.\n  I have to take my colleagues back in time to August 9 of 2001. In an \nevening address starting at 9 p.m. on August 9 of 2001, the President, \nin an address to the Nation, said we were going to permit Federal \nfunding for embryonic stem cells only if they were derived prior to 9 \np.m. on August 9 of 2001. Any that were derived after that we could not \nfund research on. Well, at this time it was said there were 78 lines, \n78 stem cell lines we could use. We know that is less than 21 now and \nmany of these are in bad shape, and every single one of them \ncontaminated on mouse feeder cells, which I will talk about in a \nmoment. I always thought it was kind of interesting and very curious \nthat we had this hypocrisy--I call it stem cell hypocrisy--that before \n9 p.m. on August 9 of 2001, it is morally acceptable to use taxpayers' \ndollars to fund embryonic stem cell research. So if the stem cells were \nderived before 9 p.m., it is morally acceptable, but if they were \nderived after 9 p.m. on August 9, it is morally unacceptable. Well, I \nask, what is so significant about 9 p.m. on August 9? Why couldn't it \nhave been 8:30 p.m., 9:15 p.m., midnight, or 10 p.m? Well, I think my \ncolleagues get the point. It is totally arbitrary--totally arbitrary. \nWe have to ask ourselves: Why is it that Federal tax dollars can be \nused on embryonic stem cells derived before 9 p.m.--that is OK--but \nafter 9 p.m., it is not OK? Please, someone tell me why 9 p.m., August \n9 is the moral dividing line. It is totally arbitrary.\n  Even with that, we had hoped the President's policy would work, but \nit hasn't. Here is why. As I said earlier, on that date, the President \nsaid there were 78 stem cell lines available. We now know only 21 are \neligible. It is not nearly enough to reflect the genetic diversity \nscientists need to develop treatments for everyone in the country. What \nis more, every single one--every single one of these approved lines--is \ncontaminated by mouse feeder cells. What that means is when you take \nthe stem cells and you propagate them, you get them to grow, you do \nthem in a medium. You grow them in a medium. They were grown on mouse \ncells, mouse feeder cells, so they are all contaminated. Ask yourself: \nWould you want to take the possibility that somehow mouse cells are \ngetting into your body because of stem cells? No. Many of the 21 lines \nare too unhealthy. They have degenerated. They are unhealthy. As a \nmatter of fact, I have been told we are down to about right now only \nfour.\n  Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, the Director of the NIH Heart, Lung and Blood \nInstitute, said only 4 of the 21 federally approved lines are in common \nuse by NIH-funded scientists. Only four. Dr. Jeremy Berg, another NIH \nDirector, was a little more generous. He said there are six lines in \ncommon use. Well, four or six, you get the picture. It is not 78, it is \nonly 4 or 6. Again, they are contaminated with mouse feeder cells. So \nsome stem cell research is taking place, but our top scientists are \nworking with one arm tied behind their backs because of these \nrestrictions. It is having a chilling impact on the scientists who are \nthinking about entering the field.\n\n  According to Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the NIH Drug Abuse \nInstitute, the administration's policy is discouraging scientists from \napplying for NIH funding to conduct stem cell research. In a letter to \nme last year, she wrote:\n\n       Despite general interest and enthusiasm in the scientific \n     community for embryonic stem cell research, the limited \n     number of available lines has translated into a general lack \n     of research proposals.\n\n  So the President's policy, which we have had in effect since August \n9, 2001, is not a way forward; it is an absolute dead end for research. \nIt only offers false hope to the millions of people across America and \nthe world who are suffering from diseases that could be cured or \ntreated through embryonic stem cell research. Meanwhile, hundreds of \nnew stem cell lines have been derived since the President's arbitrary \ntime of August 9, 2001. The NIH estimates there are about 400 different \nstem cell lines worldwide. Many of those lines are uncontaminated and \nhealthy, but they are totally off limits to federally funded \nscientists.\n  Scientists in many other countries around the world don't face these \nkinds of arbitrary restrictions. We have talked to researchers in \nEngland, for example. Our policy makes no sense to them. They cannot \nunderstand why stem cell lines derived on one date are fine to use, but \nif they are derived on another date, they are off limits. I don't \nunderstand that, either. I have wrestled with that since August 9, \n2001.\n  If you are going to take the position that this is totally morally \nunacceptable and there should be no Federal funding, then we should \nhave no Federal funding, and there are four or five lines that are now \nbeing examined and studied that should not be allowed, either. But I \nhave not seen any amendment from anyone here that would even overturn \nthat policy. It is a shame that we don't open these stem cell lines. \nThink about it this way. We don't require astronomers to explore the \nskies with 19th century telescopes. We don't tell our geologists to \nstudy the earth with tape measures. If we are serious about realizing \nthe promise of stem cell research, our scientists need access to the \nbest stem cell lines available.\n  Again, don't take my word for it. Dr. Story Landis runs the Stem Cell \nTask Force at NIH. In January, she appeared before a joint hearing of \nthe HELP Committee, chaired by Senator Kennedy, and my subcommittee. \nSenator Kennedy asked her whether scientists are missing out on \npossible breakthroughs under the administration's current policy, and \nthis was her answer:\n\n       Yes, we are missing out on possible breakthroughs. From a \n     purely scientific perspective, Federal funding of additional \n     cell lines is necessary to advance the field.\n\n  This is Dr. Landis, head of the Stem Cell Task Force at NIH.\n  So we need a stem cell policy in this country that offers true, \nmeaningful hope to patients and their loved ones. That is what this \nbill, S. 5, would do. Under our bill, federally funded researchers \ncould study any stem cell line, regardless of the date a stem cell is \nderived, as long as strict ethical guidelines are met.\n  I believe it is important to emphasize this: We have very strict \nethical guidelines. First, stem cells must come from embryos that would \notherwise be discarded. There are more than 400,000 embryos right now \nin the United States left over from fertility treatments that are \ncurrently sitting frozen in liquid nitrogen. If the contributors of \nthose embryos--the parents, the moms and dads--have had all the \nchildren they want and they no longer need the embryos, what happens to \nthem? Under the policy we have now, there are only two things: You can \nkeep them frozen for the next 10,000 or 20,000 or 50,000 years, or \nhowever long, or you can discard them. That is what is happening every \nday at in vitro fertilization clinics across the country. Embryos are \nbeing discarded as hospital waste.\n  Now, you might be a couple who says: We have had all our children, \nand we don't want any more. We don't want to keep paying forever and \never to have the embryos frozen. We would like to donate them to stem \ncell research to maybe help a young person with juvenile diabetes or \nsomeone with a spinal cord injury. We would like to contribute those \nembryos for that research. They cannot do it. It seems to me that at \nleast we ought to be able to allow the couples to donate them if they \nwish. So the real question is, Do we throw them away or use them to \nease suffering? Do we throw them away or allow them to be used with \nthese strict ethical guidelines? I think it is the second choice that \nis truly moral and respectful of human life.\n  You might even think about it this way. Embryos will be destroyed, \npeople say. The embryo itself--about which, by the way, I will point \nout there is a lot of misconception. I didn't listen to it, but I read \nthe debate in the House last year. One of the speakers--I think the \nformer minority leader, Mr. Delay, talked about fetuses and about the \nprotection of fetuses. A lot of people think we are talking about \nfetuses. We are not. We are talking about embryos. I often put a dot on \na piece of paper and I say: Can anybody see what I put there? That is \njust how big an embryo is, which is a few dozen cells.\n  Well, you have to get over this idea that somehow it is a fully \nformed fetus\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\nexisting in a womb. That is not it at all. You might say it is alive, \nit has life--yes, it does--and you should not destroy that life. Well, \nyou might destroy the embryo itself, but in taking the stem cells from \nit--the cells in the embryo give the embryo life. If you take the cells \nout and you propagate them and examine them and then maybe use those \nlines for curing diseases in the future, it seems to me that you are \nreally propagating life, saving lives, and enhancing life by doing \nthat. That is why giving people the choice of voluntarily contributing \nthe cells is truly moral and respectful of human life.\n  The second ethical requirement is that couples must provide written, \ninformed consent. Now, I might point out that some of the 21 federally \napproved lines that are now in existence--especially the ones from \nother countries--don't meet that requirement. So we need to pass S. 5 \nto tighten the ethical guidelines of stem cell research, so there is no \nquestion that the embryos were donated properly. Think of it this way. \nWe have Federal money right now that could be going--and probably is--\nfor research on some stem cells that were provided without written \ninformed consent. So we need to tighten down on that. S. 5 does that.\n  I read the debates of last year on the floor of the Senate and in the \nHouse. There was a lot of talk about setting up ``embryo farms,'' that \nthere is going to be embryo farming so that women will take their eggs, \nor create embryos, and there will be embryo farms. I heard that a \nnumber of times. Well, S. 5 prohibits women from being paid to donate \ntheir embryos. There is no chance under this bill that women could be \nexploited to go through the donation process against their will. Under \nour bill, couples cannot receive money or other inducements to donate \nembryos. Under the present guidelines that now exist from the White \nHouse, it just says you cannot receive money. Well, there might be \nother inducements that may be provided to you to get you to donate. We \nwant to cut that off and say it has to be purely voluntary. So you \ncannot receive money or any other inducements; you must have written, \ninformed consent; it can only come from embryos that would otherwise be \ndiscarded; and there are very strict ethical guidelines.\n\n  So, again, this year's bill, S. 5, has one significant change from \nlast year's bill that we passed. We passed that overwhelmingly, with 63 \nvotes. But this bill has one difference. It includes the text of last \nyear's Specter-Santorum bill, which passed the Senate unanimously but \ngot tied up in the House and died at the end of the 109th Congress. \nThat bill, which President Bush strongly endorsed, encouraged NIH to \npursue alternative ways of deriving stem cells, in addition to our \ncurrent method.\n  As I have made clear, going back to December of 1998, I support any \nethical means to improve the lives of human beings who are suffering. I \nbelieve we should open every door we can in the pursuit of cures. So \nwhat we have done in the new version of S. 5 is combine the two bills \nthe Senate passed overwhelmingly last year but did not become law. That \nwas H.R. 810 and the Specter-Santorum bill. By voting for S. 5, the \nbill before us now, Senators can show they support all forms of stem \ncell research. Again, the Specter-Santorum bill says open it up and \nfind out all other forms of stem cell research. That was amniotic, \nplacental stem cells, adult stem cells, whatever. I have no problem \nwith that. I think we ought to pursue all of them. But that is the key \ndifference between S. 5 and S. 30--that is the other bill we will vote \non tomorrow night, S. 30. That bill puts all its hopes in theories, \nalternative ways of deriving stem cells that might or might not work. \nAt this point, nobody knows. We do know how to derive embryonic stem \ncells and how to propagate them. Some research in other countries and \nprivate research has already led to stem cells developing into nerve \ncells and things like that.\n  We don't know about what S. 30 does. S. 30 says to scientists--that \nis the other bill before us--don't use any of the 400 existing stem \ncell lines already derived. Instead, put all of your effort into \nfiguring out some new way of deriving stem cells that might take 10 or \nmore years to pan out, or maybe not at all. For example, the proponents \nof S. 30 will talk a lot over today and tomorrow about stem cells that \ncould allegedly be derived from ``dead embryos''--embryos that are not \nhealthy and have stopped growing. I have to tell you, the idea that we \ncan cure juvenile diabetes, ALS, and Parkinson's with something called \n``dead embryos'' doesn't exactly inspire me with a lot of confidence. \nThink about it. If you were treating somebody with embryonic stem \ncells, would you rather use stem cells that came from an embryo that is \nhealthy, vibrant, and growing or would you rather have them coming from \na dead embryo? Ask yourself that simple question. The dead embryo died \nfor a reason: there was something wrong with it. Chances are that the \nstem cells which come from that embryo are not so great, either. So why \ndoes anyone think a dead embryo holds the secret to curing ALS or \njuvenile diabetes? S. 5, our bill, by contrast, would immediately make \nthose hundreds of new lines eligible for Federal research, again, as \nlong as they were derived under the strict ethical guidelines we have \nin our bill. So S. 30, the other bill, might not do any harm, but I \ndon't think it does any good, either. Again, that is why we ought to \nkeep our focus on S. 5.\n  If this year's debate goes like last year's, then we will expect \nopponents of S. 5 to make a lot of unfounded claims about adult stem \ncells. I will listen closely and try to correct those mistakes people \nmight make. There is a lot of stuff out there. Our committee looked at \nthis, and we have had a lot of testimony from scientists at NIH. So \nthere will be a lot of unfounded claims about adult stem cells.\n\n  As I have said for the last several years, I am all for adult stem \ncell research and use. Adult stem cells are already being used \nsuccessfully in treating several blood-related diseases, and that is \ngreat. I am all for it. Let's continue this area of research. But as we \nnow know, and as scientists tell us, adult stem cells have limits. They \ncan't do everything that embryonic stem cells can do. Again, don't take \nmy word for it. Listen to what Dr. Zerhouni, the Nation's highest \nranking medical researcher, has to say about adult stem cells. This is \nwhat he said before our committee:\n\n       The presentations about adult stem cells having as much or \n     more potential than embryonic stem cells, in my view, do not \n     hold scientific water. . . . I think they are overstated. . . \n     . My point of view is that all angles in stem cell research \n     should be pursued.\n\n  That is what S. 5 will allow us to do. Most people could care less \nwhat cells are used to develop a cure. They just want a cure. So I say \nlet's examine them all.\n  By the way, S. 30, the other bill we will be debating that focuses on \nderiving stem cells from naturally dead embryos, can be done under S. 5 \nalso or under the Specter-Santorum bill. There are no restrictions on \nthat issue. It is just that S. 30 says that is all we will do. S. 5, \nour bill, says we will open the 400 lines as long as they meet the \nethical guidelines we have established. We will open those 400 lines to \nfederally funded research and everything else, too. They can look at \nstem cells from naturally dead embryos. They can look at them from \nadult stem cells, placental, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord--whatever. \nThey can look at them all as long as they meet ethical guidelines.\n  Lastly, we talk all about research, about science, about stem cells, \nusing all the quotes from scientists and others. What it is really \nabout is giving hope to people. It is about helping people who have \ndevastating--devastating--illnesses.\n  This is a picture of Karli Borcherding of Ankeny, IA. Karli is one of \nthe millions of Americans whose hopes depend on stem cell research. I \nmet Karli for the first time last fall with her mother and her sisters. \nShe just celebrated her 12th birthday. She has type 1 diabetes, also \ncalled juvenile diabetes. When people have this disease, their body \nstops making insulin, so they have to inject it either through needles \nor a pump.\n  Here is a picture of Karli Borcherding, age 12, from Ankeny, IA, with \n1 month's worth of needles. Look at that picture. There are 120 \nneedles, 1 month. Ask yourself: How would you like to give yourself \nfour shots a day at age 12? Imagine that, four times a day. As Karli \nsays, she never gets a vacation from juvenile diabetes. It is with her \nwherever she goes--at school, at\n\n[[Page S4240]]\n\nhome, on field trips, on holidays. She told me:\n\n       My dream is that one day we will find a cure for juvenile \n     diabetes, and I can just go back to being just a normal kid.\n\n  If adult stem cells could bring Karli a cure, she would gladly take \nit. But scientists have known about adult stem cells for 40 years, and \nthey still haven't provided the answer for juvenile diabetes. We can't \nkeep telling people such as Karli that embryonic stem cells might bring \nthem a cure but, sorry, the Federal Government is not interested. Our \npremier institution of NIH can't be involved.\n  We can't keep telling the millions of Americans who have Parkinson's, \nALS, cancer, or spinal cord injuries: Sorry, we know that embryonic \nstem cell research might ease your suffering, but we would rather do \nnothing about it.\n  Now is our chance to change that situation. I urge Senators to think \nabout Karli Borcherding and all the people in their lives who could \nbenefit from stem cell research and vote yes emphatically on S. 5 \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my good friend, and I say again, \nthe person who started all of our hearings on this issue in December of \n1998. Under the chairmanship of Senator Specter, our subcommittee had \nthe first hearing on stem cell research 1 month after they were \nderived. Under his chairmanship, we have had 20 hearings. I mentioned \nthat earlier. There hasn't been a more stalwart, informed person in \neither body, or on the Hill, about embryonic stem cell research than \nSenator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is it correct that \nI have 20 minutes allocated at this time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Harkin, for his leadership on this very important issue. I \nthank him for his very generous comments. It is true that he and I have \nworked together on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human \nServices, Education, and Related Agencies for more than 20 years. He \nnow chairs the subcommittee, and I am the ranking member.\n  In the past, I have chaired the committee, and he has been the \nranking member. We have had very close bipartisan cooperation. As we \nfrequently say, there has been a seamless transfer of the gavel, \nlooking out for the interests of the American people.\n  Senator Harkin accurately notes that when stem cells first burst upon \nthe American scene in November of 1998, our subcommittee moved \nimmediately. It was actually December 2 of 1998. We have since had a \ntotal of 20 hearings on this important subject.\n  Today I am speaking for 110 million Americans who suffer directly or \nindirectly, personally or through their families and loved ones, from \ndebilitating diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease, \ncancer, diabetes, and I also speak for myself.\n  In 1970, President Nixon declared war on cancer. Had that war been \nprosecuted with the same diligence as other wars, my former chief of \nstaff, Carey Lackman, a beautiful young lady of 48, would not have died \nof breast cancer. One of my very best friends, a very distinguished \nFederal judge, Chief Judge Edward R. Becker, would not have died of \nprostate cancer. All of us know people who have been stricken by \ncancer, who have been incapacitated with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, \nwho have been victims of heart disease, or many other maladies.\n\n  We now have an opportunity, with the breakthrough on stem cell \nresearch, to have the potential of curing these maladies.\n  I sustained an episode with Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer 2 years ago. \nThat trauma, that illness, I think, could have been prevented had that \nwar on cancer declared by the President of the United States in 1970 \nbeen prosecuted with sufficient intensity.\n  We now know about stem cells. We now know from the leading scientists \nof the United States and the leading scientists of the world the \npotential of stem cells to deal with these dreaded maladies. The leader \nof the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Zerhouni, has said:\n\n       Embryonic stem cell research holds great promise for \n     treating, curing, and improving our understanding of disease, \n     as well as revealing important basic mechanisms involved in \n     stem cell differentiation and development.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to print in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks the testimonials from the Directors of the \nNational Institutes of Health who have spoken out vigorously in support \nof embryonic stem cell research.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there are some 400,000 of those embryos \nwhich have been frozen and which will either be used potentially to \ncure disease or will be discarded. Embryos are created for in vitro \nfertilization. A few of them are used and the others are frozen. If any \nof these embryos could be used to produce life, none of us would \nadvocate the research. But they will not be used to produce life.\n  Our subcommittee took the lead in providing $2 million for embryonic \nstem cell adoption. As of April 5 of this year, the Night Life \nChristian Adoption Service reports that embryo adoption resulted in the \nbirth of some 135 so-called snowflake children, and 20 babies are \ncurrently due. It is obvious by these statistics that we have enormous \nwasted resources available for scientific research.\n  I have in my hand an hourglass. This hourglass was referenced by one \nof my constituents, a man named Jim Cordy, from Pittsburgh, PA, who \nsuffers from Parkinson's. When I was in Pittsburgh years ago, Jim Cordy \napproached me with an hourglass. He said: Senator, the sands are \nslipping through this hourglass like my life is slipping away. There is \nthe potential for curing Parkinson's, and you ought to be doing \nsomething about it.\n  We have tried mightily. Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nHatch, Senator Smith, Senator Feinstein--many of us have tried \nmightily. Last year we passed a bill for stem cell research which would \nallow the use of Federal funds for research. But I think it is \nimportant to note that the Federal funds would not be used to kill \nembryos but would be used to conduct research on 400 existing lines. \nThat bill, as we all know, was vetoed. The Senate passed the bill by 63 \nvotes. I believe it is accurate to say that there are more than 63 \naffirmative votes in the Senate today. Whether there are 67 remains to \nbe seen.\n  I think it is also accurate to say that in the House of \nRepresentatives, we are not close to a veto override based on the votes \nin the House of Representatives last year. But we are not too far away \neither.\n  It is my view that if we had sufficient mobilization of public \nopinion, that public opinion and political pressure, which is the \nappropriate process in a democracy, could provide enough votes for an \noverride.\n  As I see it, it is not a matter of whether there will be Federal \nfunding for embryonic stem cell research but when that Federal funding \nwill be present. The longer it is delayed, the more people will suffer \nand die from these maladies.\n  I have encouraged the groups which come to Washington in large \nnumbers to stage a massive march on the Mall. If we put a million \npeople on the Mall, they would be within hearing distance of the living \nquarters of the White House, and with 110 million people who are \naffected personally or indirectly through their families, there is the \npotential for sufficient political pressure to provide enough votes to \noverride a veto if, in fact, the President were to veto the bill.\n  It is my hope the President will relent in light of the reconstructed \nstatute which we are providing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the history of the 20 \nhearings which the subcommittee has held on stem cells, the \nendorsements of the embryonic stem cell research by the Directors of \nthe National Institutes of Heath, and my full statement on the stem \ncell bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Stem Cell History\n\n       Hearings: 20 Labor-HHS Subcommittee hearings have been \n     convened on stem cell issues. 17 hearings have dealt \n     specifically\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\n     with stem cells and 3 with cloning. Several additional \n     hearings have focused on diseases, such as Parkinson's and \n     Alzheimer's, that relate to stem cells.\n       The first hearing, on December 2, 1998, focused on the \n     mechanics of this research and its potential medical \n     benefits.\n       The second hearing, on January 12, 1999, focused on key \n     intellectual property issues surrounding stem cell research.\n       The third hearing, on January 26, 1999, discussed the HHS \n     General Counsel's opinion.\n       The fourth hearing was held on November 4, 1999, to explore \n     the findings of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission \n     and ethical issues surrounding Federal funding for human stem \n     cell research.\n       The fifth hearing, on April 26, 2000, explored stem cell \n     research and its implications for medical treatment.\n       The sixth hearing, on September 7, 2000, focused on the \n     final NIH human embryonic guidelines.\n       The seventh hearing, on September 14, 2000 focused on the \n     promise and potential benefits of research using human \n     embryonic stem cells to treat and cure diseases, and provided \n     a forum about the ethical and right-to-life Issues.\n       At the eighth hearing, on July 18, 2001, Senators Frist, \n     Hatch, and G. Smith testified in favor of embryonic stem cell \n     research, and a second panel compared adult and embryonic \n     stem cell potential.\n       The ninth hearing, on August 1, 2001, focused on \n     intellectual property and the ethical dilemmas associated \n     with private embryonic stem cell research.\n       The tenth hearing, on October 31, 2001, focused on NIH's \n     report outlining the status of the stem cell lines.\n       The eleventh hearing, on Dec. 4, 2001 was the first hearing \n     on cloning, initiated after the announcement by Advanced Cell \n     Technologies (ACT) that it had cloned a human embryo.\n       The twelfth hearing, on January 24, 2002, focused on the \n     National Academy of Sciences' Panel on Human Cloning.\n       The thirteenth hearing on March 12, 2002 focused on \n     prohibiting human cloning and the implications for medical \n     research.\n       The fourteenth on September 25, 2002 focused on the \n     implementation of the President's stem cell policy.\n       The fifteenth hearing on May 22, 2003 investigated the \n     recent acknowledgment that 16 stem cell lines in Sweden had \n     not been developed enough to have been exposed to mouse \n     feeder cells.\n       The sixteenth hearing on July 12, 2005 was the first \n     hearing to investigate alternative methods for obtaining \n     pluripotent stem cells.\n       The seventeenth hearing on October 18, 2005 explored the \n     potential of embryonic stem cell research and nuclear \n     transplantation in treating several specific diseases and \n     featured Mr. Anthony Herrera.\n       The eighteenth hearing on June 27, 2006 was the second \n     hearing investigating alternative methods for obtaining \n     pluripotent stem cells and it featured testimony by Senator \n     Rick Santorum.\n       The nineteenth hearing on September 6, 2006 investigated \n     the claim by Advanced Cell Technology Inc. that it had \n     succeeded in deriving stem cell lines without destroying \n     embryos. This was the third hearing specifically discussing \n     alternative methods for deriving stem cells.\n       The twentieth hearing on January 19, 2007 is a joint \n     hearing with the HELP Committee that is reviewing the science \n     of stem cell research and asking the question ``Can Congress \n     Help Fulfill the Promise of Stem Cell Research?''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Floor Statement of Senator Arlen Specter\n\n       Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the stem cell \n     bills that are being debated today: S. 5--the ``Stem Cell \n     Research Enhancement Act'' of which I am an original co-\n     sponsor, along with Senators Harkin, Hatch, Kennedy, \n     Feinstein, Smith and Reid and S. 30, the HOPE Act introduced \n     by Senators Coleman and Isakson. S. 5 is a combination of two \n     bills that I introduced in the previous Congress and of which \n     I have been a strong proponent for eight years.\n\n\n                     support of biomedical research\n\n       I believe medical research should be pursued with all \n     possible haste to cure the diseases and maladies affecting \n     Americans. In my capacity as Ranking Member and at times--\n     Chairman--of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have backed up this \n     belief by supporting increases in funding for the National \n     Institutes of Health. I have said many times that the NIH is \n     the crown jewel of the Federal Government--perhaps the only \n     jewel of the Federal government. When I came to the Senate in \n     1981, NIH spending totaled $3.6 billion. In FY2007, NIH will \n     receive approximately $29 billion to fund its pursuit of \n     life-saving research. The successes realized by this \n     investment in NIH have spawned revolutionary advances in our \n     knowledge and treatment for diseases such as cancer, \n     Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mental illnesses, \n     diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, ALS and many others. \n     It is clear to me that Congress' commitment to the NIH is \n     paying off. This is the time to seize the scientific \n     opportunities that lie before us, and to ensure that all \n     avenues of research toward cures--including stem cell \n     research--are open for investigation.\n\n\n                               stem cells\n\n       I first learned of the potential of human embryonic stem \n     cells in November of 1998 upon the announcement of the work \n     by Dr. Jamie Thomson at the University of Wisconsin and Dr. \n     John Gearhart at Johns Hopkins University. I took an \n     immediate interest and held the first Congressional hearing \n     on the subject of stem cells on December 2, 1998. These cells \n     have the ability to become any type of cell in the human \n     body. Another way of saying this is that the cells are \n     pluripotent. The consequences of this unique property of stem \n     cells are far reaching and are key to their potential use in \n     therapies. Scientists and doctors with whom I have spoken--\n     and that have since testified before the Labor-HHS \n     Appropriations Subcommittee at 20 stem cell-related \n     hearings--were excited by this discovery. They believed that \n     these cells could be used to replace damaged or \n     malfunctioning cells in patients with a wide range of \n     diseases. This could lead to cures and treatments for \n     maladies such as Juvenile Diabetes, Parkinson's disease, \n     Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases, and spinal cord \n     injury. In all, well over 100 million Americans could benefit \n     from stem cell research.\n       Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos that would \n     otherwise have been discarded. During the course of in vitro \n     fertilization (IVF) therapies, sperm and several eggs are \n     combined in a laboratory to create 4 to 16 embryos for a \n     couple having difficulty becoming pregnant. The embryos grow \n     in an incubator for 5 to 7 days until they contain \n     approximately 100 cells. To maximize the chances of success, \n     several embryos are implanted into the woman. The remaining \n     embryos are frozen for future use. If the woman becomes \n     pregnant after the first implantation, and does not want to \n     have more pregnancies, the remaining frozen embryos are in \n     excess of clinical need and can be donated for research. \n     Embryonic stem cells are derived from these embryos. The stem \n     cells form what are called ``lines'' and continue to divide \n     indefinitely in a laboratory dish. In this way, the 21 lines \n     currently available for federal researchers were obtained \n     from 21 embryos. The stem cells contained in these lines can \n     then be made into almost any type of cell in the body--with \n     the potential to replace cells damaged by disease or \n     accident. At no point in the derivation process are the \n     embryos or the derived cells implanted in a woman, which \n     would be required for them to develop further. The process of \n     deriving stem cell lines results in the disruption of the \n     embryo and I know that this raises some concerns.\n\n\n                            embryo adoptions\n\n       During the course of our hearings in this subject, we have \n     learned that over 400,000 embryos are stored in fertility \n     clinics around the country. If these frozen embryos were \n     going to be used for in vitro fertilization, I would be the \n     first to support it. In fact, I have included $2,000,000 in \n     the HHS budget each year since 2002 to create and continue an \n     embryo adoption awareness campaign. But the truth is that \n     most of these embryos will be discarded. I believe that \n     instead of just throwing these embryos away, they hold the \n     key to curing and treating diseases that cause suffering for \n     millions of people.\n\n\n                      the current stem cell policy\n\n       The President opened the door to stem cell research on \n     August 9, 2001. His policy statement allowed limited federal \n     funding of human embryonic stem cell research for the first \n     time. There is a real question as to whether the door is open \n     sufficiently.\n       A key statement by the President related to the existence \n     of approximately 60 eligible stem cell lines--then expanded \n     to 78. In the intervening 5 years, it has become apparent \n     that many of the lines cited are not really viable, robust, \n     or available to federally funded researchers. The fact is \n     there are only 21 lines now available for research. Perhaps, \n     most fundamental is the issue of therapy. It was not \n     addressed in the President's statement, but it came to light \n     in the first weeks after the President's announcement that \n     all of the stem cell lines have had nutrients from mouse \n     feeder cells and bovine serum. Under FDA regulations, these \n     lines will face intense regulatory hurdles before being \n     useful in human therapies. In the intervening years, new \n     technology has been developed so that mouse feeder cells are \n     no longer necessary for the growth of stem cells. It only \n     makes sense that our nation's scientists should have access \n     to the latest technology.\n       Since August 9, 2001, new facts have come to light and the \n     technology has moved forward to the extent that the policy is \n     holding back our scientists and physicians in their search \n     for cures. I have a friend and constituent in Pittsburgh \n     named Jim Cordy who suffers from Parkinson's. Whenever I see \n     Jim, he carries an hourglass, to remind me that the sands of \n     time are passing and that the days of his life are slipping \n     away. That is a pretty emphatic message from the hourglass. \n     So it seems to me that this is the kind of sense of urgency \n     which ought to motivate Congress and the biomedical research \n     community.\n\n\n             testimony of nih director, dr. elias zerhouni\n\n       On March 19, 2007, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, President Bush's \n     appointee to lead the National Institutes of Health, \n     testified before the Senate Labor-HHS-Education \n     Appropriations Subcommittee regarding the NIH budget and stem \n     cells. At that time he stated, ``it\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\n     is clear today that American science would be better served \n     and the nation would be better served if we let our \n     scientists have access to more cell lines . . . To sideline \n     NIH in such an issue of importance, in my view, is \n     shortsighted. I think it wouldn't serve the nation well in \n     the long run.'' His testimony clearly shows that the time has \n     come to move forward.\n\n\n              s. 5--the stem cell research enhancement act\n\n       S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, lifts the \n     August 9, 2001 date restriction, thus making stem cell lines \n     eligible for federally funded research regardless of the date \n     on which they were derived. Expanding the number of stem cell \n     lines would accelerate scientific progress towards cures and \n     treatments for a wide range of diseases and debilitating \n     health conditions. The bill puts in place strong ethical \n     requirements on stem cell lines that are funded with Federal \n     dollars. In fact, several stem cell lines currently funded \n     with Federal dollars would not be eligible under the policies \n     put in place by this bill. The requirements include:\n       (1) embryos used to derive stem cells were originally \n     created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of \n     clinical need;\n       (2) the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom \n     the embryos were created have determined that the embryos \n     will not be implanted in a woman and will otherwise be \n     discarded;\n       (3) the individuals for whom the embryos were created have \n     provided written consent for embryo donation; and\n       (4) the donors can not receive any financial or other \n     inducements to make the donation.\n       Importantly, the bill does not allow federal funds to be \n     used for the derivation of stem cell lines--the step in the \n     process where the embryo is destroyed.\n\n\n              alternative methods for deriving stem cells\n\n       S. 5 further includes authorization for NIH to pursue \n     research toward alternative methods for deriving stem cells \n     that do not result in the destruction of embryos. The \n     approach is identical to that promoted by former Senator \n     Santorum and myself in the last Congress, which passed this \n     body by a vote of 100 to 0. Unfortunately, that legislation \n     did not clear the House of Representatives.\n       When the President's Council on Bioethics reported on \n     several theoretical methods for deriving stem cells without \n     destroying embryos, I immediately scheduled a hearing to \n     investigate these ideas. On July 12, 2005, the Labor-HHS \n     Subcommittee heard testimony from five witnesses describing \n     several theoretical techniques for deriving stem cells \n     without destroying embryos. The stem cells would \n     theoretically have the key ability to become any type of \n     cell. We discussed these techniques at a second hearing on \n     June 27, 2006. I must emphasize that none of these techniques \n     is a proven technology, and in some cases they are only being \n     pursued because of the restrictions in place.\n       The legislation, which former Senator Santorum and I \n     introduced, was meant to encourage these alternative methods \n     for deriving stem cells without harming human embryos. That \n     language has now been incorporated into S. 5 making it a \n     stronger bill. Those provisions in S. 5 amend the Public \n     Health Service Act by inserting a section that:\n       (1) Mandates that the Secretary of Health & Human Services \n     shall support meritorious peer-reviewed research to develop \n     techniques for the derivation of stem cells without creating \n     or destroying human embryos.\n       (2) Requires the Secretary to issue guidelines within 90 \n     days to implement this research and to identify and \n     prioritize the next research steps.\n       (3) Includes a `Rule of Construction' stating: Nothing in \n     this section shall be construed to affect any policy, \n     guideline, or regulation regarding embryonic stem cell \n     research, human cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer, or \n     any other research not specifically authorized by this \n     section.\n\n\n               the two sections of s. 5 are complementary\n\n       Understanding that scientists never know exactly which \n     research will lead to the next great cure; I have always \n     supported opening as many avenues of research as possible. \n     Based on that line of reasoning, I have always supported \n     human embryonic, adult, and cord blood stem cell research. My \n     goal is to see cures for the various afflictions that lower \n     the quality of life--or end the lives--of Americans. S. 5 is \n     the only bill under consideration that supports the funding \n     of ALL types of stem cell research.\n\n\n                    the coleman/isakson ``hope'' act\n\n       The Coleman/Isakson HOPE Act focuses attention on only \n     alternative avenues of research. This bill promotes research \n     on alternative ways of deriving stem cells--as does S. 5. It \n     emphasizes a particular alternative using so-called ``dead \n     embryos'' that is unproven and highly speculative. It does \n     not lift the President's restrictions on stem cell research. \n     Unfortunately, it also attempts to codify scientific terms \n     that would be better left to definition by the scientific and \n     medical community. Despite these shortcomings, this bill \n     deserves support because it highlights the need for further \n     research.\n       I must emphasize that this bill is not a substitute for \n     support of human embryonic stem cell research or support for \n     S. 5. A vote in favor of the HOPE Act and against S. 5 will \n     not advance the search for cures. The two bills are \n     compatible in their scope and together will advance our \n     understanding of biomedical science and bring us another step \n     closer to the cures and treatment that we all desire.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The two bills before us are both worthy of passage. S. 5 \n     stands out as it will allow real progress towards cures. I \n     strongly believe that the funding provided by Congress should \n     be invested in the best research to address diseases based on \n     medical need and scientific opportunity. Politics has no \n     place in the equation. Throughout history there are numerous \n     examples of politics stifling science in the name of \n     ideology. Galileo was imprisoned for his theory that the \n     planets revolve around the sun. The Institute of Genetics of \n     the Soviet Academy of Sciences opposed the use of hybrid \n     varieties of wheat because it was based on the science of the \n     West. Instead, they supported a doctrine called ``acquired \n     characteristics,'' which was made the official Soviet \n     position. This resulted in lower yields for Soviet wheat \n     throughout the former Soviet Union in the first half of the \n     twentieth century. These historical examples teach us that we \n     must make these decisions based on sound science, not \n     politics. I urge you to vote in favor of S. 5, so that this \n     Congress does not look as foolish in hindsight as these \n     examples.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                        letters to nih directors\n\n       On July 10, 2006, you and Senator Harkin wrote to Dr. \n     Zerhouni and 18 other NIH institute directors asking that \n     they answer questions in preparation for the upcoming stem \n     cell debate. We asked that the responses ``be submitted \n     directly to us without editing, revision, or comment by the \n     Department of Health and Human Services as required by'' the \n     fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill. The questions and a \n     summary of their answers are listed below:\n       Question 1. Do you believe that embryonic stem cell \n     research holds promise for treating, curing and improving our \n     understanding of diseases? If so, please describe some of the \n     most promising potential applications of this research. Would \n     access to additional and newer stem cell lines hasten \n     progress towards these basic and clinical applications?\n       Dr. Zerhouni (Director, NIH): ``Yes, embryonic stem cell \n     research holds great promise for treating, curing, and \n     improving our understanding of disease, as well as revealing \n     important basic mechanisms involved in cell differentiation \n     and development.''\n       ``. . . from a purely scientific standpoint, it is clear \n     that more cell lines would be helpful in ensuring expeditious \n     progress in this important field of science.''\n       Dr. Fauci (Director, Allergy Institute): ``The National \n     Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) believes \n     that research on embryonic stem cells could potentially \n     increase scientific understanding of the biology of human \n     diseases and also lead to improvements in the treatment of \n     many human diseases.''\n       ``NIAID believes that embryonic stem cell research could be \n     advanced by the availability of additional cell lines. \n     Individual stem cell lines have unique properties. Thus. we \n     may be limiting our ability to achieve the full range of \n     potential therapeutic applications of embryonic stem cells by \n     restricting research to the relatively small number of lines \n     currently available.''\n       Dr. Battey (Director, Deafness Institute): The National \n     Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders \n     believes embryonic stem cell research holds promise for \n     increased understanding of an possible treatments for \n     diseases and conditions especially within the research \n     mission areas of the Institute.''\n       ``The more cell lines available for study, the more likely \n     a cell line will be maximally useful for a given research, \n     and potentially clinical, application. . . . the scientific \n     community would be best served by having a greater number of \n     human embryonic stem cell lines available for study.''\n       Dr. Nabel (Director, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute): \n     ``Embryonic stem cell research has vast potential for \n     addressing critical health needs in a number of areas \n     relevant to the mission of the National Heart, Lung and Blood \n     Institute.''\n       ``. . . we recognize that the limitations of existing cell \n     lines are hindering scientific progress among a community \n     that is very eager to move forward in this promising area.

Have researchers reported difficulties in \n     obtaining any of the 21 lines currently available to NIH-\n     funded researchers? If so, please provide examples. In \n     practice, how many of the 21 lines are in common use by NIH-\n     funded researchers?\n       Dr. Zerhouni (Director, NIH): ``. . . all of the human \n     embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines listed on the NIH Human \n     Embryonic Stem Cell Registry are privately owned and many are \n     from foreign sources. The private owners are under no \n     obligation to make their hESC lines widely available for \n     research in other laboratories. Many scientists expressed \n     concern that access to these cell lines was a major obstacle \n     hindering hESC research eligible for Federal funding.''\n       Dr. Nabel (Director, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute): ``. \n     . . only four cell lines were in common use . . . we believe \n     that the availability of additional cell lines would be of \n     great service to NHLBI-funded researchers.''\n       Dr. Landis (Director, Neurology Institute): ``The NIH unit \n     that is systematically characterizing the approved lines and \n     making that information available now has 18 of the 21 lines, \n     and the others are on order.''\n       Jeremy Berg (Director, General Medical Sciences Institute \n     (NIGMS): ``Although NIGMS grantees have purchased 13 of the \n     21 approved human embryonic stem cell lines, only 6 lines are \n     in common use.''\n       Dr. Hodes (Director, Aging Institute): ``. . . one National \n     Institute on Aging intramural investigator involved with \n     human embryonic stem cell researching using approved cell \n     lines identified genetic abnormalities and contaminations \n     from mouse feeder cells in the embryonic stem cells that made \n     them unusable for his research. In part because of his \n     inability to continue his research with approved cell lines. \n     he has left the Institute.''\n       Mr. Volkow (Director, National Institute of Drug Abuse \n     (NIDA): ``. . . obtaining these lines has been procedurally \n     complex and expensive. Despite general interest and \n     enthusiasm in the scientific community for embryonic stem \n     cell research. the limited number of available lines has, the \n     NIDA's case. translated into a general lack of research \n     proposals.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much of my 20 minutes remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator has about 11 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Specter are printed in the Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 9 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we started a little late, so I will yield \nback the remainder of my time on this segment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next 60 minutes \nis under the control of the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Coleman.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, we are going to reverse the order for a \nsecond.\n  Mr. President, I wish to commend the distinguished Senators from Iowa \nand Pennsylvania on their passion for stem cell research, which is \nshared by virtually all the people whom I know.\n  I also wish to ask unanimous consent that Senators Chambliss, Cornyn, \nand Burr be added as cosponsors of S. 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, at the outset of my remarks I thank Tyler \nThompson and Brittany Espy for the 2 years she devoted to this issue \nprior to Tyler taking over and Joan Kirchner and Chris Carr of my staff \nfor their invaluable work and an intern and distinguished scholar from \nthe University of Georgia named Nick Chammoun who introduced me to a \nman for whom I have the greatest admiration, Dr. Steven Stice, an \neminent scholar and eminent stem cell researcher at the University of \nGeorgia.\n  I have introduced, in concert with Senator Coleman, S. 30, which has \nbeen referred to by the Senator from Ohio as containing theories--and I \nknow he is getting ready to leave, but I want him to hear one part \nbefore he leaves.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Iowa.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator from Iowa, I sincerely apologize. His man \njust won the Masters in Augusta. I should remember that.\n  This bill is not about a theory when it comes to naturally dead \nembryos. Five of the existing 21 lines funded by NIH, grandfathered \nunder the President's directive in August 2001, were derived, and are \nactive today, from naturally dead embryos. So we are not talking about \na theory, we are not talking about hope, and we are not talking about \nspeculation. We are talking about a way to address the concern of the \nethics of destruction of viable embryos with the promises and the hope \nof embryonic stem cell research.\n  Now, I was a real estate broker before I was elected to Congress, and \nsince I have been in Congress, I have been anything but a scientist or \nanyone knowledgeable of medicine, but I care deeply and compassionately \nabout those who suffer, and I share the concerns of not the question of \n``when'' but\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\nthe question of ``if'' that was expressed by Senator Specter. So I \nbegan researching this entire issue to see if there wasn't a way, and \nthat is when I stumbled onto the fact that there were already ways that \nembryonic stem cells were being derived without the destruction of \nviable embryos.\n  I went to the University of Georgia and I met Dr. Stice for the first \ntime and he walked me through that process. For the edification of all \nthose here, as well as those who are concerned about that issue, I wish \nto talk about it for a second because it is clear and it is precise and \nit threads the ethical needle and addresses the concern for the \nfurtherance of scientific research.\n  In the process of in vitro fertilization, there are three principles, \nknown as the Gardner principles, by which physicians and doctors grade \nembryonic byproducts of the fertilization to determine the embryos that \nare implantable, the embryos that are freezable, and the embryos that \nare clinically or naturally dead.\n  Level I embryos, after in vitro fertilization, are created within the \nfirst 3 days. They are viable embryos with a cluster of eight cells \nready for implantation and can develop into a human being. After 4 \nadditional days, additional embryos develop that contain the essential \neight cells, and they are viable for freezing or for implantation. But \nafter 7 days, the natural process of the cells dividing no longer takes \nplace, and there are level III Gardner principle materials that are \nleft that contain embryonic stem cells but cannot be implanted and \ncannot become a human being. Five of those lines were in existence in \n2001 and were invested in by NIH and are active today.\n  So it is absolutely possible for further embryonic stem cell research \nto take place today without destroying a viable embryo and to have a \nplethora of available stem cells for researchers and for scientists. \nThat, by the way, has been certified by any number of learned doctors \nand physicians and researchers and I wish to share some of those quotes \nat this time.\n  There was an article written, ``A Comparison of National Institute of \nHealth-Approved Human Embryonic Stem Cell Lines,'' by Carol Ware, \nAngelique Nelson, and Anthony Blau. In that, they compared 15 of the 22 \nlines that at the time were active under the August 2001 Presidential \nexecutive directive, and I quote:\n\n       They compare stem cell markers, and growth characteristics \n     of and ease of genetic manipulation of all lines. Only 10 of \n     the lines were easily tested and our 3 lines again were one \n     of those 10 lines derived from naturally dead embryos. None \n     of the 10 lines were statistically different in any way when \n     7 different growth and characteristics experiments were \n     conducted. The take home message is that there is no \n     difference between our 3 lines, the 3 lines derived from \n     naturally dead embryos, and the other 7 lines which were \n     derived from donated embryos.\n\n  So there you have it clearly and precisely stated that we have active \nembryonic stem cell lines under research and funded by the NIH derived \nfrom a naturally dead embryo that did not involve the destruction of a \nviable embryo.\n  With the passage of S. 30, you immediately have the opportunity, and \nNIH is directed, to develop those guidelines for the furtherance of \nadditional embryonic stem cell research on stem cells derived from \nthose lines.\n  Now, there are a number of other distinguished and learned people who \nhave written extensively about these lines and their viability, among \nthem Sandii Brimble and Yongquan Luo. Mr. Luo is at the Laboratory of \nNeuroscience, National Institute of Aging, Department of Health and \nHuman Services, in Baltimore, MD, who wrote:\n\n       Lines BG01, BG02, and BG03, which are the three lines NIH \n     currently is investing in that were derived from naturally \n     dead embryos, are therefore independent, undifferentiated, \n     and pluripotent lines that can be maintained without \n     accumulation of karyotypic abnormalities.\n\n  It took me a long time to practice saying those last two words, but I \nfinally got through it. The point being that they are equally as viable \nas pluripotent and as rich for scientific research as those cells that \nwould have been derived from a destroyed embryo.\n  In addition, I wish to quote from an article called Embryonic Death \nand the Creation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells, written by Dr. Donald \nW. Landry and Howard A. Zucker of Columbia University. I read as \nfollows:\n\n       We propose herein a paradigm for research involving embryos \n     that protects human life, is consistent with Federal policy, \n     and yet advances the interests of biomedical science and \n     therapeutic innovation.\n\n  That is precisely quoting the definition of natural death for embryos \nas the threshold for which that should go forward.\n  In terms of making ``naturally dead'' a term that is understandable, \nthis bill defines ``natural death'' in regard to embryos as the same \nacceptable way that death is defined in all 50 States of the United \nStates of America. In my 30 years of public life, I have been through a \nnumber of ethical debates--the ``living will'' debates of the 1970s and \nthe ``durable power of attorney,'' where we tried to legislate how you, \nMr. President, or I could give an advanced directive of what a doctor \ncould or could not do to me when I came to be in an incapacitated \nstate, and we finally decided that an irreversible cessation of brain \nwaves would be a clinical definition upon which that threshold can take \nplace.\n  A ``naturally dead'' embryo is an embryo that, after the seventh day, \nhas a cessation of the division of cells. It no longer can be implanted \nand become an embryo, but the cells that remain are viable, just as my \nheart, liver, kidneys, or lungs remain alive while I have an \nirreversible cessation of brain waves. It is that precedent which \nestablished all the organ transplants we do in America today--the gift \nof life that is given after the loss of life and the irreversible \ncessation of brain waves. This is, clinically, as Dr. Landry and Dr. \nZucker have said, precisely the exact way to deal with the ethics and \nthe morality of embryonic stem cell research because it is the same \nthing for that embryo that cannot become a human being to donate cells \nto become pluripotent embryonic stem cells as it is for a predirective \nto determine that organs can be transplanted from someone who has \nsuffered an irreversible cessation of brain waves. It is scientific. It \nis ethical. And it is precise.\n  I submit the President of the United States has said he would--\nactually did last year--veto a bill similar to the one introduced by \nSenator Harkin. The President said he will veto it again. Senator \nSpecter, in his compassionate remarks and passionate remarks, \nacknowledged that the number of votes necessary to override a veto did \nnot exist in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  If, in fact, it is a matter of not if but when, with the adoption of \nS. 30, we can make the when now. We can see to it that the promise of \nembryonic stem cell research goes forward and the ethical lines that \ncause the dilemma that exists today in the United States of America are \nnot crossed.\n  There is a human face on the desire to further that research. It is \nthe face like that of a friend of mine, like former Senator Kip Klein, \nwho suffers from Parkinson's and who has been an inspiration to me to \nfind methods like this; and Cindy Donald, a beautiful lady who \ntragically was injured in an automobile accident and lost her ability \nto walk. There is hope and promise in centers such as the Shepherd \nSpinal Center in Atlanta which deals with those terrible injuries to \nthe spinal cord. There is the hope to see to it that those who suffer \nfrom diabetes and juvenile diabetes can, in fact, find a cure that is \npossible and within our reach.\n  To that end, at the University of Georgia today, which I have already \nreferred to a number of times, that research on embryonic stem cell \nresearch for the curing of diabetes is taking place. It is taking place \nin a laboratory and under the direction of eminent scholars, one of \nwhom is Dr. Steven Stice, one of America's leading scholars today and \none of the embryonic researchers who himself introduced to me this \nmethod, given his recognition of the ethical considerations and his \ndesire and hope to bring promise and hope to the future of those who \nsuffer.\n  I submit that the Coleman-Isakson bill, S. 30, is a road for us to \nwalk proudly down, that enhances and advances, immediately, research \ninto embryonic stem cell cures while at the same time respecting the \nethical, scientific, and moral concerns that exist in the medical \ncommunity today. It is not always possible in the body politic for \nsolutions to be win-win, but I submit that S. 30, the Coleman-Isakson\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\nbill, is a win-win. It is a win for hope, it is a win for research, and \nit is a win for promise.\n  I am pleased to yield to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, \nMr. Norm Coleman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I thank my colleague from Georgia, who shares the \npassion of the Senator from Iowa, shares the passion of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. We want to see scientific breakthroughs. We want to \nsee cures for those kids who suffer from juvenile diabetes and friends \nwho have ALS. I have a brother-in-law who suffers from Parkinson's.\n  How do we get there? Senator Specter noted that, as he filled an \nhourglass and said: The clock is ticking--and it is. The question \nbecomes how do we move forward, not just in the debate but action. I am \na former mayor. If it snowed in St. Paul and the streets weren't \nplowed, I heard about it. That is what you do--take action.\n  If we look at the amount of research going on in stem cell research, \nhuman embryonic stem cell research--they are pluripotent. What we are \ntalking about is an ability of stem cells to--they have apparently an \nincredible elastic ability to be perhaps transformed to a heart or a \nliver, an incredible capacity--in theory. But clearly, scientists, I \nthink uniformly, believe there is great hope and great opportunity \nthere.\n  The reality today is that there is a certain amount of Federal \ndollars. What we are talking about is Federal dollars. We are not \ntalking about the sum of all research but simply, What does the Federal \nGovernment do? What do we do with taxpayer dollars? Where do we put \nthem?\n  In terms of human embryonic, pluripotent, the President said--I think \nit was in 2001--he talked about a series of lines that would be \navailable, just that. He was drawing the line there in terms of \nembryonic stem cells. Of those lines, originally there were 60 or 70, \nand there are now about 20 lines.\n\n  There is about $132 million being spent in Federal money in human \nembryonic stem cell research and over $1 billion in human nonembryonic \ncord blood stem cell, bone marrow, other kinds of research--all of \nwhich is promising. In some areas, there are actually therapies going \non.\n  It is fascinating. Scientists are also very passionate. I am not a \nscientist, but I have been listening to them. There are those \nscientists who are advocates of embryonic stem cell, and they are \npassionate that this is the way. Clearly, in theory, in terms of \npluripotency, embryonic stem cells have more pluripotency than adult \nstem cells, but the critics say you have the process of embryonic stem \ncells, that they have the rejection because when you have organ \ntransplants, you put another genetic material into somebody, and there \nare problems of rejection. You have the problem of tumors growing from \nthem. They say we have to support adult stem cell because that is where \nthe work is being done, that is where the breakthroughs are happening. \nOf course, other scientists come back and say, rightfully so, that \nadult stem cells do not have the elasticity, the pluripotency of \nembryonic, and so that is not the way. The question is, Is there a \nthird way? Is there a way to get past the culture wars, to get past the \ngreat divide we have?\n  There are many in this country who believe passionately that Federal \ndollars should not be used for research which involves the destruction \nof a human embryo, who believe very passionately about that. There are \nothers who say the cause of science is so great, the size of this \nembryo is so small, the hope we have to offer is so great, we need to \nmove forward. There is a divide.\n  The reality today is, with policy as it is, if the Harkin-Specter \nbill passes--which I presume it will, probably overwhelmingly it will \npass--and a similar bill is passed in the House and ultimately we work \nout the language and the President then vetoes it and, as my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania recognizes, there are not enough votes to override \nthe veto, at the end of the day of January 1, 2008, there will still \nnot be more than $132 million spent on human embryonic pluripotency \nresearch.\n  The question is, Is there another way? Senator Isakson has talked \nabout another way. He talked about dead embryos. My colleague from Iowa \ndismissed it: Dead embryos, what does that mean?\n  My colleague explained it well, that embryonic stem cells produced by \nthat method have the same pluripotency, the same capacity as other \nembryonic stem cells, but they do not cross the moral line.\n  Within S. 30, there is the point of doing other kinds of research \nthat does not cross the moral line. One is called altered nuclear \ntransfer. Later I will, perhaps, put up some charts to show how it \nworks, but very simply, if you think about it, science 101, take an egg \nand sperm, they come together, create an embryo, become a person--one \nof the pages here or a Senator or mom and dad sitting somewhere. Then \nwhat we do with altered nuclear transfer--actually, by the way, if you \nrelate it to cloning, it is not cloning, but if you think of the \nconcept of cloning, you take an egg, put some genetic material from an \nadult in there, and it becomes a person. Practically, we had Dolly the \nsheep, so we know that works. Altered nuclear transfer basically says \ntake that egg, take some genetic material, and before you put it in \nthere, you program the egg so it doesn't create an embryo but creates a \ntissue mass which has the same pluripotency, the ability to do all the \nother things any other embryonic stem cell would do.\n  I have a series of letters from scientists who say this should work. \nI will quote:\n\n       Research results suggest that Altered Nuclear Transfer may \n     be able to produce human pluripotent stem cells--the \n     functional equivalent of embryonic stem cells--in a manner \n     that is simpler and more efficient than current methods.\n\n  That is by Hans Schoeler, chairman of the Department of Cell and \nDevelopmental Biology at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.\n\n       Recently, multiple labs in the United States and around the \n     world have published or reported experiments in which adult \n     cells were converted, not to embryos, but directly to \n     pluripotent ``embryonic-like'' cells. The resulting cells \n     were virtually indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells \n     derived from embryos. The techniques used have included \n     altered nuclear transfer, cell fusion and chemical \n     reprogramming. The results were obtained from the top \n     scientists in the field and published in the best journals.\n\n  That is by Markus Grompe, M.D., Oregon Stem Cell Center.\n  One last quote:\n\n       I think that current scientific evidence and reasonable \n     expectations make it likely that altering a donor nucleus to \n     preclude normal organization of any subsequent blastocyst is \n     technically feasible and consistent with the scientific and \n     medical goals of embryonic stem cell research.\n\n  That is by Lawrence S.B. Goldstein, Ph.D., Department of Cellular and \nMolecular Medicine at the University of California, San Diego.\n  Much of the work is from a doctor, Dr. William B. Hurlbut, over at \nStanford, the Neuroscience Institute at Stanford. I worked with him. He \nhas published a lot on this issue. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a presentation by Dr. Hurlbut entitled ``Stem \nCells, Embryos and Ethics: Is There a Way Forward?''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Stem Cells, Embryos and Ethics: Is There a Way Forward?\n\n  (By William B. Hurlbut, M.D.,University of Notre Dame, Neuroscience \n                 Institute at Stanford, Apr. 18, 2006)\n\n       We are at a crucial moment in the process of scientific \n     discovery. The dramatic advances in molecular biology \n     throughout the 20th century have culminated in the sequencing \n     of the human genome and increasing knowledge of cell \n     physiology and cytology. These studies were accomplished by \n     breaking down organic systems into their component parts. \n     Now, however, as we move on from genomics and proteomics to \n     discoveries in developmental biology, we have returned to the \n     study of living beings. When applied to human biology, this \n     inquiry reopens the most fundamental questions concerning the \n     relationship between the material form and the moral meaning \n     of developing life.\n       The current conflict over ES cell research is just the \n     first in a series of difficult controversies that will \n     require us to define with clarity and precision the moral \n     boundaries we seek to defend. Human-animal Chimeras, \n     parthenogenesis, projects involving the laboratory production \n     of organs--and a wide range of other emerging technologies \n     will continue to challenge our definitions of human life. \n     These are not questions for science alone, but for the full \n     breadth of human wisdom and experience.\n       The scientific arguments for going forward with this \n     research are strong.\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\n       --The convergence of these advancing technologies is \n     delivering unprecedented powers for research into the most \n     basic questions in early human development.\n       --Beyond the obvious benefit of understanding the \n     biological factors behind the estimated 150,000 births with \n     serious congenital defects per year, it is becoming \n     increasingly evident that certain pathologies that are only \n     manifest later in life are influenced or have their origins \n     in early development.\n       --Furthermore, fundamental developmental processes \n     (including the formation and functioning of stem cells), and \n     their disordered dynamics, seem to be at work in a range of \n     adult pathologies including some forms of cancer.\n       Yet from the moral and social perspective there are serious \n     concerns. (This is an eight-cell embryo on the sharp tip of a \n     pin.)\n       It is important to acknowledge the many scientific projects \n     for which human embryos could be used. Beyond their \n     destruction for the procurement of embryonic cells, some fear \n     the industrial scale production of living human embryos for a \n     wide range of research in natural development, toxicology and \n     drug testing.\n       Lord Alton, a member of the House of Lords in the UK told \n     me that they estimate over 100,000 human embryos have already \n     been used in scientific experimentation in Britain.\n       Beyond that, there is concern about the commodification and \n     commercialization of eggs and embryos, and worry about the \n     implications of ongoing research to create an artificial \n     endometrium (a kind of artificial womb) that would allow the \n     extracorporeal gestation of cloned embryos to later stages \n     for the production of more advanced cells, tissues and \n     organs.\n       Furthermore, from a social perspective, do we really want \n     to have red state medicine/blue state medicine? The emerging \n     patchwork of policies on the state level threatens to create \n     a situation in which a large percentage of patients will \n     enter the hospital with moral qualms about the foundations on \n     which their treatments have been developed. What was \n     traditionally the sanctuary of compassionate care at the most \n     vulnerable and sensitive moments of human life is becoming an \n     arena of controversy and conflict.\n       Clearly, both sides of this difficult debate are defending \n     important human goods--and both of these goods are important \n     for all of us. A purely political solution will leave our \n     country bitterly divided, eroding the social support and \n     sense of noble purpose that is essential for the public \n     funding of biomedical science. While there are currently no \n     federally legislated constraints on the use of private funds \n     for this research, there is a consensus opinion in the \n     scientific community that without NIH support for newly \n     created embryonic stem cell lines, progress in this important \n     realm of research will be severely constrained.\n       The current conflict in the political arena is damaging to \n     science, to religion and to our larger sense of national \n     unity. The way this debate is proceeding is, in my opinion, \n     completely contrary to the positive pluralism that is the \n     strength of our democracy.\n       What is needed is to draw back from the polarized positions \n     of political rhetoric and to respectfully reflect on the \n     meaning of the moment we are in.\n       In the spirit of such a dialogue, and in the hope that it \n     might lead us toward a resolution of our difficult national \n     impasse over embryonic stem cell research, I offer the \n     perspective that follows.\n\n\n                     moral meaning of emerging life\n\n       Any evaluation of the moral significance of human life must \n     take into account the full procession of continuity and \n     change that is essential for its development. With the act of \n     conception, a new life is initiated with a distinct genetic \n     endowment that organizes and guides the growth of a unique \n     and unrepeatable human being.\n       The gametes (the sperm and egg), although alive as cells, \n     are not living beings: they are instrumental organic agents \n     of the parents. The joining of the gametes brings into \n     existence an entirely different kind of entity, a living \n     human organism. With regard to fundamental biological meaning \n     (and moral significance), the act of fertilization is a leap \n     from zero to everything.\n       In both structure and function, the zygote (the one cells \n     embryo) and subsequent embryonic stages differ from all other \n     cells or tissues of the body; they contain within themselves \n     the organizing principle for the full development of a human \n     being. The very word organism implies organization, an \n     overarching principle that binds the parts and processes of \n     life into a harmonious whole. As a living being, an organism \n     is an integrated, self-developing and self-maintaining unity \n     under the governance of an immanent plan.\n       For an embryonic organism, this implies an inherent \n     potency, an engaged and effective potential with a drive in \n     the direction of the mature form. By its very nature, an \n     embryo is a developing being. Its wholeness is defined by \n     both its manifest expression and its latent potential; it is \n     the phase of human life in which the `whole' (as the unified \n     organismal principle of growth) precedes and produces its \n     organic parts. The philosopher Robert Joyce explains: \n     ``Living beings come into existence all at once and then \n     gradually unfold to themselves and to the world what they \n     already but only incipiently are.'' To be a human organism is \n     to be a whole living member of the species Homo sapiens, with \n     a human present and a human future evident in the intrinsic \n     potential for the manifestation of the species typical form. \n     Joyce continues: ``No living being can become anything other \n     than what it already essentially is.''\n       It is this implicit whole, with its inherent potency, that \n     endows the embryo with continuity of human identity from the \n     moment of conception and therefore, from this perspective, \n     inviolable moral status. To interfere in its development is \n     to transgress upon a life in process. The principle of this \n     analysis applies to any entity that has the same potency as a \n     human embryo produced by natural fertilization, regardless of \n     whether it is the product of IVF, cloning, or other \n     processes.\n     Accrued moral status\n       The major alternative to the view that an embryo has an \n     inherent moral status is the assertion that moral status is \n     an accrued or accumulated quality related to some dimension \n     of morphology or function.\n       The three arguments currently given in support of a 14 day \n     limit on embryo research--lack of differentiation, lack of \n     individuation and pre-implantation status--are based on a \n     kind of `received tradition' that dates back to the 1986 \n     Warnock Commission in the UK. But this commission explicitly \n     acknowledged the continuous nature of embryonic development, \n     stating: ``There is no particular part of the developmental \n     process that is more important than any other.'' In a recent \n     memoir, Mary Warnock discussed the utilitarian grounding of \n     her commission's analysis acknowledging that her committee's \n     task was ``to recommend a policy which might allow the sort \n     of medical and scientific progress which was in the public \n     interest.'' Indeed, recent advances in embryology do not \n     support this commission's conclusions.\n       The argument on differentiation is based on the idea that \n     before gastrulation (which begins around the 12th to 14th day \n     with the formation of the primitive streak), the embryo is an \n     inchoate clump of cells with no actuated drive in the \n     direction of distinct development.\n       It is argued that the undifferentiated quality of the \n     blastocyst (the 4-5 day embryo) justifies its disaggregation \n     for the procurement of stem cells, while the evident \n     organization at gastrulation reveals an organismal integrity \n     that endows inviolable moral status to all subsequent stages \n     of embryological development.\n       Scientific evidence, however, supports the opposing \n     argument--that from conception there is an unbroken \n     continuity in the differentiation and organization of the \n     emerging individual life, the anterior-posterior axis appears \n     to be already established within the zygote (the one-cell \n     stage); the earliest embryonic cell divisions (at least at by \n     the 4 cell stage) exhibit differential gene expression; the \n     unequal cytoplasmic concentrations of cell constituents in \n     the early embryo suggest distinct cellular fates.\n       All this implies that the changes at gastrulation do not \n     represent a discontinuity of ontological significance (a \n     change in the nature of being), but merely the visibly \n     evident culmination of more subtle developmental processes \n     at the cellular level that are driving in the direction of \n     organismal maturity.\n       These new scientific perspetives were documented in a July \n     2002 article in Nature: ``The mammalian body plan starts \n     being laid down from the moment of conception . . . a \n     suprising shift in embryological thinking.''\n     Twinning\n       Another argument for accrued moral status is that as long \n     as an embryo is capable of giving rise to a twin it cannot be \n     considered to have the moral standing of an individual.\n       Yet monozygotic twinning, which occurs in just one in 240 \n     births, does not appear to be either an intrinsic drive or a \n     random process within embryogenesis. Rather, it results from \n     a disruption of normal development by a mechanical or \n     biochemical disturbance of fragile cell relationships. This \n     provokes a compensatory repair, but with the restitution of \n     integrity within two distinct trajectories of embryological \n     development.\n       In considering the implications of twinning for \n     individuation, one might better ask the question from the \n     opposite perspective. What keeps each of the cells of the \n     early embryo from becoming a full embryo? Clearly, crucial \n     relational dynamics of position and intercellular \n     communication are already at work establishing the unified \n     pattern of the emerging individual.\n       From this perspective twinning is not evidence of the \n     absence of an individual, but of an extraordinary power of \n     compensatory repair that reflects more fully the potency of \n     the individual drive to fullness of form even in the earliest \n     stages of embryonic human life.\n     Implantation\n       Some have argued that the implantation of the embryo within \n     the uterine lining of the mother constitutes a moment of \n     altered moral status.\n       Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tubes.\n       The embryo floats down into the uterus and begins to \n     implant in the uterine wall around the 6th-7th day. All along \n     this journey the diffusion of essential nutrients and growth \n     factors sustains the life and nourishes the growth of the \n     developing embryo. Implantation and the development of the \n     placenta simply extend this relationship between mother and \n     embryo with an internal circulation as the embryo gets too \n     large to be nourished by direct diffusion.\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\n       Implantation, then, must be viewed as just another step in \n     a continuum of ongoing intimate dependence, all occuring \n     along the trajectory of natural development that begins with \n     conception and continues into infancy. This continuity \n     implies no meaningful moral marker at implantation.\n     Function\n       Most other arguments relate in some way to the onset of a \n     specific function or capacity. Arguments for a change in \n     moral status based on function are at once the most difficult \n     to refute and to defend.\n       The first and most obvious problem is that the essential \n     functions (and even their minimal criteria and age of onset) \n     are diverse and arbitrarily assigned. Generally they relate \n     to the onset of sentience, awareness of pain, or some \n     apparently unique human cognitive capability such as \n     consciousness.\n       This approach raises a number of disturbing ethical \n     questions.\n       --If human moral worth is based on actual manifest \n     functions, then does more of that function give an individual \n     life a higher moral value?\n       --And what are we to make of the parallel functional \n     capacities in animals that we routinely sacrifice for food \n     and medical research?\n       --Furthermore, what becomes of human moral status with the \n     degeneration or disappearance of such functions? While we \n     might argue that our relational obligations change along with \n     changes in function, such as occur with senile dementia, we \n     would not sanction a utilitarian calculus and the purely \n     instrumental use of such persons no matter how promising the \n     medical benefits might be.\n       More fundamentally, from a scientific perspective, there is \n     no meaningful moment when one can definitively designate the \n     biological origins of a human characteristic such as \n     consciousness. The human being is an inseparable psycho-\n     physical unity. Our thinking is in and through our bodily \n     being, and thus the roots of our consciousness reach deep \n     into our development. The earliest stages of human \n     development serve as the indispensable and \n     enduring foundations for the powers of freedom and self-\n     awareness that reach their fullest expression in the adult \n     form.\n       With respect to fundamental moral status therefore, the \n     human being is an embodied being whose intrinsic dignity is \n     inseparable from its full procession of life and always \n     present in its varied stages of emergence.\n       This conclusion is consistent with 2,500 years of medical \n     science--as recently as 1948, the Physicians Oath in the \n     Declaration of Geneva, echoing the enduring traditions of \n     Hippocratic medicine, proclaimed: ``I will maintain the \n     utmost respect for human life from the time of conception.''\n       As we descend into an instrumental use of human life we \n     destroy the very reason for which we were undertaking our new \n     therapies; we degrade the humanity we were trying to heal.\n\n\n                     In Vitro Fertilization Embryos\n\n       This brings us to the dilemma of the moral status of an \n     estimated one million embryos left over from in vitro \n     fertalization (IVF). Created to give life, they are now \n     suspended in time and space and the uncertainty of a \n     conflicted fate.\n       In this canister in the Assisted Reproduction Technologies \n     clinic at Stanford are 300 embryos. The water in their cells \n     has been replaced with glycerol and they are immersed in \n     liquid nitrogen at a temprature of minus 200 degrees Celsius. \n     (I joke with my friend, the director of the lab, that this \n     must be the densest population in human history.)\n       But the future of these embryos is a poignant problem. In \n     some cases, such embryos have been implanted as long as \n     twelve and a half years after freezing, including one born \n     seven and a half years after its twin. In other cases, there \n     have been custody battles over the frozen embryos after \n     divorces and even a dispute over inheritance when a wealthy \n     couple died in an airplane crash and left several embryonic \n     hiers with numerous couples stepping forward and offering to \n     adopt them. But most of these one million frozen embryos do \n     not have such privileged prospects. They are castoffs, \n     destined to be discarded or disaggregated in the service of \n     medical science.\n       And this is a warning to us of how even the best intentions \n     of our science, unconstrained by the forethought of moral \n     consideration, slips slowly along the gradient of utility. \n     Each of these embryos, once the precious promise of a happy \n     baby, is now relegated to the category of mere matter, raw \n     material in a larger program of scientific progress.\n       However much we may agree or disagree with the process that \n     put them there, we should acknowledge that this is a \n     difficult dilemma. Produced with a healing purpose, the good \n     intentions of overcoming the sorrow of infertility, they are \n     now abandoned to a project of a completely different \n     character. Some say that if there is a moral problem it is \n     upstream, in the process that put them there and that now, \n     since they are destined to die, what further harm can be \n     done? As a pragmatic people, many Americans feel the weight \n     of this argument. And, if we fail to develop a morally \n     acceptable alternative source of embryonic stem cells, I \n     suspect that is where our national policy may settle.\n       Yet even if use of these embryos becomes accepted policy \n     and practice, we should be aware of something more \n     complicated that is below the surface: there has been a slow \n     but steady shift in our underlying attitude toward human \n     life. As we gain the powers of comprehension and control over \n     our most basic biology, there is a transformation, not just \n     in our physical being, but in our whole sense of who we are, \n     and of our place and purpose within the natural order.\n       As we take increasing instrumental control over natural \n     life processes our attitude changes and we lose the sense of \n     cautionary reverence and respect. With each step, however \n     benevolent the initial intention, there is a moral danger, a \n     fracturing of matter and meaning that breaks the coherence \n     and natural connections of life. With each step, the original \n     radiance and vitality of the cosmos, its order, beauty and \n     coherent moral meaning, are obscured by the conviction that \n     all of living nature is mere matter and information, to be \n     reshuffled and reassigned for the projects of the human will.\n       This instrumental use of life reaches its most ominous \n     extension as we relegate the human embryo to the status of a \n     resource, as raw material in the service of our project in \n     the mastery over nature. Such an instrumental use of early \n     human life opens a doorway down a long corridor indeed.\n       For one thing, many of these embryos are not at the \n     developmental state for harvesting embryonic stem cells and \n     would have to undergo further laboratory culture to the \n     blastocyst stage. Will we not want to use some for \n     experiments to perfect the culture medium? And while we are \n     at it, there are many other studies that could be done on \n     early embryos to help perfect IVF.\n       Thirty years ago, when IVF first came on the scene there \n     was a difficult debate in congress over support of research \n     that involves the destruction of human life. This debate \n     culminated in 1996 with the passage of the Dickey Amendment \n     that forbids federal funding for projects that endanger or \n     destroy human embryos. As with abortion, IVF, involving the \n     creation and implantation or disposal of embryos, would be a \n     matter of personal choice done with private funds.\n       Will we now retreat and override this decision--or is only \n     embryonic stem cell research urgent enough to justify an \n     exception to this long-standing federal policy? Furthermore, \n     even if we endorse this course of action, the 14-day limit on \n     the use of human embryos will not hold since it does not \n     stand up to logical argument. As discussed above, the \n     designation of fourteen days as the moral boundary for embryo \n     experimentation is in the category of a `received tradition,' \n     almost a superstition in the sense that it is a belief in a \n     change of state without a discernible cause. As a moral \n     marker, fourteen days makes no sense, it is arbitrarily set \n     and therefore vulnerable to transgression through the \n     persuasive promise of further scientific benefit.\n\n\n                              Beyond cells\n\n       And it is becoming increasingly apparent that the promise \n     of stem cells lies beyond simple cell cultures and cell \n     replacement. The technological goal is to produce more \n     advanced cell types and even tissues, organs, and possibly \n     limb primordia. Producing such complex tissues and organs may \n     require the intricate cell interactions and microenvironments \n     now available only through natural gestation.\n       During embryogenesis, differentiation and organ formation \n     unfold within the fragile spatio-temporal induction of a \n     highly specific sequence of cell signaling--different signals \n     coming from different sides and in a perfect synchrony of \n     process.\n       Consider the formation of the human hand. It begins as a \n     small bud induced off the trunk of the embryo, then through \n     an extraordinary orchestration of cell interactions it \n     progressively unfolds toward its functional form. But once \n     initiated (after about the 5-6th week of embryogenesis), the \n     limb bud can actually be severed from the embryo and, given \n     the right environment, will continue its momentum of \n     development as an independent unit.\n       I have seen just such a hand in the bottom of a test tube. \n     The tiny limb bud, snipped from the fetal remains of a 5 week \n     old aborted fetus, was implanted into the abdominal cavity of \n     a SCID mouse (a special kind of mouse that won't reject the \n     tissue), and grown till it was about \\1/4\\ inch wide. I \n     looked down on that little hand and I thought to myself--this \n     is fantastic, one day we may grow limbs for people with \n     congenital malformations or injuries and amputations. But at \n     the same time I thought--this was going to be someone's \n     little hand, that tender little newborn hand that lays across \n     his mother's breast while nursing.\n       But if we might one day grow human limbs, we might even \n     more easily grow other organs--kidneys, livers and hearts. \n     Scientists in Isreal have already established that human \n     kidney primordia taken from 7-8 week old aborted fetuses can \n     be successfully grown in mice--a feat proclaimed as ``a \n     breakthrough that might one day help save thousands of \n     patients waiting for transplants.'' (There are 50,000 people \n     in the U.S. alone on dialysis, waiting for kidney \n     transplants--an estimated 17 deaths a day are due to the \n     inadequate organ supply.) Furthermore, several years ago it \n     was announced that a scientist in China successfully \n     sustained in vitro a human heart severed from its source in a \n     7 week old aborted fetus.\n       The benefits of implanting embryos in order to employ the \n     developmental dynamics of natural embryogenesis for the \n     production of limb and organ primordia seem self-evident.\n       The implantation of cloned embryos (either into the natural \n     womb or possibly an artificial endometrium) for the \n     production of\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\n     patient specific tissue types to bypass problems of immune \n     rejection would further extend the logic of the instrumental \n     use of developing life.\n       The public pressure that has already been brought to bear \n     on the politics of stem cells and cloning by patient advocacy \n     groups has provoked such a sense of promise that it may \n     propel the argument for allowing such gestation of cloned \n     human embryos.\n       Over the past four years, I have talked with hundreds of \n     people, including many scientists, who say that they would \n     find such a practice, (that is, the implantation of a cloned \n     embryo) acceptable to save the life of a dying child.\n       Different people have different limits to the duration of \n     gestation they find morally acceptable, but in light of the \n     current sanction of abortion up to and beyond the end of the \n     second trimester, it is difficult to argue that creation, \n     gestation and sacrifice of a clone to save an existing life \n     is a large leap in the logic of justification. The argument \n     is made that if abortion is legal, that is, if a developing \n     life can be terminated with no reason given, then why not \n     for a good reason? One must admit there is a certain \n     perverse logic to this argument.\n\n\n                              white paper\n\n       In light of the arguments given above that human moral \n     worth is based on a continuity of embodied form from \n     fertilization to natural death, it would seem that we are at \n     an irresolvable impasse. If embryonic stem cells can be \n     obtained only by the destruction of human embryos this may, \n     in fact, be the case. But last May a White Paper by the \n     President's Council on Bioethics suggested otherwise. This \n     report describes four proposals put forward as possible means \n     of obtaining embryonic stem cells without the creation and \n     destruction of human embryos.\n       As the author of one of the proposals, Altered Nuclear \n     Transfer, I would like to draw on this to discuss the \n     scientific advances and moral reasoning that may lead us to a \n     technological solution to our national conflict.\n\n\n                        altered nuclear transfer\n\n       As described above, natural conception signals the \n     activation of the organizing principle for the self-\n     development and self-maintenance of the full human organism. \n     In the language of stem cell biology, this capability is \n     termed ``totipotency,'' the capacity to form the complete \n     organism. A naturally fertilized egg, the one cell embryo, is \n     totipotent.\n       In contrast, the term ``pluripotency,'' designates the \n     capacity to produce all the cell types of the human body but \n     not the coherent and integrated unity of a living being. \n     Embryonic stem cells are merely pluripotent. This is a \n     difference between the material parts and the living whole.\n       Altered Nuclear Transfer would draw on the basic technique \n     of SCNT (popularly known as ``therapeutic cloning'') but with \n     an alteration such that pluripotent stem cells are produced \n     without the creation and destruction of totipotent human \n     embryos.\n       In standard nuclear transfer the cell nucleus is removed \n     from an adult body cell and transferred into an egg cell that \n     first has its own nucleus removed. The egg then has a full \n     set of DNA and, after it is electrically stimulated, starts \n     to divide like a naturally fertilized egg. This is how Dolly \n     the sheep was produced.\n       Altered Nuclear Transfer uses the technology of nuclear \n     transfer but with a preemptive alteration that assures that \n     no embryo is created. The adult body cell nucleus or the \n     enucleated egg's contents (or both) are first altered before \n     the adult body cell nucleus is transferred into the egg. The \n     alterations cause the adult body cell DNA to function in such \n     a way that no embryo is generated, but pluripotent stem cells \n     are produced.\n       There is natural precedent for such a project. In normal \n     conception, fertilization signals the activation of the \n     organizing principle for the self-development of the full \n     human organism.\n       But without all of the essential elements--the necessary \n     complement of chromosomes, proper epigenetic configuration \n     and the cytoplasmic factors for gene expression--there can be \n     no living whole, no organism, and no human embryo. Recent \n     scientific evidence suggests incomplete combinations of the \n     necessary elements--`failures of fertilization'--are the fate \n     of many, perhaps most, of early natural initiations in \n     reproduction.\n\n\n                       failures of fertilization\n\n       It is important to realize that many of these naturally \n     occurring failures of fertilization may still proceed along \n     partial trajectories of organic growth without being actual \n     organisms. For example, certain grossly abnormal karyotypes \n     (including haploid genomes, with only half the natural number \n     of chromosomes) will form blastocyst-like structures but will \n     not implant.\n       Even an egg without a nucleus, when artificially activated \n     has the developmental power to divide to the eight-cell \n     stage, yet clearly is not an embryo--or an organism at all. \n     The mRNA for the protein synthesis that drives these early \n     cell divisions is generated during the maturation of the egg \n     and then activated after fertilization. Like a spinning top, \n     the cells contain a certain biological momentum that propels \n     a partial trajectory of development, but unlike a normal \n     embryo they are unable to bootstrap themselves into becoming \n     an integrated and self-regulating organism.\n       Some of these aberrant products of fertilization that lack \n     the qualities and characteristics of an organism, appear to \n     be capable of generating ES cells or their functional \n     equivalent. Mature teratomas are benign tumors that generate \n     all three primary embryonic cell types as well as more \n     advanced cells and tissues, including partial limb and organ \n     primordia--and sometimes hair, fingernails and even fully \n     formed teeth. (The white opacities in this x-ray are adult-\n     size molars.) Yet these chaotic, disorganized, and \n     nonfunctional masses are like a bag of jumbled puzzle parts, \n     lacking entirely the structural and dynamic character of \n     organisms. Neither medical science nor the major religious \n     traditions have ever considered these growths to be `moral \n     beings' worthy of protection, yet they produce embryonic stem \n     cells.\n       These benign ovarian tumors, appear to be derived by \n     spontaneous development of activated eggs. The disorganized \n     character of teratomas appears to arise, not from changes in \n     the DNA sequence, but from genetic imprinting, an epigenetic \n     modification that affects the pattern of gene expression \n     (keeping some genes turned off and others on). In \n     natural reproduction the sperm and egg have different, but \n     complementary, patterns of imprinting, allowing a \n     coordinated control of embryological development. When an \n     egg is activated without a sperm, the trophectoderm (the \n     outer layer in a natural embryo--sometimes called the \n     trophoblast) and its lineages fail to develop properly. In \n     the absence of the complementary genetic contribution of \n     the male, the activated egg is simply inadequately \n     constituted to direct the integrated development \n     characteristic of human embryogenesis.\n\n\n                            Systems Biology\n\n       This example points to another new dimension of our \n     advancing knowledge. Through systems biology, we are \n     beginning to recognize how even a small change of one gene \n     can affect the entire balance of an enormous network of \n     biochemical processes necessary to initiate and sustain the \n     existence of a living being.\n       Systems biology offers us the view of an organism as a \n     dynamic whole, an interactive web of interdependent processes \n     that express emergent properties not apparent in the \n     biochemical parts. Within this dynamic self-sustaining system \n     is the very principle of life, the organizing information and \n     coordinated coherence of a living being. With the full \n     complement of coordinated parts, an organismal system \n     subsumes and sustains the parts; it exerts a downward \n     causation that binds and balances the parts into a patterned \n     program of integrated growth and development. Partial organic \n     subsystems (cells, tissues and organs) that are components of \n     this larger whole, if separated or separately produced, may \n     temporarily proceed forward in development. But without the \n     coherent coordination and robust self-regulation of the full \n     organism, they will ultimately become merely disorganized \n     cellular growth.\n       ANT proposes that small, but precisely selected alterations \n     will allow the harnessing of partial developmental \n     trajectories apart from their full natural context in order \n     to produce ES cells.\n\n\n                                  CDX2\n\n       Altered nuclear transfer is a broad concept with a range of \n     possible approaches; there may be many ways this technique \n     can be used to accomplish the same end.\n       One variation involves the deletion or silencing of a gene \n     essential at the most primary level of coordinated \n     organization. As described in a January 2006 paper in the \n     journal Nature, stem cell biologist Rudolf Jaenisch has \n     established the scientific feasibility of this approach in a \n     series of dramatic mouse model experiments in which he \n     procured fully functional embryonic stem cells from a \n     laboratory construct that is radically different in \n     developmental potential than a normal embryo.\n       Using the technique of RNA interference, he was able to \n     reversibly silence the gene Cdx2 in the donor nucleus before \n     nuclear transfer to the enucleated egg. And a study just two \n     months ago in the journal Science suggests that it may be \n     possible to achieve the goals of ANT through the preemptive \n     silencing of Cdx2 in the egg even before the act of nuclear \n     transfer, thereby producing the biological (and moral) \n     equivalent of an inner cell mass tissue culture. This article \n     showed that in mice, m-RNA for Cdx2 is present in the egg and \n     asymmetrically distributed in the first cell division after \n     fertilization. This asymmetric distribution of Cdx2 directs \n     the cells at the two-cell stage to form two distinct cell \n     lineages. One of the cells at the two-cell stage goes on to \n     become the trophectoderm and forms the outer layer of the \n     embryo (and later the extra-embryonic membranes, including \n     the placenta). The other cell forms the `inner cell mass' \n     which is the source of embryonic stem cells. By selective \n     silencing of Cdx2, the authors were able to produce an \n     unorganized mass composed exclusively of cells with the \n     character of inner cell mass.\n       This is the organic equivalent of a model airplane kit \n     without the glue, you have parts but no capacity to form a \n     coherent whole. The gene Cdx2 has been shown in mouse models \n     to be essential for the early integration of organismal \n     function. In the absence of expression of this gene, as with \n     a teratoma, the trophectoderm fails to grow and there is only \n     partial and unorganized cellular process. Lacking one of the \n     two essential cell types, it is the equivalent of trying\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\n     to sing a duet with only one voice. The coordinated \n     interactions that are essential for embryonic development are \n     simply not possible. Nonetheless, an inner cell mass is \n     produced from which functional embryonic stem cells can be \n     extracted.\n       It is important to recognize that the improper development \n     of the trophectoderm is not reasonably considered a defect \n     within a part but rather a failure in the formation of the \n     whole. An early embryo does not have parts in quite the same \n     sense as an adult organism or even as a later-stage embryo \n     just a few days or weeks later. Natural embryogenesis is, by \n     definition, the period during which the whole, as the unified \n     principle of growth, produces the parts. The differentiation \n     of parts during early embryogenesis lays down the fundamental \n     axes, body plan, and pattern of integrated organogenesis. An \n     embryo does not have a central integrating part like the \n     brain; rather, the essential being is the whole being. At \n     this stage, a critical ``deficiency'' is more rightly \n     considered an ``insufficiency,'' not a defect in a being, but \n     an inadequacy at such a fundamental level that it precludes \n     the coordinated coherence and developmental potential that \n     are the defining characteristics of an embryonic organism. In \n     testimony to a U.S. Senate subcommittee on stem cell \n     research, Dr. Jaenisch stated: ``Because the ANT product \n     lacks essential properties of the fertilized embryo, it is \n     not justified to call it an `embryo.'\n       Many scientists, moral philosophers and religious \n     authorities (including some of the most conservative \n     evangelical and Catholic leaders) have expressed strong \n     encouragement for further exploration of this project. Of \n     course additional animal studies, including some with non-\n     human primates must precede any translation of these findings \n     into practice with human cells.\n\n\n                           Advantages of ANT\n\n       ANT, in its many variations, could provide a uniquely \n     flexible tool and has many positive advantages that would \n     help advance stem cell research.\n       --Unlike the use of embryos from IVF clinics, ANT would \n     produce an unlimited range of genetic types for the study of \n     disease, drug testing and possibly generation of \n     therapeutically useful cells.\n       --By allowing controlled and reproducible experiments, ANT \n     would provide a valuable research tool for a wide range of \n     studies of gene expression, imprinting, and intercellular \n     communication.\n       --Furthermore, the basic research essential to establishing \n     the ANT technique would advance our understanding of \n     developmental biology and might serve as a bridge to \n     transcendent technologies such as direct reprogramming of \n     adult cells.\n       --Moreover, as a direct laboratory technique, ANT would \n     unburden embryonic stem cell research from the additional \n     ethical concerns of the ``left over'' IVF embryos, including \n     the attendant clinical and legal complexities in this realm \n     of great personal and social sensitivity.\n       The one remaining link with IVF, the procurement of \n     oocytes, is a subject of intense scientific research and \n     there appear to be several prospects for obtaining eggs \n     without the morally dubious and expensive hormonally induced \n     super-ovulation of female patients. These include the use of \n     eggs left over from IVF, the laboratory maturation of eggs \n     cultured from ovaries obtained after surgical removal or from \n     cadavers, and possibly the direct production of eggs from \n     embryonic stem cells (a feat already accomplished with mouse \n     cells).\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       We are at a crucial moment in the progress of science and \n     civilization. Advances in biology have delivered new powers \n     with extraordinary potential for positive application in both \n     basic research and clinical medicine. Yet, at the same time, \n     these new possibilities challenge the most fundamental moral \n     principles on which our society is based. Clearly, both sides \n     of this difficult debate over embryonic stem cell research \n     are defending something important to all of us. Without a \n     resolution that sustains social consensus, there will be a \n     series of continuing conflicts as our science challenges us \n     with further dilemmas at the boundaries of human life.\n       The English author G.K. Chesterton had a metaphor that may \n     inform our current situation. Little boys are playing soccer \n     on an island, but at the very edges of the field cliffs go \n     down hundreds of feet to the waves crashing against the rocky \n     shore. The boys are playing, but only in the middle twenty \n     yards--no one wants to do a corner kick. Then someone comes \n     and builds a sturdy fence right at the edges of the field: \n     now they can play within the full field without fear of \n     falling off the cliff.\n       Our current conflict is like this: science is stalled \n     across a broad front. If we can define with clarity and \n     precision the moral boundaries we are trying to defend, we \n     might open a wider arena of legitimate study without fear of \n     the grave dangers posed by breach of the basic moral \n     principles that sustain our civilization. In provoking just \n     such reflection and clarity of definition, the proposal for \n     Altered Nuclear Transfer sets the foundation for a positive \n     future of scientific advance.\n       Yet, some will say, ``how can such a tiny clump of cells \n     hold such significance?''\n       But size is not a measure of moral meaning. It is true, \n     from here these cells are barely visible.\n       But from here one cannot see the people.\n       And from here one cannot see the earth.\n       And from here one cannot even see our galaxy.\n       Three hundred years ago the French philosopher-\n     mathematician Blaise Pascal noted that human existence is \n     located between infinities--between the infinitely large and \n     the infinitely small. He went on to say ``By size the \n     universe surrounds and swallows me up like a dot: by thought \n     I encompass the universe.''\n       But what kind of thought could encompass the universe? That \n     thought must be a moral thought--that thought must be love.\n       C.S. Lewis once said that we should answer all of our \n     problems with more love, not less love.\n       That precious love that nourished and sustained each one of \n     us in the early dawn of our unfolding form.\n       Now, as we prepare to enter the future with the new powers \n     of our scientific understanding, we should remember the words \n     of St. John of the Cross: ``In the evening of life, we will \n     be judged by love.''\n\n  We are all aware of how divisive this issue has been. I believe that \nthere are areas of common ground where people can come together and \nreconcile what appear to be two opposing opinions. This is the ground \non which I have built my legislation.\n  The HOPE Act is the only bill up for debate which would not be in \ndanger of a Presidential veto. This means that my bill is the only way \nwe can actually move the science forward for at least the next two \nyears.\n  What this debate is really about is what the American public gets at \nthe end of the day. When all the votes are cast, what can we say to the \npatients who visit us who want cures for terrible diseases? Some \nmembers would focus on adult stem cells and some would leave all the \npromise with embryonic stem cells. But a balanced and measured approach \nwould give the Federal Government the opportunity to support both.\n  At the end of the day, one bill is destined for the garbage bin. It \nsounds harsh, but it's a fact that the President will veto it. Maybe it \ncan be dusted off in 2009 with a new administration, but in the \nmeanwhile, we're wasting time. The HOPE Act actually has a chance of \nbecoming law and putting the force of Federal support into pluripotent \nstem cell research that can benefit patients in the very near future.\n  My bill incorporates all of the most promising current scientific \nadvancements which adhere to ethical principles, induding methods using \nadult stem cells and some using embryonic stem cells.\n  Since 2001, the Federal Government has funded human embryonic stem \ncell research using only lines created before August 9, 2001. No \nembryonic stem cell lines created after 2001 were eligible for funding. \nAlthough the White House could change their policy at any time, they \nhaven't. Currently, only 20-21 lines are eligible, down from an \noriginal 60.\n  There are already several methods proposed for deriving pluripotent \ncells without harming human embryos.\n  Research involving ANT, naturally dead embryos or single cell biopsy \nhas never before received Federal funding. Our bill would allow these \nmethods to be considered for Federal funding and specifically direct \nthe NIH to establish guidelines to carry out this research. Similiar \nguidelines or requests for research proposals, RFPs, do not currently \nexist.\n  Additionally, my bill provides funding to start the process of \ndeveloping a stem cell bank. By opening banks to store amniotic and \nplacental cells, this bill will make available a greater variety of \nstem cells. Different types of stem cells are used in different types \nof treatments. Anthony Atala has told us that ``So far, we've been \nsuccessful with every cell type we've attempted to produce from these \nstem cells. The AFS cells can also produce mature cells that meet tests \nof function, which suggests their therapeutic value.''\n  Bottom line--This bill moves the United States one step further \ntowards widespread use of stem cells for treatments for a variety of \ndiseases.\n  Opponents tell us that this bill doesn't do anything new. This is \njust not true. In addition to what I've mentioned above, there is \nscientific proof that these alternatives can create quality, new \nembryonic stem cell lines.\n  In fact, one of these methods, using naturally dead embryos, has \nalready produced at least one new embryonic stem cell line which is \ncurrently available in a stem cell bank and under your\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nbill would now be eligible for Federal funding. Donald Landry, Chief of \nthe Division of Experimental Therapeutics at Columbia University, says \nthat increasing the number of stem cell lines created this way would be \njust a matter of effort.\n  According to this well-respected researcher, there could be a \ncontinuous supply of new embryonic stem cell lines using stem cells \nderived from naturally dead embryos. The same could be said for other \nmethods:\n  When the dust clears, The HOPE Act is the only bill up for \nconsideration which will give the American public new research for \ntheir tax dollars. Under The HOPE Act, a continuous supply of \npluripotent stem cell lines would be available for Federal funding.\n  We are at a point where there is this great debate in this country \nover, not the issue of stem cell research but, simply, the source of \nthe stem cells and then the Federal funding of the stem cells. That is \nthe reality. That is where we are today. What Senator Isakson and \nmyself and other colleagues are offering is what we believe is a way \nforward, a way to move the science forward, a way to avoid the culture \nwars. It is not everything my colleagues who support S. 5, if that \nwould have passed and become law, would have, but S. 5 for many crosses \nthat line, so we can't support it, but we want the research to move \nforward.\n  The reality is the science is moving so much faster than the politics \nhere. The science is putting us in a position where we could and should \nexplore the benefits of embryonic research and pluripotent stem cell \nresearch without having to cross the moral line. So if S. 30 is passed, \nthe President has said he will not veto S. 30. If S. 30 becomes the \nlaw, then, in fact, the amount of Federal dollars available for human \nembryonic pluripotency research will be far greater than what we have \ntoday.\n  For those out there who are looking for hope--and that is what we \ncall our bill, HOPE--it is hope offered through principled ethical stem \ncell research. For those who are looking for hope, we are offering some \nhope. It is not everything. It is not everything that all desire in the \narea of stem cell research. But the reality of so much of what we are \ndealing with in stem cell research is about theory. It is about hope.\n  Let's offer the hope. There is hope of what embryonic stem cells can \ndo. My colleague from Iowa, when he was discounting dead embryo \nresearch, said it may take 10 year for that to pan out. Stem cell \nresearch of any kind, I have to tell the folks out there, may take 10 \nyear or more. I am not hearing scientists telling me that within the \nnext couple of years we are going to have those therapies which will \ncure juvenile diabetes or cure ALS or change the situation. We are \ntalking about looking down the road. We are talking about looking at \nresearch opportunities in which we want to provide hope. We believe \nthat is the right thing to do.\n  So my message to my colleagues who support S. 5--my colleague from \nArkansas and from Iowa, who talked about he wants to open every door we \ncan--I think we need to push all of them. Well, S. 30 opens a door. It \nopens a door without crossing the cultural line. It opens the door \nwithout being involved in the midst of the battle between those who \nsupport embryonic stem cell research and those who support only adult \nstem cell research. It offers a third way: It offers real dollars and \nreal hope and real opportunity to see if we can make progress. That is \nour goal.\n  To my colleagues who support S. 5, at the end of the day if all you \ndo is vote for S. 5, you will cast a vote I am sure in your heart you \nwill feel will be principled, the right message, the right thing to do. \nBut the reality is at the end of the day, there are going to be no more \ndollars going into Federal research, you are not going to be offering \nreal hope, you will have offered a political statement, but we need to \ndo more.\n  What Senator Isakson and I have tried to do is offer the opportunity \nto do more, to say, yes, we will move the science forward. There are \ngoing to be critics who say it can't be done. Science is fascinating. \nOftentimes it is ``my way or the highway.'' Embryonic stem cells, that \nis the way; adult stem cells, that is the way; autonuclear transfer, \nthat is the way.\n  I am not a scientist; I just want to move it forward. I understand we \nare operating in a world where it is about hope. Let's open this door. \nLet's put aside the cultural battles and the cultural wars.\n  One last observation, if I may. The Senator from Iowa talked about \ntrying to put this in context, and said, you know, look at the size, \nwhat we are dealing with. This embryo--this is a pin. That is small. \nWhat is the value of that? I take this, by the way, from Dr. Hurlbett's \nwork. I can show you the next picture here. You know, if you are on the \nMoon and you are looking at this from there, this would be kind of \nsmall. Then if you are standing--by the way, from here, these people \nwould be about the size of a pin.\n  Now we are kind of looking at the Earth from far away. If you are \nlooking at that, by the way, from the galaxy, boy, that would be very \nsmall. If you are looking at the galaxy from the universe, this would \nbe very small. It is not about size. We are dealing with the human \nembryo, and there is a moral question some of us want to ask and say \nthat there is a line, but in doing that we want the research to go \nforward, we want to offer hope, we want to offer opportunity, we want \nto use science as best we can.\n  S. 30 offers that opportunity. I would hope all of my colleagues on \nall sides of this issue would come forward. Some would say, it is not \nall we want, but we are moving the science forward. Let's do that. And \nin the end, hopefully real hope will be given and real cures ultimately \nwill be found, and we will have done it in a way that does not engage \nthe cultural ways, does not cross the line that some do not want to \ncross, but in the end makes real progress with real science.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to explain to my colleagues why I \nwill vote against S. 5 in its present form, and I believe it will \nprobably be in its present form as we vote on it.\n  We in Congress are petitioned every day by individuals, by families, \nby companies, by interest groups, and other entities that have a stake \nin what the Federal Government does. We were elected to this great body \nto represent people back home, and to provide reasonable solutions to \neveryday problems that we confront here in the Congress.\n  I meet people in Iowa every week who seek cures for different \ndiseases and different disorders. They seek results, and we fight to \nprovide them results so that life is better, life expectancy is longer. \nAmericans want Congress to fund medical research, and we do it in a big \nway. That is why we provided nearly $30 billion annually for the \nNational Institutes of Health, which is the leading organization on \nhealth-related research.\n  We all know and love someone who has suffered from a devastating \ndisease or disorder. My wife is a breast cancer survivor; my brother \ndied of a stroke; my sister died of an aortic aneurysm. I have friends \nwith diabetes, Parkinson's, and Lou Gehrig's disease. I have known many \nwho have lost a battle to cancer, and others who face a long struggle \nwith Alzheimer's disease.\n  I want cures as well as everybody else wanting cures. I want to \nbelieve that the pain and suffering will end as much as anyone wants it \nto end. But I cannot in good conscience support a bill that forces \nAmerican taxpayers to fund research that requires the destruction of \ninnocent human life. This is a slippery slope.\n\n  I wish to address six key points that have been put forward by Robert \nGeorge and by Thomas Berg. They were made in an op-ed piece from the \nWall Street Journal on March 13, this year.\n  These authors state that responsible and productive debate is often \nlost amidst confusion and misperceptions surrounding the issue of \nembryonic stem cell research. Both sides of this debate have reasonable \narguments. But these authors, including this Senator, believe \nembryonic-destructive research cannot be morally justified.\n  First, Professor George and Reverend Berg rightly point out there is \nnot a ban on human embryonic stem cell research in the United States. \nYet I believe people in this body leave that impression. More \nimportantly, it has left\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\nthe impression--whether from Members of Congress or other people in our \nsociety--there is a Federal ban on human embryonic stem cell research. \nThey leave out the fact we are already doing some through the Federal \nGovernment. They leave out the fact that the private sector and State \ngovernments are doing a lot of embryonic stem cell research as well. So \nthere is embryonic stem cell research going on. The issue is whether \nthe Federal taxpayers ought to be paying for something that would \ndestroy life at the beginning.\n  What people have forgotten in this debate, then, is George W. Bush \nwas, in fact, the first President to provide Federal dollars for \nembryonic stem cell research. Throughout the Clinton administration, \nnot one penny of taxpayer dollars was allowed for this sort of \nresearch. So there is no Federal ban. In fact, companies and \nresearchers can and are doing it now. There is no legal barrier to \nprohibit the private financing of it. In fact, we will continue to fund \nthe lines President Bush authorized in 2001. Since the President \nannounced his decision in August 2001, the Federal Government has \nprovided almost $130 million for embryonic stem cell research. Eighty-\nfive percent of the embryonic stem cell research studies in the world \nuse these lines that President Bush's decision in August 2001 allowed.\n  Because of this funding and the investment in the National Institutes \nof Health, America, our country, remains one of the global leaders in \nmedical research. Why then do some generate the false impression that \nthe Federal Government is not involved in stem cell research?\n  Well, that brings me to the second point. The authors say we are a \nlong way away from seeing the therapies the other side promises. \nEmbryonic stem cell research may not be the magic potion many make it \nout to be. Even the most ardent pro-embryonic stem cell research \nexperts have stated its benefits are years, if not generations, away. \nGeorge and Berg quote a prominent British expert who is not entirely \nconvinced that embryonic stem cells will, in his life and possibly \nanyone's lifetime, be holding quite the promise that some desperately \nhope they will.\n  One expert from the University of Wisconsin fears a backlash because \nthe cures the public expects could be decades away. I know many of my \ncolleagues and many of my constituents believe embryonic stem cell \nresearch holds potential. They believe the hope and the promise of this \nresearch will save their lives and the lives of their loved ones. But I \ncannot support the expanded use of taxpayer dollars to invest in \nsomething that is generations away--even if possible--when proven \ntherapies through adult stem cell research, with no moral strings being \nattached, no lives being taken, are right in front of us.\n  Third, the authors explain that a human embryo is deserving of at \nleast some degree of special moral status. Most people would agree the \nembryo being destroyed has the potential to be developed into human \nlife. It is a fact. Therefore, it is only right that a heightened \ndegree of sensitivity and consideration be paid to this life at this \nstage of development, the embryo.\n  This bill then plays with human life. The other side's promise of \ncures disregards the fact that this bill will allow researchers to kill \nembryos, and pay for that killing, with American taxpayer dollars.\n  The bill before us says we should fund research using embryos that \nwere on the brink of being thrown away anyway. Thrown away? What about \nthe many children who have been adopted through this process? They were \nnot thrown away or they obviously would not have been here to be \nadopted.\n  What about making sure that couples are not exploited and forced to \ncreate extra embryos so that industry can make a profit? Think how \nChina makes a profit from harvesting organs from prisoners that they \nexecute, or who knows how they die? Tourist medicine is what it is \ncalled. Do we want that sort of ethic in our research? I do not think \nso.\n  What about ensuring those so-called leftover embryos are not being \ncreated through cloning? How do we ensure human cloning is not made \nmore attractive, and that researchers are limited to how they create \nand destroy life? Where do we draw the line?\n  Point number four: There are noncontroversial methods that are worth \nexploring if you want to do something for curing maladies with stem \ncells. Other noncontroversial methods of cutting-edge research, those \nwhich do not destroy human embryos, offer near equal promise for future \nmedical benefit. Those methods are treating people this very day. Stem \ncells derived from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, \nhave opened the doors to many therapies. Adult stem cells have already \nproven effective in treating over 70 diseases and disorders, not \nsomething anybody interested in embryonic stem cells can point to. This \nalternative research has proven effective. We are investing taxpayers' \nmoney in research that people are reaping benefits in today.\n  Last year, I talked about an acquaintance of mine by the name of \nDavid Foege whom I happen to know from the years when he was a page in \nthe Iowa Legislature in the 1960s. He grew up in Iowa and now resides \nin Florida. Four years ago, David Foege was told that he had little \nchance of survival. His heart was losing all function, and there was \nlittle that doctors could do. David turned to stem cell therapy. He \nfound doctors in Bangkok who would harvest his own stem cells and \ninject them back into his own heart. This year, 25 million of his own \nstem cells were taken from his blood and injected into his heart. He \nwent from a life-threatening situation to a nearly normal heart \nfunction. He went from a life expectancy of 90 days to 10 or 15 more \nyears. He is fighting that death warrant that he received years ago. \nDavid Foege is evidence that adult stem cells work, that the investment \nwe have made in adult stem cells is paying off, and it is evidence that \nwe ought to put our money where product is received as opposed to the \nquandary of when will we get therapies or when will we get maladies \nfixed by the research in adult stem cells.\n  I wish I could list the advances with embryonic stem cell research, \nbut I cannot. There aren't any. There are no treatments for human \npatients derived from embryonic stem cells. So there is no evidence on \nwhich to argue that this research should be expanded with public \nresources; in other words, tax dollars being used. We in Congress have \nto realize that there is a difference between hope and hype.\n  The fifth point these authors make, moral concerns are not \nexclusively religious in nature. Everybody thinks that anyone who is \nfighting this research is some religious fanatic.\n  Nobody says it better than Charles Krauthammer, a highly regarded \ncolumnist and former member of the President's Council on Bioethics. \nMr. Krauthammer doesn't believe that life begins at conception, as many \nwho have a feeling about embryonic stem cells and the destruction of \nlife at that stage. But Mr. Krauthammer says that ``many secularly''--I \nemphasize secularly; I didn't say religious--``inclined people have \ngreat trepidation about the inherent dangers of wanton and unrestricted \nmanipulation''--to the point of dismemberment--``of human embryos.'' \nMr. Krauthammer says that we don't need religion to simply ``have a \nhealthy respect for the human capacity for doing evil in the pursuit of \ndoing good.''\n  Mr. Krauthammer knows firsthand what it is like to live with a \ndebilitating disease. He suffers from spinal cord injury. He spends \nevery day of his life in a wheelchair. Even he knows that it is cruel \nto play on the hearts of those who suffer by saying that a cure is \nwithin reach. He said:\n\n       There's nothing less compassionate than to construct a \n     political constituency of sufferers by falsely and cruelly \n     intimating that their disease is on the very cusp of cure if \n     only the President would stop playing politics with the \n     issue.\n\n  We aren't playing politics. Reasonable people can disagree on the \nmoral or fiscal consequences of this bill without being labeled \nreligiously minded obstructionists.\n  The sixth and final point that Berg and George make is that medical \nadvancements are not the only interest of stem cell researchers. \nBecause the benefit of embryonic stem cell research is only speculative \nand many years from producing results, most scientists have \nacknowledged that the primary interest of this type of research is to \nenhance the basic knowledge of early\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\nhuman development. S. 5 does not ban human cloning, and it doesn't help \ndraw the line on what researchers should or should not do with so-\ncalled leftover embryos. This puts us on a very slippery slope. I urge \nmy colleagues to think long and hard about this issue before casting \ntheir vote.\n  S. 5 disregards respect for human life at the expense of prolonging \nthe pain of those who seek a cure. We in Congress and across the \ncountry need to think rationally and to make tough choices. The right \nchoice is to invest in what works. I have spent a great deal of time \nexplaining that I thought that was adult stem cell research. I urge my \ncolleagues to join in defeating S. 5 and supporting the proven and \nnoncontroversial field of adult stem cell research.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this bill. \nSenator Coleman and Senator Isakson have put a great deal of time into \nthis bill, and I am pleased to work with them in bringing about this \nformulation. If I am not already a cosponsor, I ask unanimous consent \nto be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Unlike many in the Chamber, I am a scientist. I am a \nphysician. I have delivered, at last count, somewhere over 4,000 \nbabies. I understand embryology. I understand the science of molecular \nbiology. This debate is going to come down to a couple of moral \nquestions. There are really two moral questions that this country has \nto answer. I will talk about those, and then I will talk about a few \nother things that most people don't want to admit to or discuss, issues \nsurrounding this topic.\n  The first moral issue is, do we have the capability to destroy life \nin the name of saving life? That is what we are talking about with \nembryonic stem cells. We selectively snuff out a life so that we can \npotentially have a treatment in the future. That is the first great \nmoral question. I have seen the various early stages and then every \nother stage through pregnancy what that life potential is. It is not to \nbe taken lightly, this step of ignoring life or neutralizing life under \nthe proxy of saying we are going to benefit someone.\n  We have heard many people talk about the promise of embryonic stem \ncells. They do yield promise for us. However, it is a long way off. But \nwe need to be careful with this step in the direction of destroying \nlife in the name of saving life.\n  I thought Senator Isakson did a very good job of explaining embryos \nthat no longer grow. They have quit dividing. They won't be frozen. \nThey won't be implanted. They, in fact, will be discarded. But they \nstill have tremendous value for us for research. As he noted, 5 of the \n21 lines presently being researched, and 3 of the 10 lines that \npresently have no problems whatsoever came from dead embryos, embryos \nthat still have live cells but won't divide again unless induced to do \nso, and then won't divide into an embryo.\n  This is a big question for us because how we answer this question \ntoday is going to say a lot about the decisions we make in the future. \nOne of the things we are going to hear about is the tremendous amount \nof excess embryos around. Here is a RAND study report that disputes \nthat. Here is a scientific research organization that looked at the \navailability of excess embryos and in fact says the claims are not \nsupported by the facts.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       How Many Frozen Human Embryos Are Available for Research?\n\n       Frozen human embryos have recently become the focus of \n     considerable media attention. Frozen embryos are a potential \n     source of embryonic stem cells, which can replicate \n     themselves and develop into specialized cells (e.g., blood \n     cells or nerve cells). Researchers believe that such cells \n     might be capable of growing replacement tissues that could be \n     used to treat people suffering from a number of diseases, \n     including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Among \n     the most contentious issues in the stem cell debate are \n     whether frozen embryos should be used to produce stem cells \n     for research purposes and whether it is appropriate to use \n     federal funds for research involving human embryos.\n       Many of the proposed resolutions to the embryonic stem cell \n     debate are based on assumptions about the total number of \n     frozen human embryos in the United States and the percentage \n     of that total that is available for research. Accurate data \n     on these issues, however, have not been available. Guesses on \n     the total number of embryos have ranged wildly from tens of \n     thousands to several hundred thousand.\n       RAND researchers Gail L. Zellman and C. Christine Fair, \n     together with the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology \n     (SART) Working Group led by David Hoffman, MD, have completed \n     a project designed to inform the policy debate by providing \n     accurate data on the number of frozen embryos in the United \n     States and how many of those embryos are available for \n     research purposes. Their findings include the following:\n       Nearly 400,000 embryos (fertilized eggs that have developed \n     for six or fewer days) have been frozen and stored since the \n     late 1970s.\n       Patients have designated only 2.8 percent (about 11,000 \n     embryos) for research. The vast majority of frozen embryos \n     are designated for future attempts at pregnancy.\n       From those embryos designated for research, perhaps as many \n     as 275 stem cell lines (cell cultures suitable for further \n     development) could be created. The actual number is likely to \n     be much lower.\n\n\n      Vast Majority of Frozen Embryos Are Held for Family Building\n\n       The practice of freezing embryos dates back to the first \n     infertility treatments in the mid-1980s. The process of in \n     vitro fertilization often produces more embryos than can be \n     used at one time. In the United States, the decision about \n     what to do with the extra embryos rests with the patients who \n     produced them.\n       The RAND-SART team designed and implemented a survey to \n     determine the number and current disposition of embryos \n     frozen and stored since the mid-1980s at fertility clinics in \n     the United States and the number of those embryos designated \n     for research. The survey was sent to all 430 assisted \n     reproductive technology facilities in the United States, 340 \n     of which responded. Estimates for nonresponding clinics were \n     developed using a statistical formula based on a clinic's \n     size and other characteristics. The results show that as of \n     April 1, 2002, a total of 396,526 embryos have been placed in \n     storage in the United States. This number is higher than \n     expected; previous estimates have ranged from 30,000 to \n     200,000.\n       Alhough the total number of frozen embryos is large, the \n     RAND-SART survey found that only a small percentage of these \n     embryos have been designated for research use. As the figure \n     illustrates, the vast majority of stored embryos (88.2 \n     percent) are being held for family building, with just 2.8 \n     percent of the total (11,000) designated for research. Of the \n     remaining embryos, 2.3 percent are awaiting donation to \n     another patient, 2.2 percent are designated to be discarded, \n     and 4.5 percent are held in storage for other reasons, \n     including lost contact with a patient, patient death, \n     abandonment, and divorce.\n\n\n Embryos Available for Research Do Not Have High Development Potential\n\n       Although the 11,000 embryos designated for research might \n     seem like a large number, the actual number of embryos that \n     might be converted into stem cell lines is likely to be \n     substantially lower. Because assisted reproductive technology \n     clinics generally transfer the best-quality embryos to the \n     patient during treatment cycles, the remaining embryos \n     available to be frozen are not always of the highest quality. \n     (High-quality embryos are those that grow at normal rates.) \n     In addition, some of the frozen embryos have been in storage \n     for many years, and at the time that some of those embryos \n     were created, laboratory cultures were not as conducive to \n     preserving embryos as they are today. Some embryos would also \n     be lost in the freeze-and-thaw process itself.\n       To illustrate how such laboratory conditions might limit \n     the number of embryos available for research, the RAND-SART \n     team performed a series of calculations. Drawing upon the few \n     published studies in this area, they estimated that only \n     about 65 percent of the approximately 11,000 embryos would \n     survive the freeze-and-thaw process, resulting in 7,334 \n     embryos. Of those, about 25 percent (1,834 embryos) would \n     likely be able to survive the initial stages of development \n     to the blastocyst stage (a blastocyst is an embryo that has \n     developed for at least five days). Even fewer could be \n     successfully converted into embryonic stem cell lines. For \n     example, researchers at the University of Wisconsin needed 18 \n     blastocysts to create five embryonic stem cell lines, while \n     researchers at The Jones Institute used 40 blastocysts to \n     create three lines.\n       Using a conservative estimate between the two conversion \n     rates from blastocyst to stem cells noted above (27 percent \n     and 7.5 percent), the research team calculated that about 275 \n     embryonic stem cell lines could be created from the total \n     number of embryos available for research. Even this number is \n     probably an overestimate because it assumes that all the \n     embryos designated for research in the United States would be \n     used to create stem cell lines, which is highly unlikely.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The RAND-SART survey found that almost twice as many frozen \n     embryos exist in the United States as the highest previous \n     estimate. Only a small percentage of these embryos are \n     available for research because the\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\n     vast majority are reserved for family building. Among those \n     that are in principle available for research, some have been \n     in storage for more than a decade and were frozen using \n     techniques that are less effective than those that are \n     currently available.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. The second question we have to ask ourselves is, if you \nare a mother of a juvenile diabetic, a 2- or 3-year-old, or you are the \nwife of a Parkinson's patient or the caregiver of somebody with a \nspinal cord injury, if we told you that in fact we can do everything to \nproduce a cure, to give you the exact same opportunity for a cure \nwithout ever destroying the first embryo, which would your choice be? \nWould your choice be to destroy that embryo or to do it in a \nnondestructive way getting exactly the same results?\n  That is where the science is today. That is going to be disputed. But \nthe false hopes that have been created that that is the only way that \nwe can find these cures is nothing but hogwash, scientifically proven \nhogwash.\n  The fact is, we don't know what is going to come from embryonic stem \ncells. We know a lot that will come from other treatments. I just \nshared with Senator Coleman, we will have a treatment for juvenile \ndiabetes within 5 years, but it won't come from stem cells. It is going \nto come from the tobacco plant. That is very new research. It has been \nrepeated in mice. It is working. We will have that cure. That is going \nto get funded, and it will be produced long before anything else that \ncomes to an actual cure.\n  By the way, autologous stem cells, cells taken from yourself, have \nalready cured five juvenile diabetics by taking the cells from a tube \ninside the pancreas and growing those cells, regenerating beta cells, \nand reimplanting those into children who have juvenile diabetes, who \nare off insulin today. So there are lots of opportunities.\n  The second moral question that Americans need to ask themselves, as \ndo Members of this body, is if we can do everything without destroying \nthe first embryo, why do we want to destroy embryos? Because it is \neasy? Because it is convenient? Because we are locked in a mantra that \nsays this is the only way. Think for a minute about what else is going \non. We now produce almost every cell type that man has from germ cells, \nresearch done in this country, proven in Germany, in Japan, another \nsource of stem cells. Didn't destroy the first embryo, but we have it. \nAltered nuclear transfer, assisted reprogramming, which you heard \nSenator Coleman talk about, has not been done in humans yet because it \nhasn't been funded. The fact is, it has been done in mice. You sit and \nthink, what can happen.\n  When we heard that these were theories by the Senator from Iowa, \ngoing to the Moon was a theory, but we did it. The fact is, there are \nlots of other theories on how to treat disease out there that we are \ngoing to be accomplishing that aren't going to have anything to do with \nstem cells.\n  It is important that we don't take our eye off the ball. This is a \nvery key moral question that has to be answered. It has to be answered \nby all the disease groups out there. If, in fact, we can supply the \nsame product in the same timeline with the same results, why would we \nwant to destroy an embryo? If we could do it in an ethically, morally \ncorrect way, why would we do it in an ethically less correct way?\n  Then there is the little problem that you never hear talked about \nwith stem cells. The only way a stem cell therapy is ever going to work \nwithout antirejection drugs, the only way it is ever going to work is \nif you clone yourself. They don't want to talk about that right now. \nBut for a treatment to happen that will keep you free from rejecting \nthat stem cell, that treatment, that set of cells that is not purely \nyours will mean anybody who gets a treatment from an embryonically \nderived stem cell will be on antirejection drugs the rest of their \nlife, which has multiple complications. The solution to that--they \ndon't want to talk about it--is you have to clone yourself. So now we \nare into cloning ourselves and then destroying ourselves so we can have \na treatment for ourselves? That is the dirty little secret that nobody \nwith embryonic stem cells wants to talk about.\n  The interesting answer to that is altered nuclear transfer, oocyte-\nassisted reprogramming, which has none of those problems because you \nuse one of your cells into an egg, reprogram it to produce pluripotent \ncells that never produce an embryo. Nobody wants to talk about the real \nscientific issue of the problems of a treatment for a disease that we \nhave no treatments for yet, that is well down the road, and the big \nkicker that will come is, what if we get a treatment and then we try to \ngive it and everybody is going to have to be on an antirejection drug. \nEverybody knows somebody who has had a transplant. Ask them how they \nlike taking their drugs. They like taking them because they have a new \nliver or heart or kidney, but if they could not take those drugs and \nhave it, they would much rather have that.\n  So we set up a false choice. The false choice is, embryonic stem \ncells or nothing. That is not a real choice for this country.\n  I believe America is a great land, made up of good people. If we \nanswer this second moral question, if we can do this, and we can, \nthrough multiple ways, why would we destroy the first embryo? We do not \nhave to destroy the first embryo.\n\n  I think we ought to be considering the moral questions, but also the \nfacts that are going to come about as a result of this fascination and \nhope for a cure. I have had mothers of juvenile diabetics in my office. \nI have had family members of Alzheimer's patients. I have had a \nParkinson's patient plead with me to do this. When I explain to them \nwhat is on the horizon, when I explain to them what the potentials are, \nall of a sudden this hope that has no substance to it yet whatsoever \ndoes not have near the meaning as all the other things that are going \non that do have meaning.\n  So we need to refocus on the real search, the real potential that is \nin front of our country and answer this best, most important moral \nquestion: Do we steal life from the innocent to potentially give life \nto the maimed or the injured or diseased, or do we, in fact, do it in a \nway that never steals life and accomplishes the same goal?\n  That is the real question before the Senate. S. 30 does that. S. 5 \ndoes not. That is the division. One says: To heck with the ethics, to \nheck with the problems associated with it, to heck with the rejection, \nto heck with the antirejection drugs, to heck with the idea we cannot \nclone ourselves, we want to go this way only.\n  S. 30 allows all the options, all the accomplishments, all the \npotential without violating the first ethical clause. That is the \nquestion America needs to ask itself in this debate. We can give to all \nthose who are desirous of all these needed benefits of cure and \ntreatment, and we can do it in an ethically responsible manner that \nwill send us down the right road for this country, not the wrong road.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remains under the control of the \nRepublican leader.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am going to yield to Senator Coleman. \nBut, first, I ask unanimous consent that Senator McConnell be added as \na cosponsor to S. 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want to briefly touch on one other \naspect of the bill we have not talked about. I do want to thank my \ncolleague from Oklahoma for articulating what is the basic issue: if we \ncan move science forward without crossing a moral line, if we can avoid \nthe great division in America. Scientific research should be something \nthat as a society we embrace. S. 30 gives us the opportunity to do \nthat. I hope my colleagues from all perspectives on this issue decide \nthey will support S. 30.\n  One other aspect of S. 30 that is important is there is a provision \nin the bill that calls for the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto look into setting up a national amniotic and placental stem cell \nbank.\n  There are three banks of stem cells in this country. I believe \nWisconsin has the 21 embryonic stem cell lines of the 78 the President \noriginally authorized. In Minnesota, there is a cord blood cell bank, \nand there is a bone marrow bank.\n  What we hope to do, based on research that has recently come to\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\nlight--Wake Forest has done some of it--is have the use of amniotic and \nplacental stem cells. These are stem cells, by the way, that can be \ngrown in large quantities. They do not produce tumors, which occur in \nother types of stem cells. The Wake Forest scientists have noted the \nspecialized cells generated from amniotic cells really, in effect, may \nhave--again, this is all potential--but there is the potential to have \nthe kind of elasticity and pluripotency we see in embryonic stem \ncells--high-flexibility growth potential in many ways resembling human \nembryonic stem cells.\n  The hope is to put together a tissue sampling of 100,000 tissues \nwhich would then give you the kind of ability to cut across a diversity \nwe do not have today with the research that is going on.\n  Again, if S. 5 is passed, it will be vetoed, and the science will not \nbe moved forward. But if S. 30 is passed, with the provisions that \nprovide for stem cell research, that will provide for pluripotent \nresearch, that will provide for dead embryo research, which would give \nyou, again, the same kind of stem cells you get from any other kind of \nembryonic stem cells--these are some of the new techniques out there.\n  In addition, S. 30 contains a provision for moving forward with a \nnational amniotic and placental stem cell bank, which is another \nopportunity to move the research forward and to move from hope to \nreality, which is certainly the hope of the authors of this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, we yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next 60 minutes \nis under the control of the majority leader or his designee.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have 20 \nminutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 60 minutes under the control of the \nmajority leader. The Chair is not aware of any designation within that \n60 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I see. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act of 2007 that is known as S. 5. It is really the only \nbill of the two that will allow scientists to fully pursue the promise \nof stem cell research.\n  I want to particularly thank Senators Harkin and Specter, Kennedy and \nHatch, who have been in the leadership of this issue for the past \nseveral Congresses. I also want to point out, in the case of the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, he is very pro-life. I have listened \nto him over these many years. I have listened to the real wisdom he has \nespoused on this issue. I hope more people will pay attention to him \nbecause I think he is right with respect to this issue.\n  On August 9, 2001--that is 6 years ago--President Bush limited \nFederal research funding to 78 stem cell lines already in existence. \nNearly 6 years have passed, and in that time two things have happened. \nFirst, most of these 78 stem cell lines are no longer available for \nscientific work. Many lines developed abnormalities and mutations as \nthey aged. Only 21 lines are available today. These lines are all \ncontaminated with mouse feeder cells and therefore are useless for \nresearch in humans. They do not have the diverse genetic makeup that is \nnecessary to find cures that benefit all Americans, and researchers \ncannot use them to examine rare and deadly genetic diseases.\n  This was, in fact, the President's policy. It is now clearly \nestablished that policy does not work, that policy is moribund. Yet the \nPresident will not relent and Federal research on stem cells cannot go \nforward.\n  Secondly, public support for stem cell research--full-blown stem cell \nresearch--has grown. Sixty-one percent of Americans responding to a \npoll in January of this year support embryonic stem cell research. This \nis also a bipartisan issue. Fifty-four percent of Republicans in an ABC \nNews poll also support embryonic stem cell research.\n  The majority of the American public support this bill. We know the \ncurrent policy is handcuffing our scientists and is not allowing this \nresearch to move forward. So the solution is obvious. We should pass \nthis bill.\n  I think the time has come for the President to come to this \nrealization, and it is my hope he will see he has been mistaken.\n  The bill we are debating today offers a compromise. This bill will \nnot destroy any embryo that would not otherwise be destroyed or \ndiscarded. It will allow promising research to move forward. It would \nend the impasse. It would take off the handcuffs.\n  President Bush had the opportunity to take a step forward 9 months \nago when the House and Senate sent him the Castle-DeGette bill, on \nwhich this bill is based. He made it the first and, so far, only veto \nof his Presidency. My colleagues and I made a commitment that we would \nraise this issue again and again--as long as it takes. Today we are \nfulfilling that promise. We know this bill will one day become law--if \nnot this year, then next year; if not next year, then the following \nyear.\n  The majority of the American people, the majority of the scientific \ncommunity, other nations, many of our States have embraced the promise \nof stem cell research. The President can stand in the way of such an \noverwhelming consensus for only so long.\n  With every passing week, the inevitability of this legislation grows \nclearer. Just since the President's veto, officials from his own \nadministration have acknowledged the shortcomings of the current \npolicy. More research has demonstrated the unique promise of \npluripotent, multipurpose stem cells. States and private institutions \nare forging ahead without Federal support.\n  Finally, and importantly, more Americans are waiting for cures and \ntreatments for catastrophic diseases. This is a very large lobby \nindeed.\n  So today we have another opportunity to move hope forward. The two \nbills before us today present a very stark choice. Only one bill, S. 5, \nthe Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, embraces all forms of stem cell \nresearch. This legislation provides a simple and straightforward way to \nprovide American scientists and researchers with immediate access to \nthe most promising stem cell lines.\n  It states that embryos to be discarded from in vitro fertilization \nclinics may be used in federally funded stem cell research, no matter \nwhen they were created.\n  While opponents have suggested this bill will lead us down a slippery \nslope, the parameters created by the bill are numerous and, in fact, \nstrict. Let me give you some examples.\n  The embryos must be left over following fertility treatment. The \npeople donating the embryos must provide written consent. The donors \nmay not be compensated for their donation. Finally, it must be clear \nthat the embryos would otherwise be discarded.\n  This legislation will not allow Federal funding to be used to destroy \nembryos. With restrictions in place, over 400,000 embryos could become \navailable while ensuring that researchers meet the highest of ethical \nstandards.\n  Let's be clear. We are talking about embryos that will be destroyed \nwhether or not this bill becomes law. It is an indisputable fact, and \neveryone would agree these embryos have no future. When President Bush \nadopted his ill-fated policy in 2001, he allowed lines already in \nexistence to be used for federally funded research because ``the life-\nor-death decision'' had already been made.\n  The same is true here. In terms of the basic ideology of the \nPresident's earlier policy, this bill is no different than the earlier \npolicy because the life-or-death decision has already been made with \nrespect to these particular embryos. These will never be implanted. \nThey will never be adopted. They will never be used.\n  This bill has not been held up because it is flawed. There is nothing \nwrong with this bill. The bill has been held up because of ideology, \nnot policy.\n  There is a clear scientific consensus on this issue. Embryonic stem \ncell research has been endorsed by 525 organizations and 80 Nobel prize \nlaureates. These groups and these experts represent the entire panoply \nof American health care, the young and the old: the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, which we know as AARP; the Society of \nPediatric Research; the American Geriatrics Society. They represent a \nwide range of medical experts. The American Medical Association \nsupports this bill. The American Academy of Nursing supports this bill.\n\n  They are from varying regions in the country: the University of \nCalifornia\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nsystem, the University of Kansas, the University of Arizona, the \nUniversity of Chicago, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\n  They represent patients struggling with a wide variety of \nafflictions: the Christopher Reeve Foundation, the Lung Cancer \nAlliance, the Arthritis Association, the ALS Association, the Juvenile \nDiabetes Research Foundation.\n  They represent a variety of religious faiths, including the Episcopal \nChurch and the National Council of Jewish Women.\n  These groups represent a variety of patients, medical disciplines, \nand religious faiths. They are from all over this country, and they all \nsupport expanding stem cell research. This consensus now even includes \nBush administration officials. Last month, NIH Director Dr. Elias \nZerhouni testified this:\n\n       From my standpoint as NIH director, it is in the best \n     interest of our scientists, our science, and our country that \n     we find ways and the Nation finds a way to go full-speed \n     across adult and embryonic stem cells equally.\n\n  That is a pretty unambiguous statement from the man who heads the \nInstitutes of Health.\n  The Senate and the President should listen to the scientists who best \nunderstand this issue and give them access to the stem cell lines that \nsuccessful research demands.\n  Jennifer McCormick of Stanford University's Center for Biomedical \nEthics has said:\n\n       The United States is falling behind in the international \n     race to make fundamental discoveries in related fields.\n\n  It is time to address and reverse that sentiment.\n  In a letter to President Bush, Nobel laureates called the discoveries \nmade thus far by stem cell researchers a significant milestone in \nmedical research.\n  They go on to say that:\n\n       Federal support for the enormous creativity of the United \n     States biomedical community is essential to translate this \n     discovery into novel therapies for a range of serious and \n     currently intractable diseases.\n\n  They are not alone. Paul Berg of Stanford, George Daley of Harvard, \nand Laurence S.B. Goldstein of the University of California at San \nDiego recognize the promise and the need for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. These esteemed researchers have said:\n\n       We want to be very clear. The most successful demonstrated \n     method for creating the most versatile type of stem cells \n     capable of becoming many types of mature human cells is to \n     derive them from human embryos.\n\n  This is the science.\n  You can quote a scientist here or a scientist there who will differ \nwith that, but the bulk of people in this field worldwide believe as \nthis statement reflects.\n  As Lucian V. Del Priore of Columbia University said:\n\n       This is important and exciting work.\n\n  It is time we use the wisdom of these respected scientists and \nembrace the promise of biomedical research using embryonic stem cells.\n  Scientists have learned more about stem cells--how they work, how \nthey may one day be used for cures--since we last considered this \nissue, I guess some 10 months ago. This past August, scientists from \nthe University of Edinburgh used embryonic stem cells from an African \nclawed frog to identify a protein that is critical to the development \nof liver cells and insulin-producing beta cells. This could lead to a \nbetter understanding of diabetes and liver disease as well as new \ntreatments.\n  Then during the next month or two, in October, scientists at \nNovocell, a San Diego biotech company, announced the development of a \nprocess to turn human embryonic stem cells into pancreatic cells that \nproduce insulin. This could be another significant step toward using \nstem cells to treat diabetes.\n  In September last, researchers used human embryonic stem cells to \nslow vision loss in rats suffering from a genetic eye disease that is \nsimilar to macular degeneration in humans. Macular degeneration is the \nleading cause of blindness in people aged 55 and over in the world. It \naffects more than 15 million Americans. This research means stem cells \ncould one day be used to restore vision in many of these patients. Just \nthink of that: fifteen million people who are surely going to go blind, \nand that blindness might be stopped.\n  In March, a team at the Burnham Institute in La Jolla, CA used \nembryonic stem cells in mice to treat a rare degenerative disorder \ncalled Sandhoff's disease. This condition, which is similar to Tay-\nSachs disease, destroys brain cells. The mice treated with stem cells \nenjoyed a 70-percent longer lifespan, and the onset of their symptoms \nwas delayed. The stem cells migrated throughout the brains of the mice \nand they replaced damaged nerve cells. No one ever thought that could \nbe done before. This suggests that embryonic stem cells may effectively \ntreat this disease as well as other genetic neurological conditions, \nincluding Tay-Sachs.\n  So all of this work is just beginning. Scientists will now work to \ntranslate these promising advances into cures for humans, and such a \nfeat will almost certainly require access to viable lines of human stem \ncells. Unless the President's policy is overturned, these lines will \nnot be available, and without access to additional stem cell lines, the \ncures and treatments will never move from mice to humans.\n  Many States, frustrated with Federal gridlock and the loss of their \nbest scientific minds, are moving forward. I am particularly proud of \nmy State of California. In 2004, California voters, by a whopping \nmargin, approved Proposition 71 and created the California Institute of \nRegenerative Medicine. That institute is spending $3 billion over 10 \nyears supporting promising research conducted in California. This work \nwill be done with careful ethical oversight. It also bans human \nreproductive cloning, something we can all agree is immoral and \nunethical. Over $158 million in research grants has now been approved, \nmaking California the largest source of funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch in America.\n\n  Promising projects include creating liver cells for transplantation \nat the University of California at Davis, developing cellular models \nfor Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease, ALS, at the Salk \nInstitute. This will give a better understanding of how these diseases \nwork and yield possible treatments, as will work at Stanford to more \neffectively isolate heart and blood cells from embryonic stem cells. \nThese are only some of the more than 100 labs in California now \nworking.\n  One might say: All right, why not let the private sector and the \nState address this problem? Why do we need Federal research? I want to \nconcentrate a few moments on that. The actions of California and the \nactions of other private and public institutions do not substitute for \nFederal funding and a standardized national policy. Much of this debate \nfocuses on stem cell lines themselves, but scientists need much more to \nsucceed. They need expensive equipment and lab space in which to work \nand collaborate, and there is the rub. For scientists working on \nembryonic stem cells, this means taking great care not to intermingle \ntheir work on approved stem cell lines with those that are not \napproved. If Federal funds, for example, built a lab or bought a \nfreezer, a petri dish, or a test tube, these resources cannot be used \non research involving lines not included in the President's policy. As \nI said, there are no lines left in the President's policy. Therefore, \nthey can't be used. This has created a logistical nightmare.\n  The duplication and careful recordkeeping required is an enormous \ndisadvantage faced by the U.S. stem cell scientists. Many have gone to \nextreme lengths to ensure they follow these regulations. The stakes are \nhigh: Any mistake could result in the loss of Federal grants for a \nresearcher's lab.\n  Let me give a few examples. University of Minnesota researcher Meri \nFirpo buys one brand of pens for her lab that receives Government money \nand another brand of pens for use in her privately funded lab. This \nhelps her ensure that a ballpoint pen purchased with Federal grant \nmoney is not used to record results in her lab that works with stem \ncell lines not covered by the President's policy.\n  UCLA is using a complex accounting system to allocate Federal and \nprivate dollars in careful proportion to the amount of time a \nresearcher spends working on either approved or unapproved stem cell \nlines. A stem cell researcher, Jeanne Loring at the Burnham Institute \nin La Jolla, CA, designed labels for all her equipment: Stem cells in a \ngreen circle denote equipment that can be used with all\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\nstem cell lines, while equipment bought with Federal funds is marked \nwith a red circle with a slash through it.\n  At the University of California in San Francisco, biologist Susan \nFisher worked for 2 years to cultivate stem cell lines in a privately \nfunded makeshift lab. Unfortunately, the power--the electricity--in her \nlab failed. She couldn't move her lines into the industrial-strength \nfreezers in the other lab because they were federally funded. The stem \ncell lines on which she had worked for 2 years melted and were gone. So \n2 years of work was out the window because of this ridiculous \nsituation.\n  Money that could otherwise be devoted to research is instead used to \nbuild labs and purchase duplicate equipment, and the cost is \nsignificant. Scientists at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical \nResearch in Cambridge, MA, didn't want to fall behind international \nstem cell leaders, so they established a second lab. They had to buy a \n$52,000 microscope, two incubators which cost $7,500, and a $6,500 \ncentrifuge. They already owned this equipment. They had the equipment, \nbut they couldn't use it because that equipment was published with \nFederal dollars. To me, this makes no sense. I don't think we can \nafford this kind of wasteful duplication with what are very precious \nresearch dollars. Our scientists should be focused on investigating \ndisease, not worrying about who pays for their pens or their test \ntubes. So bottom line: We need a reasonable Federal policy that \nincludes funding for viable stem cell lines.\n  I don't need to tell my colleagues about the famous faces and the \naverage people who are behind this legislation. It is nearly 70 percent \nof the population. I don't have to tell my colleagues about Michael J. \nFox, who showed the Nation the true face of Parkinson's disease. I \ndon't have to tell my colleagues about First Lady Nancy Reagan, who has \nspoken out in support of this and other legislation, or Christopher \nReeve, who lived his life refusing to accept that his spinal cord \ninjury would never be healed, or Dana Reeve, who stood by her husband \nand then tragically lost her own battle with cancer. Just as important \nare the millions of Americans who may not have a famous face, but put \neverything they have in us in the hope that we will do the right thing. \nThe right thing is pretty simple. It is to give them a chance to live--\nto live.\n  That is what we are talking about. I don't think there is any other \npiece of legislation that more involves the right to life than this \npiece of legislation.\n  These are people who are going to die. They live with catastrophic, \noften terminal diseases; they suffer immeasurably. Suddenly, there \nmight well one day be a cure, or their disease might be put in \nremission. The kind of research might be done that can mend a broken \nspinal cord. How can we not support this? How can we look at the facts? \nLife or death is not involved for the embryo that is used. That is \nexactly what this legislation is. These are embryos that have no chance \nat life. All we ask is that they be put to work to protect human life. \nIt seems to me that is not too much.\n  I hope this bill not only will pass here by a substantial margin but \nthat some way, somehow, the 67 votes we need in this body to overturn a \nPresidential veto will be present. I think the American people demand \nno less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nthe eloquent statement and for her many years of working on this issue \nand for her support on so many issues dealing with the health of the \nAmerican people. I thank Senator Feinstein for being a stalwart in \ntrying to break down the barriers we have to embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, we have made some truly amazing strides in medical \nresearch with the creation of new medicine and mapping the human \ngenome. I think we all agree more can be done and more should be done.\n  We know stem cells hold promise, and we have an opportunity tomorrow \nto pass critical legislation that enables us to take some of those next \nsteps in finding treatments and cures for diseases such as Parkinson's, \njuvenile diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer.\n  Like, I suspect, every Member of this body, I have my own personal \nexperiences in my family and reasons for supporting stem cell research. \nMy mother passed away about a year and a half ago--almost 2 years ago \nnow. She had, in the last decade or so, been stricken by Alzheimer's \ndisease, dementia. Her mother had lived and died with the same disease. \nHer grandmother lived and died with the same disease. Her sister may be \nshowing early symptoms of the same disease. My mother's father was a \nbutcher. He worked 5, 6 days a week until he was 81 years old in a \nlittle mom-and-pop supermarket in Beckley, WV. His hands would shake. \nSome would probably think, how many fingers would he lose today while \ntrying to cut up the meat. He never did lose any. He was a great hero \nto me. I remember watching as Parkinson's took its toll on him, as it \nhas others of our colleagues here and in the House, such as Mo Udall, \nwhom we thought the world of, and still do--but to see what happened to \nthem because of that disease. We lost my uncle in Huntington, WV, last \nyear to a form of cancer which is almost always deadly, pancreatic \ncancer. Those are only a couple of people in my own life, people who \nwere close to me and people in my family whom we have lost or have seen \na serious degradation in the quality of their lives. Some day, I would \nlike to be able to say to my sons, who are 17 and 18, you will never \nhave to worry about Alzheimer's disease because of the research and the \nkind of work that is made possible in this legislation and what it will \ndo for you. I would like to tell them you will never have to worry \nabout Parkinson's or pancreatic cancer.\n  Today is about much more than curing diseases. It is also about \nkeeping America's research centers competitive and relevant. The United \nStates has always been a key leader in the prevention and treatment of \nillnesses. We have developed vaccines and antibiotics that have \nliterally saved millions of lives, and still do. We have made \ntremendous advances in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research as \nwell. Now we have the opportunity to make a national commitment to \nexpand the frontiers of medical research. Stem cell research is a key \npart of doing that. I know a lot of us agree. The nation that is able \nto take stem cell research to the next step and use it to truly \nunderstand how our DNA works and then to use that information to help \nfind treatments and cure diseases will be in the driver's seat of \nmedical research worldwide for some time to come.\n  My friend and fellow Delawarean, Congressman Mike Castle, led the way \nto expand stem cell research. Last year, he introduced legislation that \nwould allow the NIH to support embryonic stem cell research. Congress \npassed this bill, thanks to the leadership in no small part of Senator \nHarkin and others in this body. It was vetoed by the President. I \ndisagree with the President's policy on stem cell research. On this \nfront, I think he is wrong.\n  This year, several of my colleagues, including my friend Senator \nHarkin, have introduced legislation very similar to the Castle bill \nthat we passed last year. S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act \nof 2007, would advance stem cell research by expanding the number of \nstem cell lines that are eligible for Federal funding. It would also \nstrengthen the ethical rules that govern stem cell research--a concern \nthat I know is on many people's minds, including my own.\n  Under the administration's current policy, the number of stem cell \nlines available for federally funded research has continued to shrink. \nThere are only 21 cells now available, I am told. What is more, many of \nthe current lines are contaminated or have reached the end of their \nusefulness.\n  A gentleman named Dr. Elias Zerhouni, the Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health, recently testified before a Senate panel and made \na similar claim that these 21 cell lines the National Institutes of \nHealth has will not be sufficient for the research they need to do at \nNIH.\n  S. 5 would allow new lines to be derived from excess in vitro \nfertilization embryos that would otherwise be discarded. To me, the \nchoice seems clear:\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\nRather than allowing these embryos to be discarded, destroyed, we can \nuse them to further lifesaving research. They may contribute to saving \nthe lives of our spouses, our brothers and sisters, our parents, our \nchildren, or our nieces and nephews. S. 5 would allow new lines to be \nderived from excess in vitro fertilization embryos that would otherwise \nbe discarded. I know people are concerned about that and they have an \nethical dilemma they face. I say to people who have those concerns and \nmay have deeply held beliefs, does it make sense to you that these \nembryos that have been created in fertility clinics are going to be \ndestroyed at the discretion of whoever was the person who donated the \neggs and the sperm that fertilized the egg? Does it make more sense to \nallow the fertilized eggs to be destroyed or to allow that embryo to \nbe--at the discretion of that husband and wife--used to help preserve \nand enhance and improve life?\n\n  These new stem cell lines would dramatically expand our ability to \nstudy and find treatments for a wide range of illnesses. The benefits \nwill come not only from having more lines but from having better lines. \nBy expanding our research policy, we can create stem cell lines that \nhelp us study specific diseases or create specific treatments.\n  I close by urging all of our colleagues to join us--a majority of \nus--in supporting S. 5. It has been made better because the sponsors of \nthe bill have also introduced legislation that, I think, was offered \nlast year by Senators Specter and Santorum. It is now part of this \nlegislation. It made it better.\n  We should not wait any longer. If we focus our resources and \nattention today to find cures, we can save lives--and also save money \nin the long run. I will close by saying for those who believe this \nlegislation is somehow diverting us from pursuing the use of adult stem \ncells, or stem cells that may come from umbilical cords, it doesn't do \nthat. We should pursue those paths as well. But we should not close the \ndoor on this path; we should pursue this path, too.\n  To those who brought us to this day, Congressman Castle from \nDelaware, the sponsors of this bill today, all who have joined in \nsupporting it, and the people in the country who joined us as well, \nthank you for doing a good thing for a lot of people who need our help.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the Senator from \nDelaware, for his very eloquent and personal statement. That is what \nthis is all about, helping people who are suffering bad problems and \nneed help with their health care.\n  I yield to a leader on all our health care issues for so many years, \nand I think he is recognized as such by the entire country. He is a \ngreat leader in all health care issues, especially on this issue of \nstem cell research. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friends, Senators Harkin and \nSpecter, for the extraordinary leadership they have provided on the \nextraordinary leadership they have provided on this issue, which is so \nimportant to families in our country. We deal with a lot of issues \naround this body. But this particular legislation probably offers more \nhope to more people than perhaps anything else we will do here in the \nSenate this year.\n  When we think of all of the various kinds of illnesses and diseases \nand accidents that have affected so many families here in the Senate--\nand, most importantly, the American families--we know we have the best \nin terms of treatment for these illnesses and sicknesses in the United \nStates for those who are able to receive it. Still, all of these \nillnesses and sicknesses have defied the ablest and most gifted minds \nuntil very recently, and that is with the discovery that started about \n10 years ago with the opportunity for using stem cells, which can play \na very indispensable role in providing a cure for these individuals.\n  That is what this is basically all about--an extraordinary \nopportunity that is out there, and whether we in the United States are \ngoing to permit the great institution--the greatest institution for \nresearch--the National Institutes of Health to be able to unleash the \nvastness of the creativity, brilliance, and ability of those \nresearchers and scientists to try to unlock the cures for so many of \nthese diseases, and do it in a way that is ethically sound, and for so \nmany of the reasons that have been spelled out.\n  This is an enormously timely bill. I thank Senator Harkin for his \npersistence and for ensuring we were going to be able to have this on \nthe floor of the Senate in a timely way. I thank Senator Reid for \nscheduling this. I thank the broad bipartisan coalition that has come \ntogether on our side and on the other side of the aisle which has given \nstrong support for this legislation.\n  It is pretty popular at this time in Washington to talk about the \ndifferences that exist in our Nation's Capital. There are some very \nimportant ones. We have come together, Republicans and Democrats, House \nand Senate--those who have over a long period of time advocated the \npro-life position and those who have felt there should be an ability \nfor individuals to make judgments about their own future--in support of \nthis legislation. So this is a very special time, and this vote we are \ngoing to have tomorrow is enormously important.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues and friends for bringing us to the point \nwhere we are today. Nearly a decade ago, American scientists made the \nrevolutionary discovery that tiny cells, called stem cells, held the \nextraordinary potential to offer new hope and new help in the fight \nagainst diabetes and Parkinson's disease, spinal injury, and many other \nillnesses.\n  Six years ago, many of us in the Senate joined millions of patients \nand their families in calling on President Bush to support this \nlifesaving research. Sadly, he rejected those calls and instead imposed \nsevere restrictions on the search for the cures.\n  Since those severe limitations were imposed, we have struggled to \nfree American scientists from these unwarranted restrictions. Last \nyear, we scored a great victory when the House and Senate, with broad \nbipartisan majorities, voted to end those restrictions. But those \nefforts came to naught with a veto, and we are back at the battle \nagain.\n  I share that view of my colleagues and friends in saying if we are \nnot successful--although we are hopeful we will be--we are going to \ncontinue this battle day in and day out until we are successful.\n  Today we renew our hope that the President will start anew and \nconsider the merits of this new legislation instead of automatically \npicking up the veto pen. When Congress passed the bipartisan stem cell \nbill last year, we voted for hope, for progress, and for life. But \nPresident Bush chose to dash those hopes by vetoing the legislation.\n  Now we are taking up the cause once again. Our legislation again \nbrings together conservatives and progressives, Members of Congress on \nboth sides of the debate over a woman's right to choose. \nRepresentatives from big cities, small towns, rural communities--we all \nagree stem cell research must go forward.\n  This legislation before us is only six pages long. It is a short, \nsimple bill with enormous goals and vast potential. It overturns the \nunrealistic and unreasonable restrictions on the embryonic stem cell \nresearch imposed by the President's Executive order 5 years ago. His \nunilateral action bypassed Congress and froze progress in its tracks by \nbarring the NIH from funding research using any stem cells derived \nafter August 9, 2001, an arbitrary date chosen solely to coincide with \nthe President's speech.\n  Many of us warned at that time that this policy would delay the \nsearch for new cures and put needless barriers in the way of medical \nprogress. At a HELP Committee hearing days after the Executive order \nwas issued, many of us raised concerns about the new policy and urged \nthe President to reconsider.\n  Our concerns were dismissed by the administration, but time has shown \nthat each of the drawbacks we feared then has become a real barrier to \nprogress today.\n  At the time of the Executive order, the administration claimed that \nover 60 independent stem lines would be available to NIH researchers. \nWe found, as our friend from California, Senator Feinstein, and Senator \nHarkin pointed out earlier, that 21 of those stem lines\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nare available to NIH researchers and all those were obtained using out-\nof-date methods and outmoded techniques.\n  We listened carefully to the words of Dr. Landis, who is chair of the \nNIH stem cell task force, in testimony before the Senate in January of \nthis year.\n  ``We are missing out on possible breakthroughs.''\n  ``Federally funded research has monitoring oversight and transparency \nthat privately funded research will not necessarily have.''\n  ``The cell lines that are eligible for the NIH funding now have been \nshown to have genetic instabilities,'' effectively pointing out the \nmissed opportunities that are in place now because of the restrictions \nput on by the administration and that even the research that is being \ndone in the private sector, as limited as it is, is lacking in the kind \nof monitoring and oversight and, in many instances, the enormously \nimportant ethical considerations that have been included in this \nlegislation.\n  It has been mentioned earlier in this discussion but needs to be \nmentioned again, the excellent statement by the Director of the \nNational Institutes of Health before the Senate on March 19, where he \npoints out:\n\n       To sideline the NIH in such an issue of importance, in my \n     view, is shortsighted. I think it wouldn't serve the Nation \n     well in the long run. We need to find a way to move forward.\n\n  These are two of the most distinguished researchers, scientists. Dr. \nZerhouni has had a brilliant record at the NIH. Dr. Landis has had a \nbrilliant record. Anyone who has the opportunity to listen to them \nrespond to questions can't help but leave that meeting recognizing and \nsupporting their position.\n  Those are the issues. That is what this legislation is about. Our \nlegislation makes the basic change needed to reverse our current \npolicy. As has been pointed out, science without ethics is akin to a \nship without a rudder. For that reason, the legislation establishes \nessential ethical safeguards for stem cell research--enormously \nimportant--and has been reviewed earlier during this debate.\n  Our legislation authorizes new initiatives for obtaining the stem \ncells from sources other than embryos. We strongly support ongoing \nresearch for alternatives to embryonic stem cell research, but it is \nfundamentally wrong to shut down the promise of new cures while that \nsearch is underway.\n  In the end, this debate is not about abstract principles or complex \naspects of science but the people who look with hope to stem cell \nresearch to help them with the challenges they face.\n  It is important to SGT Jason Wittling. Let me read about SGT Jason \nWittling. He was injured in Kabala, Iraq. He is in the U.S. Marine \nCorps:\n\n       I was in Charlie Company, 1st Combat Engineering Battalion, \n     1st Marine Division. I spent 10 years, 1 month, 28 days in \n     the Marine Corps, but who's counting. On May 9, 2003, on the \n     outskirts of Kabala, Iraq, my squad was disposing of Iraqi \n     ordinances.\n\n  The fuse went off prematurely, and as a result of the accident, his \nvehicle overturned on him.\n\n       I had burst fractures of my C6 vertebrae in my neck, broke \n     my right wrist, and a number of other injuries. He is in a \n     wheelchair now, a brave and courageous marine.\n\n  Sergeant Wittling now looks to stem cell research for new hope for \nhis injuries. He has had multiple surgeries.\n  Here is LCpl James Crosby of Winthrop, MA. He enlisted in the Marine \nCorps at age 17. He is married to Angela. He was living in California \nbefore his service and injury. On March 18, James was wounded by enemy \nfire while riding in the back of a U.S. military vehicle in Iraq. A \nrocket was fired and killed the driver and injured two marines, \nincluding James. Shrapnel pierced James's side and penetrated his \nintestine and spine. James was immediately flown to a hospital in \nKuwait. He had his first operation there and was stabilized. He was \nfinally flown to a U.S. military hospital in Germany.\n  In Germany, James underwent several surgeries to remove shrapnel and \nrepair wounds. James's wife Angela was flown to Germany to be with him. \nHe is now in a wheelchair. He has had multiple additional operations. \nHe has lost 50 pounds, requires a colostomy bag at all times. He has \nundergone 14 surgeries. He remains paralyzed from the waste down.\n  He is now in a wheelchair and has high hopes that stem cell research \ncan be of help, permitting him to recover from his wounds.\n  There are countless others who have similar injuries and recognize \nthe importance of this research.\n  I am going to conclude with a letter I received from 15-year-old \nLauren Stanford, who is from Plymouth, MA, who has juvenile diabetes. \nIn her letter, she wrote of her hope of what stem cell research means \nto her and her family. She wrote me again this year. While she is still \nfull of hope, you can also hear her frustration. These are her words:\n\n       I'm now wearing what is called a continuous glucose \n     monitoring system. It has a wire probe that I insert under my \n     skin every few days on my own. When I first held the wire \n     probe to my thigh, I was scared to death. The needle was \n     huge, and I was going to be plunging it into my body. Would \n     it hurt? What if it didn't work? Was it worth the risk? After \n     about 20 minutes of sweating and shaking, I stopped \n     chickening out and found the guts to do it. And then, as soon \n     as I did it, I knew almost immediately it was the right thing \n     to do. It went in fine. It didn't hurt that much. And it is \n     helping me.\n\n  Those were her words. She goes on to write to each of us about our \ndecisions on how to vote on this legislation. Here is what she writes:\n\n       Some of you might be scared to vote yes. You know it's the \n     right thing to do; after all, if embryos are being discarded, \n     how can it not be right to use them to help people like me?\n       Your hand is lingering over the yes lever, just like mine \n     was over the insertion device. You can see it might do some \n     good . . . but you're afraid. Someone might get mad. It might \n     hurt a little. But follow my lead. Be brave.\n       Do something that might hurt a little or scare you for a \n     second, but after will make so many things so much better. \n     Vote yes to allow scientists to do this valuable research to \n     free kids like me from horrible diseases. Vote yes and take \n     another step along with me to finding cures.\n       No one ever said doing the right thing, the brave thing, \n     and the thing to make the world better would be easy. I've \n     learned that the hard way. Vote yes. Free me from the \n     machines that keep me alive. Clear away my future of kidney \n     damage, blindness and fear of a shortened life.\n\n  Those are Lauren Stanford's words, and they compel us to act. \nTomorrow we can cast a vote of conscience and courage. By approving the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act, we call upon the President of the \nUnited States to think anew and decide not to veto hope.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). There is 8 minutes 24 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to start the discussion on this \nside regarding stem cells, regarding the major hope and promise of stem \ncells, stem cell research and adult stem cells, cord blood, amniotic \nfluid.\n  I wish to start off with a story of a patient, David Foege. I have a \npicture of him here. David Foege lives in Florida and has suffered from \nend-stage heart disease. He experienced shortness of breath, tiredness, \nand an inability to concentrate and function in a normal fashion. Over \n2 years ago, his cardiologist indicated that he should go to hospice, \nsaying he had no other options. ``I would be provided plenty of \nmorphine to ease my way into a `transitional state,' '' was the \nstatement of his treating physician. Hospice does provide great \nservice, but David learned about adult stem cell treatments through a \ncompany called TheraVitae.\n  When I saw David last year, he had just returned from his first stem \ncell treatment. He has just returned from his second one a matter of \nweeks ago--just this week, as a matter of fact. We have a progress \nreport from him about this amazing work which has taken place, this \ntherapy which has occurred with adult stem cells. Listen to David's \nletter. It is really impressive and very interesting.\n\n       I am one of 7 people in the world who have experienced 2 \n     stem cell therapies!\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\n       Susan and I have just returned from Bangkok, Thailand, \n     after 45 days of adult stem cell cardiac treatment and \n     rehabilitation. [One has to wonder why he is in Thailand for \n     that.] The absolute cutting edge of technology, the \n     utilization of my own stem cells reinjected into my heart, \n     allowed the reshaping and a re-functioning of my heart from a \n     life-threatening situation to a nearly normal heart function \n     today.\n       Following my stem cell [treatment] last year I went from a \n     life expectancy of one day to 90 days to at least one year. \n     The second stem cell treatment has jumpstarted me into the \n     range of normal function. I reasonably can expect a normal \n     life expectancy, which is approximately 10 to 15 more years. \n     I can't `` tell you how great it is to the back in the \n     greatest country in the world, the United States of America. \n     The weather is fabulous here in Florida, and it is wonderful \n     to sleep on my own soft bed.\n       I am in awe of the Creator, who amazingly engineered us to \n     have our own warranty in our body's toolbox with us at all \n     times . . . our own stem cells! It does not check our \n     politics, race, religion, or sex.\n       Some of the diseases in addition to heart diseases which \n     can be treated in 2008-2009 are the following [projected into \n     the future]:\n       Blindness macular degeneration, diabetes, stroke and \n     Parkinson's disease, paralysis of any part of the body \n     including back and/or legs, renal failure.\n       Being one of the world's longest living renal transplant \n     recipients of 23 years, I can't tell you how thrilled I am \n     for others that they may not have to endure the hellish \n     torture of a renal failure. This reasonable treatment is in \n     the immediate future.\n       It is an absolutely wonderful time to be alive. The only \n     letters, or designation, I would like to have behind my name \n     is David Foege, Alive!\n       TheraVitae has the technology to soup-up our cells and \n     differentiate them for maximum effectiveness. I would support \n     embryonic cells, but they have a 100% certain side effect of \n     growing cancer tumors. Our own adult stem cells do not.\n       Best wishes and great health be with you.\n       This opens a revolutionary door of opportunity to improve \n     the quality of life like it has for me and cut the spiraling \n     cost of health care in the USA.\n       On my way to Costco without cane or wheel chair for 30 \n     minute shopping walk, I remain\n       Sincerely yours,\n       David Foege, Ph.D. And alive\n\n  That is a good way to start this discussion of these miraculous stem \ncells. They are beautiful, and they are working in at least 72 \ndifferent human maladies. David Foege had treatments using two. The \nproblem is, he has had to go to Bangkok, Thailand, for both of them \ninstead of the United States.\n  Adult stem cell therapy has no ethical problems, no ethical \nquestions. They are his own stem cells. Yet he has had to travel to \nBangkok because we don't seem to have enough research funding to be \nable to support this sort of research into areas that are giving \ncures--treatments, I want to say, emphasize treatments, not cures--to \npeople to give them an enthusiastic life, to give them a chance to live \nand to sign off ``David Foege, Ph.D., and alive.''\n  We have now found these amazing stem cells in many places, not only \nin cord blood. Thanks to my colleague from Iowa, who worked with me and \nmany others, we established a cord blood bank, and we are now--I just \nchecked these numbers before we came over here--at the end of 2006, \nthere have been 10,000 cord blood transplants to unrelated donors. I \ngot those from the New York Blood Center, which was responsible for \n2,500 of these units. That is 10,000 people probably alive who wouldn't \nbe--maybe some would, in other ways or shapes. But still it is taking \nplace.\n  We now need to bank amniotic fluid. We just found in recent \nresearch--I want to show this chart as well. Some of my colleagues may \nhave missed this. This came out in JAMA, February 28, 2007: ``Stem \ncells obtained from amniotic fluid.'' This is the fluid, of course, \nsurrounding the child in the womb.\n\n       Amniotic fluid-derived stem cells--AFS cells--can be coaxed \n     to become muscle, bone, fat, blood, vessel, nerve and live \n     cells.\n       AFS, stem cells, might be capable of repairing damaged \n     tissues resulting from conditions such as spinal cord \n     injuries, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and stroke.\n\n  I hope one of the efforts we can take on banking, that I could \npossibly do with my colleague from Iowa and many others, is banking \namniotic fluid. This has been traditionally thrown away. It may hold \nthe promise of incredible cures. It is a great source of stem cells. \nThey are very malleable, the pluripotent stem cells that are taking \nplace that are in this as well. That may be another one on which we can \njoin together. There is much news to celebrate on the stem cell front, \nthis being one.\n  In the placenta, I believe, they are finding a rich source of these \npluripotent malleable stem cells as well--here another throwaway, if \nyou will. That is an area we are going to be able to find and probably \nuse more and more into the future for these very malleable, pluripotent \nstem cells from which we can create--not create but use for additional \namazing cures.\n  I want to recognize the work of my colleagues who are on the other \nside of this debate, Senator Specter from Pennsylvania, Senator Harkin \nfrom Iowa--many others who have pushed for a long time in these areas, \nand much good has happened. In the cord blood banking, that has gone \nvery well. In the adult stem cell research, that work has gone \nfabulously, as I just read in this opening story of a gentleman just \nback from Bangkok--although he wished his treatments were taking place \nin the United States rather than in Thailand. Much good has happened.\n  We have two major barriers. The first one I believe to be an \ninsurmountable barrier, that first one being, What is the human embryo? \nIf it is a person, as we have discussed many times, then it is entitled \nto human dignity and should be treated in a dignified fashion and not \nresearched or taxpayer dollars used to research and destroy it. If it \nis property, it can be done with as its master chooses.\n  We have discussed and debated this many times. Obviously, here the \neffort would be to treat the youngest of human beings as property to be \nresearched on, to be destroyed with the use of Federal taxpayer \ndollars. Yet, if you follow that debate on forward, at what point in \ntime does a human embryo become a person? We know that if you allow it \nto grow, at some point in time, under everybody's definition, it \nbecomes a person entitled to protection and human dignity. Yet we are \nsaying here: No, at the earliest phases, we are going to treat it as \nproperty, and with Federal taxpayer dollars we are going to pay to \ndestroy it and to research on it.\n  That is the obstacle which cannot be overcome because we believe in \nhuman dignity. We believe as a society in human dignity. So our debate, \nwhich we have had multiple sets of times, sets of different debates on \nthis here, continues today.\n  The central question will be, Will we sanction the destruction of \nnascent human life with Federal taxpayer dollars? That is the central \nissue. Will we divert taxpayer dollars from adult stem cell research, \nwhich is working? See the case of Dr. David Foege--and send these \ndollars to fund speculative research that likely will never produce any \npatient treatments? That is the second question with it.\n  I mentioned the first to be an insurmountable one. I think the second \nis one of wisdom: Should we be funding something that is working or \nshould we be speculating on something that is not and is producing, \nindeed, tumors? I will back that up with a number of research papers.\n  These are the two central questions. These are the two questions we \nwill be debating throughout this period of time.\n  I doubt there is much surprise left on the vote, on how the votes \nwill take place. It is an important debate. It does frame much of what \nwe move forward with in this country and in places around the world. \nBut these are the two central questions: Will we sanction the \ndestruction of nascent human life with Federal taxpayer dollars? Will \nwe divert taxpayer dollars from adult stem cell research which is \nworking and send these dollars to fund speculative research that likely \nwill never produce any patient treatments?\n  Central to this debate is the issue of how we treat our fellow man. \nWe would all agree, I hope, that individuals should be treated with \nrespect. We would agree that we should avoid prejudices. We would agree \nthat each individual has an inalienable right to life--my colleagues, \nmy colleague from Iowa, myself, the Presiding Officer, those around, \nthose watching would all agree that we each have an inalienable right \nto life--to live. We would all hold this for the newborn through the \neldest members of our society. But when does that life begin? The \nquestion that has vexed this body for some period of\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\ntime. Does it begin at birth? Does it begin before birth? When? Biology \ntells us that life begins much earlier than birth. Here I want to read \nfrom the ``Human Embryology'' textbook. It says this:\n\n       Although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a \n     critical landmark because under ordinary circumstances, a new \n     genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.\n\n  Such definitions are helpful in clarifying that human life does begin \nat the embryonic phase. Indeed, myself, my colleague from Iowa, the \nPresiding Officer all began at that embryonic phase, whether the embryo \ncomes the old-fashioned way, via IVF or a product of various scientific \nmethods such as SCNT human cloning.\n  With the scientific fact in hand, we evaluate the facts in light of \nour ethical framework. For instance, we know that the human embryo is a \nhuman life. Then the question is, How should we treat it? Human life \nhas immeasurable value, from the youngest to the oldest. Human beings \nare ends in themselves. It is wrong to use any human as a means to an \nend. Any time throughout human history when we have done otherwise we \nhave regretted it.\n  Our value as people is intrinsic. I would say here, I am pro-life, \nwhole life. I believe that all life is sacred, it is beautiful, it is \nunique, it is the child of a loving God, from beginning to end, it is \ntrue here, it is true in the womb, it is true of a child in Darfur, it \nis true of a lady in poverty, it simply is true.\n  Yes, we want to treat people and help people who have medical \nconditions. But we must not trample upon any human to achieve such an \nend. This is because human beings are distinct and unique amongst all \ncreation. I would note that Ronald Reagan had, I thought, a very folksy \nway of defining whether this was human life and whether it should be \nprotected. In his 1983 essay on ``Abortion and the Conscience of a \nNation,'' he put this in a very commonsense way.\n\n       Anyone who doesn't feel sure whether we are talking about a \n     second human life, should clearly give life the benefit of \n     the doubt. If you don't know whether a body is alive or dead, \n     you would never bury it.\n\n  I think this consideration itself should be enough for all of us to \ninsist on protecting the unborn. Very commonsense, folksy way, but he \ndoes hit the point. Will we do what is ethical with respect to our \nfellow man? This is one of the central questions of this debate.\n  Now during this debate some will argue that we should proceed with \nethical embryonic stem cell research. Here I would distinguish between \nembryonic and some of the unquestionably ethical alternatives which we \ncan talk about. With respect to embryonic stem cell research, though, \nas embodied in the guidelines of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct, S. 5, how is it possible to ethically do something that is \ncompletely unethical--destroy another human life, innocent human life--\nfor research purposes?\n  Arguments that the bill provides ethical guidelines, though well \nintended, I believed are misplaced. The ethics of S. 5 have nothing to \ndo with protecting innocent life from destruction. They will fund, with \ntaxpayer dollars, the destruction of innocent human life.\n  The ethics of S. 5 have to do with the process of how you donate \nyoung human embryos for destruction. Mr. President, we have had this \ndebate before. We have had it on the floor on this issue, and we have \nhad it before regarding other issues. We had it with the fetal tissue \nresearch from abortions.\n  I wish to take the body back to 1991, the Coalition for Research \nFreedom, in a letter signed by many prominent patient advocacy groups \nwho are advocating embryonic stem cell research today, were advocating \nfetal tissue research in 1991. They wrote this: Fetal tissue \ntransplantation research is widely recognized as one of the most \npromising research avenues for such disease and disabilities as \nParkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, Huntington's, leukemia, epilepsy, \nspinal cord injuries, and many other chronic health conditions.\n  Doesn't that sound familiar, Congress responding to the emotional \noutcry with legislation to provide for funding for unethical research, \nresearch that can only take place with the trampling of the rights of a \nfellow human.\n  That was 1991. Those were the promises. That was the move forward by \nthis body. That is what was pushed on forward. We know what happened. \nIt was on the front page of the New York Times in 2001. The news story \nbegan like this:\n\n       A carefully controlled study that tried to treat \n     Parkinson's disease by implanting cells from aborted fetuses \n     into patient's brains not only failed to show an overall \n     benefit but also revealed a disastrous side effect, \n     scientists report.\n       In about 15 percent of patients, the cells apparently grew \n     too well, churning out so much of a chemical that controls \n     movement that the patients writhed and jerked uncontrollably.\n\n  The story continues:\n\n       ``They chew constantly, their fingers go up and down, their \n     wrists flex and distend,'' Dr. Greene said. And the patients \n     writhe and twist, jerk their heads, fling their arms about.\n       ``It was tragic, catastrophic,'' he said. ``It's a real \n     nightmare. And we cannot selectively turn it off.''\n       One man was so badly affected that--\n\n  We will see what happens. Hopefully, the sound will come back in a \nlittle while.\n\n       One man was so badly affected that he could no longer eat \n     and had to use a feeding tube, Dr. Greene said. In another, \n     the condition came and went unpredictably throughout the day, \n     and when it occurred, the man's speech was unintelligible.\n       For now, Dr. Greene said, his position is clear: ``No more \n     fetal transplants. We are absolutely and adamantly convinced \n     that this should be considered for research only.'' The \n     pattern repeats itself. It is a double tragedy. First, the \n     young human life is destroyed. Second, it is patients who \n     will likely be harmed. There are no embryonic human \n     treatments or applications, despite 25 years of embryonic \n     work in animal models and a decade of work with human \n     embryonic stem cells.\n\n  I repeat that. Twenty-five years of embryonic work in animal models, \nthere are no human treatments, and a decade of work with human \nembryonic stem cells, no treatments.\n  But what we have learned about embryonic stem cells is that these \ncells are very good at forming tumors, in particular. The literature \nabounds with such stories. One example is in an area published last \nyear in Stem Cells. You read the article and find: The expression of \nthe insulin gene could be demonstrated only when the cell is \ndifferentiated in vivo into teratomas, those are tumors.\n  This is one example and there are many others. I wish to point this \nout because this was the same result we saw taking place with fetal \ntissue research, was that tumors were formed. That is what took place.\n  I wish to go to several of the articles now that are published \narticles on the formation of tumors by embryonic stem cells. Note this \none on the insulin gene, this was in the publication Stem Cells, \npublished August 2 of 2006--have another one published April 6, 2006.\n  They noted there as well the potential for teratoma development in \nembryonic stem cell lines, even after prolonged differentiation. I have \na series of articles. Here is one in Neurochem, 2006, June. They were \nnoting there frequent tumor-related deaths in transplanted animals \ntaking place in that one.\n  Here is one in Stem Cells in June of 2006. There they note that rats \ngrafted with human embryonic stem cells predifferentiated in vitro for \n16 days developed severe teratomas--again, tumors.\n  The literature is full of that work. These are developing tumors. We \nnote in Stem Cells publication, June of 2006, more than 70 percent of \nmice that received embryonic stem cells neural precursor cells \ndeveloped teratomas, developed tumors.\n  I have a series of those publications, all noting the stem cell \ntherapy in animals produced tumors. Strange. That is what we found took \nplace in fetal tissue research when we were dealing with an older set \nof cells that had been developed, and now when we back it up to a \nyounger set of stem cells or cells we are using, we are seeing this \nsame feature, forming teratomas or tumors throughout each of the \nresearch animals and in some cases in almost every circumstance.\n  That is what we found then, and we are finding the same thing now, \nconsistent on the research. I have, for those who are interested, if \nany of the offices are interested, 17 different examples of the \nformation of teratomas\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\nby embryonic stem cell work in lab animals.\n  Let's not go down this road of unethical, speculative research. I am \nsure the research is interesting to some. But the Government needs to \npursue what is best for Americans suffering from diseases and injuries. \nThat is what our standard should be in this.\n  We have an enormous ethical hurdle of killing young human life for \nthis research purpose, and we have an area that needs more funding in \nthe adult stem cell, cord blood, amniotic fluid, and that money is \nbeing diverted to other places.\n  Now let us move from that ethical to the practical question: Should \nwe put millions or billions of dollars into interesting, speculative \nresearch on tumor-forming embryonic stem cells or should we put our \nmoney where we are already getting strong results with adult stem cell \nwork, cord blood, amniotic fluid, other areas where there is no ethical \nproblem?\n  Adult stem cells have no ethical strings attached. You can get them \nfrom an adult patient without causing the patient harm, you can harvest \nthem from the rich cord blood, and as noted in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association on March 7 of this year, they can be \nobtained from amniotic fluid, which I previously cited, without causing \nharm to the unborn child.\n  Defying the naysayers, who said this could not work or would not \nwork, there are so many confirmed adult pluripotent stem cells, \npluripotent cells, that means they can form a number of different types \nof cell types, previously thought to only exist in the embryos, can \nturn into virtually any cell in the body.\n  And here I want to show--first, let us go to the chart of the areas \nthat were having treatments taking place by adult stem cell therapy. I \nwish to hold this up. I do not think this is a complete set of areas \nbut 72 current human--this is in humans--clinical applications using \nadult stem cells: blood conditions, autoimmune, bladder disease, \ncancer, cardiovascular, liver disease, ocular, wounds and injuries, \nmetabolic disorders.\n  You can see the list of 72 different areas that are being treated \nwith adult stem cells in humans, in human trials. I wish to hold up to \nmy colleagues--I will be happy to provide this to any offices that \nwould like it--it is about an inch-thick binder of ``New Reasons for \nHope.'' These are recent developments published since Congress's stem \ncell debate and vote of 2006 and the adult stem cell research and other \nalternative to embryonic stem cell work and research.\n  This is from June 2006 to March of 2007. Here are the number of \nadditional areas that we have gotten successful work taking place in \neach of those. I wish to show this as a folder--I have shown it before \nto my colleagues--if anybody would like to see this. These are the \nrecent advances in adult stem cell research and other alternatives. \nThis is a binder about 4 inches thick, full of the front pages, just \nthe first pages of the research in these fields of what is taking \nplace. There needs to be more taking place in this field to get more of \nthe treatments for more people like David Foege.\n  If people want to go to the Web site of ClinicalTrials.gov and pull \nup the latest number of trials and studies of places that are \nrecruiting patients or are filled and no longer recruiting, it pulls up \n1,422 studies currently ongoing. This is the first of 50 pages from \nClinicalTrials.gov of the various areas and uses of adult stem cells \nthat are going on right now.\n  Let's look at the money chart. Presently, there is no prohibition \nagainst anybody developing new embryonic stem cell lines legally. If a \nprivate group or a state wants to develop a new embryonic stem cell \nline, they can. The limitation is on the use of Federal taxpayer \ndollars in research areas on newly established embryonic stem cell \nlines. But if a private group wants to develop an embryonic stem cell \nline or a State, they can do that now.\n  Let's look at the funding that has gone into embryonic stem cell \nresearch, both human and nonhuman. In fiscal year 2006, the last year \nthat we have full data for, human embryonic stem cell research, $37.8 \nmillion, nonhuman embryonic stem cell research, $110.4 million; for \n2002 to 2006, human embryonic stem cell research, $132.1 million, \nnonhuman embryonic stem cell research, $481.7 million; for a total of \n$613.9 million in embryonic stem cell research. We are putting a lot of \nmoney into embryonic stem cell research. Still the scoreboard of where \nwe are getting humans treated after $613.9 million, stem cell research \nhuman applications, adult, we have two treatment areas with binders \nfull of information, with 1,422 study trials. We have zero on the \nembryonic, after 25 years of knowing about this, 10 years of knowing \nabout it in humans, and after $613 million in funding.\n  After some period of time, should we not think, wouldn't it be better \nif Dr. David Foege were being treated in the United States instead of \nThailand and we had more of that work that is getting him treated \ntaking place here rather than in other places around the world? \nWouldn't it be better to take the $613 million that could yield more \ntreatments, if that is what we are after, wouldn't it be better to take \nthat $613 million and say: Let's put more in adult stem cell research \nwhere it is yielding results? Doesn't that make sense? Isn't that the \nright thing to do?\n  Where we have all of this that is producing results, after 25 years \nwe don't have anything here. That is not fair to say. I am sure we have \ninteresting research information that has come up through that research \nof that $613 million. I am sure there has been useful research, but it \ninvolves the destruction of young human life.\n  Before people who are watching this think: You have a cure for me in \nthe adult stem cell area, I want to make sure to put forward that many \nof these are in clinical trials today. Not all of these are widely \navailable yet. However, there has been success in all of these areas \nusing adult stem cells. For some of these treatments adult stem cells \nwere the main component. In others adult stem cells were the part that \nhelped the main component to work. All of these are real and \nlegitimate.\n  On the eve of last summer's biological debate, some scientists took \nit upon themselves to criticize this list by publishing a letter in the \nJournal of Science. In January this year, Science published a response \nto this initial letter. It is important that we put forward here the \ncontext of the adult stem cell treatment that has yielded so many human \ntreatments to date. I want to put this in context.\n\n       In their letter ``Adult Stem Cell Treatments for \n     Diseases?'' S. Smith et al. claim that we misrepresent a list \n     of adult stem cell treatments benefiting patients.\n       But it is the Letter's authors who misrepresent our \n     statements and the published literature, dismissing as \n     irrelevant the many scientists and patients who have shown \n     the benefits of adult stem cells.\n       We have stated that adult stem cell applications have \n     ``helped,'' ``benefited,'' and ``improved'' patient \n     conditions. Smith et al.'s Supporting Online Material \n     repeatedly notes patient improvement from these cells. We \n     have never stated that these treatments are ``generally \n     available,'' ``cures,'' or ``fully tested in all required \n     phases of clinical trials and approved by the U.S. Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA).'' Some studies do not require \n     prior FDA approval, and even the nine supposedly ``fully \n     approved'' treatments acknowledged by Smith et al. would not \n     be considered ``cures'' or ``generally available'' to the \n     public at this stage of research.\n       The insistence that no benefit is real until after FDA \n     approval is misplaced. Such approval is not a medical \n     standard to evaluate patient benefit, but an agency \n     determination that benefits outweigh risks in a broad class \n     of patients.\n       Physicians and patients use an evidentiary standard. Our \n     list of 72 applications, [is] compiled from peer-reviewed \n     articles, documents observable and measurable benefit to \n     patients, a necessary step toward formal FDA approval and \n     what is expected of new, cutting-edge medical applications.\n\n  As this debate moves forward, I look forward to sharing the stories \nof some of the real patients who have benefited from ethical adult stem \ncell research. We need more patients treated. We have more patients who \nneed treatment. We have an area of high-yield Federal dollar investment \nwhere it should go, and we don't have the ethical barriers. We should \nbe putting that money there; 72 to 0, that is the score. There are at \nleast 72 human treatments and applications using adult stem cells. \nThere are no human treatments with embryonic stem cells. With the rate \nof tumor formation which I previously noted, none seemed to be on the \nhorizon soon.\n  This is acknowledged by some scientists. Notably, Science carried a \npiece in 2005 in which the authors note:\n\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\n\n       . . . the clinical benefits of the research are years or \n     maybe decades away. This is a message that desperate families \n     and patients will not want to hear.\n\n  Yet we do have a message that desperate families and patients do want \nto hear; that is that we have treatments on the horizon, and we do in \nthe adult and cord blood and amniotic fluid. We need the research \nmoney.\n  Harvard stem cell researcher David Shaywitz wrote in a 2005 \nWashington Post op-ed:\n\n       While stem cell advocates have helped voters connect \n     embryonic stem cell research with compelling images of \n     patients who might one day benefit from treatment, such \n     therapies are unlikely to emerge soon enough to benefit most \n     current proponents. . . .\n       . . . scientists must do a better job of articulating the \n     limitations of our existing acknowledge, taking care to \n     emphasize not only the ultimate therapeutic potential of \n     these cells, but also how far we are from achieving such \n     therapies.\n\n  Which road will we choose? Will we choose the ethical adult stem cell \nroad that holds great promise and is currently producing treatments, or \nwill we choose the unethical embryonic stem cell road that tramples on \nhuman dignity and has produced tumors to date? That is the point of the \ndiscussion.\n  This is not just an academic discussion, nor is it just a policy \ndiscussion. It involves real people. I showed you one person who was a \nreal person. I started off with talking about David Foege who is \nexcited about being alive. Let me show you Jacki Rabon, a paraplegic. I \nmet Jacki last year. She has continued to improve. I want to share her \nstory with you.\n  She lives in central Illinois. She had come to DC last year with her \nmother and sister because she wanted to tout her successful adult stem \ncell treatment. The courage of Jacki and many others like her is truly \namazing. Years earlier, as an active 16-year-old, she was paralyzed in \nan automobile accident. As the car was flipping multiple times, Jacki \nwas thrown from the vehicle and landed on her back on a country road. \nHer dreams of earning a volleyball scholarship for college were \nshattered.\n  In a letter sent to me last year, Jacki wrote this:\n\n       That day changed my outlook, my future aspirations and my \n     complete life. Before the accident I was a very active 16-\n     year-old. I played volleyball in school and was very good. I \n     had hopes of going to college on a volleyball scholarship. I \n     truly was living a nightmare after this tragedy. I really \n     thought my life was over. I couldn't imagine not playing \n     volleyball anymore, jumping on my trampoline with my young \n     nephew, chasing after my niece or just taking a walk around \n     my small community. Not only does something like this change \n     the victim but it also disrupts and seriously affects your \n     family.\n       I spent a little over a month in the hospital. I had back \n     surgery to stabilize my back. I had a fracture at the T12 \n     area, which made me a paraplegic. I had no feeling below the \n     belly button. I had to learn to become independent again. I \n     had to learn to dress, bathe, transfer from place to place, \n     and take care of my personal hygiene and toiletry issues. It \n     was so difficult and I struggled with these once simple \n     tasks. After I accomplished these I was released and allowed \n     to come home. I was simply told, ``You'll never walk again.'' \n     That was my prognosis!\n       I got back to school a few months later and that was \n     another adjustment. Everything looks and works differently \n     when you are sitting in a wheelchair. I had to deal with a \n     lot of depression and sadness. But I tried to continue with \n     my life the best way that I could. I truly believe that my \n     faith got me through. If it wasn't for this amazing love of \n     God and my strong will and determination I don't know if I \n     could have proceeded with what my life had become. But I have \n     great determination along with the comforting faith and I \n     didn't intend on giving up that easily. I wanted to give life \n     another opportunity with my new ``lifestyle.''\n\n  Can you imagine the anguish of being a 16-year-old, your whole life \nin front of you, and then being confronted with this sort of tragedy?\n  Jacki was very fortunate, however, to have so many people who were \nlooking out for her. Her pastor saw a PBS show called ``The Miracle \nCell,'' about a procedure called olfactory mucosa transplantation being \ndone in Portugal by Dr. Carlos Lima. The work involved transplanting \nadult stem cells from spinal cord patients' own sinus area into their \nspinal cord at the initial injury site.\n  This gave Jacki real hope. Continuing her letter, she wrote:\n\n       I listened to amazing recovery of returned sensation and \n     even the ability to walk again with continued rehab from \n     others after having this surgery. I remember thinking, \n     ``There's my chance!'' I knew I wanted to pursue this \n     possibility for me.\n       My mom and I started researching this procedure on the \n     Internet and collected as much information that we could. We \n     discovered a Spinal Cord Injury Institute getting ready to \n     open in Detroit, Michigan, that summer. This institute was \n     closely associated with Dr. Lima. We called to see if we \n     could get an appointment to go and meet Dr. Steve Hinderer \n     and asked about the procedure in depth and inquire about my \n     chances of getting it done.\n       I did go to Detroit and was told that I could well be a \n     good candidate. I was given the guidelines and criteria for \n     having this done. After many months of additional testing, x-\n     rays, etc., I was accepted.\n       This was very exhilarating for me. I had read about the \n     success stories of the individuals that have gone before me. \n     Their various success stories gave me so much hope!\n       I had so much support from my family, friends, church, \n     community and surrounding areas to raise the $50.000.000 \n     needed to have this surgery. Without this overwhelming \n     support I could not have gone forward with this incredible \n     opportunity.\n       I went to Portugal in October 2005. I had the procedure \n     done on October 29th. My experience in Portugal was not all \n     pleasant. My mom and I had to deal with the language barrier \n     and the unfamiliar culture. I returned to the states on \n     November 5th. I rested at home for a few weeks then went to \n     Detroit to the Institute for aggressive rehab. Rehab was very \n     tiring and indeed very aggressive. It was an exhausting \n     experience but a very rewarding one. It was there that I \n     took my first steps on the parallel bars. I was up!\n       My progress since undergoing this surgery has been amazing! \n     I have a lot of hip movement, some tingling and heaviness in \n     my legs. I have continued with my rehab regimen at home. I \n     have leg braces that were fitted to me. I can walk on \n     parallel bars and have begun walking with a walker. I am up \n     on my feet again! That's the most satisfying feeling. Unless \n     you have been confined in a wheelchair for an extended amount \n     of time you can't really know how rewarding it is to be \n     standing again.\n       This brings me to the ongoing debate over adult stem cell \n     research. I did not think a lot about this issue before the \n     accident but now it has sparked a great interest within me. \n     First, I am very much against embryonic stem cell research \n     and advancement. I do not support this aspect at all. The \n     killing of human life is appalling to me. But with adult stem \n     cell and non-embryonic stem cell research I have become an \n     advocate. My personal experience with adult stem cell \n     transplantation should awaken the United States to the \n     unlimited possibilities. This technique is simply, ``your \n     body healing itself.'' Medical research in the United States \n     has always been respected and admired for the advances toward \n     cure for cancer, arthritis treatments and medication, heart \n     disease and other well-known diseases and ailments. But when \n     it comes to spinal cord injuries the U.S. is very much in the \n     negative category. We as taxpayers pay more money in the \n     daily care of a spinal cord injury victim than we do on a \n     cure. Now why is that? The medical society treats the injury \n     at the onset then teaches the individual to live in a \n     wheelchair and function accordingly. Then they are sent home \n     and told, ``You will never walk again.'' I experienced that \n     first hand.\n       But I am walking again. I have goals of walking by the end \n     of the year with my braces and crutches. This was made \n     possible by the procedure in Portugal--Portugal, not the \n     United States--and aggressive rehab. But I had to leave the \n     comfort of my home and country and travel to a foreign area \n     to get this done. Now that is sad, isn't it?\n       This tragedy that happened to me can happen to anyone. It \n     could be your wife, husband, son, daughter or friend. What \n     would you want for them? Simply a statement, ``You'll never \n     walk again'' or ``Never give up hope there is a better option \n     for you.''\n\n  Jacki Rabon writes:\n\n       Wake up United States! We are missing out. Let's look at \n     the issue in a more personal level--I can walk again.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jacki Rabon,\n                                                      Waverly, IL.\n\n  These are the moving words this courageous young lady wrote last \nsummer.\n  Jacki's progress does continue. We received an e-mail from Jacki's \nmom, Becki, in the last few weeks. Becki Rabon writes:\n\n       Jacki is doing wonderfully. She did have a slight hip \n     problem a few weeks ago. She was experiencing a lot of pain. \n     We had x-rays, Ultrasounds and lab work done.\n       Thank God, it was only tightness in her hip muscles. The \n     pain of course was not good . . . but it was in a way that is \n     good since Jacki is getting more feeling in her hips.\n       Otherwise, she is still walking with her braces and a \n     walker at our church. She walks independently now. All I do \n     is help her with getting the braces on and stabilizing the \n     walker while she stands up. Then she can walk by herself. The \n     distance has increased considerably. The next step for her is \n     to start walking outside and at home. She needs to be on more \n     normal terrain.\n\n  This is an amazing story, and the science that has gone into Jacki's\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\ntreatment is truly revolutionary, miraculous. Adult stem cell therapy--\nwhat could it do with another $600 million? How far along could we be?\n  A June 2006 study in the Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine reported on \nDr. Lima having transplanted nasal stem cells into seven patients with \nspinal cord injury. The patients regained some motor function and \nsensation, and two patients showed bladder control improvement.\n  Most of the adult stem cell work in this area is still being done in \nlab animals, but it is already starting to have human applications. You \nhave to ask yourself, why would we want to go down the unethical \nembryonic stem cell road when the doors are already being opened by \nadult stem cells and you already have these types of human stories \ntaking place? Why, when we have something that is working?\n  Shown in this picture is Jacki Rabon.\n  I am going to tell an amazing story about Dr. Dennis Turner. He came \nin to testify in the Senate Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Science \nand Technology. He testified in 2004. He suffered from Parkinson's \ndisease. I want to read portions of his testimony. I show you a picture \nof Dr. Dennis Turner. He stated:\n\n       For 14 years I've had Parkinson's Disease. This \n     irreversible disease involves the slow destruction of \n     specialized cells in the brain, called Dopamine Neurons. By \n     early 1991 I suffered extreme shaking of the right side of my \n     body, stiffness in my gait and movements. After some years of \n     medication, I developed fluctuation and poor response to \n     Sinemet. This made daily activities needing the coordinated \n     use of both hands hard or impossible, such as putting in \n     contact lenses. My disability prevented me from using my \n     right arm.\n       Other than my Parkinson's symptoms I was physically very \n     active and fit. Because of this Dr. Levesque felt that I'd be \n     a good candidate for an experimental treatment. He explained \n     that he would take a very small tissue sample from my brain, \n     removing its adult neural stem cells. He would then multiply \n     and mature these cells into Dopamine Neurons, then inject \n     these cells back into the left side of my brain. He proposed \n     treating only the left side because it controls the right \n     side of the body, the side with the most severe Parkinson's \n     symptoms.\n       Dr. Levesque did not tell me that this treatment would \n     permanently cure my condition. Science has yet to learn what \n     causes Parkinson's Disease, much less how to remove it. \n     However, since this cell-replacement approach had never been \n     tried in a human patient we hoped for the best. And since my \n     only other realistic alternative was to continue growing \n     worse until I eventually died, I decided to have the surgical \n     procedures in 1999, one to remove the tissue and another to \n     inject the cells. I was awake for both procedures, under \n     local anesthesia.\n       Soon after having the cells injected my Parkinson's \n     symptoms began to improve. My trembling grew less and less, \n     until to all appearances it was gone, only slightly \n     reappearing if I became upset. Dr. Levesque had me tested by \n     a Neurologist, who said he wouldn't have known I had \n     Parkinson's if he had met me on the street. I was once again \n     able to use my right hand and arm normally, enjoying \n     activities that I had given up hope of ever doing.\n       Since being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease my condition \n     had slowly, but continuously worsened. I can't say with \n     certainty what my condition would have become if Dr. Levesque \n     had not used my own adult stem cells to treat me. But I have \n     no doubt that because of this treatment I've enjoyed five \n     years of quality life that I feared had passed me by.\n       Last year, after 4 years of being virtually symptom free, \n     my Parkinson's symptoms began reappearing in my body's left \n     side. Today I have various degrees of trembling in both \n     hands, although I feel that the left is slightly worse. \n     Nevertheless, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to have Dr. \n     Levesque use my adult stem cells to treat me a second time, \n     since in my case they were safe, effective, and involved no \n     risk of rejection.\n       Because of my improvements through Dr. Levesque's treatment \n     I've been able to indulge in my passion for big game \n     photography these past 5 years.\n\n  This man suffering severe Parkinson's for 5 years being able to \nindulge in his passion for big game photography.\n\n       While on safari in 2001 I scrambled up a tree to avoid \n     being run over by a Rhino. I swam in the South Atlantic with \n     Great White Sharks. Two weeks ago I returned from Africa \n     after photographing Cheetahs and Leopards in the wild.\n\n  This is a man with severe Parkinson's.\n\n       Here are a few examples of the pictures I took. They \n     represent memories and experiences I feel I have Dr. Levesque \n     to thank for. I came here to offer him my sincere gratitude, \n     and to offer others with Parkinson's a concrete reason for \n     hope.\n       This summarizes my history with Parkinson's and the \n     positive effects I experienced through a treatment that used \n     my own adult stem cells. I'm very happy with its results and \n     would dearly love to have a second treatment.\n\n  Mr. President, I cite this example because here is a route forward \nfor us. We want to treat people with Parkinson's. Here is a route \nforward that has been shown in a human clinical trial setting, with \npositive results for a period of time. Why would we want to waste that? \nWhy wouldn't we want to fund that and to use it aggressively?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor \nand will continue to use more of my time later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nvote yes on S. 5. This is a bill that will bring hope to millions of \nAmericans and their families. This is the bill, this is the opportunity \nfor us to move forward on critically needed research. By passing the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act, we can make a major step forward in \nscientific research and bring hope and help to millions of Americans \nfighting a debilitating disease every day.\n  I think we all have members of our own families who can speak to \nthose issues--Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, juvenile diabetes, other kinds \nof diseases--where we know with a little bit of help and focus, both in \nterms of stem cell research but also in terms of funding research, we \ncan see huge changes, huge opportunities for treatment and for possible \ncures. That is what this bill is all about. It is so important we move \nforward in a positive way and pass this bill as quickly as possible.\n  It is very sad we have this issue up before us again. In the last \nCongress, we passed legislation by wide bipartisan margins to lift the \nPresident's restriction on Federal funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. By wide margins, the majority of Americans supported this \nlegislation, and still support this legislation. Unfortunately, the \nPresident issued his first and, so far, only veto to strike down our \nlegislation. So we are back here again.\n  I see Mr. Harkin, a great Senator from Iowa, on the floor. I commend \nhim for his leadership, and so many of my other colleagues. Earlier \ntoday, Senator Feinstein was on the floor, and I thank her, certainly, \nfor her leadership, as well as Senator Kennedy. So many people have \nworked so hard in bringing us to this point. I thank our leader, our \nSenate majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, for making this a priority \nas an agenda item for us in the Senate.\n  I know how deeply personal this issue is for many people. I respect \nthat many of my colleagues have different views on stem cell research. \nI have also studied this issue very extensively. Over the past several \nyears, I have met with people from all different faiths, all different \nbackgrounds, from religious figures to medical researchers on the \ncutting edge of breakthrough technology. I have met with mothers who \nhave to give multiple daily injections to their children to help them \nmake it through the day.\n  They argue that many diseases and chronic conditions--as I have \nmentioned before, diabetes, and also ALS, Parkinson's, spinal cord \ninjuries, many types of cancers--will be treated or even possibly cured \nwith stem cell research. Too many families are struggling to care for \nchildren with diabetes or watching elderly parents succumb to \nAlzheimer's disease, like my husband did, or like my grandmother, who \ndied of Parkinson's disease.\n  Too many Americans suffer from illnesses that make ordinary things \nsuch as daily household chores nearly impossible. As cochair of the \nSenate bipartisan Parkinson's Caucus, I receive letters and calls from \npeople all across our great Nation on how important stem cell research \nis to them, how important this legislation, this opportunity at this \ntime is to them and their families.\n  I have met many Michigan families dealing with chronic health issues \nevery single day. For example, a wonderful advocate and friend, Bob \nKullgren, from Grand Rapids, shared with me his daughter Kate's story.\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nWhen she was 12 years old, she was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. \nHer family took her for multiple visits to the hospital and injected \nher with insulin three to four times every single day. These routines \nonly helped to manage Kate's disease, not cure it.\n  As a teenager, Kate worked as a counselor at a camp for children with \ndiabetes. She watched as some of her fellow counselors began \nexperiencing the early stages of blindness caused by their juvenile \ndiabetes. I cannot imagine how terrifying it must be to begin to go \nblind when you should be thinking about going to the prom or graduating \nfrom high school. None of us wants that for our children.\n  Another bright young woman who has visited my office several times is \nJulielyn Gibbons. For over 12 years, Julielyn has lived with Crohn's \ndisease. It is a disease that causes intense abdominal pain. For her, \nstem cell research offers the promise of not only curing this lifelong \ndebilitating disease but also the hope of being able to live a normal \nlife. She e-mailed me:\n\n       I want to be able to bring children into the world knowing \n     that they will never have to suffer as I have, and that \n     possibility best exists through stem cell research.\n\n  S. 5, a strong bipartisan bill, is an important and, in fact, a \ncritical step forward toward giving Julielyn and Kate that hopeful \nfuture we all want for our children. S. 5 expands Federal financing of \nresearch on additional stem cell lines created from embryos freely \ndonated from in vitro fertilization clinics under strict ethical \nguidelines. These embryos are frozen and will likely be destroyed. \nThink about that. These are frozen embryos that will likely be thrown \nin the garbage can. They are being thrown away. Which is better: To \nhave the opportunity to use those cells, those precious cells to be \nable to create life, to create cures, or to see them thrown away? That \nis what is happening right now.\n  This bill also would authorize the National Institutes of Health to \nlook at other ways of creating new stem cell lines. This does not \npreclude other opportunities for research. In fact, this is a bill to \nmake it clear we want to use every possibility to save life, to be able \nto cure diseases, and that we will continue to see that is done with \nthe highest ethical standards, which is what is guaranteed under this \nlegislation.\n  The current administration's policy, frankly, is tying the hands of \nscientists and impeding their progress on treatments and cures for \ndiseases that families every day are waiting for. Sean Morrison, the \ndirector for the University of Michigan's Center for Stem Cell Biology, \ntold me the federally approved lines are of limited use because they \nare not genetically diverse enough to realize the full potential of \nthis research--so many more are needed. In other words, we don't have \nenough right now. We can't do what needs to be done, what families are \nasking for across this country.\n  While we look toward the future, we should remember those who have \npassed while we have had this debate as well. Every day the clock is \nticking on somebody who is ill. Every day the clock is ticking on \nsomebody with a fatal disease who could be helped in some way or cured \nif we were doing everything we could to provide the research and the \ncures and the treatments. What pains me the most is that some of the \nbrave advocates I have had the privilege to meet during my \ncongressional career are no longer here today. They are no longer here \nthis week to see this vote. Hopefully we will not have many more people \nwho will be seeing their lives deteriorate or lose their lives before \nwe are able to actually begin to do what needs to be done with this \nresearch.\n  It is for them and for all the families I have met that I will cast \nmy vote this week, a vote for life, for hope, for a bright future. I \nknow the cures won't come tomorrow, but they may never come if we do \nnot act now. I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on S. 5, and I \nurge the President of the United States to do what is right, to do what \nthe overwhelming majority of the American people are asking him to do \nand asking us to do, which is to say yes to lifesaving research, to say \nyes to that which will provide hope for a cure. I hope we will say yes \nin a very large margin to S. 5.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side in \nthis round?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 42 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n  I speak today in support of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct, offered by the majority leader, to whom we all owe a debt of \ngratitude for bringing this important bill to the floor. As a new \nMember of this body, as is the Presiding Officer, it also gives me \ngreat pride to express my appreciation for the leadership of Senator \nHarkin, Senator Specter, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Hatch, whose \nvoices over the years have placed us in the position to pass this \nlegislation, as I hope we will tomorrow.\n  I also wish to recognize the exceptional work and extraordinary \nleadership of my colleague and friend from Rhode Island, Congressman \nJim Langevin. Congressman Langevin has been both a State and national \nleader on this issue, championing the passage of H.R. 810 in last \nyear's Congress and of H.R. 3 in January, as well as playing an \nintegral role in Rhode Island's stem cell dialogue. Just today he was \nwith our Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts, as she issued her \nreport, ``Discovering Rhode Island's Stem Cell Future: Charting the \nCourse Toward Health and Prosperity.'' This report is an important step \ntoward developing a comprehensive statewide plan for stem cell research \ninitiatives in Rhode Island.\n  Congressman Langevin did not arrive at his position on stem cell \nresearch easily. He grappled, as we all do, with the ethical and \nscientific issues involved, meeting with a host of individuals and \ngroups spanning the ideological spectrum. After serious and heartfelt \nconsideration, he concluded, as have many of our Senate colleagues, \nthat a central part of his deeply held beliefs about life is a \ncommitment to those who are challenged by diabetes, by heart disease, \nby Alzheimer's, by Parkinson's, by spinal cord injury, by stroke, and \nby the myriad of diseases and conditions that stem cell research might \nhelp or even cure. I share this deep commitment to stem cell research \nand a sincere optimism about the hope it offers for so many lives.\n  I want to share the story of one of those lives. It is the story of \nLila Barber, a 12-year-old girl from Westerly, RI, who came to visit me \nhere in Washington 2 weeks ago. In 2005, Lila started experiencing pain \nin her leg. The pain got progressively worse over a 5-month period, \nuntil it was keeping her, and her parents, up all night. The Barbers \nbegan a medical journey, from doctor to doctor and test to test, only \nto be told that Lila had bursitis. As it turned out, Lila did not have \nbursitis; she had osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone tumor on her tibia \nbelow her knee.\n\n  Years ago, doctors would have had no option but to amputate Lila's \nleg. But reconstructive techniques have improved, and most limbs can \nnow be replaced with a metal and plastic artificial joint or a cadaver \nbone transplant. Fortunately, Dr. Richard Terek, an orthopedic surgeon \nspecializing in musculoskeletal oncology at Brown University, was able \nto save her leg using such a cadaver bone transplant, which preserves \nas much normal tissue as possible. In the year following Lila's \nsurgery, she was home-schooled as she underwent 16 rounds of \nchemotherapy. Lila's chances of long-term survival are now good--75 \npercent.\n  But even if Lila remains cancer free, she will face a painful and \nongoing medical struggle. Since the donor bone and cartilage are not \nliving, Lila's transplanted tibia will not grow as she does. Even \nworse, it will break down over time. This is a place where stem cell \nresearch could vastly improve care\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\nfor cancers like Lila's. In the short-term, stem cell research could \nallow surgeons to develop techniques to use Lila's own cells to \nbiologically and mechanically enhance bone tissue transfer. That is, \nLila's own stem cells could be used to repopulate the lost bone and \ncartilage. In the longer term, stem cell research might allow \nscientists to grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. One day, \nchildren with osteosarcoma and other bone tumors might receive new \nbones that actually grow with their bodies into adulthood. Such bone \ntissue enhancements would also be beneficial to individuals with \ninjuries from accidents, sports injuries, or just the wear and stress \nof age. This is just one area of promise in the broad landscape of hope \nstem cell research opens to Americans.\n  As for Lila, with frequent monitoring from Dr. Terek, and sporting a \nbright bandanna on her first days back to school in the seventh grade, \nshe is getting back to her old ways. She even attended the Nickelodeon \nKids' Choice Awards last weekend, a trip made possible by A Wish Come \nTrue, an organization in Rhode Island that grants wishes to children \nwith life-threatening and dangerous illnesses.\n  For the Barber family, their greatest wish is for Lila's good health. \nStem cell research holds the promise of making that wish, and millions \nof wishes like the Barbers', come true. Let us throw off the \nideological shackles constraining our progress imposed by the bleak and \nbenighted policies of the Bush administration. Let us all support S. 5 \nand embrace the promise for life and health and hope and cure that \nthese discoveries present to mankind.\n  I thank the majority leader for sponsoring this vital legislation. I \nthank the Senator from Iowa for his leadership on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am glad to yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from Iowa \nfor yielding time to me.\n  As a longtime supporter of stem cell research, I am pleased the \nSenate is once again taking up the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. \nI am very proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan bill. It will \nexpand the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally \nfunded research, enabling scientists to take full advantage of the \nscientific and medical opportunities provided by stem cells. At the \nsame time, the bill establishes clear standards to ensure this research \nis conducted ethically.\n  The promise of embryonic stem cell lines lies in their potential to \ndevelop into virtually any cell, tissue, or organ in the body. As a \nconsequence, this research holds tremendous potential to treat, and \nperhaps even cure, a vast array of diseases and conditions. Researchers \ncould, for example, potentially generate insulin-producing islet cells \nfor patients with juvenile diabetes; neurons to treat Parkinson's \ndisease, ALS, and Alzheimer's, as well as bone marrow cells to treat \ncancer. It is estimated that more than 100 million Americans are \nafflicted by diseases or disabilities that have the potential to be \ntreated through this promising research.\n  I have heard some of our colleagues today, in arguing against this \nbill, say that the promise won't be fulfilled, that it is overblown, \nand that it is raising false hopes. We cannot say for certain what \navenue of scientific research is necessarily going to produce the \nresults all of us hope for, but surely it makes no sense to cut off a \npromising source of research that could benefit from Federal funds. I, \nfor one, am very optimistic about the potential. There are no \nguarantees. There are no guarantees with any scientific research, but \ncertainly the promise is there. It would be foolhardy for us to \ncontinue to restrict this research, to place artificial barriers in the \nway of research that offers such hope and such promise to so many \nAmerican families.\n  In August of 2001, President Bush announced that Federal funds could, \nfor the first time, be used to support research on embryonic stem \ncells. But that research, under the President's Executive order, was \nlimited to existing stem cell lines that were created prior to 9 p.m. \non that day.\n  In the 5\\1/2\\ years since the President made that announcement, this \nstem cell policy has fallen far short of its original goals. While the \nHuman Embryonic Stem Cell Registry at the NIH lists 78 stem cell lines, \nat best, no more than 22 lines will ever be available for research \nunder the current policy. Moreover, as Dr. John Gearhart of Johns \nHopkins University told the Special Committee on Aging last year, \nexisting lines are ``contaminated with animal cells, lack genetic \ndiversity, are not disease-specific, and are not adequate for \nresearchers to apply to a wide variety of diseases.'' Limiting \nresearchers to these lines, therefore, places huge and unnecessary \nroadblocks in the way of possible treatments and cures for a wide range \nof devastating diseases.\n  We have learned a lot about stem cells since 2001. For example, \nscientists have now created methods for growing stem cell lines that \nare free of animal cells, thus greatly improving their potential for \ntreating and curing disease. They have also created disease-specific \nstem cell lines. Under the current Federal policy, however, these new \nand improved stem cell lines are not available to federally funded \nresearchers in the United States. It is time for us to update our stem \ncell policy to reflect what we have learned so that we can accelerate \nthis important research.\n  The legislation before us lifts the current restriction so that stem \ncell lines are eligible for federally funded research, regardless of \nthe date on which they are created. Federal funding, however, would \ncontinue to be restricted to stem cells derived from embryos originally \ncreated for fertility treatments that are in excess of the clinical \nneed and that otherwise would be discarded. That is the issue before \nus. Are we going to use these stem cells--these cell clusters which \notherwise would be thrown away--for what could be lifesaving and life-\nenhancing research? That is the issue.\n  The legislation has other important safeguards that require informed \nconsent of the donors, and it prohibits any financial inducement to \ndonate. Finally, the bill calls upon the NIH to develop strict \nguidelines to ensure that researchers adhere to clear ethical and moral \nstandards.\n  As the founder and the cochair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I am \nparticularly excited about the promise stem cell research holds for an \nultimate cure for diabetes. Early research has shown that stem cells \nhave the potential to develop into insulin-producing cells to replace \nthose which have been destroyed in individuals suffering from type 1 \ndiabetes.\n  During the last Congress, I chaired a hearing in conjunction with the \nJuvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Children's Congress to examine \nthe devastating impact juvenile diabetes has had on too many American \nchildren and their families. We heard heartbreaking testimony from \nchildren who traveled here to tell us what it is like to live with \njuvenile diabetes, just how serious it is, and how important it is that \nwe fund the research necessary to find a cure.\n  One of those was a constituent of mine from Falmouth, ME, Steffi \nRothweiler. She told the committee that she could not remember having a \nnormal life without diabetes. She described her parents, who have given \nup a full night's sleep and their weekends, on guard every hour of \nevery day to make sure Steffi's diabetes is controlled as tightly as \npossible so that she can stay as healthy as possible. Steffi asks that \nwe do all we can to find a cure for diabetes as quickly as possible. We \nsimply cannot ignore the potential embryonic stem cell research holds \nfor children like Steffi.\n  I am sensitive to the ethical concerns raised by opponents of this \nresearch. But I wish to emphasize once again that the cell clusters \nwhich will be used for this research would otherwise be discarded. In \nmy view, the ethical choice is to use them for research that may \nbenefit millions of Americans rather than just discard them as medical \nwaste.\n  Moreover, what is often ignored in this debate is that embryonic stem \ncell research is now occurring in the private sector and in other \ncountries outside the purview of the NIH. Therefore,\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\nif we could extend these ethical guidelines that routinely accompany \nfederally funded research, all of us should be for that as a goal.\n  I wish to quote testimony from Dr. Allen Spiegel, who was, at the \ntime, Director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and \nKidney Diseases. He made that very point at our 2005 hearing on \njuvenile diabetes. He testified that, while NIH routinely worked very \nclosely with the private sector, in the area of stem cell research, \n``there is a wall.'' By expanding our current stem cell policy, we can \ntear down that wall, allowing for more research but ensuring that it is \nconducted with clear ethical standards.\n  Now, the other argument we always hear is that we don't need to have \nthis kind of stem cell research because adult stem cells derived from \ntissue, such as bone marrow, are a sufficient replacement for embryonic \nstem cells in forwarding this important research.\n  The fact is, both are promising. But, again, as Dr. Spiegel testified \nat the hearing that I chaired with regard to diabetes research:\n\n       We need to do embryonic stem cell first because it can give \n     us a better understanding of what causes type 1 diabetes . . \n     . because it will actually inform our ability to work with \n     adult stem cells . . . and finally, because, and one cannot \n     guarantee or promise this, the embryonic stem cells \n     themselves, if successfully turned into insulin-secreting \n     beta cells, could be the source of cell therapy.\n\n  That is the testimony from the experts.\n  It would be tragic not to take advantage of this opportunity to \naccelerate research that can potentially help millions of people \nsuffering from devastating illnesses. I urge our colleagues to join in \nvoting for this important legislation.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for yielding me time. This is legislation \nthat truly can make a difference to the lives and well-being of so many \nAmerican families.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nvery eloquent statement regarding this bill. The Senator is right on \nthe mark in talking about the ethical--if I can get her attention for a \nsecond--part of this issue.\n  As the Senator knows, in S. 5, we have very strict ethical \nguidelines. One, the only embryos that can be used are those slated to \nbe discarded anyway from our IVF clinics. Secondly, there has to be \nwritten informed consent by the donors. And, third, there cannot be any \nmonetary or other kinds of inducements at all to the donors of these \nembryos. Those guidelines are actually stricter than what is in law \nright now. As the Senator knows, we have these strict guidelines.\n  The other point the Senator brought up, if she has a minute for me to \nexplore this point with her a bit, is that we have in vitro \nfertilization clinics. My information is that last year about 50,000 \nbabies were born by IVF. I have friends of mine who had children thanks \nto IVF; otherwise, they would never have had children. Obviously, there \nare some embryos left over. They would like to be able to donate those \nfor embryonic stem cell research because they are not going to have any \nmore children.\n  So it seems to me the ethics question is, are we just going to \ndiscard them as hospital waste, which is done every day, or would it be \nmore ethical to say let's use those with the strict guidelines we have \nto save lives, to make life better, to ease suffering and pain?\n  The Senator from Maine put her finger on it. That, to me, is the \nethical way, I would think. What our bill is trying to do is to let \nthose donors of those embryos say, yes, do this. You can do that, and \nuse that for research. I thank the Senator from Maine for her \ncontribution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for just a \nmoment so I can respond to the excellent points that he made, first, I \ncommend Senator Harkin, Senator Specter, and others who have worked on \nthis bill for including those clear safeguards. This isn't a case where \nanyone is going to be selling the left over, unused embryos from in \nvitro fertilization. In fact, the bill appropriately prohibits any \nfinancial inducement, any sort of money changing hands. So that is an \nimportant safeguard.\n  But the Senator put his finger on what I think is the primary ethical \nchoice. The left over cell clusters are going to be discarded. They are \ngoing to be discarded. They are discarded every day, every month, every \nyear as medical waste. How much more enhancing it would be to use them \nfor research that could save lives, that could prolong lives, that \ncould improve the quality of life for someone suffering from juvenile \ndiabetes or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's or other devastating diseases.\n  I believe this bill is a very ethical bill that will help move us \nforward in the search for better treatments, for better diagnoses, and \nsomeday a cure. I cannot believe that we would cut off such promising \nresearch when we know it can be done in an ethical way.\n  I applaud the Senator for his leadership in this area. I hope we will \nproceed to a very strong bipartisan vote in support of legislation that \nmeans so much to the American family.\n  We do a lot of debate on this Senate floor, but it is rare that we \nhave a debate on an issue that touches so many Americans personally. \nAll of us have family members who have suffered from these devastating \ndiseases, and this offers--does not promise--but offers the potential \nfor research that could really make a difference.\n  I thank the Senator. I am very happy to join him in this effort.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine. How much \ntime does our side have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take a couple more minutes to \nexpand on this point.\n  I mentioned this morning, if you are faced with a situation where \nembryos are going to be discarded and destroyed totally or these \nembryos could be donated for embryonic stem cell research and \npropagated and given life and then proceed to give life to others, is \nthat not the better ethical choice? In other words, what I am saying \nis, when you discard an embryo from an IVF clinic now as hospital \nwaste, that is destroyed. But if you take an embryo and take out of the \nembryo the 100 or 200 cells in it, extract them, the embryo itself is \nnot an embryo any longer, but the cells are still alive. They are still \nalive. They propagate, they grow, they become stem cells that we \nalready know--we have already done that--develop into nerve cells, bone \ncells, heart muscle tissue, motor neurons. They already know that.\n  On the one hand, you are really destroying the embryos, and on the \nother hand, you are taking the embryos, you are changing them into \nsomething else that propagates life and that actually could be--we \ndon't know, as the Senator said, we don't know the end result but could \nactually enhance and make life better for many people. It seems to me \nthis is the more ethical way to go.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Harkin for his \nleadership on this issue and Senator Collins and those who have been \nresponsible in bringing forward S. 5 for us to have an opportunity to \nvote for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.\n  I join my colleagues. Rarely do we have an opportunity in this body \nto cast a vote that literally offers hope to over 100 million people in \nthis country. We all have constituents who are suffering from \nParkinson's or Alzheimer's disease or juvenile diabetes or ALS or \nspinal cord injury and other illnesses and injuries that very much the \nstem cell research offers hope that we will be able to make \nadvancements to improve quality of life.\n  But there is more involved here than just the health and lives of \nAmericans. We also are talking about the United States and its \npreeminence internationally in medical research. We have led the world \nin medical research in this country. People from all over the world \ncome to America to get their health care needs met and to train their \nhealth care professionals.\n  We have been on the cutting edge. In my own State of Maryland, we \nhave the NIH, we have the Naval Medical Center at Bethesda, we have \nJohns\n\n[[Page S4267]]\n\nHopkins University, the University of Maryland Medical Center--all on \nthe leading edge of research technology.\n  S. 5 will help us maintain our preeminence in medical research, as \nwell as help millions of people as we make advancements in medical \nresearch.\n  Let's review quickly the current status of embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  It offers tremendous promise, we all know that. We all know embryonic \nstem cells hold the greatest promise for being able to regenerate parts \nof our organs and bodies that will allow us to deal with horrible \ndiseases and injuries.\n  On August 9, 2001, the President's Executive order restricted \nembryonic stem cell research. If we could go back to 2001 and look at \nthe situation in 2001, there were many who thought maybe that would be \nadequate at that time. We didn't know a lot about embryonic stem cell \nresearch back in 2001. NIH at that time had predicted, I remind my \ncolleagues, that there were 60 to 78 stem cell lines that would be \navailable under the President's Executive order, when in reality there \nwere only 22, and some have been contaminated with mouse feeder cells.\n  We lack the genetic diversity necessary to perform research today on \nembryonic stem cells, and the most vulnerable groups are minorities \nbecause they are disproportionately affected by the lack of diversity \nin the stem cells that are available.\n  What is affected? Research dollars are not being made available. \nMoney is not coming forward to deal with the most promising forms of \nresearch in our Nation. The role of the United States in medical \nresearch is being jeopardized. We are actually losing our best \nresearchers to other countries which don't have these unreasonable \nrestrictions.\n  I think the argument can best be made not by researchers, not by \nlegislators, but by listening to some of our constituents.\n  I had the opportunity to have Josh Basile as an intern in my office. \nThree years before he was an intern in my office, he was a healthy \nyoung person leading a very healthy, very active life--a tennis player \nand doing all those things that a person his age would do. But then he \nwas on the beaches off the Atlantic, and a wave caught him and he \nbecame a quadriplegic overnight. He is determined he is going to walk \nagain. He is determined he is going to make progress. In fact, he is \nmaking progress. He is rehabilitating himself the best he possibly can. \nHe has brought back motion where people thought it was impossible for \nmotion to come back because he is determined. He is keeping his body \nready, but he is asking us to do our share to allow the medical \nresearchers to have the tools necessary to help him so one day he can \nwalk.\n  One of my closest friends--my closest friend in law school--Larry \nKatz, when he was a very active attorney in Baltimore, was diagnosed \nwith ALS. I watched him as his body left him and he died a very \ndifficult death.\n  Any of us who have experienced these types of life circumstances know \nthat we have a responsibility to do everything we can to make sure that \nour scientists have the appropriate tools to do the research to bring \nabout the answers to provide the resources, the money, and the \nappropriate scientific methods in order to unlock the mysteries of so \nmany diseases.\n  Stem cell research offers tremendous promise. The work being done at \nthe University of Maryland Medical Center and the work being done at \nJohns Hopkins in my community--Dr. John Gearhart and Dr. Douglas Kerr, \nI met with these scientists frequently to try to get a better \nunderstanding about this. I am not a scientist. I don't know all the \ntechnicalities, but I have had a chance to meet with these scientists \nand see what they are doing and learn firsthand the promise that \nembryonic stem cell research holds out to all of us. They have been \nable to implant embryonic stem cell growth in mice and see movement \nwhere there was no movement before. It holds out such great promise.\n  We can do better and we have to allow our scientists the ability to \ndo that. Let me quote from one other Marylander, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, \nwho is the Director of the National Institutes of Health and a resident \nof Baltimore. Last month, he reiterated his support for lifting the \ncurrent ban, stating that:\n\n       From my standpoint, it is clear today that American science \n     will be better served and the Nation will be better served if \n     we let our scientists have access to more stem cell lines.\n\n  There is a lot of fact and a lot of fiction out there as to what this \nmeans and what this bill does, what exactly the restrictions are under \ncurrent law. There are some who argue that this legislation will \nencourage the creation of in vitro fertilization for research. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. The only lines that are available are \nthose that are currently in existence. As my colleagues have repeated \nover and over on this floor, those who claim that this will divert the \ncell from its original purpose for implantation are wrong. The facts \nare that these embryos would be otherwise discarded.\n  Those who say we have to protect against abuse, read the language of \nthe bill. The bill requires the donor's consent, and it can't be with \ncompensation. It provides guidelines for the ethically sound use of \nembryonic stem cell research.\n  In June of 2001, 2 months before President Bush issued his stem cell \npolicy, Sue Stamos and her daughter Faith came to visit me in my House \noffice. At the time, Faith was 3 years old, a very brave little girl \nwho had been diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. She asked me for my \nsupport for Federal research to help find a cure for Faith, and I \npromised back then I would do everything I could to help the Stamos \nfamily.\n  Back in 2001, our knowledge of stem cell research was nowhere near \nwhat it is today. We didn't know what promise it held at that time. \nToday, 6 years later, we have a much broader and deeper knowledge about \nthe scientific possibilities of stem cells but much less capacity to \nresearch stem cell lines than we had anticipated.\n  Last year, I voted to keep my promise to Sue and Faith Stamos and to \nthe thousands of other Marylanders who are waiting for cures. Today, \nagain for Faith and Josh and thousands of other Marylanders, I will \nvote to expand the stem cell lines available for federally funded \nresearch. I hope my colleagues will join in sending a message to \nAmericans that this Congress will not stand in the way of medical \nprogress through the proper use of embryonic stem cell research.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and with that, Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of many of the speeches that have been made this afternoon, \nparticularly when Senator Collins of Maine a little while ago talked \nabout whether we should decide--``we'' meaning Members of the Senate--\nwhat the promise of embryonic stem cell research is. We can't. We are \nnot scientists. Mr. Coburn certainly would qualify as a medical doctor, \nbut there are no scientists here of the eminence of people doing this \ncritical work.\n  Ms. Collins made a very good point, and the point I would like to \nreiterate from the presentation I made this morning is that there is \nnobody here arguing against furthering science and furthering embryonic \nstem cell research. The question is which route we take.\n  The proposal in S. 30, which Senator Coleman and myself have brought \nforward, is an affirmation of the need to expand embryonic stem cell \nresearch. It is an affirmation that there is a way to do it. In the \ncourse of the last couple of years, we have discovered a lot of new, \ninteresting, and dynamic things, most important of which is that 5 of \nthe 21 lines that exist right now, under the grandfather clause the \nPresident issued in August of 2001, are lines derived not from the \ndestruction of a live embryo or an implantable embryo but from a \nnaturally dead embryo.\n  Let me briefly but succinctly go back to that definition. It is very \nmuch the same as a clinically dead person with an irreversible \ncessation of brain waves but the rest of their body still lives on life \nsupport so that they are able to donate, through a medical power of \nattorney, their organs to be transplanted and which can then save a \nhuman life. It is the same medical principle, where with that \ndetermination of death, although there is still life in the body,\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\nthat individual is able, through their grant, to donate their organs in \norder to save another life.\n\n  This is the same principle in terms of naturally dead embryos. \nEmbryos developed for in vitro fertilization, after 3 days, are \nimplantable viable embryos. In 4 additional days, additional embryos \nare created with the cell mass necessary to become a viable fetus and \nultimately a human being. But after the seventh day, which is called \nlevel III, or the Gardner III principle, the embryonic stem cell \nembryos are clinically dead, although cells within the embryo are \nalive. That is the same principle as an organ donation from an \nindividual who suffers from an irreversible cessation of brain waves.\n  S. 30, which I stand on the floor today to promote and commend to the \nMembers of the Senate, does exactly and precisely what most of the \nMembers of this body want to do, and that is further the NIH investment \nin embryonic stem cell research. As I said this morning, three of those \nlines happen to exist in the State of Georgia. Three lines currently \nunder the grandfather clause issued by the President's Executive order \nin August of 2001, three lines that currently are continuing to be \nfunded by the National Institutes of Health, three lines that are \ncontributing to the breakthrough or hopefully the steps of the \nbreakthroughs, in terms of any number of cures, but in particular those \nof diabetes and those of spinal column injury.\n  By adopting S. 30, sending it to the House and the House adopting it, \nand the President having said he will sign it, then we know we can \nbreak through this logjam and we can create additional lines for \nembryonic stem cell research and exponentially bring forward the public \ninformation that is so necessary in the research and medical community. \nBecause the critical benefit the National Institutes of Health \ninvestment makes is it makes the discoveries come into the public \ndomain because the NIH is a public entity and it is the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  So I would submit that S. 30 is the right way to enhance what most, \nif not all, here want to do and that is to enhance the cure of dread \ndiseases, the breakthroughs necessary to solve any number of problems, \nand do so in a way that clearly respects the viability of an embryo by \nselecting those lines only from embryos that are clinically dead. You \nare then not destroying what could become a viable human being, but you \nare adding to and furthering embryonic stem cell research in the same \nway that 5 of the existing 21 lines currently being researched are \nbeing brought forward.\n  I wish to read one paragraph from Dr. Edward Ferdin, who wrote on the \nLandry and Zucker report on this very subject, and I quote:\n\n       Dr. Landry points out a similar standard is invoked at the \n     end of life--meaning this dead embryo standard--in the use of \n     neurological criteria for the determination of death. When \n     the integrative unit of the body ceases because of the loss \n     of brain wave, a patient is declared dead even though the \n     individual cells and tissues of the body may continue to \n     function for some period of time. In the absence of the \n     brain, there is no longer a person presently within the body. \n     The fact that individual cells, tissues, and organs in the \n     brain-dead body continue to live is what enables transplant \n     surgeons to save thousands of lives each year through organ \n     donation.\n\n  The same could be true if we were to make the same use of cells of \ndeceased embryos in pursuit of the cures for degenerative diseases and \nfurther the advancement of embryonic stem cell research.\n  I see my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, has come to the floor \nto speak, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me begin by expressing my heartfelt \nappreciation to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Coleman, for working diligently, creatively, and in \na very determined way to try to solve a problem that has previously \nexisted in this area that has made it difficult, if not impossible, for \nsome of us to support the expansion of embryonic stem cell research \nbecause we were concerned that a very important moral line would be \ncrossed.\n  I, for one, strongly support medical research, development, and \ninnovation to combat disease and develop effective treatments to \nimprove the quality of health for all Americans, and I am sure we all \nfeel the same way. During the 109th Congress, I was proud to support \nlegislation that promoted expansion of stem cell research without \nharming or destroying human embryos, and today I am proud to join \nSenators Coleman and Isakson in cosponsoring the HOPE Act, the Hope \nOffered Through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research bill.\n  This HOPE Act advances stem cell research, while respecting life and \nfocusing on cures by allowing the Secretary of the Department of Health \nand Human Services to establish guidelines for research on embryos that \nhave died from natural causes. The bill directs HHS, Health and Human \nServices, to prioritize research likely to produce the greatest results \nin the near term, and authorizes Federal funding for research only if \nsuch lines have been derived in such a manner that it does not harm or \nkill a living human embryo. Finally, it directs the Institute of \nMedicine to conduct a study to delve further into the possibilities of \namniotic and placental cell bank programs, areas which I understand \nfrom my reading have a lot of promise.\n\n  I am also encouraged by the scientific advances made in the roughly \n$3 billion of Federal money put into stem cell research since about \n2001 that have created real advances in adult and cord blood stem cell \nresearch, and I strongly support efforts to build upon these promising \ntherapies which are already being used in medical treatments for a \nvariety of reasons. Current Federal stem cell policy funds research \nusing established embryonic stem cell lines, thus taxpayers are not \nforced to support research that would require the use and destruction \nof human embryos at the earliest stage of development.\n  It is essential to note that there is no law that prohibits embryonic \nstem cell research in this country. I think, unfortunately, this has \nbeen misportrayed and misunderstood in many quarters. In fact, this \nadministration is the first one to support federally funded embryonic \nstem cell research within parameters. But the issue before us is solely \nan issue of whether American taxpayers will be forced to fund research \nthat many of them oppose on fundamental moral grounds. It creates a \nslippery slope when human life is sacrificed for medical \nexperimentation.\n  The current Federal policy does not forbid others from conducting \nsuch research on lines other than those approved by the President, \nprovided it is funded from sources other than the Federal taxpayer. \nThere are States, I think notably California and others, that have \nvoted to spend their own taxpayers' money for that purpose but not the \nFederal taxpayers' money.\n  Adult stem cells--and this is again one of those areas where, when \nyou mix science and politics, I fear always the science suffers--and \nthis is part of the good news of this research, this $3 billion \ninvested in stem cell research since 2001--the good news is that adult \nstem cells are treating real patients who suffer from more than 70 \ndifferent diseases and disorders right now.\n  I think many people would be surprised to learn that embryonic stem \ncells have had few modest successes in animal trials and so far have \nproduced zero treatments for human beings. I think many people would be \nsurprised because of the overhyped and oversold story about embryonic \nstem cell research. I think our job ought to be to try to come up with \na reasoned piece of legislation based on the facts, not based on hype. \nI think that is what Senator Isakson and Senator Coleman have done.\n  All of us have deep sympathy for parents, for children, for families \nwho continue to struggle with painful, serious diseases. I continue to \nstudy this issue with great care. I remember every year the parents of \nchildren who suffer juvenile diabetes coming to my office along with \ntheir children. It really tugs at your heartstrings to see these \nparents wanting their children to be cured from this terrible disease. \nWe all hope and pray that someday they will be.\n  I have been encouraged by recent reports from America's scientific \ncommunity which revealed that great potential exists for obtaining \nembryonic-like stem cells without creating and then harming human life. \nAt the beginning of this month there were 1,373 publicly available \nclinical trials related to adult stem cells--1,373 publicly\n\n[[Page S4269]]\n\navailable clinical trials related to adult stem cells--including 671 \nthat are currently recruiting patients.\n  In my State of Texas, for example, 93 adult stem cell clinical trials \nare currently being conducted on everything from brain injuries to \ndifferent forms of cancer to heart disease.\n  I am proud to say that medical research in my State has been at the \nforefront of the adult stem cell research field. For example, the Texas \nHeart Institute reported evidence of the effectiveness of treating \ncongestive heart disease with the patient's own stem cells. Heart \ndisease, as we all know, is the No. 1 killer in the United States. Yet \nthe researchers at the Texas Heart Institute are finding that adult \nstem cells injected directly into the heart are not only improving \nblood flow and blood vessel formation, but they are even growing new \nheart tissue.\n  Another clinical trial in Texas, started this last year at the \nUniversity of Texas Medical School at Houston and Memorial Hermann \nChildren's Hospital, is among the first to apply adult stem cells to \ntreat traumatic brain injury. The researchers in this trial are using \nchildren's own bone marrow stem cells to treat brain trauma. This is an \nespecially important area to see adult stem cell research branching out \ninto because of the devastating effect that brain injuries have had on \nsurvivors' lives.\n  These trials and others like them are bringing us new treatments all \nthe time for real patients right now. I will continue to support the \nexpansion of research that may lead to the improved treatment of \ndisease without compelling taxpayers to fund destruction of human \nembryos, a procedure that many find morally objectionable.\n  Let me say in conclusion, again, how much I appreciate the creativity \nand determination of my two colleagues who have led the effort on this \nimportant legislation. I am proud to cosponsor it, proud to support it. \nI think generations yet unknown will continue to benefit from the kind \nof medical research that we will approve if we pass this bill and when \nit is signed by the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom the American Medical Association dated April 10, 2007, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     American Medical Association,\n                                      Chicago, IL, April 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: As Congress considers stem cell \n     legislation, the American Medical Association (AMA) believes \n     that it is important that any such legislation follow certain \n     research and medical practice guidelines.\n       In general, the AMA supports federal funding of biomedical \n     research which promises significant and scientific benefits. \n     More specifically, we--\n       support biomedical research on multipotent stem cells \n     (including adult and cord blood stem cells);\n       encourage strong public support of federal funding for \n     research involving human pluripotent stem cells (embryonic); \n     and\n       encourage continued research into the scientific issues \n     surrounding the use of umbilical cord blood-derived \n     hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation.\n       Further, AMA research policy supports certain ethical \n     considerations, including donor anonymity, non-coercion of \n     donors, absence of financial inducement and written informed \n     consent of the donor regarding the nature and scope of the \n     research involved. The AMA advocates these guidelines to \n     ensure appropriate and ethical stem cell research, with the \n     hope that continued stem cell research may lead to potential \n     cures and therapies for those suffering from many devastating \n     diseases.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Michael D. Maves, MD, MBA,\n                                    Executive Vice President, CEO.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I would like to address that for a second. This is a \nletter that does not endorse a particular bill, but it lays out the \nAMA's support for embryonic stem cell research. I want to make a couple \nof affirmations quickly, if I can.\n  It says:\n\n       In general, the AMA supports Federal funding of biomedical \n     research which promises significant scientific benefits. More \n     specifically we, support biomedical research on multipotent \n     stem cells, (including adult and cord blood stem cells); \n     encourage strong public support of federal funding for \n     research involving human pluripotent stem cells (embryonic); \n     and, encourage continued research into scientific issues \n     surrounding the use of umbilical cord blood-derived \n     hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation.\n       Further, AMA research policy supports certain ethical \n     considerations, including donor anonymity, non-coercion of \n     donors, absence of financial inducement and written informed \n     consent of the donor regarding the nature and the scope of \n     the research involved.\n\n  S. 30, the Coleman-Isakson bill, contains exactly each and every one \nof those items laid out by the American Medical Association.\n  I might further add, unlike any other legislation, it does not pick a \nfavorite, but it encourages NIE to make investments in all research \nthat has the most imminent promise in terms of benefiting the lives of \nindividuals.\n  So you heard people talking about embryonic, you heard people talking \nabout adult, you heard people talking about cord blood. The Coleman-\nIsakson bill recognizes the value of all and leaves to the scientists \nat NIH the prioritization of those investments but ensures those \ninvestments are made in the furtherance of the research, just exactly \nas indicated in the letter from the AMA.\n  I see my colleague from Minnesota, Mr. Coleman, is on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I yield to Senator Coleman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his \nleadership and the opportunity to work together on something that I \nhope is a unifying force for this body. Let's agree where we can agree. \nI think that is what S. 30 offers.\n  I listened to the debate on S. 5. I see my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Iowa. I do not know if there is a greater champion in the Senate \nthan the Senator from Iowa when it comes to supporting the rights of \nindividuals with disabilities. I worked on disability discrimination \nwhen I graduated law school 30 years ago. One of my heroes in this \nregard has always been the Senator from Iowa.\n  Coauthor of S. 5 is my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch. I don't \nknow if there is a man of greater moral integrity in this body than \nOrrin Hatch. He is an extraordinary man. He and I have had long \nconversations about this bill. Good people disagree.\n  For some of us there is that moral line that says we cannot support \nFederal funding for the destruction of a human embryo. It is a line \nthat a number of people cannot cross. So what happens is, if we have a \nconcern of just having S. 5--and there is a battle that is being waged \nthere. Again, it will pass. It will pass in this body and pass in the \nHouse. Then the reality is it will be vetoed. There will not be enough \nvotes to override the veto. So in the end, those with good intentions \nwho want to move science forward are not going to be able to do that.\n  This message to those who are suffering from ALS and suffering from \njuvenile diabetes--the research is not going to be moved forward at \nall.\n  A number of my colleagues have put forth S. 30 as an opportunity. Dr. \nHurlbut said: We offer one small island of unity in a sea of \ncontroversy, a place we can come together and promote the opportunity \nand support pluripotent stem cell research, research that has the \nability to provide the kind of flexible cell material that offers great \nhope. Again, hope; it offers great hope.\n  The good news is research is going forward in this area. This \nresearch offers an opportunity, not just in the area of stem cell \nresearch, but if you talk to some of the scientists, science itself is \ngoing to be opened, perhaps, to other advancements. We are going to \nlearn more about stem cells just from doing this research.\n  I have a chart that lays out what ANT is. This is just one of the \noptions under S. 30. S. 30 would provide Federal funding for research \nthat does not involve the destruction of an embryo. Some of it is dead \nembryo research. This is ANT. Under the natural process you have a \nfertilized egg, the egg and sperm, the fertilized egg that becomes an \nembryo.\n  SCNT, as I understand it, is the way we got Dolly the sheep. We have \na somatic cell from an adult. It was an animal--or it could be from a \nhuman. You put that cellular material, which has all the DNA, all that \nprogram in the enucleated egg, the egg gets fertilized, and you get an \nembryo.\n\n[[Page S4270]]\n\n  What ANT does, and the type of research, among a number of options--\nthere are some thoughts you could reprogram these cells. You could do a \nrange of things, but what you are doing is altering the cell nucleus. \nIt is kind of a key in there, something that unlocks the cell. If you \ntake it out--I think it is CDX2, but I am not a scientist. But what you \nessentially do if you take that out before you transfer into this \nenucleated egg, before you put this genetic material with all the DNA \nand everything in there, in the end what you are going to get is an \ninner cell mass with all the ability to produce the pluripotent cells \nthat you would get, but there is no embryo, and it doesn't cross the \nmoral line.\n  The opportunity for this Congress, in a bipartisan way, to support \nthis kind of research is a positive thing.\n  I see my colleague from Missouri. I have some other comments, but I \nbelieve we have some time, and I will use that time later.\n  I want to reiterate that I hope my colleagues who support S. 5--we \nsimply have disagreement over crossing that line--I hope they can come \nwith us and support S. 30.\n  My concern is about the House. Last year this body passed a bill \nsimilar to S. 5. It also passed the Specter-Santorum bill, which \nprovided, by the way, a number of alternative means of producing cells. \nSome of those, by the way, are included in S. 5. But, again, S. 5 will \nnot become law.\n  If you want alternative ways to go forward, you have to support S. \n30. The House killed the Specter-Santorum bill. Their approach was, \nthey wanted to have 100 percent of nothing--no alternative ways if they \ndidn't get exactly what they wanted in their bill that was similar to \nS. 5.\n  I hope my colleagues who are looking to provide hope will understand \nthere is a path to move the science forward. There is a path for \nfunding. There is a path to set up, as we have in S. 30, a stem cell \nbank, a bank of amniotic and placental stem cells. I hope our \ncolleagues in the House do not do a repeat of what happened last year \nin which an effort to support alternative means was destroyed because \nthey did not get their way in their version of S. 5.\n\n  This is an opportunity to come together. It is not a whole package. \nIt is not everything. It is not all the research that will come forward \nin S. 5 because for some of us, there is a line that we should not \ncross. But I think all of us can agree we want to support alternative \nmeans. We want to support dead embryo research, ANT, reprogramming, and \ncreate the opportunity to have more research being done next year than \nis being done this year.\n  That is the promise. That is the hope that S. 30 offers.\n  With that, I see my colleague from Missouri. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                              Iraq Funding\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is a very important debate, but I have \nanother very important subject that I need to bring to the attention of \nthis body. First and foremost, as I address this body, Congress has yet \nto take the necessary steps to approve emergency funding for our troops \nserving in a war zone. While I applaud the steps taken by the \nleadership of the Senate to appoint conferees moments after passing the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, Speaker Pelosi and the House \nleadership have been too busy conducting foreign policy to appoint \nconferees.\n  I am here. We are ready--I, along with a number of my colleagues--to \nget to work and get the funds where they are needed. As I said time and \ntime again on the Senate floor, our generals and military commanders \nare in the best position and are best suited to know the needs of our \nforces. When they tell us they need the funds urgently, I do not \nbelieve they are leaving much room for interpretation.\n  General Schoomaker, Army Chief of Staff--a no-nonsense operator--\nsaid:\n\n       Without approval of the supplemental funds in April, we \n     will be forced to take increasingly draconian measures which \n     will impact Army readiness and impose hardships on our \n     soldiers and their families.\n\n  Secretary Gates, whom war critics and opponents alike embraced this \nstraight-talking, candid Secretary of Defense, said:\n\n       This kind of disruption to key programs will have a \n     genuinely adverse effect on the readiness of the Army and the \n     quality of life for soldiers and families.\n\n  In addition, this, too, would degrade the already perilous State of \nthe National Guard's home front mission to support civil authorities. \nWe are told that 88 percent of the Guard units at home are not equipped \nto respond to natural disasters or a potential terrorist attack.\n  That is why I was proud to support, with my friend and National Guard \nCaucus cochairman, Senator Leahy, inclusion of a billion dollars in the \nsupplemental for Guard equipment.\n  The most significant and important constitutional role this Congress \nis supposed to be undertaking is exercising its power over the purse. \nYet, ironically and most detrimentally to our troops, that one \nparamount duty seems to be the last one on the to-do list of some in \nCongress. Instead, the retreat-and-defeat crowd has sought to \nmicromanage the war from 8,000 miles away, setting timetables and \nprescribing troop movements. This same message will discourage our \nallies, who are beginning to help, obviously, our troops, and only \nencourage our enemies.\n  The recent action taken by the retreat-and-defeat crowd would suggest \nthey are vested in defeat in order to achieve the goals of the far left \nwing of the Democratic Party where Michael Moore, George Soros, and \nothers who support their party with tens of millions of dollars for \n527s will do anything to undermine President Bush, even if it means \nlosing the war that radical Islam and al-Qaida have declared on us.\n  As we have seen in recent weeks since the implementation of General \nPetraeus' plan, there is movement in the right direction. It cannot be \nchanged overnight and nobody should expect an immediate turnaround, but \nit is the best hope we have. Senator McCain, who just returned from \nIraq, reports that Sunni sheiks in Anbar are now fighting al-Qaida, \nmore than 50 joint United States-Iraqi stations have been established \nin Baghdad, Muqtada al-Sadr has felt the heat, and his followers \noverall are not contesting them. Finally, Senator McCain observed that \nIraqi Army and police forces are increasingly fighting on their own, \nwith their size and capability growing.\n  While Senator McCain and I would agree that there are no guarantees \nfor victory and we have a long way to go, we certainly need to make \nevery effort to achieve it. Yet some Members of this body and the other \nbody say the real war on terror is in Afghanistan, not Iraq. If that is \nso, why are our marines fighting in Al Anbar against al-Qaida?\n  Charles Krauthammer, on March 30 in the Washington Post, wrote on \nthis very topic:\n\n       Thought experiment: Bring in a completely neutral \n     observer--a Martian--and point out to him that the U.S. is \n     involved in two hot wars against radical Islam insurgents. \n     One is in Afghanistan, a geographically marginal backwater \n     with no resources and no industrial or technical \n     infrastructure. The other is in Iraq, one of the three \n     principal Arab states, with untold oil wealth, an educated \n     population, an advanced military and technological \n     infrastructure that, though suffering decay in the later \n     years of Saddam Hussein's rule, could easily be revived if it \n     falls into the wrong hands. Add to that the fact that its \n     strategic location would give its rulers inordinate influence \n     over the entire Persian Gulf region, including Saudi Arabia, \n     Kuwait, and the Gulf States. Then ask your Martian: Which is \n     the more important battle? He would not even understand why \n     you are asking the question.\n\n  The war in Iraq is a very important front on the larger global \nbattlefield. If anyone doubts this, then all we need to do is to listen \nto what Osama bin Laden had to say back in December 2004 in a message \nto Muslims in Iraq.\n  Bin Ladin said: I now address my speech to the whole of the Islamic \nNation. Listen and understand. The issue is big, and the misfortune is \nmomentous. The most important and serious issue today for the whole \nworld is this Third World War which the crusader Zionist coalition \nbegan against the Islamic Nation. It is raging in the land of the Two \nRivers. The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of \nthe caliphate.\n  That is what Osama bin Laden said. He has gone on to say: The whole \nworld is watching this war and the two adversaries--the Islamic Nation, \non the one\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\nhand, and the United States and its allies on the other. It is either \nvictory and glory or misery and humiliation.\n  Now, obviously we did not declare war on radical Islam; it declared \nwar on us.\n  In addition, some in the House have sought to strike the term \n``global war on terror,'' pandering again to the likes of the George \nSoros wing of the party, undercutting U.S. efforts.\n  The global war on terror is a real mission that 9/11 showed us has no \ngeographical boundaries and one that so many of our brave men and women \nhave died for since the attacks of 9/11.\n  The terrorists have been targeting the United States throughout the \n1980s and 1990s. The United States never responded to those attacks, \nand the message sent was one of weakness, not strength. We would be \nrepeating the same mistake today by communicating a weakness of our \nwill by our political leaders. We withdrew from Vietnam, we withdrew \nfrom Beirut, we withdrew from Mogadishu. These repeated withdrawals \nsignal to our enemies all over the world that if they inflict enough \ndamage on our most heroic citizens, the marines will never surrender, \nbut Washington will.\n  A precipitous withdrawal, such as that being prescribed by the \nwannabe generals here in the Congress, would be disastrous. The Iraq \nStudy Group's recommendations reached the same conclusion. James Baker, \nthe group's cochairman, just wrote:\n\n       The report does not set timetables or deadlines for the \n     removal of troops as contemplated by the supplemental \n     spending bills the House and Senate passed. In fact, the \n     report specifically opposes that approach. As many military \n     and political leaders told us, an arbitrary deadline would \n     allow the enemy to wait us out and would strengthen the \n     positions of extremists over moderates. A premature American \n     departure from Iraq, we unanimously concluded, would almost \n     certainly produce even greater sectarian violence and further \n     deterioration of conditions in Iraq and possibly other \n     countries.\n\n  The intelligence community, in open hearing, said precipitous \nwithdrawal on a political timetable would lead to heightened killings \nof Shias and Sunnis, offer a safe haven for al-Qaida to reestablish \nitself, and likely a region-wide war between Sunni and Shia countries.\n  To ignore these questions and considerations simply because they are \nunpalatable is shortsighted at best and dangerous at the worst. Those \nwho want to end the war precipitously because they want to embarrass \nthe President do not want to talk about the fact that the war in Iraq \nwill do anything but end--in fact, would only grow even more dangerous. \nIf we leave, radical Islamists will follow us home.\n  What I say to those who want to get out either immediately or on a \npolitical timetable, not based on the conditions on the ground, is if \nyou want to run the war on terror from this body, you will own it. Even \nif some would-be generals in this body think they are smarter than \nGeneral Petraeus and can devise a better plan in legislation--and I \ndoubt that they can--how can they adjust their legislation conditions \non the battlefield? To micromanage a war is to ensure defeat.\n\n  When a newly revitalized al-Qaida carries out renewed 9/11-scale \nattacks, you will own those attacks as well. There are hundreds of \nthousands of soldiers, marines, guardsmen, and reservists and their \nfamilies who will remember, and I will help remind everyone.\n  As you may know, I proudly hail from the Show Me State. If all of the \nrhetoric in Washington about supporting the troops is true, and I \nbelieve people mean it, then I suggest that the Congress show our \ntroops we do support them by getting them the funds and giving them a \nchance to succeed and not taking away management from the hands of our \ncapable generals in the field and bringing to it this body where, in \nour great military wisdom, we know better than the troops, the \nofficers, and the commanders on the ground what the conditions are in \nIraq and the other battlefields.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, how much of our time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Isakson-\nColeman stem cell research bill. For me, this issue is personal on many \nlevels, and it weighs heavily on my heart, my mind, and my conscience. \nI have given great care in coming to my decision to be a cosponsor of \nthis bill and have spent much time reflecting, thinking, and praying \nabout making the right decision on this issue of stem cell research \nbecause it is a very controversial but yet a very forward-leaning \nissue.\n  Today we are debating the various types of research and what many \nview as the potential to cure diseases. There is no question that \neveryone here is supportive of medical research and, in particular, of \nstem cell research. However, there is still so much to be learned from \nscience, so many discoveries yet to be made, and so much that we still \ndo not know.\n  I am aware that there are very promising alternatives to embryonic \nstem cell research, such as deriving stem cells from umbilical cord \nblood and bone marrow. Those cells have demonstrated the capability of \nturning into most tissue types, thus helping to provide the basis for \nadvanced research to find cures for diseases such as juvenile diabetes, \nParkinson's disease, sickle cell anemia, and heart disease. Research \nfrom adult stem cells has saved thousands of lives, and funding for \nthis research certainly should continue.\n  While I am familiar with the advancements made in the adult stem cell \nresearch, there is still a lack of scientific evidence to show that \nembryonic stem cell research yields the strong results we have from the \nadult stem cell lines. There is also the issue of whether taxpayer \ndollars should be used for research that many believe is morally wrong.\n  While the morality of embryonic stem cell research is an issue for \nmany Americans, including myself, I also believe there is a constant \nneed to continue working to advance science and medical research. As a \ncountry, it is important that we stay on the cutting edge of medical \nresearch and remain globally competitive, because the United States \noffers the best health care in the world.\n  This legislation, introduced by Senators Isakson and Coleman, will \nnot only advance science, it will allow for embryonic research to take \nplace using non-viable embryos. The cells in those embryos have \nnaturally quit dividing and therefore would not be used for \nfertilization. Even if these embryos were frozen or saved, no \npracticing physician would ever attempt to implant them because the \ndevelopmental stages have naturally stopped.\n  This legislation will allow the Department of Health and Human \nServices to extend Federal funding for research on embryonic stem cell \nlines only if the lines were derived without harming a viable embryo. I \nbelieve this approach is an effective way to provide for advancements \nin science and give them to those who are waiting for cures without \ncompromising the value of life.\n  Many of us have personally benefitted or had family members who \nbenefitted from the advancements made in modern medicine over the past \n5, 10, or 20 years. I think we are all grateful for the progress that \nhas been made. It is my most sincere hope that we continue to see \nmonumental steps made in medical research--stem cell and otherwise--and \nthat we find cures for those suffering from diseases such as \nAlzheimer's, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries.\n  Make no mistake about it, if you sincerely, as a Member of this body, \nwant to see an advancement in the area of medical stem cell research, \nthis is the alternative you must vote for because this is a bill, if it \ngets the required number of votes, which will go to the President's \ndesk, and it is the bill which the President will sign, and we can move \nforward on the issue of embryonic stem cell research. I am proud to be \na cosponsor and intend to vote for this legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield my unused time back to the manager of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate on \nthis bill from my office. I have written down some of the miraculous \nstatements that have been made on the floor of the Senate, and I \nthought I would resubmit some of them with some constructive criticism.\n  Seventy-eight stem cell lines are no longer useful. That is not \naccurate. All stem cell lines are contaminated with mouse feeder cells. \nNot true, either. The policy does not work. Not true. Research on stem \ncells under the present cannot go forward. I would remind the body that \nstem cells, embryonic stem cells are being researched every day in this \ncountry with private money. This is about using Federal dollars to \ndestroy embryos; it is not about blocking embryonic stem cell research.\n  The statement was made by the Senator from California that these are \nembryos that would already be destroyed. Now that is not accurate at \nall. Only S. 5 embraces all forms of stem cell research. S. 30 embraces \nevery form of stem cell research, including embryonic stem cells, but \nit makes the correct distinction of taking a nonviable embryo that is \nstill viable for embryonic stem cells but not viable to create a human \nand uses those instead of the true potential-for-life embryos. There \nwould be no limitation on the numbers of these.\n\n  If we go to a fertility clinic today where embryos are created, what \nwe see is a range of embryos in terms of their quality. Then they are \ngraded. Some are implantable. Some are frozen. Some have quit dividing. \nThose that quit dividing but are not dead but don't have the potential \nare the ones S. 30 will allow to be used for embryonic stem cells. It \nbypasses the ethical dilemma we have and still gives us embryonic stem \ncell research.\n  It was just released by the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation and was on CNN, 13 young people from the ages of 14 to 31, \nnow living in Brazil, who had type 1 diabetes were treated with their \nown immune cells given back to them, and they now live without insulin. \nThat was released today. It didn't have anything to do with an \nembryonic stem cell.\n  Someone during the debate said: We all know embryonic stem cells hold \nthe most potential. I believe the Presiding Officer now in the chair \nsaid that. That is not true. They don't hold the most potential. They \nhold great research potential, but what we ought to be interested in is \ntherapeutics. How do we treat diseases? How do we accomplish therapies \nto do the most good for the most people?\n  What we are going to find out is, there will be some potential from \nembryonic stem cells. But if I had a child with diabetes, I would want \nit fixed as soon as I could, not 10 or 15 years from now. The fact is, \nwe have all these treatments that are coming about. I am convinced, as \nmuch as I am alive and standing here today, that within 10 years new \nonset type 1 diabetics will be cured within 2 months of the onset of \ntheir disease. That is going to happen. We are going to see that. We \nwill see tremendous treatments for that, whether from germ cell lines, \nembryonic stem cell lines that are harvested correctly and ethically, \nand other treatments, including autologous or their own stem cells used \nto treat the body.\n  I introduced into the Record the RAND study on the available embryos. \nWe had it quoted today, there are 400,000 of them out there. That is \nnot true. It is more like 13,000 available. So when we have this \nexaggerated claim that 400,000 embryos are waiting to be destroyed for \nembryonic stem cell research, that is not true.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma earlier introduced a \nRAND study that talked about the number of embryos. I believe there are \nnearly 400,000 that may be in IVF clinics. Apparently, only 2.8 percent \nhave the potential to be discarded. Is that correct?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is correct.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Is there a sense that the Senator from Oklahoma has in \nterms of decisions that parents and others are making about the kind of \nlife potential of those 97 percent that are not being discarded, that \nare being frozen for future attempts at pregnancy?\n  Mr. COBURN. There is no question it happens every day. One of the \nthings we have seen in our State is, we sometimes overfertilize eggs \nand create too many. But when it comes down to the individual couple \nwho says: We are going to try this implantation, we are going to save \nthese, then if they have a child, they may want to have another child, \nso that many of these are saved in reserve for that family. To say \nthere are 400,000 when, in fact, there are probably less than 13,000 \nthat could be available, if you look at the other side of that, how \nmany nongrowing, nonviable embryos are available today? Fifty to \nseventy to one hundred thousand of the stage 3 embryos that can be used \nfor embryonic stem cell that doesn't violate the ethical dilemma we \nface today. So the reason I put the RAND study in there is so the \nRecord will show the facts, not the desire of a Member of the Senate to \noverstate the case. The fact is, there are less than 13,000 available. \nThe fact is, level 3 embryos, there are 100,000 available. Nobody talks \nabout that. In fact, 3 of the 10 that are the best lines right now \nrunning came from exactly that source. So we know that is the \npotential.\n  Let me continue. We had the statement: Science without ethics is like \na ship without a rudder. That is true. Therefore, when we start \ndestroying life, where is our rudder? When we start marginalizing the \nweakest and the most vulnerable in our society to say we are going to \ndo something good somewhere when, in fact, the science doesn't show \nthat yet, where is our rudder? That is what S. 30 does. S. 30 gives an \nethical option for every need we have in the scientific community to \naccomplish everything the scientific community wants to accomplish. \nThere are no limitations in S. 30.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has made the point, President Bush is \ngoing to veto S. 5. He has already said he is going to veto it. So a \nyear from now, where do we want to be in terms of stem cell research? \nDo we want to have more embryonic stem cell lines and do we want to \nhave more embryonic stem cell lines the NIH can use money to research \non? The answer is, yes, we do. There is one way to do that. That is S. \n30. S. 30 allows that. I am convinced, as an obstetrician and as a \nscientist, that 10 years from now we won't use embryos whatsoever to \nproduce stem cells. We will use embryonic stem cells to help us \nresearch genetics and drug treatments for difficult diseases that we \nalready have, and we will use other methods to produce cell lines that \nwill give us cures to disease.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the recent \nannouncement of the article in JAMA on CNN, ``Type 1 diabetics live \nwithout insulin in stem cell experiment.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             [From CNN.com]\n\n     Type 1 Diabetics Live Without Insulin in Stem Cell Experiment\n\n       Chicago, IL (AP).--Thirteen young diabetics in Brazil have \n     ditched their insulin shots and need no other medication \n     thanks to a risky, but promising treatment with their own \n     stem cells--apparently the first time such a feat has been \n     accomplished.\n       Though too early to call it a cure, the procedure has \n     enabled the young people, who have Type 1 diabetes, to live \n     insulin free so far, some as long as three years. The \n     treatment involves stem cell transplants from the patients' \n     own blood.\n       ``It's the first time in the history of Type 1 diabetes \n     where people have gone with no treatment whatsoever . . . no \n     medications at all, with normal blood sugars,'' said study \n     co-author Dr. Richard Burt of Northwestern University's \n     medical school in Chicago, Illinois.\n       While the procedure can be potentially life-threatening, \n     none of the 15 patients in the study died or suffered lasting \n     side effects. But it didn't work for two of them.\n       Larger, more rigorous studies are needed to determine \n     whether stem cell transplants could become standard treatment \n     for people with the disease once called juvenile diabetes. It \n     is less common than Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with \n     obesity.\n       The hazards of stem cell transplantation also raise \n     questions about whether the study\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\n     should have included children. One patient was as young as \n     14.\n       Dr. Lainie Ross, a medical ethicist at the University of \n     Chicago, said the researchers should have studied adults \n     first before exposing young teens to the potential harms of \n     stem cell transplant, which include infertility and late-\n     onset cancers.\n       In addition, Ross said that the study should have had a \n     comparison group to make sure the treatment was indeed better \n     than standard diabetes care.\n       Burt, who wrote the study protocol, said the research was \n     done in Brazil because U.S. doctors were not interested in \n     the approach. The study was approved by ethics committees in \n     Brazil, he said, adding that he personally believes it was \n     appropriate to do the research in children as well as adults, \n     as long as the Brazilian ethics panels approved.\n       Burt and other diabetes experts called the results an \n     important step forward.\n\n\n                         `Very promising time'\n\n       ``It's the threshold of a very promising time for the \n     field,'' said Dr. Jay Skyler of the Diabetes Research \n     Institute at the University of Miami.\n       Skyler wrote an editorial in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association, which published the study, saying the \n     results are likely to stimulate research that may lead to \n     methods of preventing or reversing Type 1 diabetes.\n       ``These are exciting results. They look impressive,'' said \n     Dr. Gordon Weir of Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, \n     Massachusetts.\n       Still, Weir cautioned that more studies are needed to make \n     sure the treatment works and is safe. ``It's really too early \n     to suggest to people that this is a cure,'' he said.\n       The patients involved were ages 14 to 31 and had newly \n     diagnosed Type 1 diabetes. An estimated 12 million to 24 \n     million people worldwide--including 1 to 2 million in the \n     United States--have this form of diabetes, which is typically \n     diagnosed in children or young adults. An autoimmune disease, \n     it occurs when the body attacks insulin-producing cells in \n     the pancreas.\n       Insulin is needed to regulate blood sugar levels, which \n     when too high, can lead to heart disease, blindness, nerve \n     problems and kidney damage.\n       Burt said the stem cell transplant is designed to stop the \n     body's immune attack on the pancreas.\n       A study published last year described a different kind of \n     experimental transplant, using pancreas cells from donated \n     cadavers, that enabled a few diabetics to give up insulin \n     shots. But that requires lifelong use of anti-rejection \n     medicine, which isn't needed by the Brazil patients since the \n     stem cells were their own.\n       The 15 diabetics were treated at a bone marrow center at \n     the University of Sao Paulo.\n       All had newly diagnosed diabetes, and their insulin-\n     producing cells had not been destroyed.\n       That timing is key, Burt said. ``If you wait too long,'' he \n     said, ``you've exceeded the body's ability to repair \n     itself.''\n       The procedure involves stimulating the body to produce new \n     stem cells and harvesting them from the patient's blood. Next \n     comes several days of high-dose chemotherapy, which virtually \n     shuts down the patient's immune system and stops destruction \n     of the few remaining insulin-producing cells in the body. \n     This requires hospitalization and potent drugs to fend off \n     infection. The harvested stem cells, when injected back into \n     the body, build a new healthier immune system that does not \n     attack the insulin-producing cells.\n       Patients were hospitalized for about three weeks. Many had \n     side effects including nausea, vomiting and hair loss. One \n     developed pneumonia, the only severe complication.\n       Doctors changed the drug regimen after the treatment failed \n     in the first patient, who ended up needing more insulin than \n     before the study. Another patient also relapsed.\n       The remaining 13 ``live a normal life without taking \n     insulin,'' said study co-author Dr. Julio Voltarelli of the \n     University of Sao Paulo. ``They all went back to their \n     lives.''\n       The patients enrolled in the study at different times so \n     the length of time they've been insulin-free also differs.\n       Burt has had some success using the same procedure in 170 \n     patients with other autoimmune diseases, including lupus and \n     multiple sclerosis; one patient with an autoimmune form of \n     blindness can now see, Burt said.\n       ``The body has tremendous potential to repair,'' he said.\n       The study was partly funded by the Brazilian Ministry of \n     Health, Genzyme Corp. and a maker of blood sugar monitoring \n     products.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield 2 additional minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. There are two ethical questions America has to answer. \nOne is, is it OK to destroy life with the potential of helping cure \nmaladies--we haven't seen it yet--with the potential, the hope to cure \nmaladies? In the midst of that ethical question, is it OK to destroy \nthat life when you could do the same thing without destroying life by \nusing class 3 embryos? That is the first ethical dilemma. The second \nethical dilemma we face as a nation and as citizens of this country and \nas Members of this body is, if in fact it is true there are other ways \nto get to the exact same goal of treatments--we all want to fulfill the \nhopes and the desires, whether they are paraplegics, quadriplegics, \ndiabetics, Parkinson's or others, all these tremendous diseases that we \nknow we are going to be able to eventually find a cure for--if we can \ndo that without ever having to destroy the first embryo, wouldn't we \nall rather go that way? That is what S. 30 offers. S. 30 offers an \nopportunity to accomplish exactly the same thing without destroying the \nfirst life. How we answer that question is going to say a lot about our \ncountry.\n  My hope is a year from now we are standing on this floor and seeing \nall this promise come true, whether it be altered nuclear transfer, \nwhether it be germ cell, which I happen to believe is going to be \nanother great option in terms of multipotent and pluripotent stem \ncells, that we will see the fruits and the wisdom of the Senate that \npasses a bill, S. 30, which actually makes a difference. S. 5 isn't \ngoing to make any difference. It is going to get vetoed. It is not \ngoing to do anything to help us except create a political posture that \nthe President has said he will not bow to. He is not going to sign it. \nHe is going to veto it, and the House will not override it. So the \nquestion is, if you want to give hope, if you want to promote a \npotential for treatment and cures for all these strong and tough \ndiseases families are facing and individual patients are facing, the \nway to do that is to make sure S. 30 becomes law. It will, in fact, be \nthe thing that makes the difference. S. 5 won't. S. 5 is going to get \nvetoed, and we will be back here doing the same thing next year and the \nnext year and the next year.\n  The point is, let's do what we can today, and S. 30 accomplishes \nthat.\n  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for both his passion \nand his expertise. I think he said this morning--how many babies has \nthe Senator delivered?\n  Mr. COBURN. A shade over 4,000.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. This is one Senator who understands the value of life \nand has a hands-on approach.\n  It is interesting. President Clinton's bioethics commission \nconcluded, if we have some other alternatives, why wouldn't we use \nthem? They concluded the derivation of stem cells from embryos \nremaining following infertility treatments is justifiable only if no \nless morally problematic alternatives are available for advancing the \nresearch. I believe what is happening is the science is moving faster \nthan the politics, that we have today the opportunity through a number \nof processes to move forward with pluripotent stem cell research in \nways that are less morally problematic, that don't cross a line, that \ndon't cross the line that says we should not have Federal funding for \nthe destruction of a human embryo.\n  I know my colleagues and friends who support S. 5 quite often have \ntalked about excess embryos that we have and that may not be used for \nany other purpose. I would ask them to ask these questions. I believe \ntheir intent is this narrow intent, but as you look at S. 5, the \nquestion raised is, is this the beginning of the production of embryos? \nIf in fact this is the acceptable path to go, why wouldn't we produce \nembryos that would then get Federal funding to do the research? Is the \nuse of these embryos only for the purpose of stem cell research? Where \nwould we draw the line? Who draws that line? Why wouldn't we use this \nto study embryonic growth, cell patterns, a whole range of other \nthings? Once we have crossed the line, where does it end? If it is \ndifficult to coax embryonic stem cells into the desired kinds of \ndifferentiated type cell types, would we want to allow the embryos to \ndevelop longer so we could kind of coax them into later development so \nwe can see that later stage embryos may be a better source of more \nadvanced cells and tissues and organs? Even if we don't do that, if we \nmove down this path, are there other nations or other countries that \ndon't have the kind of moral concerns we have? Why would they not want \nto go that route?\n  We have already begun the process. What we offer in S. 30 is a \npossibility to bring this country together to provide\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\nFederal funding for stem cell research that provides the hope of what \npluripotent stem cells may be able to do. It sets up a tissue bank for \namniotic and placental stem cells which offer great promise without the \nmoral dilemma. At a time when clearly the Nation is divided, we offer a \ntime to come together.\n  My concern is, last year we passed a bill in this Senate that \nprovided for alternatives, Specter-Santorum. It was rejected in the \nHouse. I hope my colleagues don't take an all-or-nothing approach. I \nhope they don't look to get 100 percent of nothing--nothing meaning \nthat S. 5 is going to be vetoed--and then stop us from at least moving \nforward with the opportunity to put Federal dollars in research and \nproduction doing stem cell research that doesn't cross a moral line.\n  I see my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I wanted to add one other thing. When the American people \nthink about stem cells and potential treatments, the thing that is \nnever talked to them about is the idea of tissue rejection. There isn't \ngoing to be an embryonic stem cell that produces a cell that can be \nused in any human without the use of antirejection drugs. The only way \nyou can get around that is to clone yourself. The only way you can get \naround it totally, without any rejection whatsoever, is to be a female \nand clone yourself, because cells have these wonderful little engines \nin them called mitochondria. They have separate DNA. That DNA of the \ncloned egg will be accomplished as a part of that.\n\n  So this idea we think we are going to have this great answer, even \nonce we get to treatments--treatments that use embryonic stem cells \nrather than altered nuclear transfer, or oocyte-assisted \nreprogramming--those cells will all have to have accompanying with \nthem, all those treatments, anti-rejection drugs.\n  If you know anybody who has had any type of organ transplant, ask \nthem how it is to take those drugs. The only way you do that is, we \ncome to the next ethical dilemma: Is it OK for you to clone yourself, \nthen destroy that life you have cloned so you can take part of that for \nyou? All those ethical dilemmas are gone in altered nuclear transfer \nbecause now you are inserting stem cells from your own body. They are \nyour own cells. There is no rejection.\n  In this study in Brazil I just put in the Record, there is no \nrejection because they are using their own cells. They have eliminated \nthe ability of their body to destroy their islet cells in their \npancreas and have done that with their own cells. There is no rejection \nso they are not on any medicines. They are not on insulin anymore \nbecause they are now producing insulin.\n  So the fact is, we should make sure we understand if and when--and \nthere is no guarantee the ``when'' is going to come--we have embryonic \nstem cell treatments, those are going to be accompanied by \nantirejection treatments as well. However, if you use your own cells \nfor the same treatment--we heard Senator Brownback talk about the \nnumerous studies that are ongoing now with autologous or self-giving \nreparations from your own body--there is no rejection issue.\n  So it is easy for us to talk, and it is easy for us to offer hope, \nbut we need to make sure when we talk about that hope, when we talk \nabout embryonic stem cells, we are balancing it with a realism that we \nare not off treatment, even though we offer a cure, because now we have \na treatment to make sure the cure works. So it is a step that is \npositive, but it is not the panacea that has been described on this \nfloor today.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from Markus Grompe, MD, from the Oregon Health & \nScience University.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Oregon Stem Cell Center, Oregon Health & Science \n           University,\n                                     Portland, OR, April 10, 2007.\n       Embryonic stem cells have many potential uses in biomedical \n     research, including cell transplantation therapy, in vitro \n     studies of developmental and disease processes as well as \n     drug testing. To date, the establishment of human pluripotent \n     stem cell lines that can be used for these applications \n     always involves the destruction of nascent life, the embryo. \n     Human embryos can be generated by fertilization or by cloning \n     (somatic cell nuclear transfer).\n       However several recent studies, pioneered in animals, have \n     firmly established that it is also possible to generate \n     pluripotent cells equivalent to embryonic stem cells without \n     destroying embryos (the alternative methods). While these \n     approaches have been only tested in animals to date, it is \n     highly likely that similar approaches will work for human \n     cells as well. Additional research is needed to realize the \n     potential of the alternative methods and make them practical \n     on a large scale. For this reason I strongly support Senate \n     Bill 30. This bill will provide the necessary support to \n     establish and validate methods for producing pluripotent \n     cells without destroying human life.\n       Several of the proposed methods have scientific as well as \n     ethical advantages. The third and fourth techniques described \n     in the President's Council on Bioethics May 2005 White paper \n     will produce cells that are immunologically matched to the \n     patient from who they were derived. These cells could then be \n     used for transplantation without being rejected by the immune \n     system. It is also expected that these approaches will make \n     the production of pluripotent cell lines technically easier \n     and more efficient that methods that rely on embryos.\n       In my own laboratory we would use the alternative methods \n     to produce liver and pancreas cells for the treatment of \n     liver diseases and diabetes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Markus Grompe, M.D.,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. In that letter Dr. Grompe talks about what my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma just talked about. He talks about producing cells that \nare immunologically matched to the patient from whom they were derived. \nHe says:\n\n       These cells could then be used for transplantation without \n     being rejected by the immune system. It is also expected that \n     these approaches will make the production of pluripotent cell \n     lines technically easier and more efficient than methods that \n     rely on embryos.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       In my own laboratory we would use the alternative methods \n     to produce liver and pancreas cells for the treatment of \n     liver diseases and diabetes.\n\n  We have an opportunity under S. 30 to move the research forward, to \nmove it forward in a unified way, a way that avoids the culture wars, \navoids the great divide, that has the opportunity for moving forward \nwithout dealing with the issues of immune reactions that opens up a \nvision of hope. This is about hope. S. 30 is hope offered through \nprincipled and ethical stem cell research--the HOPE Act.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--whatever their \nposition is on S. 5--understand if they want to move the ball forward, \nif they want to look into the eyes of their constituents and say we are \ngoing to give you something, some sense of hope, we are going to move \nresearch forward, the only way to do that today is through supporting \nS. 30. I urge my colleagues to support S. 30.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, do I understand the situation is that now \nour side has 60 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished senior Senator from Florida \nis recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this, to me, is an issue where \nwe ought to be using some common sense. We have all of these enormously \nplaguing diseases that are upon us, and we have the first rays of hope \nwe can cure these diseases.\n  Who among Americans has not been touched by diseases such as ALS and \nParkinson's and spinal cord injury and diabetes and Alzheimer's and \ncardiovascular disease and cancer? Who among us, one way or another, \nhas not been touched by it? Now we have this ray of hope that the \nscientists tell us, by growing these stem cells, we have this \nopportunity for enormous medical breakthroughs.\n  At the National Prayer Breakfast this year, the speaker was Dr. \nFrancis Collins. He is the fellow who headed the project of mapping the \nentire human genome. I have heard Dr. Collins speak on other occasions \nin which\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\nhe has talked about the promise of all of the stem cell research.\n  Dr. Collins--and I say this for a specific reason--was the speaker at \nthe National Prayer Breakfast because he is this eminent scientist who \nsuccessfully mapped the human genome, but he is also a man of a deep \nand abiding faith who happens to support not only the stem cell \nresearch that we address here today--which is in this bill to open the \ncoffers of the Federal Government so we can finance beyond the limited \nnumber of lines in embryonic stem cell research--but Dr. Collins would \nmake the case for going beyond in something known as somatic cell \nnuclear transfer, which is taking an egg, scooping out the nucleus, \ntaking a donor's skin cell, taking the nucleus from that, and \nimplanting it in the egg, stimulating the process to grow, and growing \na specific line of stem cells that are exactly tailored to the donor's \ncells, and growing whatever the stem cells are.\n  But that is another advance. That is not even what we are addressing \ntoday. We are addressing Federal funding for the first kind of growing \nstem cells. Why we would not use the resources of the Federal \nGovernment to attack these diseases that the scientists and the medical \nprofession feel have enormous progress, why we would not do that is \nbeyond me.\n  With regard to the second kind--somatic cell nuclear transfer--you \nare not even dealing with a fertilized egg, so you do not have that \nquestion. The question there is, are you going to where you do cloning? \nWell, we have the capability of passing the laws that say cloning for a \nhuman, where it would be implanted into the womb--we can say that is \nnot only unlawful, that is criminal. That does not mean we do not \nproceed with the research and the development on stem cell research--in \nthat case, somatic cell nuclear transfer.\n  So this is a matter that can bring hope to millions. As I said, there \nis simply not an American who has not been touched one way or another \nthrough friends or family by this list of horrible diseases. If that \ngives us promise, that is enough for this Senator, and I hope it is \nenough for a two-thirds majority of this Senate so when the President \nvetoes it, we can override it.\n  This is a bipartisan bill that is going to expand the number of stem \ncell lines that would be eligible for federally funded dollars for \nresearch. It clearly would accelerate the progress toward the cures and \ntreatments for these dread diseases.\n  Every other Senator and I have heard from thousands of people back in \nour States who suffer--suffer daily--from these dread diseases. With \nthis ray of hope--like a sunburst coming through the clouds--we cannot \nturn our face from it. We have to face it. We have to give hope to \nthese people who are suffering. That is the task before this Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am waiting for the arrival of another \nSenator to speak.\n  I listened to some of the debate that was just concluded, and I \nthought I heard--I am almost certain I heard--the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma say S. 5 would provide money for the destruction of human \nembryos.\n  Well, I am sorry, I hate to disagree with my friend from Oklahoma, \nbut that is not so. As a matter of fact, we do not provide that kind of \nFederal money now with the stem cell lines that are being researched--\nthe few that are being researched now--and we do not under our bill. We \nstill operate under what is called the Dickey-Wicker amendment which \nprohibits the use of Federal funds being used to destroy embryos. So we \ndo not do that anyway. I think the Senator from Oklahoma ought to read \nthe bill a little bit more carefully and understand we do not provide \nfor the destruction of embryos.\n  I always find curious, every time someone speaks for the President--a \nspokesperson for the President--they always say the one line the \nPresident will not cross is he will not provide taxpayer money for the \ndestruction of embryos. Well, if that is the case, then he should have \nno problem with S. 5, the bill we have before us, because it does not \nprovide Federal funding for the destruction of embryos. It provides \nFederal funding for the research on stem cell lines that are derived by \nothers--private entities, State entities, or whatever. But we do not \nprovide any funding for the destruction of embryos whatsoever. I wanted \nto clear that up to make certain that did not sit out there.\n  I also listened earlier to my good friend--and he is a good friend--\nSenator Brownback talking about the 72 diseases being treated with \nadult stem cells. Well, if all of these diseases are being treated so \nwell with adult stem cells, then why do all the patient advocacy groups \nthat are affiliated with those diseases support our bill, S. 5? We have \n525 different patient advocacy groups supporting our bill.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Kansas, how many does he have \nsupporting S. 30? Senator Brownback's list includes several types of \nleukemia and lymphoma, but I have a letter from the Leukemia & Lymphoma \nSociety, by Mr. George Dahlman, the vice president for public policy. \nHe wrote a letter dated April 4 of this year. He says:\n\n       On behalf of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, I am writing \n     in response to assertions that adult stem cells have treated \n     or cured several blood cancers, including several leukemias, \n     lymphomas and multiple myeloma.\n       As a representative of more than 700,000 patients and their \n     caregivers in this country who battle blood cancers on a \n     daily basis, our organizations would like to emphasize, as \n     the Senate debates S. 5, the Stem Cell Research and \n     Enhancement Act, that we exist today because we have not \n     found cures for these devastating diseases.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Furthermore, the claim that treatment of blood cancers with \n     cord blood, blood, or marrow stem cells demonstrates the \n     potential of ``adult stem cell'' research or is a substitute \n     for embryonic stem cell research is misleading and \n     disingenuous.\n\n  So again, Senator Brownback's list included leukemia and lymphoma, \nbut the various organizations that represent all these people support \nS. 5. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society,\n\n                                                    April 4, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of The Leukemia & Lymphoma \n     Society, I am writing in response to assertions that adult \n     stem cells have treated or cured several blood cancers, \n     including several leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma.\n       As a representative of more than 700,000 patients and their \n     caregivers in this country that battle blood cancers on a \n     daily basis, our organization would like to emphasize as the \n     Senate debates S. 5, the Stem Cell Research and Enhancement \n     Act, that we exist today because we have not found cures for \n     these devastating diseases.\n       Furthermore, the claim that treatment of blood cancers with \n     cord blood, blood or marrow stem cells--known as \n     hematopoietic stem cells--demonstrates the potential of \n     ``adult stem cell'' research or is a substitute for embryonic \n     stem cell research is misleading and disingenuous. While \n     these hematopoietic treatments can rejuvenate similar cell \n     lines, they have not demonstrated robust ``plasticity'' or \n     the ability to give rise to more varied lineages. That \n     ability is the characteristic that gives hope to researchers \n     and patients and should be clearly understood in this debate. \n     The concept that ``adult stem cells'' can differentiate into \n     more diverse tissue types is highly controversial and \n     evidence to date has been inconclusive. While deserving of \n     further scientific study, there is no clear evidence that the \n     use of adult stem cells can substitute for pluripotent stem \n     cells that have the capability of making diverse tissue \n     types.\n       We support exploring every avenue of research, including \n     embryonic stem cell research, until a cure is found. The most \n     respected scientists in our field view embryonic stem cells \n     as an area of research that must be explored, and one that \n     our government must make a commitment to support. The \n     Leukemia & Lymphoma Society asks that you and your colleagues \n     pass S. 5, and not accept any substitutes.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               George Dahlman,\n\n                                    Vice President, Public Policy,\n                                  The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I see my colleague, Senator Brown from \nOhio, is here. I yield to him 10 minutes. If he needs more time, I can \nyield him more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa, who, \nfrankly, more than anybody in this institution and almost anybody in \nthe country, has led the charge on embryonic stem\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\ncell research and the work he has done will save lives, which is what \nthis issue is all about.\n  The Senate is about to vote on legislation that ends the ban on \nFederal funding for embryonic stem cell research. President Bush, as we \nhear--although I still hope he changes his mind--does not support \nlifting the ban on stem cell research, but do we know who does? The \nAmerican Medical Association thinks we should lift the ban. So does the \nAmerican Society for Microbiology, the Association of American Medical \nColleges, the Cancer Research Foundation of America, the Juvenile \nDiabetes Research Foundation, the Parkinson's Action Network, Project \nALS, and the Society for Pediatric Research. The list goes on and on \nand on.\n  We in this body should ask ourselves: Why do these groups support \nFederal funding? Because the research offers victims of these diseases \nhope. Not a magic bullet, not a miracle cure, not certainty but, quite \nsimply, hope: hope that a child with a spinal injury will recover the \nability to walk; Hope that a parent with Alzheimer's will be able to \nstep back from the abyss of dementia. Hope.\n  Recently the Director of the National Institutes of Health stated in \na Senate hearing that he supports expanded stem cell research. Dr. \nZerhouni, who basically is one of the President's chief medical \nadvisers and an appointment of President Bush, said:\n\n       It is clear today that American science would be better \n     served and the Nation would be better served if we let our \n     scientists have access to more cell lines.\n\n  That would give them the opportunity to expand their research, to \nopen one more door, provide one more opportunity for research; in a \nword, to provide hope.\n  If we don't listen to the leader of one of our Nation's most \nprestigious scientific institutions, whom will we listen to? Because of \nembryonic stem cell research, medical science may one day be able to \ndispense with the use of terms such as ``incurable'' or \n``irreversible'' or ``unremitting,'' words that spell disaster to loved \nones, words that spell no hope so often for patients. If we can do what \nwe have the opportunity to do today, to open another door, to give \nanother window of opportunity to our medical scientists, to our \nresearchers, we can provide that hope to so many patients and so many \nloved ones of those patients. That is amazing. Getting anywhere near \nthat goal would be amazing.\n  More than 200,000 people in my State, more than 200,000 Ohioans have \nAlzheimer's disease. More than 40,000 Ohioans have Parkinson's disease. \nAlmost 700,000 Ohioans have diabetes. That is about 1 in 14 Ohioans who \nhave diabetes. I have a family member suffering from diabetes. My best \nfriend, John Kleshinski, is someone who provided hope for so many. He \nlived in Boston for many years. He grew up in Ohio with me. John \nKleshinski provided hope to so many children in inner-city Boston \nbecause of his philanthropy, because he gave young children in Boston a \nchance to learn music, to play the piano, to sing, to learn other \nmusical instruments. John Kleshinski always provided hope. John was \ndiagnosed with juvenile diabetes when he was 13. Last November, at the \nage of 55, he died of a heart attack. Throughout his life, he did \neverything possible, everything within the limits of modern medicine to \nprolong his life and to live the healthiest life he could. If we had \ndone the advancements in embryonic stem cell research, it could have \nmade a difference in John Kleshinski's life. If we are going to choose \nlife, if we are going to value life, this issue is so very important to \ngive people hope.\n  Looking at these conditions alone, at Parkinson's, diabetes, \nespecially juvenile diabetes, and Alzheimer's, it is clear there are \nhuge stakes involved when Federal actions delay the moment when \nembryonic stem cell research produces its first human treatment. We can \nact tomorrow and pass this legislation. We can continue to try to \npersuade the President, as his own medical adviser did, to change his \nmind. His own medical adviser changed his mind over the last couple of \nyears about stem cell research. If we can pass this bill tomorrow and \nhopefully convince the President to change his mind, it will provide \nhope for so many Americans.\n  This bill, Senate bill 5, will advance stem cell research, and most \nlegislators are in support of S. 5, which passed the HELP Committee, \nand it has passed in the other body. But President Bush has threatened \nto veto this bill. He vetoed similar legislation last year as his first \nand only veto since he has been President. I hope he takes a step back. \nI hope he considers the people he is hurting by stifling embryonic stem \ncell research. I hope he listens to his own medical adviser, Dr. \nZerhouni. I hope he listens to the millions of Americans whose lives \nwill be shattered by disabling and terminal illnesses, the families \nwhose hearts will be broken by the loss of a loved one, the children \nwho will not grow up, the parents who will not meet their \ngrandchildren, the grandparents who will no longer recognize their \nfriends and their family members. Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's \ndisease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, arthritis, diabetes, paralysis, \nthe advancement of embryonic stem cell research can provide hope for \ncures of all these diseases.\n  Investing in embryonic stem cell research is an expression of empathy \nand compassion. We have an opportunity to turn potential cures into \nreal ones. We must not squander it. Hope, Mr. President, hope.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Ohio for \nhis eloquent statement. This is what it is all about. He got it right \nwhen he said this is about hope. It is not hope based upon any kind of \nfalse foundation. All the leading scientists, Nobel Prize winners, \nheads and former heads of NIH, and 525 different advocacy groups, all \nrelying upon good scientific expertise, have said the foundation here \nis solid, that we can build hope because we know embryonic stem cells \ndevelop into all the cells of the human body. We know. We have had \nembryonic stem cells that have differentiated into nerve tissue, more \nneurons, heart and muscle tissue, and bones. So we know the possibility \nis there because it has already been done.\n  Again, we have a long way to go. No one is saying that absolutely we \nwill do this, this, and this, but that is what scientific research is \nabout. It is about looking and studying and examining and trying to \ndevelop these ideas. We know the foundation is there. So the hope we \nhold out to people with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, and spinal cord \ninjury is one that is real, but it will not happen unless we get about \nembryonic stem cell research and lift the handcuffs, the shackles off \nour scientists.\n  So the Senator from Ohio is right. It is about hope. That is what \nthis bill is all about. It is about hope. Not the false hope of saying: \nOh, adult stem cells will take care of it. Adult stem cells have their \nplace, and some of them have proven adequate to do different things but \nnot everything. There is hope with amniotic fluid stem cells, cord \nblood stem cells. Now, the bill S. 30 talks about that, which is taking \nit from naturally dead embryos. That raises ethical questions in and of \nitself. Who decides when something is naturally dead? I would ask my \ncolleagues who are promoting S. 30--and they are my good friends; I \nknow they mean well and they are trying to advance a certain point of \nview, but are they saying you can take something that is dead and bring \nit back to life? If so, that is--I have only known where that has \nhappened once in the history of humankind, and we just celebrated \nEaster Sunday. So they can't be saying they are taking something dead \nand bringing it back to life. So if it is not dead, what is it? Is it a \nsick embryo? Is it an embryo that isn't quite propagating as fast? What \nis it and who decides? Who gets to decide? S. 30 doesn't say that. S. \n30 has no ethical guidelines to decide, or who decides what is \nnaturally dead. So that raises all kinds of ethical questions in and of \nitself. So that is why, even if S. 30 were to become law--I don't think \nit will be--I don't mind supporting S. 30. The fact is our bill, S. 5, \ndoes everything S. 30 wants to do. If they want to do research to take \nembryonic stem cells from blastocysts that are not developing \ncorrectly, that can happen under our bill. Our bill opens the door to \nall kinds of research.\n  Here is the difference between S. 5 and S. 30. S. 5, the bill we are \nsupporting, does both things. It opens the door for embryonic stem cell \nresearch\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\nfrom leftover embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics, under strict \nethical guidelines which I talked about today and laid out. It also \nwould provide for research into naturally dead embryos. Now, S. 30, \ntheir bill, the Isakson-Coleman bill, it does one of those. It does \nresearch only into stem cells from naturally dead embryos. That is the \ndifference. Our bill allows that to go ahead. Their bill does not allow \nthe more promising embryonic stem cell research to go ahead, and that \nis from leftover embryos at in vitro fertilization clinics. That is \nwhat this is all about. That is what this is all about.\n  Again, I repeat: It is about what the Senator from Ohio said. It is \nabout hope. Listen, we are not fooling anybody around here, the people \nwatching, the medical community out there, the research scientists, the \nfamilies of loved ones who are suffering from these illnesses, the kids \nwith juvenile diabetes, they get it. They get it. They know what that \nis all about. They know there is only one bill on the floor of the \nSenate now that gives them hope, and that is S. 5. They know it. All \nthis mumbo jumbo we hear, it doesn't mean anything. Only one thing \nmeans anything, and that is to pass the bill that takes the shackles \noff our scientists, that provides for strict ethical guidelines for \npeople who have leftover embryos at an in vitro fertilization clinic \nwho say: I don't want them discarded as hospital waste. I want them to \nbe donated to science to cure diseases and illnesses and to help \nsuffering people.\n  That is what S. 5 is about. S. 30 does not do that. It simply keeps \nthe handcuffs on our scientists, and we want to remove those handcuffs.\n  Mr. President, I see my good friend from New Jersey is on the floor, \nso I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Iowa \nyielding time, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President we are back again--almost a year after Congress passed \nbreakthrough legislation--discussing embryonic stem cell research and, \nagain, I rise in strong support of this lifesaving, life-enhancing \nlegislation.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct, because I believe the bill has the potential to make a profound \nand positive impact on the health of millions of Americans. I believe \nthat it can do so in an ethical manner.\n  We know embryonic stem cells have the unique ability to develop into \nvirtually every cell and tissue in the body. We know numerous frozen \nembryos in fertility clinics remain unused by couples at the completion \nof their fertility treatments. Why should they not be allowed to donate \nthose embryos to Federal research to save lives? We allow people to \ndonate organs to save lives. Why couldn't a couple, if they so choose, \ndonate their frozen embryos instead of simply discarding them, throwing \nthem away, throwing away hope?\n  We can do this ethically and still cure illnesses, enhance lives and, \nhopefully, even save lives. But the truth is, we should not even be \nhaving this debate right now because if the President had done his duty \nlast year and not vetoed H.R. 810, this bill would already be law, and \nthis country's dedicated medical researchers would be well on their way \nto discovering treatments and cures for many of the most savage \ndiseases afflicting us. But when given the opportunity to carry out the \nwill of the people, he stood for ideology and ignorance over science \nand research.\n  Mr. President, enough is enough. It is time for a change. I have no \ndoubt that the Senate will pass this important legislation and thus \nseek to advance federally funded research on embryonic stem cells. I \nhave no doubt that if it becomes law, the bill would save and improve \nlives all over America. I have no doubt that the majority of Americans \nwant us to pass this bill into law. My only doubt is whether our \nPresident will do his duty and sign it into law.\n  During the last Congress, President Bush vetoed H.R. 810, crushing \nthe hopes of millions of Americans. This year, I fear and suspect that \nhe will follow the same misguided path. But before he takes us down \nthat route, one that leads to more heartbreak and suffering, I have one \nquestion. Why? Why is he standing in the way of research that will save \nlives? Why is he keeping our parents, our children, and our friends \nlocked in wheelchairs and hospital beds? Why is he letting conservative \nideology rob the lives of so many suffering Americans?\n  The simple fact is, whatever the claims of those who ignore science \nin favor of ideology, embryonic stem cell research offers one of the \nmost promising leaps forward in the history of medicine. Speak to those \nwho are eager to do the research and you hear of potential cures for \njuvenile diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord \ninjuries. If we unlock the door to this research, we can find \ntreatments and cures for these debilitating and painful diseases. We \nowe it to our parents, our children, and our grandchildren to unlock \nthat door.\n  But President Bush prefers ignorance and pain over mercy and \nmiracles. Where is the compassion he often speaks of? His own \nscientists are trying to explain the power of this research, but he \ncontinues to turn a deaf ear, refusing to listen to common sense and \nreason. Mr. President, it is time to start listening.\n  The preamble of our Constitution says all Americans have the right to \n``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' I believe this implies \nthe freedom to be physically able. By not allowing embryonic stem cell \nresearch, we are prohibiting individuals from pursuing their rights. We \nare blocking them from a possible cure or treatment. And we are \nstanding in the way of their freedom.\n  Last Congress, the interim chair of the National Institutes of Health \nstem cell task force, bravely and bluntly spoke of the importance of \nembryonic stem cell research and the drawbacks of the current policy \nprohibiting research.\n  He said:\n\n       Science works best when scientists can pursue all avenues \n     of research. If the cure for Parkinson's disease or juvenile \n     diabetes lay behind one of four doors, wouldn't you want the \n     option to open all four doors at once instead of one door?\n\n  How can we tell our loved ones that their cure could be waiting \nbehind a laboratory door, but that door is locked? We must pursue all \navenues of research and unlock the potential that embryonic stem cell \nresearch holds.\n  But if that isn't enough, recently, before the Health Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, the Director of the NIH, Elias Zerhouni, \nsaid the great promise of human embryonic stem cell research is being \nimpeded by President Bush's policy. He said:\n\n       It is in the best interest of our scientists, our science, \n     and our country that we find ways and the nation finds a way \n     to go full speed across adult and embryonic stem cells \n     equally.\n\n  So if President Bush won't listen to his own scientists, who will he \nlisten to? Perhaps he will listen to the American people who are crying \nout in virtual unison for change. More than 70 percent of Americans \nsupport embryonic stem cell research. Three out of four Americans \nunderstand the hope and promise this research provides.\n  This bill means all the prayers for cures and therapies for \nAlzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy, heart disease, and other \nillnesses could be answered. This bill provides a promise that families \nmight no longer have to see a loved one suffering. This bill means hope \nfor individuals challenged and fighting to live a life with dignity. I \nhave met with children and families all over New Jersey who have shared \ntheir daily struggle with diseases and conditions that could be cured \nor treated if we were to pursue embryonic stem cell research.\n  Young children have come to my office and told me how they have to \nprick themselves with a needle, administer insulin shots, or use an \ninternal pump on the side of their body in order to keep their juvenile \ndiabetes under control. These children might be freed of this grave \nresponsibility if we support embryonic stem cell research. Don't we owe \nthem the opportunity of a better life? Don't we owe it to the husband \nwhose wife shakes uncontrollably from Parkinson's disease to help find \na cure that will restore her body? Don't we owe it to the athletes who \ntold me about their life-altering spinal cord injuries, to give them \nthe freedom to walk again?\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\n  None of these individuals chose their current situations. But we can \nchoose to help get them out of those situations. We owe it to the \nAmerican people, to the millions of Americans and their families \nsuffering from life-altering disabilities and diseases, to demonstrate \nour Nation's full commitment to finding a cure and doing all we can to \nhelp their dreams and hopes come true. Stem cell research has vast \npotential for curing diseases, alleviating suffering, and saving lives. \nI know my colleagues recognize the enormous potential of this research, \ntoo. It is time for the President to start listening.\n  The question is, Why does President Bush continually ignore the \nAmerican people? He ignores what the American people are saying about \nIraq, and now he ignores what they are saying about embryonic stem cell \nresearch. Both decisions result in lost lives, and both decisions cause \npain and suffering. This is unacceptable to me and the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans. It should be unacceptable to the President as \nwell.\n  I am very passionate and dedicated to this cause because the promise \nof stem cell research has personally captivated my family, like it has \nso many other American families. My mother suffers from severe \nAlzheimer's disease. When I look at her empty gaze and her shriveled \nbody, I cannot help but wonder if we had started embryonic stem cell \nresearch years ago, would she still be suffering today, would she be \ncured, would she at least be able to recognize her children and her \ngrandchildren, would she have been with me on the day I took the oath \nof office in this Chamber.\n  I don't want my children to be asking the same types of questions. We \ncannot wait any longer.\n  The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is an ethical life-enhancing, \nlifesaving piece of legislation. I believe it is the moral obligation \nof the United States Government and the President of the United States \nto allow this process--these potential cures--to be fully explored.\n  Embryonic stem cell research holds the promise of hope and the \npossible restoration of life.\n  We owe it to current and future generations to ensure that their \nlives remain as bright and prosperous as today's science allows.\n  It is time for the President to start listening to the American \npeople and to the scientists, not just special interests. It is time \nfor him to sign this important piece of legislation into law and open \nthe door to the hope and promise of embryonic stem cell research.\n  It is time for hope and cures--not despair and disease.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for a \nvery eloquent and poignant presentation of his position on embryonic \nstem cell research. I think what the Senator reflected is, again, the \nhopes of so many families in America who have a loved one suffering \nfrom Alzheimer's or juvenile diabetes, or a young person who has had an \naccident and is a paraplegic for life with a spinal cord injury. You \nsay: What can we do to help? How can we help? Well, it is one thing to \nbe sympathetic--and we are sympathetic to those who suffer from \nillnesses or injuries--but if we have it within our grasp, as the \nSenator from New Jersey said, to open some doors and see what is behind \nthose doors, it seems to me we are compelled to do that.\n  We don't know where the scientific research may lead. But we do know \nif we don't do it, it is not going to lead anywhere. We know that. As I \nsaid earlier, the foundations are there to give hope to people that \nembryonic stem cell research will lead to great discoveries and \ntreatments and interventions. I can only say to my friend from New \nJersey that, in all of my meetings with scientists over the last dozen \nyears or more--and especially since Gerhardt and Thompson isolated stem \ncells in 1998--the scientific community's enthusiasm for this is almost \nboundless because they realize that harnessing the power of embryonic \nstem cells that can develop into any form of a cell in the body could \nlead to interventions and cures that are now beyond our grasp.\n  I listened to the Senator from New Jersey, especially when he talked \nabout opening doors. I have often likened biomedical research, \nscientific research, to saying if there are 10 doors, and you don't \nknow what is behind any of those doors, if you are only going to open \none door, what are your odds of finding the right answer? Well, if you \nopen two doors, the odds get better. If you open five doors, you know \nit is 50-50. So the more doors we open, the better our chances are of \nfinding these discoveries.\n  The Senator is right. If we open one door at a time, the odds are \nalways going to be 10 to 1--or I guess it would be 9 to 1. It would be \n9 to 1 that you are not going to find the right answer.\n  If we start opening all these doors and get the scientists talking \nwith one another and looking at things, well, that means the span of \ntime that it would take to find these cures is collapsed.\n  Scientists don't work in a vacuum. They collaborate. They talk with \none another. They read one another's papers. They find out what other \nscientists are doing. They find out if a scientist has opened a \ndifferent door and collaborate on that. That is why it is necessary to \nbegin to open these doors.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for talking about that point.\n  Earlier I was responding to the comments of my friend from Kansas, \nSenator Brownback. He was talking about 72 diseases being treated with \nadult stem cells. I pointed out his list included several types of \nleukemia and lymphomas, but I had printed in the Record earlier a \nletter from George Dahlman of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society saying \nthey support S. 5.\n  Senator Brownback's list also included testicular cancer. I have a \nletter from Craig Nichols, M.D., board member of the Lance Armstrong \nFoundation.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: As a member of the Lance Armstrong \n     Foundation's (LAF) Board of Directors, I am writing in \n     response to assertions that adult stem cells have treated or \n     cured the disease of testicular cancer. While the mission of \n     the LAF is to inspire and empower people affected by all \n     types of cancer, I feel that it is important to set the \n     record straight on this issue.\n       Testicular cancer is the most common cancer among men ages \n     15-35 and approximately 8,000 men will be diagnosed with \n     testicular cancer in the United States this year. While \n     testicular cancer is one of the most curable forms of cancer, \n     our organization would like to emphasize as the Senate \n     debates S. 5, the Stem Cell Research and Enhancement Act, \n     that we have not completely eradicated the disease.\n       There is not an FDA-approved adult stem cell treatment \n     generally available to treat testicular cancer. Rather, adult \n     stem cells enable testicular cancer patients to withstand a \n     higher dose of chemotherapy during treatment for the disease.\n       We support exploring every avenue of research, including \n     embryonic stem cell research within specified ethical limits, \n     until a cure is found. The most respected scientists in our \n     field view embryonic stem cells as an area of research that \n     must be explored, and one that our government must make a \n     commitment to support. The Lance Armstrong Foundation asks \n     that you and your colleagues pass S. 5, and not accept any \n     substitutes.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Craig Nichols, M.D.,\n\n                                              Member of the Board,\n                                       Lance Armstrong Foundation.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator Brownback's list of 72 diseases \nincludes Parkinson's disease. I have a letter\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\nfrom six Parkinson's groups: The American Parkinson's Disease \nAssociation, the Parkinson's Action Network, the Michael J. Fox \nParkinson's Research Foundation, the National Parkinson Foundation, the \nParkinson's Disease Foundation, and the Parkinson's Alliance & Unity \nWalk.\n  Here is what they say:\n\n       Opponents of S. 5 are using as ammunition the assertion \n     that embryonic stem cell research is not needed in this \n     country because many diseases, 72 of them, including \n     Parkinson's, have been treated or cured with adult stem \n     cells. This assertion is an absolute falsehood. If there were \n     a therapy to adequately treat the symptoms or halt the \n     progression of this unrelenting disease, the millions of \n     Parkinson's patients, caregivers and their physicians would \n     be pursuing that treatment right now. . . .\n       The Parkinson's community asks that you and your colleagues \n     pass S. 5 and not accept any substitutes.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Parkinson's Action Network,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: We recognize that you are hearing from \n     many patient advocacy and research organizations refuting a \n     belief that adult stem cells have been used in treating or \n     curing a long list of ailments, conditions and diseases. As \n     representatives of more than one million people with \n     Parkinson's disease and their families, our organizations \n     would like to emphasize as the Senate debates S. 5, the Stem \n     Cell Research and Enhancement Act, that we exist today \n     because we have NOT found a cure or adequate treatments for \n     Parkinson's using adult stem cells or otherwise. Furthermore, \n     Dr. Elias Zerhouni, Director of the National Institutes of \n     Health and President Bush's top scientist, when recently \n     testifying before the Senate declared that the idea that \n     adult stem cells hold as much promise as embryonic stem cells \n     ``doesn't hold scientific water.''\n       Because the unique promise of embryonic stem cell research \n     is critical to advancing understanding of and treatments for \n     Parkinson's disease, the Parkinson's community is dedicated \n     to expanding federal funding for embryonic stem cell \n     research. As you may know, Parkinson's occurs when dopamine \n     producing neurons in the brain die. To this date, scientists \n     have had more success in generating dopamine cells from human \n     embryonic stem cells than any other type of stem cell, \n     including adult, umbilical, or amniotic.\n       While replacement of these neurons may be one therapy \n     resulting from additional embryonic stem cell research, other \n     avenues of Parkinson's research will benefit from this \n     legislation and expansion of the current policy. Researchers \n     will be aided in studying the causes of Parkinson's, \n     developing more accurate models to improve our understanding \n     of the disease, and, ultimately, halting the unrelenting \n     neurological degeneration and loss of quality of life for \n     Parkinson' s patients.\n       Opponents of S. 5 are using as ammunition the assertion \n     that embryonic stem cell research is not needed in this \n     country because many diseases, 72 of them , including \n     Parkinson's, have been treated or cured with adult stem \n     cells. This assertion is an absolute falsehood. If there were \n     a therapy to adequately treat the symptoms or halt the \n     progression of this unrelenting disease, the millions of \n     Parkinson's patients, caregivers and their physicians would \n     be pursuing that treatment right now.\n       The most respected scientists in our field view embryonic \n     stem cells as an area of research that must be explored and \n     one that our government must make a commitment to support. \n     The Parkinson's community asks that you and your colleagues \n     pass S. 5 and not accept any substitutes.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joel Gerstel,\n       American Parkinson Disease Association.\n     Amy Comstock Rick,\n       Parkinson's Action Network.\n     Debi Brooks,\n       The Michael J.

Mr. President, Senator Brownback's list includes multiple \nsclerosis. Here is a letter from the National Multiple Sclerosis \nSociety:\n\n       S. 5 is the only bill that is pro-patient, pro-cure, and \n     pro-research. Please work to pass S. 5 immediately. Thank you \n     for bringing this important vote to the Senate floor.\n\n  Joyce Nelson, President and CEO of the National Multiple Sclerosis \nSociety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Multiple Sclerosis\n\n\n                                                      Society,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The National Multiple Sclerosis (MS) \n     Society strongly supports the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \n     Act (S. 5). We ask that as Majority Leader, you help champion \n     S. 5 through the Senate without any amendments and with the \n     widest possible majority of support.\n       The National MS Society believes all promising avenues of \n     research that could lead to the cure or prevention of MS or \n     relieve its symptoms must be explored. The Society supports \n     the conduct of scientifically meritorious medical research, \n     including research using human cells, in accordance with \n     Federal, State, and local laws and with adherence to the \n     strictest ethical and procedural guidelines. Research on all \n     types of stem cells is critical because we have no way of \n     knowing which type of stem cell will be of the most value in \n     MS research. Stem cells--adult or embryonic--could have the \n     potential to be used to protect and rebuild tissues that are \n     damaged by MS, and to deliver molecules that foster repair or \n     protect vulnerable tissues from further injury.\n       Until there is a cure for MS, we hold that every ethical \n     avenue of research, which may have the potential to prevent \n     or repair the consequences of this disease, must proceed and \n     be supported. Please communicate to your colleagues that only \n     a vote in favor of S. 5 is a vote in favor of moving stem \n     cell research forward in our county. A vote against S. 5 is a \n     vote against the 400,000 individuals living with the \n     devastating effects of MS and against progress for research.\n       S. 5 is the only bill that is pro-patient, procure, and \n     pro-research. Please work to pass S. 5 immediately. Thank you \n     for bringing this important vote to the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Joyce Nelson,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator Brownback's list also included \nspinal cord injury. Here is a letter from the Christopher and Dana \nReeve Foundation:\n\n       While there are indeed a number of promising avenues now \n     being investigated that address paralysis and spinal cord \n     injuries through rehabilitation, cellular therapies and \n     pharmaceuticals, there simply is no merit to any claim that \n     adult stem cells have successfully treated or cured spinal \n     cord injuries. . . .\n       The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation strongly endorses \n     the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, S. 5, and thanks you \n     for your leadership in bringing this vital legislation to the \n     Senate floor.\n\n  Signed by Peter Wilderotter, President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Christopher and Dana Reeve\n\n\n                                                   Foundation,\n\n                                                    April 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Majority Leader Reid: On behalf of the Christopher and Dana \n     Reeve Foundation (CDRF), I am writing to chronicle our \n     support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, S. 5. The \n     CDRF advocates for millions of Americans afflicted by \n     paralysis from injury or disease for expanded federal support \n     for embryonic stem cell research to ensure that science is \n     enabled to move forward as vigorously as possible. The Stem \n     Cell Research Enhancement Act is an ethical and responsible \n     means for science to do so, and I urge all of our Senators to \n     please vote ``Yes.''\n       We believe that absolute candor should rule in the stem \n     cell research debate and that the time has come to overthrow \n     the misguided tenets of its opponents. Research is not \n     performed in a vacuum. The CDRF funds a number of research \n     initiatives through our individual grants program, research \n     consortia, and translational fund and examines various \n     methods of research that can complement and ideally expedite \n     discoveries and treatments. While there are indeed a number \n     of promising avenues now being investigated that address \n     paralysis and spinal cord injuries through rehabilitation, \n     cellular therapies and pharmaceuticals, there simply is no \n     merit to any claim that adult stem cells have successfully \n     treated or cured spinal cord injuries.\n       The CDRF believes that embryonic stem cell research must \n     receive federal funding in order to advance this area of \n     scientific endeavor and which will potentially lead to \n     treatments and possibly cures for many truly devastating \n     diseases and disorders.\n       The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation strongly endorses \n     the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, S. 5 and thanks\n\n[[Page S4280]]\n\n     you for your leadership in bringing this vital legislation to \n     the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Peter T.

Here is a letter from the American Society of \nHematology:\n\n       ASH supports S. 5 because our members are interested in \n     expanding the current federal policy on embryonic stem cell \n     research to allow scientists to explore the full promise of \n     this field. The other bill that will be considered by the \n     Senate will not change current policy in any meaningful way. \n     . . .\n       Again, our Society urges your support of S. 5. . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           The American Society of Hematology,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the American Society of \n     Hematology (ASH), I urge you to vote ``yes'' on the Stem Cell \n     Research Enhancement Act (S. 5). This legislation expands \n     current policy by providing for federal funding of embryonic \n     stem cell research on lines derived after August 9, 2001 \n     while still requiring strong ethical guidelines for research.\n       Stem cell research is an issue that has been gaining import \n     with the general public over the past year and it is clearly \n     a high priority for our country. S. 5 is scheduled for floor \n     consideration in the Senate on April 10. Although at least \n     one additional bill will also be considered by the Senate, a \n     vote in favor of S. 5 is most critical. A vote against S. 5 \n     is unacceptable.\n       ASH represents more than 10,000 hematologists in the United \n     States who are committed to the study and treatment of blood \n     and blood-related diseases. ASH supports S. 5 because our \n     members are interested in expanding the current federal \n     policy on embryonic stem cell research to allow scientists to \n     explore the full promise of this field. The other bill that \n     will be considered by the Senate will not change current \n     policy in any meaningful way.\n       Hematologists have pioneered the field of stem cell \n     research for over 40 years with innovative discoveries about \n     adult bone marrow stem cells and how they could be used to \n     cure human diseases. Today, ASH members are poised to \n     contribute to research on embryonic stem cells that has the \n     potential to lead to the next generation of important \n     therapies for a broad range of intractable diseases.\n       Embryonic stem cell research could make a major difference \n     in the fight against many blood and blood-related diseases, \n     in addition to cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, \n     and spinal cord injuries. After nearly six years under \n     President Bush's restrictive federal policy, there are only \n     21 embryonic stem cell lines available for federal funding. \n     Research in this area has slowed to pace that is \n     unacceptable; S. 5 will reinvigorate embryonic stem cell \n     research in this country for the benefit of patients who are \n     suffering.\n       Again, our Society urges your support of S. 5. The current \n     federal embryonic stem cell research policy needs to expand \n     to help researchers find treatments and cures for over 100 \n     million Americans who suffer from many deadly and \n     debilitating diseases.\n           Thank you,\n                                            Andrew I. Schafer, MD,\n                                                         President\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a report in Science magazine analyzes the \nlist to which Senator Brownback referred. The authors found there are \nFDA-approved treatments for only nine diseases on Senator Brownback's \nlist and all of those are blood-related diseases such as leukemia.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article in Science be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                             Sciencexpress\n\n\n                adult stem cell treatments for diseases?\n\n       Opponents of research with embryonic stem (ES) cells often \n     claim that adult stem cells provide treatments for 65 human \n     illnesses. The apparent origin of those claims is a list \n     created by David A. Prentice, an employee of the Family \n     Research Council who advises U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R-\n     KS) and other opponents of ES cell research.\n       Prentice has said, ``Adult stem cells have now helped \n     patients with at least 65 different human diseases. It's real \n     help for real patients''. On 4 May, Senator Brownback stated, \n     ``I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \n     listing of 69 different human illnesses being treated by \n     adult and cord blood stem cells''.\n       In fact, adult stem cell treatments fully tested in all \n     required phases of clinical trials and approved by the U.S. \n     Food and Drug Administration are available to treat only nine \n     of the conditions on the Prentice list, not 65 [or 72]. In \n     particular, allogeneic stem cell therapy has proven useful in \n     treating hematological malignancies and in ameliorating the \n     side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Contrary to what \n     Prentice implies, however, most of his cited treatments \n     remain unproven and await clinical validation. Other claims, \n     such as those for Parkinson's or spinal cord injury, are \n     simply untenable.\n       The references Prentice cites as the basis for his list \n     include various case reports, a meeting abstract, a newspaper \n     article, and anecdotal testimony before a Congressional \n     committee. A review of those references reveals that Prentice \n     not only misrepresents existing adult stem cell treatments \n     but also frequently distorts the nature and content of the \n     references he cites.\n       For example, to support the inclusion of Parkinson's \n     disease on his list, Prentice cites Congressional testimony \n     by a patient and a physician, a meeting abstract by the same \n     physician, and two publications that have nothing to do with \n     stem cell therapy for Parkinson's. In fact, there is \n     currently no FDA-approved adult stem cell treatment--and no \n     cure of any kind--for Parkinson's disease.\n       For spinal cord injury, Prentice cites personal opinions \n     expressed in Congressional testimony by one physician and two \n     patients. There is currently no FDA-approved adult stem cell \n     treatment or cure for spinal cord injury.\n       The reference Prentice cites for testicular cancer on his \n     list does not report patient response to adult stem cell \n     therapy; it simply evaluates different methods of adult stem \n     cell isolation.\n       The reference Prentice cites on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma does \n     not assess the treatment value of adult stem cell \n     transplantation; rather, it describes culture conditions for \n     the laboratory growth of stem cells from lymphoma patients.\n       Prentice's listing of Sandhoff disease, a rare disease that \n     affects the central nervous system, is based on a layperson's \n     statement in a newspaper article. There is currently no cure \n     of any kind for Sandhoff disease.\n       By promoting the falsehood that adult stem cell treatments \n     are already in general use for 65 diseases and injuries, \n     Prentice and those who repeat his claims mislead laypeople \n     and cruelly deceive patients.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I see that my friend from New Jersey is \nalso in the Chamber. He has been a strong supporter of medical research \nthrough all his lifetime. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey. I assure him that if he needs more time, we will yield him some \nmore time. I yield to the distinguished Senator, my good friend, Mr. \nLautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague for \nhis leadership on this issue. I hope we can find out there are lots of \nleaders around here who just have not shown their intention to lead. I \ncongratulate Senator Harkin for his hard work.\n  People ask me why stem cell research isn't available. The people who \nask me that question most frequently are the families who come to see \nme. I love seeing their children. I am a grandfather of 10 kids. The \noldest is 13, the youngest is 3. When I look at what my \nresponsibilities as a Senator are, I think of my children and \ngrandchildren, and I think about everybody else's children and \ngrandchildren at the same time. I couldn't make it good enough for my \ngrandchildren when it comes to helping them rid themselves of a \ncondition, or permitting them to live an easy, normal life in many \ncases.\n  My oldest grandson is 13, and he is asthmatic. Whenever my daughter \ntakes him to play sports, she always checks to see where the nearest \nemergency clinic is because if he starts to wheeze or he needs some \nhelp, she wants to know where to go.\n  I see it with lots of visitors I have, like families with a diabetic \nchild. I had one boy who was 10 years old come to my office in New \nJersey. I sat around a long table with families who have a child who is \ndiabetic. I asked the kids their responses to their disease, what is \nthe worst part of it. They all said: Sticking your finger, and not \nfeeling good when everybody else looks as if they are having fun.\n  People ask me: Why can't we do something about this? We are spending \nbillions on a war that brings us gloom and despair, and we spend \nbillions on tax cuts for people who don't need them--but we need help.\n  This 10-year-old boy I referred to, when I asked him what the worst \npart of having diabetes was, he said: I can't go to sleep-overs \nanymore.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\n  He said: One time I slept over at my friend's house and during the \nnight I got sick and he called his mother and she got mad. So my \nparents won't let me go to sleep-overs anymore. I am sad about that \nbecause I like my friend, but we can't do anything about that.\n  Then he said: But I'm only going to live to 31 anyway.\n  With that his father sat right up and said: No, no, that's not true \nat all. We are going to take care of you.\n  I wish President Bush was in that office when I had some of those \nkids in there or when I have families with an autistic child come to \nmeet with me. It affects everything that the family does. It would \nmeans the world to them if their child could be treated to become \nhealthy.\n  We have an epidemic across our country with autism. We see that 1 in \nevery 150 families in America are affected by autism and the fact that \nthey must go to public agencies or hire teachers or send children to \nparticular schools.\n  When we look at the situation, we see that stem cells have the \npotential to save lives and alleviate the suffering of millions of \nAmericans. Of course we should fully fund research for embryonic stem \ncells regardless of when they were developed. That is common sense. But \nwe have a President who is held captive by ideologues who are at war \nwith science.\n  Over 5 years ago, President Bush enacted a policy that made no \nscientific sense, only political sense for his base. He put a stop to \nthe development of new stem cell lines for research. Once again, that \nis a devastating blow to people who have a diabetic in their family, or \ncancer, Parkinson's, autism, or other diseases.\n  In New Jersey, the number of those affected by autism is staggering. \nIn 1991, there were 234 cases of autism diagnosed. In 2005, less than \n15 years later, we saw 7,400 cases of autism.\n  We say we want to help these people, but the President says he \ndoesn't believe in it and threatens another veto when this bill is \npresented to him.\n  There is no good answer I can give these families and children. But I \ndo assure them that I will do all I can to reverse the President's \npolicy so we can work hard for a cure for their diseases.\n  Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to vote to help these kids. The \nscience is clear: Stem cell research, particularly embryonic stem cell \nresearch, has tremendous potential to help us better understand \ntreatments and cure a number of diseases. That is why Americans \noverwhelmingly support stem cell research. Studies show that 7 out of \n10 Americans--70 percent--favor embryonic stem cell research. Virtually \nevery major medical scientific and patient group supports embryonic \nstem cell research. Organizations such as the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Diabetes Association, the Christopher Reeve \nFoundation, the Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDs Foundation, and the \nlist goes on and on. In my home State of New Jersey, support for stem \ncell research is overwhelming. In fact, Rutgers University, our State \nuniversity, is one of the leading advocates of stem cell research.\n\n  Our country has always been about hope, about the chance for a better \nlife. So when President Bush talks about vetoing a stem cell research \nbill, it denies hope to millions of Americans. Last year, Congress \npassed similar legislation that would have reversed the President's \npolicy on stem cells, but the President vetoed that bill based on what \nhe calls ethics and morality. What is ethical about denying a cure to \nchildren suffering from diabetes? Is there anything moral about denying \npeople who have paralysis the chance to perhaps walk again?\n  Any real ethical issues are addressed by this bill. New stem lines \nwill come from embryos donated by fertility patients under strict \nguidelines. They will not be embryos created for research. What we are \ntalking about in this bill are embryos that would otherwise be disposed \nof, discarded, thrown away.\n  We stand at a crossroads in America. We can either take the position \nthat cells in a petri dish are a gift for healing or we can throw away \nthe opportunity to alleviate human suffering. The men, women, and \nchildren who suffer from diabetes and other life-threatening conditions \nare racing against time. Recent statistics show that one out of three \nchildren born today will suffer diabetes in their lifetime.\n  We have wasted so much time and opportunity already, between the \nPresident's policy and his veto last year. Those who would benefit from \nthe potential of embryonic stem cell research need the President to put \naside politics and deal with the facts. I would love to see President \nBush meet some of these families or see the children who come to meet \nwith me who are diabetic. We have had 300 children in one of the \nmeeting rooms in the Senate. To see those children, how beautiful they \nare, and how desperately they want help. Yet for some reason, our \nGovernment wont' help out. We see the President again threatening a \nveto and saying he will not permit funding for this research. It is a \nterrible thing.\n  I salute the bipartisan leadership of Senators Harkin and Specter on \nthis issue. Everybody in Congress and in this country has had contact \nwith someone who is suffering from a condition who desperately needs \nhelp. It is hard to understand why we wouldn't have 100 votes in this \nbody to say, yes, we want to do whatever we can for children who are \nsick or children who are likely to encounter these problems in the \nfuture. Yet the President has insisted on turning his back on these \nopportunities. It is a pity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains on our side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time on this side has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I obviously yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to resume the discussion on \nembryonic stem cell research. I wish to resume the discussion on adult \nstem cell successes and why we should not move forward on destroying \nmore human life for the purposes of research.\n  I wish to start out with a simple picture, a picture of one child, \nHannah. She was a frozen embryo. I wish to just go through this briefly \nbecause we talk about frozen embryos as though this is something you \ncan discard and there is really no significance here, or if there is, \nit is minimal, it is not really human, it is just something that is \nsitting there in a frozen state and we should just research on this \nperson. I note this because Hannah was a frozen embryo. She was \nadopted. She was implanted. Then here we are looking at her in April of \n2001 at age 28 months.\n  I met Hannah. She has been in my office. She is a bright, young, \nvivacious girl. I point out that she starts out as what we are talking \nabout researching on here--she starts out being frozen, alive, adopted \nas an embryo, arrives in a clinic, is thawed, implantated, and develops \na heartbeat. Here is a picture of her at 21 weeks. We can see her, and \nwe can see the development.\n  The reason I point this out, and I guess it should be obvious to \neverybody, but what we are talking about is something in embryology \nbooks that is defined as human. It is defined as a person with a 46-\nchromosomes. It is defined as a unique person who will never be \nrecreated. We are defining and talking about somebody. If these frozen \nembryos are adopted, they can be implanted and grow into human beings.\n  Hannah as she was in April of 2001, Hannah who was in my office.\n  I urge more people to look at this as a possible option. A number of \npeople have embryos at IVF clinics, frozen embryos at IVF clinics. This \nis a viable option if people don't want to have them implanted in \nthemselves. If they are extra, they could consider that there are a \nnumber of people who cannot conceive who want to adopt. I urge people \nto look at this as a possible and viable option and a beautiful option \nthat people would look at. This is happening quite a few times in \nplaces across the United States. It is important. It is a great option.\n  My wife and I have adopted two children--not at the frozen embryo \nstage\n\n[[Page S4282]]\n\nbut at a later stage. I can say with all candor, it is a wonderful \nthing. It has been a great gift to our family to have two of our \nchildren who are adopted. With the rest of our family, it has just been \nfabulous for all of us.\n  I hope people will look at this as a viable option. It is a viable \noption technologically. This is something people can do. You can do \nthis today. This can take place. It does take place. It is a regular \nevent that takes place. It is something you can feel good about in \ndoing and having a beautiful child who is here and functioning and in \nthe world and bringing joy to people's eyes.\n  Our two adopted children are both 9, and they bring great joy to \neverybody they are around. Even when they are bugging their older \nsister, they bring her joy. It is just a great thing to do, and I \nreally hope we can do a lot more of this if people would consider this \nas a real option rather than just saying these are extra embryos or \nthese are throwaways or they are going to be disposed of anyway. Why \nnot look for the best option? Why not look for this beautiful option \nwhich is out there instead of saying: Well, we can't do anything with \nthem anyway; let's just discard them.\n  There is another option here. There is a different chance. There is \nanother hope. That child, then, can bring into the world so much joy \nand possibilities that are endless. Why not that one? What is wrong \nwith that option? I hope people will really look at this as a real \nchance and something they can do.\n  In my earlier remarks, I read a definition from an embryology \ntextbook which affirmed that each individual life begins as a 46-\nchromosome embryo. The Presiding Officer did. I did. Senator Harkin \nfrom Iowa did. Textbook definitions are good, but living examples are \noften even better, and that is what I am showing in this chart. Of \ncourse, each one of us alive today is an example that life begins at an \nembryonic stage because we were all once embryos. Another clear example \nof this truth is those children today--137, I am told, with 16 \ncurrently in utero--who used to be numbered among the so-called spare \nor leftover embryos. That is not as many as I hope it will be, and I \nhope in the future we can have a lot more.\n  Last year, I had the privilege of meeting one of these young \nchildren, a young girl named Hannah. We can see her life growth along \nthis continuum in this chart. Of course, if she is terminated in any \nphase along this way, she is not out here. Life is that continuum. I \nwould like to draw the attention of my colleagues to this and in \nparticular ask, how can we just wantonly destroy these embryos for \nresearch purposes with taxpayer funding because they are allegedly \nspare, left over, or just going to be destroyed anyway? It is wrong to \nturn living human persons into research objects to be exploited. I \nbelieve those embryos which have been adopted make this point very \nwell.\n  I also wish to note that currently in the United States, it is not \nillegal anywhere in the country for a person to donate an embryo to \ndevelop a stem cell, an embryonic stem cell line. It is not illegal \nanywhere. What we are talking about in the Senate today is expanding \nthe Federal taxpayer funding for human embryonic stem cell research. We \nare talking about taxpayer funding of this research that is considered \nhighly unethical to a number of our fellow Americans. It is something \nwe do not need to do.\n  On the point of not needing to do fund this research with taxpayer \ndollars, I ask unanimous consent that an article be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This was an article posted at CNN at 4:05 eastern \ndaylight time that ``Type I diabetics live without insulin in stem cell \nexperiment.'' This is just out on CNN this afternoon. ``Thirteen young \ndiabetics in Brazil . . . '' That is a point I have been making. This \nresearch should be done in the United States. Instead, it is going \nother places:\n\n       Thirteen young diabetics in Brazil have ditched their \n     insulin shots and need no other medication, thanks to a risky \n     but promising treatment with their own stem cells--apparently \n     the first time such a feat has been accomplished.\n\n  This is just a highlighting of this particular article. Again, the \nresearch is being done in Brazil. You will see some consistency on \npoints. If you followed my earlier comments, I was talking about a \ngentleman who was getting a heart treatment with his own stem cells in \nBangkok, Thailand; a young lady in Illinois who received treatment for \nher spinal cord injury, a paraplegic, in Portugal. Now this diabetic \nwork is being done in Brazil. All of this adult stem cell work that is \ntaking place is outside of the country rather than being done here and \nus funding and doing it in America. If we are losing the battle in the \nresearch anywhere, it seems to be in the adult stem cell field that is \nproducing these types of treatments.\n  Let me proceed. This is an AP story. It was on CNN. I am reading:\n\n       Thirteen young diabetics in Brazil have ditched their \n     insulin shots and need no other medication thanks to a risky \n     but promising treatment with their own stem cells--\n     apparently the first time such a feat has been \n     accomplished. Though too early to call it a cure, the \n     procedure has enabled the young people, who have Type 1 \n     diabetes, to live insulin-free so far, some as long as \n     three years. The treatment involves stem cell transplants \n     from the patients' own blood.\n       ``It's the first time in the history of Type I diabetes \n     where people have gone with no treatment whatsoever . . . no \n     medications at all, with normal blood sugars,'' said study \n     co-author Dr. Richard Burt of Northwestern University's \n     medical school in Chicago, Illinois.\n       While the procedure can be potentially life-threatening, \n     none of the 15 patients in the study died or suffered lasting \n     side effects. But it didn't work for two of them. Larger, \n     more rigorous studies are needed to determine whether stem \n     cell transplants could become standard treatment for people \n     with the disease once called juvenile diabetes. It is less \n     common than Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with \n     obesity.\n       The hazards of stem cell transplantation also raise \n     questions about whether the study should have included \n     children. One patient was as young as 14. Dr. Lainie Ross, a \n     medical ethicist at the University of Chicago, said the \n     researchers should have studied adults first before exposing \n     young teens to the potential harms of stem cell transplant, \n     which include infertility and late-onset cancers. In \n     addition, Ross said that the study should have had a \n     comparison group to make sure the treatment was indeed better \n     than standard diabetes care.\n       Burt, who wrote the study protocol, said the research was \n     done in Brazil because U.S. doctors were not interested in \n     the approach. The study was approved by ethics committees in \n     Brazil, he said, adding that he personally believes it was \n     appropriate to do the research in children as well as adults, \n     as long as the Brazilian ethics panels approved. Burt and \n     other diabetes experts called the results an important step \n     forward.\n       ``It's the threshold of a very promising time for the \n     field,'' said Dr. Jay Skyler of the Diabetes Research \n     Institute at the University of Miami. Skyler wrote an \n     editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, \n     which published the study, saying the results are likely to \n     stimulate research that may lead to methods of preventing or \n     reversing Type 1 diabetes.\n       ``These are exciting results. They look impressive,'' said \n     Dr. Gordon Weir of Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, \n     Massachusetts. Still, Weir cautioned that more studies are \n     needed to make sure the treatment works and is safe. ``It's \n     really too early to suggest to people that this is a cure,'' \n     he said.\n       The patients involved were ages 14 to 31 and had newly \n     diagnosed Type 1 diabetes. An estimated 12 million to 24 \n     million people worldwide--including 1 to 2 million in the \n     United States--have this form of diabetes, which is typically \n     diagnosed in children or young adults. An autoimmune disease, \n     it occurs when the body attacks insulin-producing cells in \n     the pancreas. Insulin is needed to regulate blood sugar \n     levels, which, when too high, can lead to heart disease, \n     blindness, nerve problems and kidney damage.\n       Burt said the stem cell transplant is designed to stop the \n     body's immune attack on the pancreas.\n       A study published last year described a different kind of \n     experimental transplant, using pancreas cells from donated \n     cadavers, that enabled a few diabetics to give up insulin \n     shots. But that requires lifelong use of anti-rejection \n     medicine, which isn't needed by the Brazil patients since the \n     stem cells were their own.\n       The 15 diabetics were treated at a bone marrow center at \n     the University of Sao Paulo. All had newly diagnosed \n     diabetes, and their insulin-producing cells had not been \n     destroyed. That timing is key, Burt said. ``If you wait too \n     long,'' he said, ``you've exceeded the body's ability to \n     repair itself.''\n  And he talks about repairing itself later in this article. I wish to \nhit that point. The procedure involves stimulating the body into \nproducing new stem cells and harvesting them from the patient's blood. \nNext comes several days of high-dose chemotherapy, which virtually \nshuts down the patient's immune system and stops destruction of\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\nthe few remaining insulin-producing cells in the body. This requires \nhospitalization and potent drugs to fend off infection. The harvested \nstem cells, when injected back into the body, build a new healthier \nimmune system that does not attack the insulin-producing cells.\n  Patients were hospitalized for about 3 weeks. Many had side effects. \nOne developed pneumonia, the only severe complication. The doctors \nchanged the drug regime after treatments failed in the first patient \nwho ended up needing more insulin than before the study, and another \npatient also relapsed. The remaining 13 live ``a normal life without \ntaking insulin,'' said the study coauthor, Dr. Julio Voltareli of the \nUniversity of Sao Paulo. ``They all went back to their lives.''\n  The patients enrolled in the study at different times so the length \nof time they have been insulin-free also differs. Dr. Burgess had some \nsuccess using the same procedure in 170 patients with other autoimmune \ndiseases, including lupus and multiple sclerosis; one patient with an \nautoimmune form of blindness can now see, Dr. Burgess said, and then he \nhad this quote: The body has a tremendous potential to repair.\n  The study was partly funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and \nGenzyme Corporation, a maker of blood sugar monitoring products.\n  Now, why are we not doing these treatments in America? Why would we \nnot be funding this sort of work? We do not have unlimited amounts of \nfunds to go around. We are putting $613 million into speculative \nembryonic stem cell research that has produced no cures. Yet we are \nhaving people from the United States go to Bangkok and to Portugal and \nto Brazil to get these treatments that are financed by the Brazilian \nMinistry of Health, along with a private corporation that is the maker \nof blood sugar monitoring products. Why is it not being done here? \nThere are now 13 young diabetics who ditched their insulin shots. That \nis beautiful news. It should be done here.\n  Yet we are starving this field that is producing so many results, \nputting in $613 million into embryonic stem cell research that is \nhighly speculative, that is considered unethical by many of our fellow \ncitizenry in the United States, and is producing no treatments or \ncures, while people are going to Brazil to be able to deal with \ndiabetes or to Portugal to deal with spinal cord injuries or to \nThailand to deal with congestive heart failure and heart disease.\n  Now is something wrong with this? I think it clearly is wrong when we \nare not seeing these treatments here, the treatments are going to other \nplaces, and we are not funding them. We need to do more in the adult \nstem cell field, in the cord blood field, we need to do more in \namniotic fluid, we need to do more in the placenta stem cell field. \nAmerican citizens should not have to go to Brazil and other places to \nget this cutting-edge technology.\n  Yet we will spend a lot of time debating on the floor over embryonic \nstem cells, or the need to do research on both adult and embryonic, but \nthe problem is we do not have infinite amounts of money. We do have a \nlimited research budget. The money we are putting into the embryonic \nfield, destroying human life at taxpayer expense, does not go into \nadult stem cell work. It does not go into other areas where we could do \nmore research, to get the results that would treat people so that \ndiabetics do not need their insulin shots. It is cutting-edge work \nbeing done somewhere else. We are not funding it.\n  I want to talk, too, about another aspect of this that I have not \nbrought up previously, and that is private-sector funding. I note on \nthis diabetes story that was out on the AP wire that there was a \nprivate corporation, Genzyme Corporation, a maker of blood sugar \nmonitoring products.\n  It is not illegal anywhere to do embryonic stem cell research in this \ncountry, and if it is so promising in the health care field, one would \nthink there would be heavy private-sector investment taking place in \nembryonic stem cell research. If this is producing and holds the key to \ncuring Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and diabetes, then one would think \nthere would be a flood of private-sector money coming into this field \nto develop and to get the early patents on some of the work.\n  Let's see what is happening in the investor community on this. How \nmany private investors are going into it? We can talk about following \nthe money into the field. This is a July 17, 2006, edition of the New \nYork Sun, an article written by Harold Furchtgott-Roth, former FCC \nCommissioner. I wish to quote some from this article. I will put this \nin. He says this:\n\n       For investors, the debate over Federal funding of embryonic \n     stem cell research is an indication that profits are remote. \n     In many, if not most, areas of technology--including \n     electronics, chemistry, and computing--the frontiers of \n     research and development are spearheaded by private business. \n     Where profits are a powerful inducement, innovation needs \n     little federal funding.\n       From pharmaceuticals to electronic monitoring equipment, \n     much of medical research advances to the drumbeat of \n     capitalism. Innovative ideas are rewarded. Tens of billions \n     of private dollars in America and around the world finance \n     new research because it offers visible roads to rewards.\n\n  What does he say about stem cell research? We knew this to be true, \nthat there is heavy investment in the commercial sector in \npharmaceutical supplies and electronics and computing.\n  One of the big driving areas is the private sector or the investors \ngoing into these fields and investing heavily. So what are they doing \nin stem cell research, in embryonic stem cell research today?\n\n       To date, private investment in stem cell research has been \n     relatively small and unrewarding. Several publicly traded but \n     relatively small American companies\n\n  He lists a couple--\n\n        . . . conduct research and development on stem cells. Many \nprivately held companies also pursue stem cell research, but venture \ncapital backing for stem cell research is waning.\n\n  It is not growing, it is waning.\n\n       Nor is there substantial private research and development \n     migrating abroad. American financial institutions raise \n     enormous funds to invest in businesses engaged in medical \n     research both in America and abroad--\n\n  We certainly know that to be true--\n\n     but little if any of that money targets foreign investment in \n     stem cell research companies.\n       The current policy does not appear to have left America \n     backward in the basic science of stem cell research. \n     According to a recent study in ``Nature Biotechnology,'' \n     American scientists account for the dominant share of \n     research publications on embryonic stem cell research, and \n     the number of publications is growing rapidly. Perhaps \n     American science will be even more dominant with greater \n     Federal funding, but the stimulus for that funding should not \n     be that we are falling hopelessly behind the rest of the \n     world.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the rest of this article in its entirety be \ninserted at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2).\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, my point in saying this is that we know \nthis is true. We know that in the medical health field, if there are \nsome great results that are coming that could be patentable or provide \ntreatments--that the medical sector of our economy is growing as a \npercentage of the gross national product, that I think is somewhere \naround 15 percent now, growing faster, that there is a heavy investment \nin medical research taking place, we know that in the pharmaceutical \nindustry, we know that in the medical treatment areas that is taking \nplace.\n  So why is that not happening in embryonic stem cells? The reason is \nbecause it is not producing any results. Instead, we have health \nministries and corporations going abroad to make these investments in \nthe adult field when they feel like there is not sufficient interest \nhere taking place.\n  That should tell us something; that is, the private sector is not \nputting money in. Indeed, the private-sector research is waning. These \nare all indicators that we ought to be looking at and asking ourselves: \nWhat is taking place?\n  Now earlier I covered some of the advances in stem cell research that \nhas happened, and I note I wish to build on the statement put forward \nby today's AP story on Type 1 Diabetes being treated in Brazil with \nadult stem cells and my comments about the lack of private-sector \ninvestment.\n  I wish to hit another point as to why the private sector is not \ninvesting in embryonic stem cell research. I made it part of this \npresentation earlier, but I wish to make it stronger now; that is,\n\n[[Page S4284]]\n\nthat embryonic stem cells produce tumors.\n  This is continuing to come out in all the data, and I think it is \npart of the reason why you do not see private investors going into this \nfield. If this is the pharmaceutical field and the drugs you are \ntreating people with are producing tumors, it is unlikely that that \ndrug is going to get approved by the FDA, it is unlikely it is going to \nmove forward in any sort of drug delivery system or it is going to be \naccepted by the public if there is a high likelihood that you are going \nto get tumors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to put this set of documents \nin at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3).\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This is a series of front pages of articles of the \nvarious scientific publications where we have had, to date, tumors \nbeing developed by embryonic stem cells. These are in animal models \nbecause, of course, we do not have any human clinical trials that are \ntaking place yet with embryonic stem cells. These are all in the animal \nfield. But we are seeing continuously in the research results, as I \nstated earlier, that the embryonic stem cells injected into animal \nmodels are creating teratomas, creating tumors.\n  This, as I quoted earlier, happened in the fetal tissue debate of 15 \nyears ago, when they were creating teratomas or tumors, and we are now \nseeing the tumors come up again consistently in the research data on \nembryonic stem cell work. And here--this gets quite technical. But I \nwish to read some of the quotations in these various articles, that if \nany of my colleagues would like to look it up, this will be in the \nRecord.\n  Here is a research article from 2004, when cultures were transplanted \nin diabetic mice--we were just talking about a successful diabetic \ntreatment in humans--this is in diabetic mice. They formed teratomas--\nagain those are tumors--and did not reverse the hyperglycemic state. \nThis is the first page of a 2004 scientific publication. Here is an \nembryonic stem cell publication, and this is the front page of this \narticle, that is out in a 2006 article: Embryonic stem cells derived \nneuroprogeny, more than 70 percent of mice that received these types of \nembryonic stem cells developed teratomas, thus posing a major safety \nproblem is what this article noted, that 70 percent of mice developed \ntumors. It does not sound like that one is going very well.\n  We have another one in the Stem Cell publication, again 2006 \npublication, developed severe teratomas, in this particular \npublication, using human embryonic stem cells again in lab rats, \ngrafted into lab rats. That one is not going very well.\n  Here is a 2005 article from a publication: Four weeks \npostimplantation, cells implanted in high numbers formed teratomas in \nthe majority of the animals implanted. That one is not going very well.\n  Here is a Brazilian publication involving brain tissue: Unlimited \nself-renewal in high differentiation poses the risk of tumor induction \nafter engraftment. This is December of 2004. That one is taking place, \nand it is not going very well.\n\n  Here is another publication. This one is from 2003. Conclusions: \nTransplanted ES cells can be grafted. The cells will, however, form a \ntumor if they leak into an improper space such as the thoracic cavity. \nNow we have a bigger problem. If the stem cells leak into another area, \nthey form tumors in other parts of the body. That is not going very \nwell.\n  Here is another publication. This is a 2005 publication. When the \ncultured cells were transplanted into diabetic mice, they reversed the \nhyperglycemic case for 3 weeks, but the rescue failed due to immature \nteratoma formation and then formed cancer cells. So they did something \nfor 3 weeks, and that didn't work out very well.\n  Here is another publication. This is out of Washington University, \n2004. Results suggest transplanting ES cells into the injured spinal \ncord does not improve locomotive recovery and can lead to tumor-like \ngrowth of cells, accompanied by increased debilitation, morbidity, and \nmortality. That one is not going well.\n  That is a set of publications. This is just the front pages of these \nthat I am entering into the Record. My point is not to belittle \nembryonic stem cells. My point is this is highly consistent with the \nfetal tissue work earlier and what is working. We have a route that is \nmoving. Why would we move on forward, putting $620 million of Federal \nmoney into an area that has not worked for 25 years.\n  I recognize my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wanted to ask my colleague if he will yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague for the many hours of effort he \nhas put into this to analyze the data that is out there about this \nimportant issue. It has been helpful to us. I know some people think it \nis an easy question for them. Senator Brownback has taken the road less \ntraveled. He has been willing to dig into the issue because it does \ntouch on real moral and ethical questions. It is not a light matter.\n  Let me ask the Senator a question. Is it true that the embryonic stem \ncells we are talking about here, if allowed to grow and mature, would \nbe a human being, and that human being's height, hair, eye color, and \nall, would have been determined at that very moment when it was at that \nembryonic stem cell stage, how they would grow and mature?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes. My colleague states the obvious. It is when you \nget that first set of chromosomes from your mother and father that your \nhair color, so many of your features are determined. It doesn't change. \nThat is your genetic material, and you get it from the very earliest \ninstance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So the life that is being proposed here, it is life, I \nthink no one can dispute that. It is a living organism. This life, if \nallowed to develop, will be developed into a distinct human person?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So I think that implicates some questions to all of us. \nIt is not a thing outside the realm of reason. Good people question \nwhether we should experiment on that life. You had a number of children \nwho were brought here, snowflake babies. I didn't get to be with you on \nthat occasion, but it was reported to me. Would you tell us about those \nchildren you saw?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I have a picture of one here. This is Hannah, one of \nthe first snowflake babies. It is a pretty simple and direct story. \nJust like you and me, they started out as embryos. They went into a \nfrozen state for a period of time. Then they were allowed to be adopted \nby other individuals and implanted into a mother's womb and then grew \nin a normal process that takes place. The point you made earlier that I \nthink should be so obvious to all of our colleagues is this is Hannah \nhere and this is Hannah at an earlier stage when she is an embryo, just \nas we were at one point in time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This very type embryo is what we are talking about \nexperimenting with under the legislation that is before us.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. With Federal taxpayer dollars; that is what we are \ntalking about.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to this, we know good people can differ. I \ncertainly believe good people can differ. I don't count myself morally \nsuperior to anybody on these questions. I am not a scientist. I \ncertainly haven't studied it to the extent that you or other Members of \nthis body have. Senator Coburn and Senator Hatch and others have \nstudied it. Some have different opinions about it. I don't think it is \nan insignificant matter that this is a piece of life, a small embryonic \nlife that would grow into a distinct human being. That is what we are \ntalking about providing Federal funds to experiment with.\n  It is not a crime today for a private person or a university to \nexperiment on this, even if it causes people moral and ethical \nproblems, is it?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct. It is not a crime today.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Private people are doing that today?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I guess in 2001, President Bush acknowledged there were \nembryonic lines available at that time and that any action we took at \nthat moment against those lines did not implicate human life. He said \nthose lines\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\nwould be available for embryonic stem cells for any university that \nwould apply; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct, and that Federal taxpayer funds could \nbe used to experiment on those human embryonic stem cell lines where \nthe life-and-death decision had already been made.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I had heard at some point that those lines may not be \ncontinuing, but I am informed that in fact those lines do continue, at \nleast some of them, and that there is a substantial number of embryonic \ncells available for research if they were asked for, but they haven't \nbeen all utilized; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct as well.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So when we get up to this line of experimenting with \nhuman life, one of the things I would ask myself is, is this medically \nnecessary? Is this a matter about which we are debating that would \nprevent some sort of research? The way I see it, there are federally \nfunded stem cells available for research today, as you have explained. \nThen there is no limit whatsoever on the number of stem cells that are \navailable in the private sector, at our universities and our great \nresearch centers in the world and in the United States; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct. Any sort of private sector investment \ncan take place, any sort of State or local investment can take place, \nalthough, as I noted in the article, the private sector does not seem \nto be putting much money into the field. I believe that is clearly \nbecause of a lack of results.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is important for you to share with us. \nBecause decisions become easier when there is not a crisis. We deal \nwith self-defense issues and moral issues a lot of times, but doesn't \nseem to me we are at that critical juncture in our scientific activity \nthat would require the American people, through the expenditures of \ntheir dollars, to affirm this procedure. Would the Senator not agree if \nthe American people fund this procedure, then it represents a national \nblessing of the procedure, in effect, an approval of this procedure as \nmoral and legitimate?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Well, it clearly does. It says you treat the youngest \nof human life as property, not as a person. You noted this is alive. \nYet some would say it is not a life. It is alive, but it has not yet \nrisen to the level of being a human life. This would say we can treat \nhumans at the youngest age of their life continuum as property and that \nwe will use Federal taxpayer dollars to destroy them and to do research \non them at that point in time. If you can do that at earlier stages, \nwhy not later? What is the differentiation? At what point in time does \nthis become removed from property to becoming a person as it somehow \ndoes magically in this process? My point is, the place to start is at \nthe beginning, when the life begins. Otherwise, there is no significant \nplace you can draw any line along the way saying at this point in time \nit becomes a person entitled to the protection of the law and society. \nRight now we are treating the youngest of humans as property.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am uneasy about it. I don't claim to know all of it. \nI haven't studied it to the extent you have. I know entities of great \naugustness such as the Catholic Church have serious theologians and \nscientists. They are uneasy with it. I am not Catholic, but I \nunderstand that. People have invested a lot of time and effort and feel \nthis is crossing a line that is dangerous for us to cross. From what I \nam hearing from your remarks, you don't think it is necessary to cross \nthat line to do the kind of research that could actually save lives and \nthat we all hope will save lives one day?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If our objective is healing people, if that is our \nobjective, we have a far more likely route, a route that is already \nproducing substantial success that is lying right in front of us, \nwithout ethical concerns or dilemmas--adult stem cells, cord blood. \nIncreasingly, in the future, in amniotic fluid we will find abundant \nsupplies of stem cells with no moral problems whatsoever. That is what \ndoesn't make any sense to me either. We are going to take away all \nhuman dignity from the youngest humans. We are going to do so in an \narbitrary fashion because we are not saying where you develop the \nstatus of human dignity at some point in time, but we are going to take \nit away from you here. We are going to use Federal taxpayer dollars to \ndestroy you. Yet we have another way that is producing good results in \nthe adult stem cells, stem cells in your body and in mine, and this \nroute is producing tumors. It doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense \nwhy we would invest $613 million more into the future as we have in the \npast since 2002. Why would you put more into this area that has all \nthese problems? I respect my colleagues who are on the other side of \nthis debate. They want to produce results and they want to cure people. \nBut it seems as if all the evidence is leading us the other way without \nethical dilemma. So why would we then do that, if all the evidence is \npointing another way and we don't have unlimited resources, we can't \nput this to better, higher use, and not having hopefully people in the \nfuture have to leave our country to get adult stem cell therapies from \nout of country?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will say this, I thank you for utilizing the free \nspeech this great Senate allows us to raise questions that some perhaps \njust as soon would not talk about. I do think a decent respect for \nthose millions of Americans who strongly believe this is not a good \nthing to do, that this is crossing boundaries we ought not to cross, \nand saying we are going to take your money in disrespect of your views \nand spend it on a procedure you strongly feel is not the right thing, \ncommitting our Nation officially as approving this procedure is not a \nbridge we have to cross. That is where I come down at this point. I do \nnot claim to be all knowing, but that is what I would say.\n\n  I say to Senator Brownback, I would share with you a letter I \nreceived in March, just about a month ago, from a constituent in my \nState who e-mailed me in support of S. 5, and I sent back some of the \nthoughts my staff and I had put together on it. I got this letter. It \nis addressed to me, but it could probably be better addressed to you \nbased on the work you and others have done. He had a child who had a \nrecent four-wheeler accident and was a quadriplegic. This is his quote:\n\n       In our desire to see our son again have use of his limbs, \n     we allowed our opinions to be influenced by the media. You \n     were so kind to respond to our e-mail with a letter stating \n     your opinions and thoughts. After doing more research, \n     listening to the opinions of a long-time quadriplegic, and \n     praying about this issue, we are pleased with the position \n     you have taken against this legislation. We felt we owed you \n     an apology--\n\n  They certainly did not--\n\n     and thank you for your adherence to Christian moral \n     boundaries when voting on public policy.\n\n  I know a lot of people have different views on this issue, and some \nthink everybody in the country has a certain view on it. But I think if \nmore people understood the remarks you made, the great research that is \nongoing that could actually cure or heal spinal cord injuries, could \nhelp with diabetes and Parkinson's and other diseases--if this were \ncritical to the passage of this legislation, I think we would have a \nmore difficult choice to make.\n  But I think, as you have explained it, at this point in history and \nin science, we are at a point where that research can continue. It is \nnot stopped, and it is not necessary for us to make that final step to \ncross this barrier and begin to officially, as a nation, experiment \nwith human life.\n  So I say to the Senator, thank you for your work. You have led me \naround to this position. I think I will not be supporting S. 30 and \nwill be supporting S. 5. I think it is a better way--excuse me, which \none is it, I ask Senator Brownback?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. S. 30.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, I think you are correct. I will be supporting S. \n30 and voting against S. 5. And this has been an important debate. The \nAmerican people have had the opportunity to hear some good arguments \nand a great deal of science and research. We are heading in the right \ndirection, I believe, with the President saying he will not accept S. \n5. I respect him for it. He stood up, absolutely. He has studied the \nissue, and he has firm views about it. Whereas the legislation may pass \nhere, I am hopeful it will not finally become law.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Alabama. I note for his\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\nconstituent, who sent such a kind letter, one of our lead examples is \nthis woman shown in this picture, Jacki Rabon, who is a paraplegic, not \na quadriplegic, from a car accident and was treated with adult stem \ncells--her own--in Portugal instead of the United States and is now \nwalking with the aid of braces. There is tingling and feeling now \nthroughout her legs, and hopefully that will continue. In all of these \ncases, it is important we get early treatments and people get treated--\nand I want to see that increasingly in the United States.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me just interrupt you there because people miss \nthis, perhaps. You are saying she was treated with adult stem cells?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. She was treated with her own stem cells.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So it was not necessary for her treatment to have \nembryonic stem cells?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It was not necessary. The only thing that was \nnecessary is she had to travel to Portugal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the Senator has now \nexpired.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nExhibit 1\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Type 1 Diabetics Live Without Insulin in Stem Cell Experiment\n\n       Chicago, IL (AP).--Thirteen young diabetics in Brazil have \n     ditched their insulin shots and need no other medication \n     thanks to a risky, but promising treatment with their own \n     stem cells--apparently the first time such a feat has been \n     accomplished. '\n       Though too early to call it a cure, the procedure has \n     enabled the young people, who have Type I diabetes, to live \n     insulin-free so far, some as long as three years. The \n     treatment involves stem cell transplants from the patients' \n     own blood.\n       ``It's the first time in the history of Type I diabetes \n     where people have gone with no treatment whatsoever . . . no \n     medications at all, with normal blood sugars,'' said study \n     co-author Dr. Richard Burt of Northwestern University's \n     medical school in Chicago, Illinois.\n       While the procedure can be potentially life-threatening, \n     none of the 15 patients in the study died or suffered lasting \n     side effects. But it didn't work for two of them.\n       Larger, more rigorous studies are needed to determine \n     whether stem cell transplants could become standard treatment \n     for people with the disease once called juvenile diabetes. It \n     is less common than Type II diabetes, which is associated \n     with obesity.\n       The hazards of stem cell transplantation also raise \n     questions about whether the study should have included \n     children. One patient was as young as 14.\n       Dr. Lainie Ross, a medical ethicist at the University of \n     Chicago, said the researchers should have studied adults \n     first before exposing young teens to the potential harms of \n     stem cell transplant, which include infertility and late-\n     onset cancers.\n       In addition, Ross said that the study should have had a \n     comparison group to make sure the treatment was indeed better \n     than standard diabetes care.\n       Burt, who wrote the study protocol, said the research was \n     done in Brazil because U.S. doctors were not interested in \n     the approach. The study was approved by ethics committees in \n     Brazil, he said, adding that he personally believes it was \n     appropriate to do the research in children as well as adults, \n     as long as the Brazilian ethics panels approved.\n       Burt and other diabetes experts called the results an \n     important step forward.\n\n\n                          very promising time\n\n       ``It's the threshold of a very promising time for the \n     field,'' said Dr. Jay Skyler of the Diabetes Research \n     Institute at the University of Miami.\n       Skyler wrote an editorial in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association, which published the study, saying the \n     results are likely to stimulate research that may lead to \n     methods of preventing or reversing Type I diabetes.\n       ``These are exciting results. They look impressive,'' said \n     Dr. Gordon Weir of Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, \n     Massachusetts.\n       Still, Weir cautioned that more studies are needed to make \n     sure the treatment works and is safe. ``It's really too early \n     to suggest to people that this is a cure,'' he said.\n       The patients involved were ages 14 to 31 and had newly \n     diagnosed Type I diabetes. An estimated 12 million to 24 \n     million people worldwide--including 1 to 2 million in the \n     United States--have this form of diabetes, which is typically \n     diagnosed in children or young adults. An autoimmune disease, \n     it occurs when the body attacks insulin-producing cells in \n     the pancreas.\n       Insulin is needed to regulate blood sugar levels, which \n     when too high, can lead to heart disease, blindness, nerve \n     problems and kidney damage.\n       Burt said the stem cell transplant is designed to stop the \n     body's immune attack on the pancreas.\n       A study published last year described a different kind of \n     experimental transplant, using pancreas cells from donated \n     cadavers, that enabled a few diabetics to give up insulin \n     shots. But that requires lifelong use of anti-rejection \n     medicine, which isn't needed by the Brazil patients since the \n     stem cells were their own.\n       The 15 diabetics were treated at a bone marrow center at \n     the University of Sao Paulo.\n       All had newly diagnosed diabetes, and their insulin-\n     producing cells had not been destroyed.\n       That timing is key, Burt said. ``If you wait too long,'' he \n     said, ``you've exceeded the body's ability to repair \n     itself.''\n       The procedure involves stimulating the body to produce new \n     stem cells and harvesting them from the patient's blood. Next \n     comes several days of high-dose chemotherapy, which virtually \n     shuts down the patient's immune system and stops destruction \n     of the few remaining insulin-producing cells in the body. \n     This requires hospitalization and potent drugs to fend off \n     infection. The harvested stem cells, when injected back into \n     the body, build a new healthier immune system that does not \n     attack the insulin-producing cells.\n       Patients were hospitalized for about three weeks. Many had \n     side effects including nausea, vomiting and hair loss. One \n     developed pneumonia, the only severe complication.\n       Doctors changed the drug regimen after the treatment failed \n     in the first patient, who ended up needing more insulin than \n     before the study. Another patient also relapsed.\n       The remaining 13 ``live a normal life without taking \n     insulin,'' said study co-author Dr. Julio Voltarelli of the \n     University of Sao Paulo. ``They all went back to their \n     lives.''\n       The patients enrolled in the study at different times so \n     the length of time they've been insulin-free also differs.\n       Burt has had some success using the same procedure in 170 \n     patients with other autoimmune diseases, including lupus and \n     multiple sclerosis; one patient with an autoimmune form of \n     blindness can now see, Burt said.\n       ``The body has tremendous potential to repair,'' he said.\n       The study was partly funded by the Brazilian Ministry of \n     Health, Genzyme Corp. and a maker of blood sugar monitoring \n     products.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                 [From the New York Sun, July 17, 2007]\n\n              In the Stem Cell Debate, Count Investors Out\n\n                      (By Harold Furchtgott-Roth)\n\n       The Senate this week will consider legislation to expand \n     federal funding for scientific and medical research of human \n     embryonic stem cells. It promises to be an emotional debate, \n     largely uninfluenced by the sober calculus of the investment \n     community. Whatever the outcome, investment opportunities are \n     not immediate.\n       Large parts of the academic and scientific community insist \n     on the medical benefits of expanded federal funding for such \n     research, a view shared by Majority Leader Frist and many \n     Senate Democrats. But the commercial benefits are not there \n     yet.\n       For investors, the debate over federal funding of embryonic \n     stem cell research is an indication that profits are remote. \n     In many, if not most, areas of technology--including \n     electronics, chemistry, and computing--the frontiers of \n     research and development are spearheaded by private business. \n     Where profits are a powerful inducement, innovation needs \n     little federal funding.\n       From pharmaceuticals to electronic monitoring equipment, \n     much of medical research advances to the drumbeat of \n     capitalism. Innovative ideas are rewarded. Tens of billions \n     of private dollars in America and around the world finance \n     new research because it offers visible roads to rewards.\n       Other areas of research have enormous merit and advance \n     scientific knowledge, but promise little if any profit. \n     Sponsors of such research request federal and other \n     noncommercial funding because private investment would be \n     profoundly risky, if not pointless.\n       Thus, in this week's Senate debate, the primary issue is \n     not whether stem cell research is lawful, but which forms the \n     federal government will fund. Some day, perhaps, profit \n     incentives for stem cell research will make federal funding \n     unnecessary, but we are far from that outcome.\n       To date, private investment in stem cell research has been \n     relatively small and unrewarding. Several publicly traded but \n     relatively small American companies, including Aastrom, \n     Geron, StemCells, and ViaCell, conduct research and \n     development on stem cells. Many privately held companies also \n     pursue stem cell research, but venture capital backing for \n     stem cell research is waning.\n       Nor is there evidence of substantial private research and \n     development migrating abroad. American financial institutions \n     raise enormous funds to invest in businesses engaged in \n     medical research both in America and abroad, but little if \n     any of that money targets foreign investments in stem cell \n     research companies.\n       Many leading medical research areas such as Germany have \n     far greater restrictions on stem cell research than America. \n     A few, such as Britain, Japan, Korea, and China, have \n     relatively few restrictions on stem cell research, but most \n     research is conducted by the government.\n       The current policy does not appear to have left America \n     backward in the basic science of stem cell research. \n     According to a recent study in ``Nature Biotechnology,'' \n     American\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\n     scientists account for the dominant share of research \n     publications on embryonic stem cell research, and the number \n     of publications is growing rapidly. Perhaps American science \n     will be even more dominant with greater federal funding, but \n     the stimulus for that funding should not be that we are \n     falling hopelessly behind the rest of the world.\n       The Senate debate will not be strongly influenced by the \n     investment community. Because investment opportunities are \n     small, American financial institutions are not waiting to \n     pour hundreds of billions of dollars in private companies if \n     the federal government were to expand funding for stem cell \n     research.\n       Most of the debate is about the ethics of stem cell \n     research. Most Senate Republicans worry about the ethics of \n     embryonic research, particularly about possible incentives \n     for creating embryos for harvesting. Senate Democrats focus \n     more on potential benefits from research.\n       Federally funded scientific research often takes years or \n     decades to yield commercial applications, if ever. Embryonic \n     stem cell research, despite all of its enormous promise and \n     political cache, is no different. If it were different, it \n     would not need federal funding. This week's debate, while \n     having enormous political stakes for the Senate, will simply \n     confirm to investors that widespread commercial applications \n     of stem cell research remain distant.\n       Almost five years ago, President Bush unveiled a policy \n     that for the first time permitted limited federally funded \n     research of stem cells. It was attacked from both sides at \n     the time and will certainly be attacked again this week in \n     the Senate. Despite the rhetoric, the policy has not put \n     American scientists or investors at an international \n     disadvantage.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n Insulin Expressing Cells From Differentiated Embryonic Stem Cells Are \n                             Not Beta Cells\n\n   [By S. Sipione, A. Eshpeter, J. G. Lyon G., S. Korbutt, and R.C. \n                               Bleackley]\n\n\n                                Abstract\n\n       Aim/hypothesis. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been \n     proposed as a potential source of tissue for transplantation \n     for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes. However, studies \n     showing differentiation of beta cells from ES cells are \n     controversial. The aim of this study was to characterise the \n     insulin-expressing cells differentiated in vitro from ES \n     cells and to assess their suitability for the treatment of \n     diabetes.\n       Methods. ES cell-derived insulin-expressing cells were \n     characterised by means of immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and \n     functional analyses. Activation of the Insulin I promoter \n     during ES-cell differentiation was assessed in ES-cell lines \n     transfected with a reporter gene. ES cell-derived cultures \n     were transplanted into STZ-treated SCID-beige mice and blood \n     glucose concentrations of diabetic mice were monitored for 3 \n     weeks.\n       Results. Insulin-stained cells differentiated from ES cells \n     were devoid of typical beta-cell granules, rarely showed \n     immunoreactivity for C-peptide and were mostly apoptotic. The \n     main producers of proinsulin/insulin in these cultures were \n     neurons and neuronal precursors and a reporter gene under the \n     control of the insulin I promoter was activated in cells with \n     a neuronal phenotype. Insulin was released into the \n     incubation medium but the secretion was not glucose-\n     dependent. When the cultures were transplanted in diabetic \n     mice they formed teratomas and did not reverse the \n     hyperglycaemic state.\n       Conclusions/Interpretation. Our studies show that insulin-\n     positive cells in vitro-differentiated from ES cells are not \n     beta cells and suggest that alternative protocols, based on \n     enrichment of ES cell-derived cultures with cells of the \n     endodermal lineage, should be developed to generate true beta \n     cells for the treatment of diabetes.

Whereas teratoma \n     formation rarely occurs in xenogeneic transplantation \n     paradigms of ES cell-derived neural progeny, more than 70% of \n     mice that receive murine ES cell-derived neural precursor \n     cells develop teratomas, thus posing a major safety problem \n     for allogeneic and syngeneic transplantion paradigms. Here we \n     introduced a new differentiation protocol based on the \n     generation of substrate-adherent ES cell-derived neural \n     aggrgates (SENAs) that consist predominantly of neuronally \n     committed precursor cells. Purified SENAs that were \n     differentiated into immature but postmitotic neurons did not \n     form tumors up to four months after syngeneic transplantation \n     into the acutely degenerated striatum and showed robust \n     survival.

We have investigated the effect of \n     in vitro predifferentiation on in vivo survival and \n     differentiation of hESCs implanted into the 6-OHDA (6-\n     hydroxydopamine)-lesion rat model of PD. The hESCs were \n     cocultured with PA6 cells for 16, 20, or 23 days, lending to \n     the in vitro differentiation into DA neurons. Grafted hESC-\n     derived cells survived well and expressed neuronal markers. \n     However, very few exhibited a DA neuron phenotype. Reversal \n     of lesion-induced motor deficts was not observed. Rats \n     grafted with hESCs predifferentiated in vitro for 16 days \n     developed severe teratomas, with hESCs predifferentiated for \n     20 and 23 days remained healthy until the end of the \n     experiment. This indicates that prolonged in vitro \n     differentiation of hESCs is essential for preventing \n     formation of teratomas.

A major \n     feature of a-mannosidosis is progressive neurological \n     decline, for which there is no safe and effective treatment \n     available. We have a guinea pig model of a-mannosidosis that \n     models the human condition. This study investigates the \n     feasibility of implanting differentiated mouse embryonic stem \n     cells in the neonatal guinea pig brain in order to provide a \n     source of a-mannosidase to the affected central nervous \n     system.\n       Cells implanted at a low dose (1.5 103 cells per \n     hemisphere) at 1 week of age were found to survive in very \n     low numbers in some immunosuppressed animals out to 8 weeks. \n     Four weeks post-implantation, cells implanted in high numbers \n     (105 cells per hemisphere) formed teratomas in the \n     majority of the animals implanted. Although implanted cells \n     were found to migrate extensively within the brain and \n     differentiate into mature cells of neural (and other) \n     lineages, the safety issue related to uncontrolled cell \n     proliferation precluded the use of this cell type for longer-\n     term implantation studies. We conclude that the pluripotent \n     cell type used in this study is unsuitable for achieving safe \n     engraftment in the guinea pig brain.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Neurally Selected Embryonic Stem Cells Induce Tumor Formation After \n   Long-Term Survival Following Engraftment Into the Subretinal Space\n\n  [By Stefan Arnhold, Helmut Klein, Irina Semkova, Klaus Addicks, and \n                          Ulrich Schraermeyer]\n\n       Purpose. To determine whether transplantation of embryonic \n     stem (ES) cells into the subretinal space of rhodopsin-\n     knockout mice has a tumorigenic effect.\n       Methods. Mouse ES-cell-derived neural precursor cells \n     carrying the sequence for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) \n     gene were grafted subretinally into the eyes of \n     rhodopsin-/-mice, whereas control animals \n     underwent sham surgery. Eyes were retrieved after 2, 4, and 8 \n     weeks after cell injection or sham surgery for histologic \n     analysis.\n       Results. Gross morphologic, histologic, and \n     immunohistochemical analysis of eyes at 2 and 4 weeks after \n     engraftment exhibited no morphologic alterations, whereas \n     neoplasia formation was detected in 50% of the eyes evaluated \n     at 8 weeks after engraftment. Because the neoplasias \n     expressed differentiation characteristics of the different \n     germ layers, they were considered to be teratomas. The \n     resultant tumor formation affected almost all layers of the \n     eye, including the retina, the vitreous, and the choroid.\n       Conclusions. Although ES cells may provide treatment for \n     degenerative disease in the future, their unlimited self-\n     renewal and high differentiation potential poses the risk of \n     tumor induction after engraftment. Thus, more care must be \n     taken before using ES cell transplantation as a therapeutic \n     option for patients with degenerative disease. Invest. \n     Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004;45:1251-1255)\n       Advances in stem cell research and associated technologies \n     over the past decade have increased hopes for the development \n     of cellular therapies for age-related degenerative diseases. \n     These diseases arise due to progressive cell loss; thus, \n     replacing these cells would be an ideal therapy.\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\n       With respect to degenerative diseases of the mammalian \n     visual system, the death of specific cell populations within \n     the retina is associated with blinding diseases of the eye, \n     such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis \n     pigmentosa (for review see Ref. 1). Transplantation of stem \n     cells into the retina to replace lost cells or to act as \n     supporting cells to prevent further degenerative cell loss is \n     also discussed increasingly as a practical approach for \n     treating blindness. Unfortunately, the application of \n     cellular therapies is limited because of a scarcity of donors \n     for suitable cell populations, such as neural stem or \n     progenitor cells, that can be transplanted either into the \n     subretinal space or into the vitreous chamber. However, these \n     cell populations can be obtained in huge quantities by \n     differentiating embryonic stem cells into the respective cell \n     types, thus making cell replacement therapies more plausible.\n       The isolation of human embryonic stem cells from \n     preimplantation blastocysts has made cell replacement therapy \n     an even more realistic option as human ES cells share \n     similarities with their counterparts in the mouse. Many \n     attempts have been made to induce in vitro differentiation of \n     ES cells into many cell types, including hematopoietic \n     precursor, heart and skeletal muscle, endothelial, and neural \n     cells. Interesting data from an in vitro study in which ES \n     cells were exposed to defined extracellular factors \n     demonstrated the differentiation potential of ES cells into \n     retinal neural progenitor cells.\n       Herein, we describe the transplantation of GFP-labeled, ES-\n     cell-derived neural precursor cells into the subretinal space \n     of the rhodopsin knockout mouse to determine the integrative \n     capacity of these cells and to evaluate their potential to \n     differentiate into retinal cells. Furthermore, any rescue \n     effects or associated complications exerted by the \n     transplanted cells were evaluated.\n\n\n    materials and methods--ES cell cultivation and neural precursor \n                               selection\n\n       ES cells of the cell line D3 of the mouse strain 129 were \n     purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). To keep ES cells in an \n     undifferentiated state, we cultivated them feeder cell \n     independent, with the supplementation of leukemia inhibitory \n     factor (LIF: 100 nM; Invitrogen-Life Technologies, \n     Gaithersburg, MD) in DMEM (Invitrogen-Life Technologies) plus \n     15% fetal calf serum (FCS) and the established supplements as \n     previously described. The cells were allowed to aggregate in \n     hanging drops to form embryoid bodies (EBs). Hanging drops \n     containing the EBs were rinsed off after 2 days and \n     subsequently cultivated in suspension (DMEM, 10% FCS) for \n     another day. Finally, at day 3, EBs were transferred to \n     tissue culture dishes (DMEM with 10% FCS) and allowed to \n     adhere for 12 hours. Selection of neural precursor cells was \n     achieved by cultivation in an astrocyte-conditioned, serum-\n     free medium containing insulin, transferrin, selene chloride, \n     and fibronectin, as previously described. Selection was \n     performed for up to 18 days. The efficiency of the selection \n     procedure was continuously investigated immunocytochemically \n     with an antibody against the intermediary filament nestin, \n     which is specifically expressed in neural precursor cells. To \n     study the further differentiation of selected neural \n     precursor cells, we transferred them to a medium (DMEM/Ham's \n     F12) with a serum content of 10% FCS.\n       For an alternative way to induce neurogenesis, ES cells \n     were cultured in hanging drops as spheroidal aggregates (EBs) \n     in DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS for 3 days. Afterward, EBs \n     were cultured in suspension in the presence of 0.1 M \n     retinoic acid for another 4 days.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Engraftment and Tumor Formation After Allogeneic In Utero \n            Transplantation of Primate Embryonic Stem Cells\n\n [By Takayuki Asano, Naohide Ageyama, Koichi Takeuchi, Mikio Momoeda, \n  Yoshihiro Kitano, Kyoko Sasaki, Yasuji Ueda, Yutaka Suzuki, Yasushi \n Kondo, Ryuzo Torii, Mamoru Hasegawa, Shigeo Ookawara, Kiyonori Harii, \n             Keiji Terao, Keiya Ozawa, and Yutaka Hanazono]\n\n       Background. To achieve human embryonic stem (ES) cell-based \n     transplantation therapies, allogeneic transplantation models \n     of nonhuman primates would be useful. We have prepared \n     cynomolgus ES cells genetically marked with the green \n     fluorescent protein (GFP). The cells were transplanted into \n     the allogeneic fetus, taking advantage of the fact that the \n     fetus is so immunologically immature as not to induce immune \n     responses to transplanted cells and that fetal tissue \n     compartments are rapidly expanding and thus providing space \n     for the engraftment.\n       Methods. Cynomolgus ES cells were genetically modified to \n     express the GFP gene using a simian immunodeficiency viral \n     vector or electroporation. These cells were transplanted in \n     utero with ultrasound guidance into the cynomolgus fetus in \n     the abdominal cavity (n=2) or liver (n=2) at the end of the \n     first trimester. Three fetuses were delivered 1 month after \n     transplantation, and the other, 3 months after \n     transplantation. Fetal tissues were examined for transplanted \n     cell progeny by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in \n     situ polymerase chain reaction of the GFP sequence.\n       Results. A fluorescent tumor, obviously derived from \n     transplanted ES cells, was found in the thoracic cavity at 3 \n     months after transplantation in one fetus. However, \n     transplanted cell progeny were also detected ( 17) without \n     teratomas in multiple fetal tissues. The cells were solitary \n     and indistinguishable from surrounding host cells.\n       Conclusions. Transplanted cynomolgus ES cells can be \n     engrafted in allogeneic fetuses. The cells will, however, \n     form a tumor if they ``leak'' into an improper space such as \n     the thoracic cavity.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Teratoma Formation Leads to Failure of Treatment for Type 1 Diabetes \n       Using Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Insulin-Producing Cells\n\n  [By Takahisa Fujikawa, Seh-Hoon Oh, Liya Pi, Heather M. Hatch, Tom \n                     Shupe, and Bryon E. Petersen]\n\n       Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been proposed to be a \n     powerful tool in the study of pancreatic disease, as well as \n     a potential source for cell replacement therapy in the \n     treatment of diabetes. However, data demonstrating the \n     feasibility of using pancreatic islet-like cells \n     differentiated from ES cells remain controversial. In this \n     study we characterized ES cell-derived insulin-expressing \n     cells and assessed their suitability for the treatment of \n     type I diabetes. ES cell-derived insulin-stained cell \n     clusters expressed insulin mRNA and transcription factors \n     associated with pancreatic development. The majority of \n     insulin-positive cells in the clusters also showed \n     immunoreactivity for C-peptide. Insulin was stored in the \n     cytoplasm and released into the culture medium in a glucose-\n     dependent manner. When the cultured cells were transplanted \n     into diabetic mice, they reversed the hyperglycemic state for \n     3 weeks, but the rescue failed due to immature teratoma \n     formation. Our studies demonstrate that reversal of \n     hyperglycemia by transplantation of ES cell-derived insulin-\n     producing cells is possible, However, the risk of teratoma \n     formation would need to be eliminated before ES cell-based \n     therapies for the treatment of diabetes are considered. (Am J \n     Pathol 2005, 166:1781-1791)\n       Diabetes mellitus is one of the major causes of death in \n     advanced countries, and has been shown to adversely affect \n     health and quality of life, It is associated with various \n     severe or fatal complications, including blindness, kidney \n     failure, heart disease, stroke, neuropathy, and amputations. \n     Type I diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes, results from \n     the cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \n     islet cells that are known to produce insulin. Type I \n     diabetic patients experience high blood glucose levels as a \n     result of insulin deficiency. There is no cure for this form \n     of diabetes to date. Several approaches have been used in \n     attempts to reverse the disease process for type I diabetes, \n     including whole organ pancreas transplant and islet \n     transplants. In addition, options such as the potential use \n     of pancreatic stem and progenitor cells are being \n     investigated. Currently, the only clinically approved \n     treatment for type I diabetes, with the exception of insulin \n     injection, is islet cell transplantation in combination with \n     immunosuppresive therapy. Unfortunately, this option is only \n     available to a very limited number of patients because of a \n     severe shortage of donor tissue sources. This shortage has \n     focused interest in developing renewable sources of insulin-\n     producing cells appropriate for transplant.\n       Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been proposed as a potential \n     source of pancreatic B cells because they are self-renewing \n     elements that can generate the many cell types of the body. \n     Recent studies suggest that mouse ES cells can be manipulated \n     to express and secrete insulin. However, insulin-producing \n     grafts derived from ES cells in these initial reports have a \n     high degree of cellular heterogeneity and proliferation, \n     uncharacterized growth and tumor-forming potential, as well \n     as low insulin levels compared to pancreatic islets. \n     Additionally, some researchers claim that the insulin-\n     positive cells derived from ES cells may not be real insulin-\n     producing B-like cells. In one study, contrary to previous \n     reports, no message for insulin was detectable in culture, \n     which suggested that the cells may be concentrating the \n     hormone from the medium rather than producing. Another study \n     showed that the main producers of insulin in culture were \n     neurons and neuronal precursors.\n\n Transplantation of Apoptosis-Resistant Embryonic Stem Cells Into the \n                        Injured Rat Spinal Cord\n\n[Michael J.

One \n     group received transplants of cells genetically modified to \n     over-express bc1-2, which codes for an anti-apoptotic \n     protein. A second group received transplants of the wild-type \n     ES cells from which the be1-2 line was developed. In the \n     untransplanted control group, only medium was injected. \n     Locomotor abilities were assessed using the Basso, Beattie \n     and Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale for 6 weeks. There was no \n     incremental locomotor improvement in either transplant group \n     when compared to control over the survival period. Morbidity \n     and mortality were significantly more prevalent in the \n     transplant groups than in controls. At the conclusion of the \n     6-week survival period, the spinal cords were examined. Two \n     of six cords from the bc1-2 group and one of 12 cords from \n     the wild-type\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\n     group showed gross evidence of abnormal growths at the site \n     of transplantation. No similar growth was seen in the \n     control. Pathological examination of the abnormal cords \n     showed very large numbers of undifferentiated cells \n     proliferating at the injection site and extending up to 1.5 \n     cm rostrally and caudally. These results suggest that \n     transplanting KD3 ES cells, or apoptosis-resistant cells \n     derived from the KD3 line, into the injured spinal corddo \n     does not improve locomotor recovery and can lead to tumor-\n     like growth of cells, accompanied by increased debilitation, \n     morbidity and mortality.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Insulin Expressing Cells From Differentiated Embryonic Stem Cells Are \n                             Not Beta Cells\n\n [By S.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been \n     proposed as a potential source of tissue for transplantation \n     for the treatment of Type I diabetes. However, studies \n     showing differentiation of beta cells from ES cells are \n     controversial. The aim of this study was to characterize the \n     insulin-expressing cells differentiated in vitro from ES \n     cells and to assess their suitability for the treatment of \n     diabetes.\n       Methods. ES cell-derived insulin-expressing cells were \n     characterized by means of immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and \n     functional analyses. Activation of the Insulin I promoter \n     during ES-cell differentiation was assessed in ES-cell lines \n     transfected with a reporter gene. ES cell-derived cultures \n     were transplanted into STZ-treated SCID-beige mice and blood \n     glucose concentrations of diabetic mice were monitored for 3 \n     weeks.\n       Results. Insulin-stained cells differentiated from ES cells \n     were devoid of typical beta-cell granules, rarely showed \n     immunoreactivity for C-peptide and were mostly apoptotic. The \n     main producers of proinsulin/insulin in these cultures were \n     neurons and neuronal precursors and a reporter gene under the \n     control of the insulin I promoter was activated in cells with \n     a neuronal phenotype. Insulin was released into the \n     incubation medium but the secretion was not glucose-\n     dependent. When the cultures were transplanted in diabetic \n     mice they formed teratomas and did not reverse the \n     byperglycaemic state.\n       Conclusions/Interpretation. Our studies show that insulin-\n     positive cells in vitro-differentiated from ES cells are not \n     heta cells and suggest that alternative protocols, based on \n     enrichment of ES cell-derived cultures with cells of the \n     endodermal lineage, should be developed to generate true beta \n     cells for the treatment of diabetes.

Fifty-five and a half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take about 10 minutes or so, I \nsuppose--maybe 15 at the most. Then I will yield back the remainder of \nmy time for anyone who is interested in what is happening on the floor. \nI think Senator Isakson will follow up and close off the debate for the \nremainder of today.\n  But I want to respond to a couple things that have been said that I \nwas listening to both on the floor and off the floor so people \nunderstand that sometimes things are not as clear cut as perhaps they \nare presented. There are always two sides to every story, as we know.\n  But I heard my good friend from Kansas talking about the type 1 \ndiabetes research that was conducted in Brazil. Indeed, the JAMA, the \nJournal of the American Medical Association, reported today they had \nsome success with this. I just want to read, though, from the Juvenile \nDiabetes Research Foundation that obviously has been following this \nissue very closely. They said that today's report underscores the need \nfor continued work across a range of important scientific areas. They \nsaid:\n\n       For that reason, we continue to strongly support passage of \n     S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which will \n     allow scientists to more fully explore this critical area of \n     research.\n\n  I will not go into all of the things they are saying about the \nprocedure. It is a risky procedure that happened in Brazil. They do not \nknow at this point whether the people are really cured. Will their \nsymptoms--diabetes symptoms--come back after a few months? No one \nreally knows. But it is promising. Again, I am hopeful that research \npans out. But I want to point out, the Juvenile Diabetes Research \nFoundation says that is fine, but still, let's get S. 5 passed so we \ncan continue on with this needed research in embryonic stem cells.\n  I also want to talk for a little bit about two or three issues. One \nis just the broader issue of why embryonic stem cell research has not \nyet led to human treatments. Well, scientists have been doing research \non adult stem cells for over 30 years. There are no--I repeat, no--\narbitrary restrictions on research with adult stem cells. Scientists \nand private companies do not have to be skittish about doing this \nresearch. They do not have to worry about that all of a sudden the \nFederal Government is going to ban it or limit it.\n  Now, compare that situation with embryonic stem cells. First of all, \nscientists did not even know how to extract them until November of \n1998. The first Federal grant for these stem cells was not awarded \nuntil 2002, and again on a limited number of lines that are available. \nEven now only a tiny fraction of the total Federal budget for stem cell \nresearch is used for embryonic stem cells. The vast majority still goes \nfor adult stem cells.\n  Here is a chart I have in the Chamber that shows that. Embryonic \nresearch lags far behind adult stem cells. For fiscal year 2006, the \nNational Institutes of Health funding for embryonic stem cells, $38.3 \nmillion; for adult stem cells, $200.3 million. So, again, people say: \nWell, why isn't embryonic stem cells doing more? You can see it is \nbeing totally underfunded as compared with adult stem cells.\n  Again, we have not had the 30 years of research. There has been more \nthan five times as much funding for adult stem cell research as for \nembryonic stem cells. So, again, scientists are studying embryonic stem \ncells with one arm tied behind their back.\n  The fact is, it does not matter what many of the Senators think about \nthe potential of embryonic stem cell research. What matters is what \nscientists think. What is their view, those who know this area, who are \nstudying it, Nobel prize laureates, the head of NIH? Let's look at what \nthe head of NIH--this is a man appointed by President Bush. He heads, \nas Senator Specter has often said, the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment; that is, the National Institute of Health. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       The presentations about adult stem cells having as much or \n     more potential than embryonic stem cells, in my view, do not \n     hold scientific water. . . .I think they are overstated. . . \n     .My point of view is that all angles in stem cell research \n     should be pursued.\n\n  That was Dr. Elias Zerhouni, the head of NIH.\n  Breakthroughs are coming, but they take time. To clamp down on \nembryonic stem cell research before it even has a chance shows a total \nlack of understanding about how science works. More importantly, it \ndenies hope to the millions of Americans who suffer from Parkinson's, \nALS, juvenile diabetes, spinal cord injuries, and other treatable \ndiseases and conditions.\n  Secondly, I want to respond to an issue that is presented in the \nIsakson-Coleman bill, S. 30--this whole idea of the promise of \nextracting embryonic stem cells from dead embryos. I must say--and I \nsay to my good friend from Georgia--this still kind of mystifies me. As \nI said earlier, when something is dead, it is dead. I do not know \nanybody who can extract and bring back to life something that is \ndead. So we have to get over the idea we are talking about dead \nembryos. They are not dead; they are alive. They are living. They are \nliving organisms. They are not dead. So again, an embryo dies or gets \nsick or ill for a reason. There is something wrong with it. Chances are \nthe stem cells that come from that ``dead embryo'' aren't so great \neither. So why does anyone think a dead embryo holds the secret to, \nsay, curing juvenile diabetes?\n\n  Here is what three top scientists wrote about dead embryos:\n\n       There is no proof that dead embryos will work. Beyond the \n     fact that scientists haven't developed a reliable method for \n     determining an embryo's ``death,'' there is no scientific \n     evidence that stem cells derived from these embryos would \n     have the required properties or be safe for human therapies.\n\n  Paul Berg of Stanford, George Daley of Harvard, and Lawrence S. B. \nGoldstein of the University of California at San Diego, these three \npeople have been involved in embryonic stem cell extraction research. \nThey say there is no evidence this will have the required properties or \nbe safe for human therapies.\n  I want to read from the bill, S. 30. This is the definition of \nnaturally dead:\n\n\n[[Page S4290]]\n\n\n       The term ``naturally dead'' means having naturally and \n     irreversibly lost the capacity for integrated cellular \n     division, growth, and differentiation that is characteristic \n     of an organism, even if some cells of the former organism may \n     be alive in a disorganized state.\n\n  Well, I have a hard time understanding that, but then this is not a \nscientific definition. I submit there is no scientific test to \ndetermine when an embryo reaches this state where they can say it won't \ndifferentiate or grow. It is an eyeball test. I have been told when \npeople get in vitro fertilization and they produce embryos, the \nembryologist, if I can use that term, will look at them and some \nexhibit better signs than others. Some look healthier than others, have \nmore activity than others. These are the ones they will implant. The \nother ones that look healthy, they freeze. If there are some that don't \nlook very healthy, they are discarded.\n  I assume these are the ones we are talking about in S. 30; is that \nright?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am very \ngrateful for the opportunity. The Senator from Iowa is exactly right, \nbecause he is describing in layman's terms what is known as the Gardner \nprinciples of in vitro fertilization. After an in vitro fertilization, \nat the end of 72 hours, clearly transplantable or implantable embryos \nare formed. Within the next 4 days, up to 7 days, additional viable \nembryos can actually be developed. At the end of the seventh day, the \ncellular division process stops. That is called Level III Gardner \nprinciples.\n  To try and use layman's terms to answer the question, because the \nSenator from Iowa is a great Iowan and I am a Georgian, but I am not a \nscientist and he isn't either, and we are down here talking about some \npretty complicated stuff, the best analogy to make in terms of a \nnaturally dead embryo is the same description you have of death when \nsomeone donates their organs after a traumatic brain injury that causes \nan irreversible cessation of brain waves. By definition in all 50 \nStates, the individual is clinically dead and a living will or a \ndurable power of attorney can direct what is done with the rest of \ntheir life in terms of transplanting organs or whatever. The same thing \nis true in the Gardner principles. After that seventh day, the cellular \ndivision stops. The embryo is not sick. The embryo is not handicapped. \nIt is not transplantable and it can't become a fetus, but you can \nderive stem cells.\n  I won't take any more of the Senator's time except to say one other \nthing. There are 21 lines grandfathered in the August 2001 order of the \nPresident that still have NIH money being invested. Five of those 21 \nlines are lines which were derived from naturally dead embryos. For \n5\\1/2\\ years, the NIH has invested money in those lines that were \nderived from embryos that were destroyed and invested money in those \nthat were derived from embryos that were naturally dead.\n  I don't have the paper in front of me so I can't read it verbatim, \nbut to go back to my opening remarks today, in each case they have \nfound, in comparing those studies, of those lines over the last 5\\1/2\\ \nyears, since August of 2001, that they are pluripotent, \nundifferentiated cells in lines BG01, 02, and 03, which are three of \nthe five lines derived that way. So we have the NIH for 5 years \ninvesting in it. We have a clear scientific definition of what an \nembryo is, which is not a sick embryo, but it is a natural process in \nGardner Level III principles of in vitro fertilization. What it does do \nis it allows you to address the ability to expand stem cell research \nwithout crossing the line or destroying a viable embryo.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, no. I would ask my friend as we engage in this--and I \nhave obviously been talking to scientists and others about this--we get \ninto another problem, and I will read something from a scientist who \nwrote me a letter on this. Who decides? Who decides when that embryo is \nnot implantable? How is that decided? I am told there is no scientific \ndividing line on that. It is sort of an eyeball test. One scientist \nmight say no, another scientist may say yes. Your bill, with all due \nrespect, does not give any clear delineation.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Again, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. In the Gardner principles, all the doctors who perform \nthe great science of in vitro fertilization, which has touched my \nfamily and many others--it is great research. It has allowed families \nto have children who couldn't. After the fertilization you have 3 \nstages: 72 hours where you have clearly implantable embryos, at 7 days \nwhere you still can develop those embryos, and then the remainder which \nare embryos but do not have under the microscope the cellular \ncollection and cluster of the 8 critical cells to make up an \nimplantable embryo that becomes a fetus. That is made through a \nscientist, not a politician, looking into a microscope and making those \ndecisions. Again, making the analogy to the irreversible cessation of \nbrain waves, how do we scientifically today, when someone has a \ntraumatic brain injury, determine if they are legally dead? It is done \nby measuring the brain waves, the same way an in vitro fertilization \ndoctor would measure the cellular division and collection in the \nremaining embryos after the seventh day.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask my friend for further clarification. \nIs it not true that some of these after 7 days could be implantable?\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The only thing I can tell the Senator is the only doctor \nin the house, Senator Coburn, when asked that question in committee \nwhen we had the hearing--and I was at the hearing and so were you--\nsaid: Any doctor who did that would be out of his mind because they \nwould know the implantation could not result in a viable fetus and \nultimately a child. That is my only--I am not a scientist, but that is \nthe quote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me read, though, from a letter from George Daley, who \nis one of the foremost researchers on embryonic stem cell research at \nthe Dana Farber Cancer Institute at the Harvard Medical School. Mr. \nDaley has testified, and I think he testified that day we were there. I \nwrote him a letter asking him about his views on using embryonic stem \ncells that have been called ``naturally dead.'' He said:\n\n       Though some Senators might be persuaded to vote for \n     expanded funding for human embryonic stem cells derived from \n     ``naturally dead'' stem cells, this would be a step backwards \n     for embryonic stem cell research. The definition of a \n     ``naturally dead'' embryo as required in the alternative bill \n     is highly problematic. S. 5 remains the greatest hope for \n     advancing embryonic stem cell research in this country. The \n     concept that human embryonic stem cells might be derived from \n     a ``naturally dead'' embryo originated in an article authored \n     by Landry and Zucker in the Journal of Clinical Investigation \n     2004. The article contained the following passage:\n       ``For a developed human organism, brain death marks the \n     irreversible loss of the capacity for all ongoing and \n     integrated organic function . . .''\n\n  As we just mentioned.\n\n       We propose--\n\n  Get this:\n\n       We propose that the defining capacity of a 4 or 8 cell \n     human embryo is continued and integrated cellular division, \n     growth, and differentiation. We further propose that an \n     embryo that has irreversibly lost its capacity, even as its \n     individual cells are alive, is properly considered \n     organismically dead. Even at its earliest stages, the life of \n     the developing organism is more than the sum of the lives of \n     its constituent cells.\n\n  So again, they propose this. It is not an accepted scientific \nprinciple. The cessation of brain waves is, on the living organism, an \naccepted scientific fact, but this is only a proposal.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I quoted from that very study today. \nThose are two distinguished scientists at Columbia University in New \nYork. That paper proposes a principle in terms of future development \nand decisions. However, I want to repeat for the Senator, in 2001, in \nAugust, when the President signed his directive, 5 of the 21 lines that \nare currently invested in by NIH are those that were developed from \nnaturally dead embryos.\n  Dr. Steven Stice, the eminent scholar of the Georgia Research \nAlliance and at the Institute at the University of Georgia operates \nthose three lines today under NIH supervision. They were all derived \nfrom naturally dead embryos, and the research they are quite famous for \nalready in terms of addressing diabetes is taking place on those lines.\n  So I agree 100 percent with everything the Senator read. I read that\n\n[[Page S4291]]\n\npaper and I have quoted from that paper. It was just put in front of me \nand I don't have my glasses on, so I will not get into the big words \neither. But you are absolutely correct. That was a proposal made on the \npremise of for the future, but that does not mean the practice did not \nalready exist.\n  Lastly, the Gardner principles are an accepted principle for in vitro \nfertilization which have been in existence for decades that clearly \ndelineate the decision between 72 hours, 7 days, and naturally dead \nembryos.\n  I yield back to the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a good discussion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from Dr. George Daley be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Children's Hospital Boston,\n\n\n                                       Department of Medicine,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, April 2, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am responding to your request to \n     provide my views on the feasibility of deriving human \n     embryonic stem cells from embryos that have been called \n     ``naturally dead.'' This concept is articulated in bill S. 30 \n     pending before the U.S. Senate that states: ``It is the \n     purpose of this act . . . to promote the derivation of \n     pluripotent stem cell lines without the creation of human \n     embryos for research purposes and without the destruction or \n     discarding of, or risk of injury to, a human embryo or \n     embryos other than those that are naturally dead.'' An embryo \n     that is ``naturally dead'' is later defined as ``having \n     naturally and irreversibly lost the capacity for integrated \n     cellular division, growth, and differentiation that is \n     characteristic of an organism, even if some cells of the \n     former organism may be alive in a disorganized state.''\n       Some senators might be persuaded to vote for expanded \n     funding for human embryonic stem cells derived from \n     ``naturally dead'' embryos at the expense of voting for \n     expanded research support under S. 5. This would be a step \n     backwards for embryonic stem cell research. The definition of \n     a ``naturally dead'' embryo, as required in the alternative \n     bill, is highly problematic, and S. 5 remains the greatest \n     hope for advancing human embryonic stem cell research in this \n     country.\n       The concept that human embryonic stem cells might be \n     derived from a ``naturally dead'' embryo originated in an \n     article by Landry and Zucker (Journal of Clinical \n     Investigation, 2004). The article contained the following \n     passage: ``For a developed human organism, brain death marks \n     the irreversible loss of the capacity for all ongoing and \n     integrated organic functioning. We propose that the defining \n     capacity of a 4- or 8-cell human embryo is continued and \n     integrated cellular division, growth, and differentiation. We \n     further propose that an embryo that has irreversibly lost \n     this capacity, even as its individual cells are alive, is \n     properly considered organismically dead. Even at its earliest \n     stages, the life of the developing organism is more than the \n     sum of the lives of its constituent cells.''\n       IVF clinics grade embryos based on morphologic criteria \n     that have been shown in limited studies to correlate with \n     successful births (see Gardner et al., Fertil Sterility \n     2000). Embryos of highest morphologic quality are transferred \n     to the uterus or frozen for possible future use, and embryos \n     of poor morphologic quality are discarded because they have \n     little possibility of surviving freezing and thawing. Some \n     have argued that these poor quality embryos might be \n     considered ``dead'', and therefore provide a more acceptable \n     source for ES cells.\n       In actual clinical practice, even poor quality embryos that \n     might be considered ``naturally dead'' by in vitro criteria \n     can give rise to successful pregnancies. Landry and Zucker \n     propose studies that would correlate failure of an embryo to \n     divide in vitro with certain biomarkers that could serve as \n     surrogate criteria for embryo death. However, any such \n     definition of embryo death that depends on in vitro criteria \n     only is scientifically problematic, as embryo incubation in \n     vitro is not as conducive to embryo development as the native \n     in uterine environment. I also cannot envision an ethically \n     acceptable clinical study that would correlate the pregnancy \n     outcomes of enough poor quality embryos to ensure the \n     reliability of criteria for ``embryo death.''\n       Using poor quality embryos for ES cell derivation will \n     inevitably mean destroying some embryos that might have \n     resulted in a successful pregnancy. I am skeptical that we \n     can devise any highly reliable criteria to define embryo \n     death that will appease the critics of ES cell derivation.\n       My laboratory has accumulated significant experience with \n     attempts to derive human embryonic stem cells from poor \n     quality embryos--those that are deemed by clinical \n     embryologists to be unsuitable for clinical use and are \n     destined to be discarded as medical waste. We are preparing \n     our data for publication in the scientific literature and \n     thus I offer the following summary for informational purposes \n     only. I will provide you with the final version of our paper \n     once it has been subject to peer-review.\n       Our experience shows that the poorest quality embryos have \n     the lowest probability of yielding ES cells. Out of \n     approximately 100 embryos that would most likely be \n     considered ``naturally dead,'' we isolated only a single \n     human ES line. Although the chromosomes in this cell line \n     appear normal, I worry that this line might harbor occult \n     genetic defects. Out of approximately 100 embryos that \n     developed slightly better in vitro (yet were still deemed \n     clinically unacceptable and discarded) we derived 5 ES lines. \n     This efficiency is within the expected success rates for \n     human ES cell derivation from healthy embryos; however, I \n     suspect that these lines may have arisen from those embryos \n     that are not truly ``naturally dead.'' Again, I am highly \n     skeptical that any clinical study can be designed that will \n     reliably exclude embryo viability and yet maintain \n     feasibility for deriving human ES cells.\n       I am left to wonder why we would choose to allow only poor \n     quality embryos for medical research when many thousands of \n     normal embryos are otherwise destined to be discarded as \n     medical waste. I believe we should respect the preference of \n     many couples to donate such excess embryos to medical \n     science, and believe that such embryos are preferable as \n     objects for medical research and possible sources for cell \n     replacement therapies. Human embryonic stem cell research is \n     vitally important for the future of medicine and should be \n     vigorously supported by our federal government. Senate \n     passage of S. 5 is the most sure-fired means of achieving \n     this end.\n       I am available to answer more detailed questions about this \n     complex issue.\n           Sincerely.\n                                         George Q. Daley, MD, PhD,\n                         Associate Professor, Biological Chemistry\n                                       and Molecular Pharmacology.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, he pointed out in this letter that \nsometimes in actual clinical practice even poor quality embryos that \nmight be considered naturally dead can, by in vitro fertilization, give \nrise to successful pregnancies. He says he also ``cannot envision an \nethically acceptable clinical study that would correlate the pregnancy \noutcomes of enough poor quality embryos to ensure the reliability of \ncriteria for `embryo death.'''\n  He is saying that the quality for in vitro may be different for in \nutero. Therefore, it might be a poor quality in vitro, but that doesn't \nnecessarily mean it would be poor quality for implantation in utero. He \nraises this ethical question.\n  He says:\n\n       I am skeptical that we can devise any highly reliable \n     criteria to define embryo death that will appease the critics \n     of embryonic stem cell derivation.\n\n  What you are talking about is the Gardner principle, which has to do \nwith what embryos they implant. That is what that really has to do \nwith. So therefore, sure, you are going to take the healthiest, most \nvibrant embryo that you are going to implant, first of all, with the \nhope that it will develop. I still say to my friend that while you can \ntake the ones that don't develop after a week or so and say we will \ntake the stem cells from them--and some happen that way. That is fine. \nBut it just sort of begs the question, if you really want to derive the \nbest stem cells, why wouldn't you use the healthiest embryos rather \nthan the sickest embryos? I am not a scientist, but to me it seems that \nif you want the best, most vibrant and healthy stem cells, you go after \nthe most vibrant and healthy embryos that have been frozen in vitro \nfertilization, as our bill says, that otherwise will be discarded. That \nis my point.\n  I will soon yield. But I am not opposed to the Senator's bill. I am \nnot opposed to looking at this kind of stem cell derivation. I don't \nhave a problem. I think there are problems defining exactly when it \ndies and that kind of stuff. But if you pass S. 5, that takes care of \nall that, and it covers that whole issue. It would seem to me, again, \nthat you would want to go after the healthiest and use the healthiest \nones.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator is a distinguished member of the Senate and \na great debater. I want to make one point. Both the Senator's bill and \nthe bill we have introduced and the added ethical criteria you placed \nin this year's bill prohibit the fertilization of eggs for the purpose \nof research.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. If that is the case, when the Senator made the statement \nthat I was only talking about those used in in vitro, which is \ndifferent from in utero, which I guess meant implantation, both bills \ndo exactly the same thing. You would never create fertilization farms \nfor research purposes under your legislation, nor under S. 30.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Those embryos developed in in vitro fertilization would \nin all cases be eggs fertilized for the purpose of creating a viable \nembryo.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Right.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The difference, with all due respect--and I have great \nrespect for the Senator and the character and the quantity and the \ncontent of this debate--if you ultimately want to further embryonic \nstem cell research in the environment that we have, the Gardner \nprinciple division in in vitro fertilization for level 3 for the \nnatural death of the embryo, that bridges the ethical question on the \ndestruction of an embryo that was otherwise viable and would be \nsomething the White House would sign. So it would further embryonic \nstem cell research under a proven method which exists today, and NIH, \nin five different cases, is invested in in terms of BG01, 02 and 03, \nwhich happen to be the lines with which I am familiar. With all due \nrespect, since we both prohibit the fertilization of eggs for the \npurpose of deriving cells for scientific research, it is a matter of \nhow you draw that line.\n  I appreciate the Senator giving me the time to make that explanation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, it is a good debate. We should have more of these \nkinds of exchanges on the Senate floor. I respect my friend, and I \nrespect his approach. Again, we have our differences in the way we \napproach things. I picked up on one word my friend just said--the \n``environment'' in which we are operating. I assume he means the \nenvironment being the Presidential declaration of August 9, 2001, that \nonly Federal funding could be used for stem cells derived prior to 9 \np.m. but none after that. I assume that is the environment we are \ntalking about.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. If the Senator will let me respond, that is precisely \nwhat I am talking about. As we have had 5\\1/2\\ years since the \nPresidential directive, and since we--fortunately, and unbeknownst to \nme certainly, and probably the Senator from Iowa, none of us knew you \nwould have these five lines in those original lines that were \ngrandfathered. So we have had 5\\1/2\\ years of experience at NIH, with \nlines derived without destroying physically a viable embryo, but it \nwould, rather, be a natural death. So since you have that, and since it \ndoesn't cross that ethical line, that is what I was referring to. And \nyou would have the opportunity to further the science in a bill that \ncan be passed and not vetoed. So, with all due respect, that is what I \nwas referring to.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is what I thought. My proposal is to change the \nenvironment. That is what we have to do. I say we have to change the \nenvironment. The American people want it changed, the scientific \ncommunity wants it changed, the head of NIH--former head of NIH and 525 \ndifferent advocacy groups out there want it changed. Why should one \nperson--the President of the United States--have the say-so of what is \nmoral and what is not moral, depending upon a time?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. May I respond?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure, but why is 9 p.m. of August 9 the moral dividing \nline that Federal funds can be used on stem cell lines? Before that it \nis moral, but after that it is immoral. I cannot understand that.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will never, hopefully, debate or question any \nindividual's judgment and morality. I admire it in everybody, and I \nadmire the Senator from Iowa and his principles. The President has made \nhis statement and has said what he would do. My reference was that if \nscience, in the last 5\\1/2\\ years, has shown us this is a way to \nfurther that science without crossing that line, then with respect for \nhis principles and morals, I am looking to find ways that fit rather \nthan ways to argue. That is my point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. We have to do what we can do sometimes \nhere. Certainly, we have been funding adult stem cell research. Senator \nSpecter and I have made certain of that in our Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. And also $132 million for embryonic--those 21 lines.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Don't get me started on that because those have all been \ncontaminated on mouse feeder cells. My friend from Oklahoma said that \nwas not true the other day, but it is true. They have been growing on \nmouse feeder cells, every one of them. Again, we don't know if they \nwill ever be able to be used for any kind of human therapies. Maybe \nyes, maybe no. We do know that the 400-some stem cell lines derived \nsince then privately, or by State involvement, or whatever, have not \nbeen used on mouse feeder cells. We know those, more than likely, will \nhave the capacity of being used in human therapy.\n  I respect people's morality, but I just don't know that I like it \nwhen somebody imposes their self-imposed morality on all of the \nAmerican people. I respect the President's moral views, I really do. \nBut I have a hard time understanding how the President can say Federal \nfunding should not be used for embryonic stem cell research if they \nwere derived after 9 p.m., August 9, 2001, and before that it is \nmorally OK. For the life of me, I have never been able to understand \nthat.\n  If it is morally unacceptable to use Federal dollars for embryonic \nstem cell research, then it ought not to be used for these 21 lines \neither.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator makes the point, but if the Senator will \nyield, I will simply respond.\n  The President issued that directive in August of 2001. He established \nthat date of August 9. The White House has now said that in the case of \nS. 30, had the stem cells survived from the naturally dead prohibition, \nthey would live.\n  That is not everything the Senator from Iowa would like. I understand \nand respect that. Acknowledging the nice things you said about the \nlegislation, it is a ray of sunshine in the furtherance of that \nresearch. I am grateful to the Senator for the time he has allotted me.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Quite frankly, that is why I don't have any problems with \nthis line of research. All I can say to my friend is that all of the \nscientists who write me letters and who have weighed in on this issue, \nand the groups that rely upon scientists and Nobel laureates, they all \nsay that this might be an area of interest, but it doesn't substitute \nfor lifting the ban. I am hopeful. I guess I am a hopeful person.\n  I am hopeful that the President will understand that we are not \nasking him to cross his moral line. He said repeatedly through his \nspokespeople, very recently, that the one bright line the President \nwill not cross is using Federal funds to destroy embryos. I wish they \nwould read the bill. S. 5 doesn't provide money for the destruction of \nembryos. We don't do that now. We have not done it in the past. So, \ntherefore, this bill should be able to be signed because it doesn't \nprovide one single cent of taxpayer dollars for the destruction of \nembryos. Of course, neither does the bill of the Senator from Georgia; \nof course not. So that is why I am a hopeful person, thinking that the \nPresident or his people will read this and say: You are right. We have \nstricter ethical guidelines in this bill than exist right now.\n  So I am hopeful. I am hopeful that we can get this job done.\n  Anyway, I just wanted to make one other point tonight before I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Before the Senator does that, I appreciate the Senator \nasking the questions and allowing me the opportunity to respond and, \nhopefully, in some way clear up, if not totally at least say where we \nare coming from based on the scientists I have talked to. I respect him \nvery much.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wish we could do more of this on the Senate floor. By \nhaving respect for one another's opinions and thought processes and \nsources of information, I think we can get a clearer understanding of \nwhere people are coming from. Lots of times we give our speech and \nleave and nobody is around discussing anything.\n  Some of the best times I have had on the Senate floor were debating \nPhil Gramm of Texas. We used to get into some good debates. He was \nalways willing to give and take and talk back and forth in a congenial \nmanner. We need more of that on the floor of the Senate. That is just \nmy opinion.\n  Mr. President, I want to say one other thing that came up. Again, it \nhas to do with understanding these kinds of moral lines, so to speak. \nIt is true that we all started out as an embryo. I want to remind \npeople what an embryo is. It is a blastocyst that has between 100 and \n200 cells. The embryos we are talking about in S. 5 are sitting in in\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\nvitro fertilization clinics and are frozen in liquid nitrogen. They are \nsmaller than a period at the end of a sentence, and they are stored in \ntiny straws like this.\n  What I am holding up here is one of the devices used to store \nembryonic stem cells in liquid nitrogen. They take this top off here, \nif I can get it off. They have a little tube like this. In this tube, \nthe opening of which is about as big as the end of a period at the end \nof a sentence, they would put in that little tube an embryo. Then they \nwould put it in this enclosure and put it in liquid nitrogen in a tank \nand freeze it. Then if the couple who donated the embryos were \nunsuccessful in having children--I have a couple friends of mine who \nare now doing that, and their first pregnancy wasn't successful. They \nwere going back for a second. They get one of these frozen embryos, \nthaw it out, and it is implanted in utero. So that is what these tiny \nlittle straws are.\n  An embryo will never become a human being unless and until it is \nimplanted into a uterus, takes hold, and develops. Sometimes they are \nimplanted and they don't take hold; they are discharged.\n  So an embryo is what I think we can rightfully call potential life--\npotential in that if it is implanted and takes hold, it could become a \nhuman being. Therefore, it is potential.\n  Let's look at another chart.\n  This is Karli Borcherding of Ankeny, IA. She is 12 years old and has \ntype 1 diabetes. These are all the needles she uses in 1 month, 120. \nThink: How would you like to give yourself four shots every day? Look \nat all those needles she goes through every month at 12 years of age. \nKarli has juvenile diabetes, as I said. She knows what will happen if \nshe is not cured. At some point in her life, she will probably become \nblind. She will probably lose a foot, a leg, or one or more of her \nlimbs. At some point in her life, diabetes will take her.\n  This is not potential life. This is real life--a human being living \nright now.\n  That embryo stored in liquid nitrogen, is it alive? Of course. It is \nnot dead, it is alive. Is it a human being? No. It is a potential human \nbeing. Karli Borcherding is a real human being.\n  So read S. 5. Under the ethical guidelines of this bill, NIH can fund \nresearch only on those embryos which are left over from in vitro \nfertilization and which would otherwise be discarded. Every day, \nfertility clinics discard unwanted embryos. Last year, 50,000 babies \nwere born to couples who wanted to have a baby, couldn't, and wanted in \nvitro fertilization. Out of those 50,000, a lot of embryos are left \nover. When a couple has had one child, two, three--however many they \ndecide--and they have leftover embryos, what happens to them? The \nclinic calls them up and says: If you want to keep them, you have to \npay us every month. Parents may say: We don't want them anymore, we \nhave had all our children. And if you are not willing to pay to keep \nthem frozen for the next 200, 300, 400, 500, 1,000 years or however \nlong, they are discarded. It happens every day of every week of every \nyear.\n  What we are saying and what the real question is, as long as we have \nleftover embryos, is it better to have them discarded and flushed down \nthe drain or used for the kind of scientific research that would one \nday cure Karli Borcherding?\n  What we are talking about is potential life, potential life frozen in \nnitrogen, or we are talking about real life. That is really the \ndifference--potential life that would otherwise be flushed down the \ndrain versus Karli Borcherding and her real life. That is why I think \nSenator Hatch had it correct. He said the real pro-life position is S. \n5. That is the real pro-life position.\n  As I have said before, once an embryo is discarded in an in vitro \nfertilization clinic, it is discarded. It is dead. But if that embryo \nwas taken and the stem cells are taken out and those stem cells are \npropagated, they are alive. They don't die; they are alive. They \ncontinue to be alive. They are developed into nerve tissue, bone \ntissue, heart muscle tissue that some day--or they could be developed \ninto the kinds of cells that would help Karli Borcherding become \ninsulin free. That is what this debate is about.\n  It seems to me, if this is a moral problem for the President or \nanybody else, we ought to have legislation that would shut down every \nIVF clinic in this country. Shut them down and ban the procedure in the \nUnited States because there are leftover embryos. If it is immoral to \ntake those embryos, even with the written, informed consent of the \ndonors, with no money changing hands, and if they are going to be \ndiscarded anyway, if that is immoral, wouldn't it be immoral to just \ndiscard them? But you have to do one or the other.\n  Senator Brownback talked about adoption. I am all for that. That is \nfine. If couples want to adopt babies from in vitro fertilization \nclinics, that is fine. But as I said, we have 400,000 frozen embryos \nright now; 50,000 babies born every year from IVF. I think we have had, \nwhat, 135 adoptions. That is fine. They can be adopted, and there may \nbe a lot of donors who have donated embryos. They have had their \nchildren, but they really don't want to have other people having their \nchildren. That raises other kinds of ethical questions. They might want \nto say: We would rather donate that for stem cell research to save \nKarli Borcherding's life.\n  We have to come to grips with this issue. Is it OK to have IVF \nclinics, is it OK to have in vitro fertilization? If that is the case, \nthen we have to take it step by step and confront reality. The reality \nis in vitro fertilization is legal, it is acceptable. It provides \ncouples with children they otherwise could not have, and the reality is \nthat there are leftover embryos. We have to confront that reality. What \ndo you do with them? They are not all going to be adopted. We have to \nagree that is an impossibility. So are they going to be discarded or \nwith the consent of the donors be used for embryonic stem cell \nresearch? That is really the question.\n  I think there is really only one answer, and that is what all the \nscientists--I say all, the vast majority of scientists, Nobel \nlaureates, the head of NIH, the former head of NIH, 525 advocacy groups \nrepresenting all diseases and injuries in the United States that you \ncan imagine, why they all say that S. 5 is the bill we have to pass, \nthat we have to enact into law to take the handcuffs off our \nscientists. That is why it is so important we have a good solid vote \nfor this bill tomorrow.\n  With that, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his patience and his \nkindness.\n  I yield back whatever time we have remaining on our side for today's \npurpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa. I have also enjoyed today and appreciate the \nquestions, and hopefully we can do it throughout the rest of the debate \nso when people cast their votes they are informed.\n  By way of interest, when we talked about the embryonic stem cell \nlines derived from naturally dead embryos, I thought it would be \nappropriate to end my remarks today by just acknowledging that lines \nBG01 and 02, which are under NIH funding now, which were grandfathered \nin the President's directive, and which were derived from naturally \ndead embryos, were the lines upon which the research was applied that \nhas developed the first product to be marketed from embryonic stem cell \nresearch, pending patent, to deliver neural progenitor cells which will \nbe the cells that deliver pharmaceutical and other therapy for spinal \ncolumn and brain injuries.\n  So it is very important to understand that not only is the process, \nA, an accepted process, B, currently under funding at NIH, C, covered \nunder the President's directive of 2001, but in that 5\\1/2\\ years \nsince, research on two of those lines derived from naturally dead \nembryos is, in fact, producing a remarkable potential product for \nbetter health in all of America.\n  With that said, I, too, yield back all of our time and again thank \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, in the remaining time that I have \nallocated, I wish to talk about another subject, and that is the United \nStates Tax Code. I believe that as I speak there are thousands of \nAmericans, perhaps hundreds of thousands of Americans, now calculating \ntheir income tax for the year 2006.\n  Today is April the 10th. Tax returns have to be filed during the \ncourse of the next week to comply with the Federal tax laws, and this \nis a matter which is very much on the minds of thousands of Americans, \nperhaps even some watching the Senate on C-SPAN are in the process of \ncompiling their tax returns. I will use this occasion to again \nintroduce legislation for the flat tax.\n  The flat tax is a new structure of taxation of income in the United \nStates under a model proposed by Professors Hall and Rabushka, from \nStanford University, which would enable taxpayers to file their returns \non a simple postcard, which I hold in my hand, where the tax return can \nbe filled out in the course of 15 minutes. It has some 10 lines to fill \nout: Wages, personal allowance, number of dependents, mortgage interest \ndeduction, charitable contributions, total for deductions, total \ntaxable compensation, tax of 20 percent, tax withheld by employer, and \nthe tax or refund due.\n  We have a system in the United States today where the statistics are \nastounding. There are some 582 tax forms to be filled out by Americans \nwho file their tax returns. There are some 6.4 billion hours and $265 \nbillion each year spent in complying with the tax laws. The IRS Code \nand regulations fill more than 17,000 pages and have grown from some \n744,000 words in 1955 to over 7 million words 50 years later in the \nyear 2005.\n  Albert Einstein, genius that he was, is quoted as saying:\n\n       The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income \n     tax.\n\n  For a man who developed the theory of relativity, that is quite an \nindictment of the American tax system.\n  This change in the tax laws would be a godsend for the U.S. economy. \nEconomists estimate that in the course of 7 years, the gross national \nproduct would increase by $2 trillion, attributable solely to the \nefficiencies which would come about by relieving this enormous \nregulatory burden.\n  We talk frequently about the burden of regulation in the Federal \nGovernment, but the most onerous regulatory form is the tax form, or \nthe tax regulations, which are a burden on all Americans. When you take \na look at the cost of compliance, at $265 billion a year, and take a \nlook at the loopholes of some $390 billion a year, which would be \neliminated by the flat tax, and $120 billion a year in tax fraud, with \nthe $10 billion a year it costs to run the Internal Revenue Service, it \nis obvious what an enormous savings there would be in the economy. Most \nimportantly, there would be the savings to individual citizens who, on \nthe average, require about 14 hours to fill out a tax return. Many \ncitizens now hire specialists because the tax forms have become so \ncomplicated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the flat tax \nreturn, plus the legislation itself, and my full statement on this \nsubject be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is one additional comment on the \nflat tax return. I have incorporated in the statement an analysis of \ntaxes which would be made by people at various levels of the income \nspectrum, and for a married couple with two children, with an annual \nincome of $40,000, an analysis of the comparison shows a decrease in \ntaxes of $1,217. For middle-class taxpayers, with comparable taxes, a \nslight increase but relatively little compared to the enormous savings \nthat are involved.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Iowa for yielding me \nthe time, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                      Tax Day 2007 Floor Statement\n\n       Mr. Specter. Mr. President, this week, American taxpayers \n     face another Federal income tax deadline. The date of April \n     15 (or April 16 this year) stabs fear, anxiety, and unease \n     into the hearts of millions of Americans. Every year during \n     ``tax season,'' millions of Americans spend their evenings \n     poring over page after page of IRS instructions, going \n     through their records looking for information and struggling \n     to find and fill out all the appropriate forms on their \n     federal tax returns. Americans are intimidated by the sheer \n     number of different tax forms and their instructions, many of \n     which they may be unsure whether they need to file. Given the \n     approximately 582 possible forms, not to mention the \n     instructions that accompany them, simply trying to determine \n     which form to file can in itself be a daunting and \n     overwhelming task. In 2006, studies conducted by the Office \n     of Management and Budget and the Tax Foundation found that \n     American taxpayers, including\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\n     businesses, spend more than 6.4 billion hours and $265 \n     billion each year complying with tax laws. That works out to \n     more than $2,500 per U.S. household. Much of this time is \n     spent burrowing through IRS laws and regulations which fill \n     over 17,000 pages and have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 \n     to 7.1 million words in 2005. By contrast, the Pledge of \n     Allegiance has only 31 words, the Gettysburg Address has 267 \n     words, the Declaration of Independence has about 1,300 words, \n     and the Bible has only about 1,773,000 words.\n       The majority of taxpayers face filing tax forms that are \n     far too complicated and take far too long to complete. \n     According to the estimated preparation time listed on the \n     forms by the IRS, the 2006 Form 1040 is estimated to take 13 \n     hours and 15 minutes to complete. Moreover this does not \n     include the estimated time to complete the accompanying \n     schedules, such as Schedule A, for itemized deductions, which \n     carries an estimated preparation time of 5 hours, 37 minutes, \n     or Schedule D, for reporting capital gains and losses, which \n     shows an estimated preparation time of 6 hours, 10 minutes. \n     Moreover, this complexity is getting worse each year. Just \n     from 2000 to 2004 the estimated time to prepare Form 1040 \n     jumped 34 minutes.\n       It is no wonder that well over half of all taxpayers, 61 \n     percent according to a recent survey, now hire an outside \n     professional to prepare their tax returns for them. However, \n     the fact that only about 35 percent of individuals itemize \n     their deductions shows that a significant percentage of our \n     taxpaying population believes that the tax system is too \n     complex for them to deal with. We all understand that paying \n     taxes will never be something we enjoy, but neither should it \n     be cruel and unusual punishment. Further, the pace of change \n     to the Internal Revenue Code is brisk--Congress made over \n     9,500 tax code changes in the past fifteen years. And we are \n     far from being finished. Year after year, we continue to ask \n     the same question--isn't there a better way?\n       My flat tax legislation would make filing a tax return a \n     manageable chore, not a seemingly endless nightmare, for most \n     taxpayers. My flat tax legislation will fundamentally revise \n     the present tax code, with its myriad rates, deductions, and \n     instructions. This legislation would institute a simple, flat \n     20 percent tax rate for all individuals and businesses. This \n     proposal is not cast in stone, but is intended to move the \n     debate forward by focusing attention on three key principles \n     which are critical to an effective and equitable taxation \n     system: simplicity, fairness and economic growth.\n       My flat tax plan would eliminate the kinds of frustrations \n     I have outlined above for millions of taxpayers. This flat \n     tax would enable us to scrap the great majority of the IRS \n     rules, regulations and instructions and delete most of the \n     7.1 million words in the Internal Revenue Code. Instead of \n     billions of hours of non-productive time spent in compliance \n     with, or avoidance of, the tax code, taxpayers would spend \n     only the small amount of time necessary to fill out a \n     postcard-sized form. Both business and individual taxpayers \n     would thus find valuable hours freed up to engage in \n     productive business activity, or for more time with their \n     families, instead of poring over tax tables, schedules and \n     regulations.\n       My flat tax proposal is dramatic, but so are its \n     advantages: a taxation system that is simple, fair and \n     designed to maximize prosperity for all Americans. A summary \n     of the key advantages are:\n       Simplicity: A 10-line postcard filing would replace the \n     myriad forms and attachments currently required, thus saving \n     Americans the 6.4 billion hours they currently spend every \n     year in tax compliance.\n       Cuts government: The flat tax would eliminate the lion's \n     share of IRS rules, regulations and requirements, which have \n     grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to 7.1 approximately 94,000 \n     employees, creating opportunities to put their expertise to \n     use elsewhere in the government or in private industry.\n       Promotes economic growth: Economists estimate a growth due \n     to a flat tax of over $2 trillion in national wealth over \n     seven years, representing an increase of approximately $7,500 \n     in personal wealth for every man, woman and child in America. \n     This growth would also lead to the creation of 6 million new \n     jobs.\n       Increases efficiency: Investment decisions would be made on \n     the basis of productivity rather than simply for tax \n     avoidance, thus leading to even greater economic expansion.\n       Reduces interest rates: Economic forecasts indicate that \n     interest rates would fall substantially, by as much as two \n     points, as the flat tax removes many of the current \n     disincentives to savings.\n       Lowers compliance costs: Americans would be able to save or \n     invest the $265 billion they currently spend every year in \n     tax compliance.\n       Decreases fraud: As tax loopholes are eliminated and the \n     tax code is simplified, there will be far less opportunity \n     for tax avoidance and fraud. Currently, the IRS is estimating \n     a tax gap of $300 billion a year.\n       Reduces IRA costs: Simplification of the tax code will \n     allow us to save significantly on the $10 billion annual \n     budget currently allocated to the Internal Revenue Service.\n       The most dramatic way to illustrate the flat tax is to \n     consider that the income tax form for the flat tax is printed \n     on a postcard--it will allow all taxpayers to file their \n     April 15 tax returns on a simple 10-line postcard. This \n     postcard will take 15 minutes to fill out.\n       At my town hall meetings across Pennsylvania, the public \n     support for fundamental tax reform is overwhelming. I would \n     point out in those speeches that I never leave home without \n     two key documents: (1) my copy of the Constitution; and (2) a \n     copy of my 10-line flat tax postcard. I soon realized that I \n     needed more than just one copy of my flat tax postcard--many \n     people wanted their own postcard so that they could see what \n     life in a flat tax world would be like, where tax returns \n     only take 15 minutes to fill out and individual taxpayers are \n     no longer burdened with double taxation on their dividends, \n     interest, capital gains and estates.\n        This is a win-win situation for America because it lowers \n     the tax burden on the taxpayers in the lower brackets. For \n     example in the 2006 tax year, the standard deduction is \n     $5,150 for a single taxpayer, $7,550 for a head of household \n     and $10,300 for a married couple filing jointly, while the \n     personal exemption for individuals and dependents is $3,300. \n     Thus, under the current tax code, a family of four which does \n     not itemize deductions would pay taxes on all income over \n     $23,500--that is personal exemptions of $13,200 and a \n     standard deduction of $10,300. By contrast, under my flat tax \n     bill, that same family would receive a personal exemption of \n     $37,500, and would pay tax on income over that amount.\n       The tax loopholes enable write-offs of some $390 billion a \n     year. What is eliminated under the flat tax are the \n     loopholes, the deductions in this complicated code which can \n     be deciphered, interpreted, and found really only by the \n     $500-an-hour lawyers. That money is lost to the taxpayers. \n     $120 billion would be saved by the elimination of fraud \n     because of the simplicity of the Tax Code, the taxpayer being \n     able to find out exactly what they owe.\n        This bill is modeled after a proposal organized and \n     written by two very distinguished professors of law from \n     Stanford University, Professor Hall and Professor Rabushka. \n     Their model was first introduced in the Congress in the fall \n     of 1994 by Majority Leader Richard Armey. I introduced the \n     flat tax bill--the first one in the Senate--on March 2, 1995, \n     Senate bill 488. On October 27, 1995, I introduced a Sense of \n     the Senate Resolution calling on my colleagues to expedite \n     Congressional adoption of a flat tax. The Resolution, which \n     was introduced as an amendment to pending legislation, was \n     not adopted. I reintroduced my legislation in the 105th \n     Congress with slight modifications to reflect inflation-\n     adjusted increases in the personal allowances and dependent \n     allowances. I reintroduced the bill on April l5, 1999 income \n     tax day--in a bill denominated as S. 822. I then introduced \n     my flat tax legislation as an amendment to S. 1429, the Tax \n     Reconciliation bill; the amendment was not adopted. During \n     the 108th Congress, I introduced my flat tax legislation once \n     again on April 11, 2003. On May 14, 2003, I offered an \n     amendment to the Tax Reconciliation legislation urging the \n     Senate to hold hearings and consider legislation providing \n     for a flat tax; this amendment passed by a vote of 70 to 30 \n     on May 15, 2003. I then testified on this issue at a \n     subsequent hearing held by the Joint Economic Committee on \n     November 5, 2003. On April 15, 2005, I reintroduced my flat \n     tax legislation in a bill denominated as S. 812. Today, I \n     again put forward this legislation with two minor changes.\n       The first is that the numbers for personal exemptions and \n     deductions have been adjusted for inflation. The second is a \n     newly inserted provision that will allow these numbers to \n     continue to be adjusted for inflation in the years to come. \n     This change will prevent these exemptions and deductions from \n     losing value over time.\n       Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on \n     behalf of flat tax reform, I have devoted considerable time \n     and attention to analyzing our nation's tax code and the \n     policies which underlie it. I began the study of the \n     complexities of the tax code over 40 years ago as a law \n     student at Yale University. I included some tax law as part \n     of my practice in my early years as an attorney in \n     Philadelphia. In the spring of 1962, I published a law review \n     article in the Villanova Law Review, ``Pension and Profit \n     Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for Closely Held \n     Corporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova L. \n     Rev. 335, which in part focused on the inequity in making \n     tax-exempt retirement benefits available to some kinds of \n     businesses but not others. It was apparent then, as it is \n     now, that the very complexities of the Internal Revenue Code \n     could be used to give unfair advantage to some. Einstein \n     himself is quoted as saying ``the hardest thing in the world \n     to understand is the income tax.''\n       The Hall-Rabushka model envisioned a flat tax with no \n     deductions whatsoever. After considerable reflection, I \n     decided to include in the legislation limited deductions for \n     home mortgage interest for up to $125,000 in borrowing and \n     charitable contributions up to $3,125. While these \n     modifications undercut the pure principle of the flat tax by \n     continuing the use of tax policy to promote home buying and \n     charitable contributions, I believe that those two deductions \n     are so deeply ingrained in the financial planning of American \n     families that they should be retained as a matter of fairness \n     and public policy--and also political practicality. With \n     those two deductions maintained, passage of a modified flat \n     tax will be difficult, but without them, probably impossible.\n       In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment \n     of a modified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall \n     advised\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\n     that the revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, \n     which uses a 19 percent rate, is based on a well-documented \n     model founded on reliable governmental statistics. My \n     legislation raises that rate from 19 percent to 20 percent to \n     accommodate retaining limited home mortgage interest and \n     charitable deductions.\n       This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their \n     source, so that there is no personal taxation on interest, \n     dividends, capital gains, gifts or estates. Restructured in \n     this way, the tax code can become a powerful incentive for \n     savings and investment--which translates into economic growth \n     and expansion, more and better jobs, and raising the standard \n     of living for all Americans.\n       The key advantages of this flat tax plan are threefold: \n     First, it will dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. \n     Second, it will remove much of the IRS regulatory morass now \n     imposed on individual and corporate taxpayers, and allow \n     those taxpayers to devote more of their energies to \n     productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which rewards \n     savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic \n     growth in all sectors of the economy as more money flows into \n     investments and savings accounts.\n       Professors Hall and Rabushka have projected that within \n     seven years of enactment, this type of a flat tax would \n     produce a 6 percent increase in output from increased total \n     work in the U.S. economy and increased capital formation. The \n     economic growth would mean a $7,500 increase in the personal \n     income of all Americans. No one likes to pay taxes. But \n     Americans will be much more willing to pay their taxes under \n     a system that they believe is fair, a system that they can \n     understand, and a system that they recognize promotes rather \n     than prevents growth. and prosperity. My flat tax legislation \n     will afford Americans such a tax system.\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10AP07.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\n       A variety of specific cases

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE NONDISCLOSURE ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have introduced a bill requiring insurance \ncompanies to provide a written ``plain English'' explanation on the \nfront page of each new homeowner's policy. It is a commonsense, \ncustomer-friendly service that could benefit insurers, consumers, and \ntaxpayers,\n  I cosponsored a similar measure during the last Congress. The changes \nfrom last Congress are minimal. The new bill, called the Homeowners' \nInsurance Nondisclosure Act, deals exclusively with homeowners' \npolicies, the area where most insurance coverage disputes arose \nfollowing Hurricane Katrina.\n  Homeowners' policies are notoriously long, complicated, and written \nin legalese. Even for homeowners who are familiar with legal documents \nlike mortgages and deeds, insurance policies are hard to understand.\n  That is because these policies are a contract between two parties, \ndefined in precise legal terms. In the case of homeowners' policies, \nmost consumers depend heavily on their agents for a good-faith \nexplanation.\n  Yet, unlike a mortgage or deed, insurance policies are a competitive \nproduct purchased by consumers. While we can't erase complex legalese \nfrom an insurance document, I do think it is reasonable for insurers to \nprovide their paying customers with a simple, concise explanation of \ntheir policy.\n  If passed, this bill would require insurers to place a basic \ndescription of what the policy will not cover in a ``noncoverage box,'' \nstating in bold letters, twice the size of the body of the policy text, \nall conditions, exclusions, and limitations pertaining to the \nindividual policy's coverage.\n  Consumer groups like this proposal, and insurers should, too. It \nrequires nothing of insurance companies except a little extra ink, but \nit could save insurers, their customers, and taxpayers much more.\n  One consumer group contends that had there been a plain English \nexplanation of homeowners' policies before Katrina, American homeowners \ncould have saved up to $65 billion in lost claims. Insurers and \ntaxpayers could save an untold amount of time and money in averted \nnegotiations and court costs associated with disputes.\n  Using existing laws that govern unfair or deceptive practices, my \nbill would require the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, to enforce \npenalties against insurers who fail to comply with the noncoverage \ndisclosure.\n  Predictably, some big insurance companies are already criticizing \nthis bill, so expect some in the insurance industry to show resistance \neven in the face of this commonsense, cost-effective, consumer-friendly \nrequirement. Their reaction is typical of some in the insurance \nindustry's overall response since Hurricane Katrina--to delay, \ndistract, and distort, saying ``no'' even to the most simple, sincere \nsolutions.\n  That is what prompted lawmakers like U.S. Representative Gene Taylor \nand me to initiate this legislation and other major insurance reforms \naimed at making insurance more dependable for the consumers who must \nbuy it.\n  I hope insurance companies will play by significantly different rules \nwhen the next Katrina-like disaster hits America--rules which better \nprotect consumers. And for homeowners, some of those rules will be \nclearly displayed on the first page of every new homeowner's policy, \nwritten in plain English.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4298-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4298-S4299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ELECTIONS IN NIGERIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this month's elections in Nigeria mark \nan important moment for Africa's most populous country. Free, fair, and \npeaceful elections would allow Nigeria\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\nto consolidate its young democracy and to set an example for other \ndeveloping countries in the region and around the world. Last November, \nthe Senate unanimously passed a resolution I introduced that called \nupon the Government of Nigeria and the Independent National Electoral \nCommission to demonstrate a commitment to successful democratic \nelections and promised continued U.S. and international support for \nthis effort. With the first set of votes just days away, I am \ndisheartened by the poor performance of these individuals and \ninstitutions in the leadup to these historic polls.\n  Since GEN Olusegun Obasanjo took the helm of Nigeria's first civilian \ngovernment in 15 years in 1999, the United States and the wider \ninternational community have made significant investments in assisting \nNigeria's democratic transition in recognition of the country's \nstrategic and symbolic importance. If this month's polls do not produce \na legitimate, fairly elected government, however, the United States and \nour allies will need to reconsider our political and material support \nto Nigeria.\n  Following a violently contested election in 2003, President Obasanjo \ndeclared that his ``initial assignment as President is trying to heal \nthe wounds from the elections.'' Instead, in the runup to this month's \npolls, he has sparked fresh outrage by using the Independent National \nElectoral Commission, INEC, to limit competition, not promote it; by \nrepressing dissent rather than encouraging free speech; by harassing \ndomestic observers and obstructing the free and fair participation of \nopposition candidates. These abuses reveal the need for substantial \nelectoral reform if Nigeria is to continue becoming a role model of \ndemocracy in Africa and around the world.\n  By almost all accounts, Nigeria is simply not ready to conduct this \nelection, and the President and the Chairman of INEC should be held \naccountable for that failure. There is still time, however, to \ndemonstrate a commitment to the democratic process by accrediting and \nfacilitating the work of domestic and foreign election observers, \napproving and publicizing election procedures and polling places, and \nposting voter lists at each polling location. Transparent conduct of \nthe polls to be held on April 14 and 21, including unrestricted access \nto polling places for election monitors, will bolster the credibility \nof President Obasanjo's government and INEC, which have been damaged by \nslow and incomplete preparations in past months.\n  Disrespect for the principles and processes of democracy threaten the \ngains that President Obasanjo's government has overseen in the past 8 \nyears. Nigeria's recent economic growth, domestic security, and \ninternational reputation are all at stake because development, \nstability, and credibility cannot be sustained in a dysfunctional \npolitical system. Regardless of the outcome of this month's elections, \nI urge all political leaders and their supporters to respect the rule \nof law, preserve the democratic process, and renounce violence.\n  This is a critical moment for Nigeria and for Africa. If problems \nrelated to this month's elections lead to unrest and instability in \nNigeria, the impact could unsettle the region, indirectly by example \nand directly by weakening one of the most important forces for peace \nand progress on the continent. Under President Obasanjo's leadership, \nNigeria has defended democracy throughout Africa by working with allies \nto reverse coups and efforts to undermine constitutional processes. Now \nthe President has put his own democracy at risk, and the world is \nwatching. Corruption, violence, repression, and obstruction of \ntransparent, legitimate elections will not be tolerated by the \ninternational community, and Nigeria and its leaders will be judged \naccordingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4299-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF ROBERT D. EVANS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto Robert D. Evans, who retired on February 28, after 35 years of \ndistinguished service with the American Bar Association, including \nservices as director of the ABA's Governmental Affairs Office.\n  Born in Vermont, Bob received his B.A. from Yale University in 1966 \nand his law degree from the University of Michigan in 1969. He began \nhis legal career at the Chicago firm known today as Sachnoff & Weaver, \npracticing corporate and commercial law. When an opportunity to work on \npublic policy issues arose, he joined the ABA Chicago staff in 1972, \nand soon found himself working in the ABA's Washington, DC, office. \nSince 1982, Bob has served as director of the Governmental Affairs \nOffice, providing strong leadership on many issues, including judicial \nindependence, tax reform, the PATRIOT Act, and numerous anticrime and \nantiterrorism bills. Perhaps what people will remember most is Bob's \ncareer-long effort to guarantee access to justice for all through the \ndevelopment and preservation of the Legal Services Corporation, which \nfunds local legal aid programs to help low-income individuals and \nfamilies deal with basic legal problems that affect day-to-day living.\n  Bob is listed in ``Who's Who in America'' and ``Who's Who in American \nLaw.'' He has received numerous awards and commendations for his \ndedicated and tireless work in seeking equal justice for America's \npoor, including recognition from the National Legal Aid and Defender \nAssociation and the National Clients Council.\n  Bob has also made outstanding contributions to Washington-area \ncommunities. He has served Washington Grove, MD, as mayor and town \ncouncil member, and currently sits on the Washington Grove Planning \nCommission. Bob has also chaired the Associations Division of the \nNational Capital Area United Way Campaign, and has helped to raise \nmillions of dollars for DC area charities to support those in need. He \nalso was president of Project Northstar, a homeless children's tutoring \nprogram for homeless children in the District of Columbia.\n  With his dedication to the rule of law, his professionalism, his \nexpertise and his unfailing good humor, Bob has fulfilled the highest \nideals and goals of the legal profession. He has improved the \nadministration of justice, and brought greater access to legal \nrepresentation and American justice for all persons, regardless of \ntheir economic or social condition. Bob will be greatly missed. I join \nhis many colleagues and friends in wishing Bob, his wife Kathie, and \ntheir daughter Sarah much happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4299-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4299-S4300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               Private First Class Stephen K. Richardson\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to humbly honor a Bridgeport, \nCT, soldier who lost his life in the service of our country: Private \nFirst Class Stephen K. Richardson.\n  On Tuesday, March 20, the 22-year-old Private First Class Richardson \nand another soldier were killed when a roadside bomb exploded near \ntheir vehicle in Baghdad. Now Stephen is being remembered for his \nspirit of service, for his devotion to his country, and for his love of \nhis family.\n  Stephen served with the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry, 4th Brigade, \n1st Infantry Division, which has been charged with securing Baghdad. \nPrivate First Class Richardson took on that mission willingly: ``He \nwanted to be part of America's protection,'' said his grandmother, Ina \nJackson. ``He wanted to help resolve the problems in Iraq.'' Like \nnearly every other soldier who has enlisted since the start of the Iraq \nwar, Private First Class Richardson knew exactly where he was going and \nexactly what risks he'd be facing which makes his sacrifice all the \nmore admirable.\n  Those who were close to Stephen know just what a fine young life has \nbeen cut off. Edward Geist, a professor at the University of \nBridgeport, remembers teaching him. ``He was older than my other \nstudents he took the work more seriously,'' said Professor Geist. He \nstill remembers an essay Private First Class Richardson wrote about his \nfuture plans returning to his family's home in Jamaica and starting a \nbusiness to help improve living conditions. ``It was much more \nreflective and serious than what we normally get,'' Stephen's professor \nsaid. I think that seriousness of purpose was exactly what drove \nPrivate First Class Richardson to serve his country and a glimpse of \nthe bright future he might have had in store.\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\n  Instead, his death leaves a father and mother to bury their son; a \nfatherless daughter, Iyanna; and a widowed and pregnant wife, Katana. \nTheir memories of Stephen are bright and indelible: Stephen planting \ntomatoes, spinach, and string beans in the backyard garden with his \ngrandmother; Stephen giving a pony ride to his 7-year-old cousin; \nStephen watching ``Bugs Bunny'' with infant Iyanna. Today, I imagine \nthat each of those memories comes back with a stab of grief to those \nwho loved Stephen; but I pray that time will turn them into a \nwellspring of comfort.\n  This war leaves behind more anguish than we can easily bear. At 4 \na.m. on Tuesday morning, Stephen's mother, Jacqueline Hamilton-Carby, \nstarted out of bed in Jamaica and sat down to write him a letter: ``It \nhas been 43 days, that is 1,032 hours or 61,920 minutes, better yet \n3,715,200 seconds, since I heard your voice. That is a long, l-o-n-g \ntime but whereas I was worried before, I have placed you in the hand of \nGod.'' On the same day, her son was killed.\n  But she has no doubt that he is in that hand still. ``I'm not angry \nwith anyone,'' said Ms. Hamilton-Carby. ``I just view it as the work of \nGod.''\n  May she find comfort, and all who loved Stephen, and all who are \nbereaved. I add my voice to their prayers, and I pledge my highest \nrespect to an American soldier who died in our service, Private First \nClass Stephen K. Richardson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4300-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STRATEGIC REFINERY RESERVE ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a bill I \nintroduced, the Strategic Refinery Reserve Act of 2007. This bill would \nauthorize the Department of Energy to build enough refining capacity to \nmeet the energy needs of the Federal Government--primarily the \nDepartment of Defense--and to supply the private market in times of \nshortages and price spikes.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which severely damaged oil refineries in \nthe Gulf Coast, illustrated the Nation's vulnerability to a disruption \nin supply of refined petroleum and exposed shortcomings in our current \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve system. The Strategic Refinery Reserve Act \nwould address these issues by having a refining capacity of 5 percent \nof total U.S. consumption of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Three \npercent of capacity would be held in reserve, ready to increase supply \nin the private market in times of energy emergencies. The remaining 2 \npercent of that would go to the Federal Government to support the day-\nto-day needs of the military, saving taxpayers from paying the oil \nindustry's inflated prices.\n  The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Monday that \ndrivers paid an average of $2.80 a gallon for regular gasoline last \nweek, up from $2.70 the week prior. According to the report, prices are \nnow 11.7 cents per gallon higher than April of 2006. The price per \nbarrel of oil, set by the Middle East cartel Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries, OPEC, is only one factor that pushes up the price \nof gas and oil in our country. Refining capacity, the infrastructure \nthat takes crude oil and turns it into gas, is down dramatically, which \npushes the price of gas up for everyone.\n  U.S. refineries today are running at full, or near full, capacity. In \n1981, there were 324 refineries in the United States; today there are \n149. Big Oil has made it clear that they are unwilling to reinvest \ntheir record profits in new refineries because the less they sell, the \nmore they make per gallon. That may be good for oil company \nshareholders, but it is bad for consumers. The Strategic Refinery \nReserve Act will ensure the availability of emergency refinery capacity \nand protect consumers from sharp increases in the price of petroleum \nproducts. Our economy, our military, our communities and our families \nare struggling under the burden of high energy prices. They expect us \nto work to bring energy prices down. This bill would do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4300-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4300-S4301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     IN HONOR OF JOSEPH W. COTCHETT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I recognize Joseph W. \nCotchett of Burlingame, CA, on the occasion of his being honored by \nSanta Clara University School of Law as their 2007 Distinguished \nAdvocate. Joe is a partner in the law firm of Cotchett, Pitre & \nMcCarthy and is widely considered to be one of the leading trial \nlawyers in the United States by plaintiffs and defense attorneys.\n  The renowned Santa Clara University, SCU, School of Law is honoring \nJoe for his exceptional lifetime of advocacy. For more than 15 years, \nSCU has carefully selected Distinguished Advocates and brought them to \ncampus to expose students to outstanding trial lawyers. This month, Joe \nCotchett joins an impressive list of Santa Clara University's \nDistinguished Advocates.\n  For the past 10 years, the National Law Journal has named Joe \nCotchett one of the 100 Most Influential Lawyers in America. In 2003, \nthe San Francisco Chronicle named him one of the Top Ten Lawyers in the \nSan Francisco Bay Area, saying:\n\n       The Burlingame attorney has had a star career that's not \n     only talked about in legal circles but has made headlines \n     around the country. Known mostly as a plaintiff lawyer, many \n     of his cases are filed on behalf of fraud victims, and have a \n     widows-and-orphan flavor to them.\n\n  The San Francisco/Los Angeles Daily Journal has said that Joe is \n``considered one of the best trial strategists in the state'' who built \na career out of representing the underdog against powerful interests.\n  One of the Nation's best trial lawyers, Joe fights for what he \nbelieves is right. Joe has won settlements for investors in white-\ncollar fraud cases and represented numerous California public agencies, \nincluding the California State Teachers' Retirement System. He took on \ncorrupt energy giant Enron during California's energy crisis.\n  Joe was the lead trial lawyer for 23,000 elderly customers in the \nLincoln Savings & Loan Association debacle. After a 4-month trial, he \nwon one of the largest jury verdicts then recorded. For his work in \ndefense of the watchdog group Consumers Union, Trial Lawyers for Public \nJustice honored Joe for his ``outstanding contribution to the public \ninterest'' as ``Trial of the Year Finalist'' in 2000.\n  In the 1970s, Joe was involved in early environment lawsuits to save \nthe California coast and numerous consumer actions which laid the \ngroundwork for many of our present consumer laws in California. In \nrecent years, Joe has focused on financial fraud on behalf of \nshareholders and public pension funds.\n  Joe is also my appointment to the Federal Judicial Advisory \nCommittee, which President George W. Bush, Senator Dianne Feinstein, \nand I authorized.\n  It is clear that Joe is one of the top trial lawyers in the country. \nWhat is equally impressive is that while some people would have stopped \nthere, satisfied with this outstanding accomplishment, Joe continues to \ngive of his time and resources. And not just with worthy pro bono work.\n  Throughout his lifetime, Joe has been committed to fighting the good \nfight. From his days as a college student in the South, challenging \nsegregation by drinking from segregated water fountains, to his work as \none of nine members and chair of the California State Parks Commission; \nfrom his involvement with the Boys and Girls Club to his work with \nDisability Rights Advocates, which honored him in 2003 for his nearly \n40 years of civil rights work, Joe's dedication to others has had an \nenormous reach.\n  Joe is deeply committed to giving back to his local community. He \npreserved the Debenedetti building, a Mission Revival Style building \nwhich is very special to residents of Half Moon Bay in California. He \nwrote ``The Lost Coast,'' the historical guide to the California coast \nbetween Santa Cruz and San Francisco. Joe is involved in numerous bay \narea charitable organizations involving animals, children, women, and \nminorities. He established the Cotchett Family Foundation to aid those \nin need.\n  Born in Brooklyn, Joe received his B.S. in engineering from \nCalifornia Polytechnic College in San Luis Obispo in 1960. He earned \nhis J.D. from Hastings College of Law at the University of California \nin 1964. Joe served in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps and was a \nSpecial Forces paratrooper and\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\nJAG Corps officer. As a veteran, he has continued to assist veterans.\n  In 2000, UC Hastings opened the Cotchett Center for Advocacy \nrecognizing Joe as one of its outstanding graduates. In 2004, Cotchett \nendowed a $7 million fund to support science and mathematics teacher \neducation at California State Polytechnic University to serve inner-\ncity and rural minority children. To honor Joe, Cal Poly renamed its \nlandmark Clock Tower the Cotchett Education Building. In 2006, the \nJoseph W. Cotchett Business Studio for students was dedicated at Notre \nDame de Namur University.\n  Congratulations to Joe Cotchett for being named Santa Clara \nUniversity's Distinguished Advocate for 2007. This is a worthy addition \nto a very long list of accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4301-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN RAYMOND GERALD MURPHY\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with a sad heart that I \ncome to the floor today and honor my good friend Raymond Gerald Murphy. \nJerry Murphy died last Friday at the age of 77. A burial with full \nmilitary honors is planned for Santa Fe National Cemetery this week.\n  CPT Jerry Murphy was the 39th U.S. marine to be awarded the Medal of \nHonor for heroism in the Korean war. He was decorated by President \nDwight Eisenhower in a White House ceremony in 1953. In addition to the \nMedal of Honor, Captain Murphy was also awarded the Silver Star, the \nPurple Heart, the Korean Service Medal with two bronze stars, the \nUnited Nations Service Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal. \nJerry Murphy was a hero in every sense of the word.\n  What really made Jerry special though was his service to others. When \nhe returned from Korea, he dedicated his entire life to taking care of \nother veterans. He spent 23 years working in the Albuquerque VA \nRegional Office. Upon his retirement, he continued to serve veterans as \na volunteer until he became too sick to do so. Earlier this year, \nSenator Bingaman and I introduced a bill to rename the Veterans Affairs \nMedical Center in Albuquerque, as the ``Raymond G. Murphy Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center.'' I am very sad this was not completed \nbefore Jerry died, but I hope it will be completed soon.\n  In addition to all of Jerry's military honors, he was also a family \nman. Jerry is survived by his wife Maryann, his sons John, Michael, and \nTim, his daughter Eleanor, as well as eight grandchildren. My thoughts \nand prayers are with the Murphy family this week; I know they are proud \nof what Jerry accomplished in his lifetime.\n  Jerry Murphy was a close friend, and I will miss him greatly. I \nalways valued his friendship and advice. Godspeed, amigo. You touched \nmany lives and helped many people. Your legacy will not soon be \nforgotten.\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish today to commemorate the \nlife of retired Marine Captain Raymond Gerald Murphy. Captain Murphy \npassed away on April 6, 2007, but left behind a legacy that will not \nsoon be forgotten. His legacy of courage, valor, and commitment to his \ncountry will forever remain a part of the history and heart of the \nUnited States.\n  Captain Murphy was born and raised in Pueblo, CO. After graduating \nfrom Adams State College, he selflessly volunteered for the U.S. Marine \nCorps and was sent to officer training school. At only 23 years old, \n2nd Lieutenant Murphy led a Marine platoon to perform an evacuation \nmission in the hills of South Korea after U.S. troops had sustained \nmonths of heavy mortar attack from enemy forces. Lieutenant Murphy \nbravely commanded a small group of men up the hill to survey the \nsituation. Met by intense enemy fire, Lieutenant Murphy pressed on to \nrescue wounded and killed marines, while continuing to support combat \nplatoons. Realizing that all platoon commanders had been either killed \nor severely wounded, Murphy found himself in charge of the attack and \nbegan reorganizing his men. Murphy ordered his men to carry the wounded \nback down the hill for medical attention, and carried many men on his \nown back.\n  Having sustained a wound to his left side, and shot through his right \nhand, Murphy refused medical help until all of his men were brought to \nsafety. Wounded, he continued to go back up the hill, facing continued \nenemy fire, until every injured and fallen marine was carried back \ndown. As the last man down the hill, Lieutenant Murphy left not a \nsingle man on that shattered hillside in South Korea.\n  On October 27, 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower bestowed upon \nLieutenant Murphy the Medal of Honor, the highest award for his courage \nand heroic action during the Korean War. Lieutenant Murphy's Medal of \nHonor citation reads, ``His resolute and inspiring leadership, \nexceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest \ncredit upon Second Lieutenant Murphy and enhance the finest traditions \nof the United States Naval Service.'' I believe this encapsulates the \nessence of his service and patriotism as a U.S. marine.\n  I am honored to stand before the Senate today to pay tribute to the \nlife and service of CPT Raymond Murphy. I would like to offer my \ncondolences to his wife Marry Ann and his four children. His family has \nlost a husband and a father, and this Nation has lost a truly noble \nman, but may his gallantry and heroism be memorialized forever in the \nfreedoms of this great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4301-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4301-S4302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            100 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF RUNNING N CATTLE COMPANY\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I recognize the Running N \nCattle Company of Kenna, NM, that is currently celebrating its \ncentennial year of operation. The Running N Cattle Company's 100th \nanniversary date was in May of 2006.\n  The Running N Cattle Company is a family owned partnership that began \nin 1906. William H. Cooper and his wife Elizabeth left Hopkins County \nin east Texas, with their five grown children, to acquire free land \nthrough the Homestead Act in New Mexico. The act promised 160 acres of \nland for each adult and an abundant supply of water. All seven members \nof the Cooper family made their claim on 160 acres, just north and east \nof what is now the small village of Kenna, NM. William and Elizabeth \nsettled, making Kenna their home. Out of their five children, Joseph \n``Joe'' Cooper was the only child who remained at the original \nhomestead.\n  In 1909 Joe moved back to East Texas to marry his high school \nsweetheart, Gertrude Jackson. Shortly after, they traveled by train \nback to the homestead at Kenna where they continued ranching and began \nraising a family. Joe eventually purchased the pieces of land his \nbrothers and sisters had claimed in 1906. Although Joe ran both sheep \nand cattle on his land, he eventually made the decision that he wanted \nto concentrate all his efforts on raising cattle. Joe and Gertrude had \nfour children; Lewis Cranford Cooper born in 1915 was their only child \nwho decided to join his father in the ranching business.\n  In 1937 Lewis Cooper married Lucille Martin in Clovis, NM. In 1940 \nthey moved to the headquarters of the ranch near his parents' home. \nLewis was a sharp cattle tender and bought and sold cattle from \nCalifornia to Kansas. Lewis enjoyed the ranching business and had a \nkeen eye for good horses. Lewis grew up in Kenna and Elida where he \nstayed actively involved in his community, working to make it a \npleasant place to live. Lewis and Lucille had two daughters Virginia \nAnn, Jenny, and Jacqulin, Jackie. Lewis and Lucille continued ranching \nuntil Lewis died, in 1971. Lucille now makes her home in Portales where \nshe stays involved with her church, grandchildren, and two great-\ngrandsons.\n  Jenny Cooper, older daughter of Lewis and Lucille, married Dr. John \nClemmons in 1968 at the ranch home in Kenna. John has been active in \nthe stocker yearling business at this location since Lewis's death in \n1971. John has served as the general manager since 1971, along with \nthat title, he also embraces ownership duties. The Running N Cattle \nCompany has been continuously owned and operated by the same family. \nFor the past 36 years John and Jenny, along with Jackie are the fourth \ngeneration to own the partnership and continue the business. Throughout \nthe years the family has been able to purchase additional pieces of \nland allowing the ranch to expand. The headquarters is kept in the same\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\nlocation as the original homestead between Kenna and Elida, NM. The \nRunning N Brand appears on cattle in the counties of Roosevelt, Chavez, \nLea, DeBaca, and Guadalupe.\n  I am proud of the success of this hard-working family. This family \ncarries on all the traditions of the ranching lifestyle, in New Mexico \nand in the West. They take great pride in the land in which they have \nworked for many years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nthem for their continued contributions to the State of New Mexico. I \ncongratulate them on their success and wish them many successful years \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4302-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LEWIS ENTZ\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about an \nupstanding citizen of Colorado--Lewis Entz.\n  Former State Senator Entz will be receiving an honorary degree from \nAdams State College at their spring commencement on May 5, 2007. This \nhonor will be bestowed upon him in recognition of the work he has done \nfor the college and, more importantly, the San Luis Valley.\n  Lew Entz is the owner and operator of Entz Farms. He is a licensed \npilot, a husband and father of four, and a Marine Corps veteran of the \nKorean war. Before spending nearly 20 years serving the people of \nregion in the Colorado General Assembly, he was an Alamosa County \ncommissioner for 14 years.\n  I served in the Colorado Legislature with then-Representative Entz \nfor 8 years. We worked together on small airports, agriculture, and \nwater. During all my time dealing with him, I learned enough to \nheartily agree with the board of trustees of Adams State College in \ntheir assessment of his value to his community, region, and State.\n  Lew's vast knowledge of Colorado's complex water laws was incredibly \nimportant to his district. Water is the most important aspect of \nexistence in the San Luis Valley. Lew, as a farmer, has a full \nappreciation of this. Lew tirelessly worked for years to protect this \nresource for his constituents.\n  There is no one who has served the people of the San Luis Valley more \nvigorously or better than Lew Entz. I congratulate him on this honor \nfrom Adams State College, and want to thank him for his four decades of \nservice to the people of the San Luis Valley and the State of \nColorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4302-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING BOB AND JAN FRAUMANN\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge a very \nspecial occasion that only comes around once in a lifetime. This year \nBob and Jan Fraumann will celebrate 50 years of marriage.\n  Bob and Jan are very special members of my church, Mt. Zion United \nMethodist Church, in Marietta, GA. Bob has been our Director of Music \nfor as long as I can remember. Every Sunday is a musical experience, \nbut Easter, Christmas, and Independence Day are always exceptional. Bob \nworks extremely hard for months to arrange remarkable music programs \nfor those very special celebrations.\n  Bob and Jan are blessed with two sons, Rick and Greg, and four \ngrandchildren. Rick and his wife Laura have two children, Bobbie and \nBrittany. Greg and his wife Terri have two children, Victoria and \nSofia.\n  I am pleased today to join with my pastors, Steve Lyle and Laura \nParker, and our entire congregation in congratulating Bob and Jan \nFraumann on this truly momentous occasion. It is a privilege to stand \nhere in this Senate and honor this tremendous milestone that embodies \nthe profound love and commitment they have for one another.

Mr. President, National Crime Victims Rights Week \nwill soon be celebrated. I would like to compliment John Gillis, the \ndirector of the Office of Victims of Crime at the Department of \nJustice, for his outstanding work on behalf of crime victims. I ask to \nhave printed in the Record a column I wrote about Mr. Gillis.\n  The material follows.\n\n                     Honoring Director John Gillis\n\n                       (By U.S. Senator Jon Kyl)\n\n       Each April for the past 26 years, the Nation has observed \n     National Crime Victims Rights Week. This is a time when the \n     country recognizes the harm suffered by millions of Americans \n     at the hands of criminals and calls for additional ways to \n     support victims in their struggle for justice.\n       This year I'd like to use this week to praise the \n     leadership of John W. Gillis, the Director of the Justice \n     Department's Office for Victims of Crime (OVC). During his \n     long and distinguished law-enforcement career--including two \n     decades with the Los Angeles Police Department and a stint as \n     chair of the California Board of Prison Terms--Mr. Gillis has \n     fought tirelessly on behalf of crime victims.\n       Mr. Gillis experienced personal tragedy in 1979 when gang \n     members murdered his daughter Louarna as part of a targeted \n     killing of children of police officers.\n       This horrific tragedy compelled him to help found the \n     Justice for Homicide Victims and the Coalition of Victims \n     Equal Rights, an organization that works for the rights of \n     victims and their families. He also founded Victims and \n     Friends United and has been an active member of Memory of \n     Victims Everywhere and Parents of Murdered Children, a \n     support group for families of homicide victims.\n       The President nominated Mr. Gillis to become Director of \n     OVC in 2001, and I was honored to lead his nomination through \n     the Senate. Since the beginning of his tenure, he has \n     transformed the OVC into an organization that truly puts \n     victims first.\n       Through his ``victims first'' focus, he helped provide the \n     inspiration for the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy \n     Preston, Louarna Gillis, Nila Lynn Crime Victims Rights Act \n     of 2004, named in part after his daughter, which Senator \n     Dianne Feinstein and I cosponsored, and which extends \n     meaningful and enforceable rights to federal crime victims \n     for the first time in our Nation's history.\n       To ensure that these new rights will be enforced through \n     our courts, Mr. Gillis has supported the National Crime \n     Victim Law Institute and new clinics across the country; such \n     as the one here in Arizona, established by Arizona Voice for \n     Crime Victims, which provided the first model in the Nation. \n     These clinics provide free legal and social services to \n     victims of crime who seek to be treated with the respect and \n     dignity that they deserve. Congress has followed the example \n     Mr. Gillis set by providing critically needed resources to \n     support these efforts beginning in 2006, and we are committed \n     to continue expanding them.\n       Under his leadership, OVC created the Helping Outreach \n     Programs to Expand (HOPE) grant program to help fund \n     grassroots victim service organizations that have had \n     difficulty in obtaining public funding through other sources. \n     In 2002, 376 programs received over $1.8 million to support \n     its development efforts, and, in 2007, the HOPE program will \n     continue to develop and expand the use of grassroots service \n     providers to help expand outreach to victims.\n       OVC has reached out to the Native American communities \n     where the highest rates of violent crime occur. It increased \n     funding for services to victims and expanded eligibility for \n     this funding to include tribes not under federal \n     jurisdiction. In 2005, OVC funded approximately $8.5 million \n     for projects serving Native American crime victims, and, in \n     2006, it increased discretionary funding to $3.5 million for \n     the Tribal Victim Assistance Program, allowing 30 tribes to \n     develop direct services to victims of violent crime.\n       OVC also recently announced the availability of an online \n     application for the International Terrorism Victim Expense \n     Reimbursement Program, which is intended to reimburse victims \n     for allowable expenses incurred as a result of acts of \n     terrorism occurring outside the United States. Additionally, \n     under OVC's Antiterrorism and Emergency Assistance Program, \n     OVC provided assistance to jurisdictions to support the \n     response to incidents of mass violence on school campuses.\n       This Crime Victims Rights Week, we should not only honor \n     crime victims and those affected by crime, but think about \n     new ways to help and support victims in their struggle for \n     justice. The examples that I've cited are only a few of Mr. \n     Gillis's accomplishments as OVC director that will help those \n     seeking justice. And, I am proud to have someone like Mr. \n     Gillis guiding these efforts. His service to the President \n     and to crime victims is a credit to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4302-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4302-S4303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GIRL SCOUTS OF THE OUACHITA COUNCIL\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, honest and fair. Friendly and \nhelpful. Considerate and caring. Courageous and strong. For 80 years, \nthe Girl Scouts of Ouachita Council have worked to instill these values \ninto the girls of central and southeast Arkansas. On April 14, 2007, \nthey will gather together to celebrate this impressive anniversary, and \nI want to take this time to celebrate with them. Their tireless \ncommitment to the young women of our State has helped bring out the \nbest in the daughters of Arkansas, and we owe them a great deal of \nthanks for this important work.\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\n  With the stated mission of building girls of courage, confidence and \ncharacter, the Girl Scouts of America started as a group of just 18 in \nSavannah, GA, in 1915. And as the Scouts have grown up along with the \ncountry, their cause has lost none of its relevance or necessity. They \nhave brought those simple, yet noble ideals to all parts of the Nation \nand now proudly claim a membership of more than 3.6 million.\n  Through the Girl Scouts, young women develop a sense of civic \nresponsibility and self-esteem that helps them realize the critical \nrole they have to play in their communities and their country. Similar \nideals were taught to me at an early age by my family and have helped \nto motivate and inspire me throughout my career.\n  Years ago, my mother told me, ``It's a fact, not a fault, that we \nhaven't had more women in elected office. It's just the way history \nturned out. But it's our fault if we don't do something to change that \nand to bring more women into government and the future.''\n  Today, I am proud to be one of 16 women serving in the Senate--the \nlargest class of women Senators in American history. Across the \ncountry, we see women taking more active leadership roles not only \npolitics, but business, education and science. We have built on the \ngreat foundation that was laid for us by generations past, and it is \nour responsibility to these courageous leaders to continue momentum \nforward. This is especially true in Arkansas as we carry on legacy of \nHattie Caraway, the first woman ever elected to the Senate and a \ntrailblazer for women in politics.\n  There is still much left to do, and the unyielding commitment of \ngroups like the Girl Scouts will prepare the next wave of great \nAmerican women to the benefit of their communities and country.

A bill to safely redeploy United States troops from Iraq; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is just over 4 years since our brave \ntroops marched into Baghdad, bringing an end to the dictatorship of \nSaddam Hussein. Four long years later, however, over 141,000 U.S. \ntroops remain in Iraq and more are on the way, while that country \ncontinues its tragic descent into widespread violence and civil war. \nFour years later, the President continues to insist that he has no \nintention of bringing this war to an end--or even acknowledging when it \nmight end. And, 4 years later, the American people are calling out in \ngreater and greater numbers for an end to a misguided and open-ended \nmilitary mission.\n  That is why, today, along with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, I \nam introducing legislation that would require the President to begin \nsafely redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq within 120 days, and that \nwould require redeployment to be completed by March 31, 2008, by ending \nfunding for the war on that date. While I would personally prefer an \neven stronger approach, with a shorter time-frame, for ending the war, \nI am pleased to be working with the Majority Leader on this \nlegislation. Senator Reid understands the terrible costs of this war, \nand he understands the solemn obligation we have in this body to bring \nit to a close. As he put it just a few days ago, ``It is not worth \nanother drop of American blood in Iraq. It is not worth another damaged \nbrain.'' I thank Senator Reid for his support and for agreeing to bring \nthe bill up for a vote before Memorial Day. I am also pleased to have \nthe cosponsorship of Senators Leahy, Dodd, Kerry, Boxer, Whitehouse and \nKennedy.\n  There is no U.S. military solution to Iraq's civil war, which the \nrecently declassified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) called a \n``self-sustaining inter-sectarian struggle between Shia and Sunnis.'' \nAnd even if there were a military solution, civil war is only one of \nthe problems causing violence and instability in Iraq. Again, let me \nquote the NIE: ``the term `civil war' does not adequately capture the \ncomplexity of the conflict in Iraq, which includes extensive Shia-on-\nShia violence, al-Qa'ida and Sunni insurgent attacks on Coalition \nforces, and widespread criminally motivated violence.''\n  Most Americans recognize that it makes no sense to ask our troops to \npolice an ongoing civil war. Nor does it\n\n[[Page S4309]]\n\nmake any sense to ask our troops to put down a Sunni insurgency, or to \nplace them in the middle of ``Shia-on-Shia violence'' or ``criminally \nmotivated violence'' in Iraq.\n  It does, however, make sense to address the ongoing threat posed by \nal Qaeda. For that reason, the Feingold-Reid legislation would allow \n``targeted operations, limited in duration and scope, against members \nof al Qaeda and other international terrorist organizations'' to \ncontinue in Iraq after March 2008. The bill also has narrow exceptions \nfor U.S. troops to train and equip Iraqis and provide security for \nother U.S. troops and civilian personnel, but neither of these \nexceptions authorizes U.S. troops to engage in combat operations.\n  The Feingold-Reid bill allows targeted operations to take out \nterrorists who pose a threat to the United States, but it recognizes \nthat maintaining a huge U.S. troop presence in Iraq doesn't help--in \nfact, it hurts--our global anti-terrorism efforts. By redeploying the \nvast majority of U.S. troops from Iraq, this legislation will allow us \nto re-focus on the broader fight against al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is not a \none country franchise, and the President's strategy of devoting so much \nof our resources and attention to one country is short-sighted and \ncounter-productive.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that cutting off funds for the war is the \nsame as cutting off funds for the troops. They raise the specter of \ntroops being left on the battlefield without the training, equipment \nand resources they need.\n  Those arguments are false. Every member of Congress agrees that we \nmust continue to support our troops and give them the resources and \nsupport they need. Not a single member would ever vote for any proposal \nthat would jeopardize the safety of our troops. The Feingold-Reid bill \nwould end our involvement in the war without in any way impairing the \nsafety of our brave servicemembers. By setting a March 31, 2008, \ndeadline after which funding for the war will be terminated, Congress \ncan provide ample time for the President to safely redeploy our troops.\n  Former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger made this point at a \nJudiciary Committee hearing I chaired entitled ``Exercising Congress's \nConstitutional Power to End a War.'' Speaking of my proposal to end \nfunding for the war, he said: ``There would not be one penny less for \nsalary of the troops. There would not be one penny less for benefits of \nthe troops. There would not be one penny less for weapons or \nammunition. There would not be one penny less for supplies or support. \nThose troops would simply be redeployed to other areas where the armed \nforces are utilized.''\n  This has been done before, in fact not that long ago. In October \n1993, Congress enacted an amendment cutting off funding for military \noperations in Somalia effective March 31, 1994, with limited \nexceptions. Seventy-six Senators voted for that amendment. Many of them \nare still in this body, such as Senator Cochran, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Lugar, Senator McConnell, Senator Specter, \nSenator Stevens and Senator Warner. Did those 8 Senators, and the many \nDemocratic Senators who joined them, act to jeopardize the safety and \nsecurity of U.S. troops in Somalia? By cutting off funds for a military \nmission, were they indifferent to the well-being of our brave men and \nwomen in uniform?\n  Of course not. All of these members recognized that Congress had the \npower and the responsibility to bring our military operations in \nSomalia to a close, by establishing a date after which funds would be \nterminated.\n  That same day, October 15, 1993, several Senators--myself included--\nsupported an even stronger effort to end funding for Somalia \noperations. The amendment offered by Senator McCain would have \neliminated Somalia funding right away except for funds for withdrawal \nor in case of American POWs or MIAs not being accounted for. Thirty-\neight Senators, most of them Republicans, opposed a measure to table \nthat amendment. We did so because we understood that Senator McCain was \nproposing an appropriate, safe, responsible way to use our power of the \npurse to bring an ill-conceived military mission to a close without in \nany way harming our troops. As Senator Hatch said at the time, ``The \nMcCain amendment provides the President with the flexibility needed to \nbring our forces home with honor and without endangering the safety of \nAmerican troops.''\n  Feingold-Reid also allows the President to bring our brave forces \nhome with honor and without endangering them in any way. It is safe, it \nis responsible, and it is long overdue.\n  The President will not listen to the American people. It is up to \nthis Congress--newly elected by Americans fed up with the President's \nmishandling of Iraq--to let the people's voices be heard. And it is up \nto this Congress to end a war that is undermining our national security \nand draining precious resources from the global fight against al Qaeda \nand its allies. Last November, the American people voted to end the \nwar. Now it is up to Congress to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1078. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for employer-provided employee housing assistance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Housing \nAmerica's Workforce Act. My legislation will address the need to ensure \nsafe, decent, and affordable housing as well as creating and sustaining \nhealthy communities for our Nation's workforce. I would also like to \nthank Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez for her leadership in introducing \nthe companion bill in the House of Representatives.\n  The sad truth is that across the Nation, working full-time no longer \nguarantees the security and comfort of a home. The shortage of \nworkforce housing has emerged as a national crisis as housing costs \nhave far outgrown the rate of inflation in many markets. As the gap \nbetween wages and housing costs widens, affordable housing is pushed \nbeyond the reach of an increasing number of working families.\n  As a result, people who provide the bulk of vital community \nservices--teachers, firefighters, police officers, and laundry and \nrestaurant workers--often cannot themselves afford to live in the high-\npriced communities in which they serve. That is why I am reintroducing \nthe Housing America's Workforce Act.\n  This bill creates incentives to expand employer assisted housing \ninitiatives across the Nation. This legislation offers a tax credit of \n50 cents for every dollar that an employer provides to eligible \nemployees, up to $10,000 or six percent of the employee's home purchase \nprice, whichever is less, or up to $2,000 for rental assistance.\n  In addition, this act defines housing assistance as a nontaxable \nbenefit to ensure that employees receive the full value of employers' \ncontributions. Finally, the act establishes a competitive grant program \navailable to nonprofit housing organizations that provide technical \nassistance, program administration, and outreach support to employers \nundertaking housing assistance initiatives.\n  The benefits of this legislation are far reaching. Employees receive \nfinancial support to buy or rent a home closer to work, while their \nemployer enjoys the benefits of a more stable workforce, including \nimproved morale, and reduced turnover and recruitment resulting in \nbottom line savings. Furthermore, the surrounding community receives a \nnew investment in the form of property taxes, as former commuters buy \nhomes near the jobsite.\n  Research has shown that this legislation is needed. Recent data shows \nthat the number of working families with critical housing problems, \ndefined as those paying more than half of their income for housing and/\nor living in dilapidated conditions, has increased 67 percent from 1997 \nto approximately 5 million families. In addition, a recent workforce \nhousing study released by the National Association of Home Builders \nfound that workers who provide vital services to the community can only \nfind affordable housing in less than half of the Nation's top 25 \nmetropolitan areas.\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\n  The Housing America's Workforce Act addresses our Nation's housing \nchallenge from a new perspective by allowing the private sector to play \na direct role in promoting housing affordability. This legislation will \ncreate opportunities for us as a Nation to expand these public-private \npartnerships and will make a profound impact in the lives of our \nworkforce.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this legislation and \nmove it to the floor without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Obama (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Menendez, Mr. Brown, and Ms. Cantwell)):\n  S. 1084. A bill to provide housing assistance for very low-income \nveterans; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homes for \nHeroes Act of 2007. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Schumer, \nMenendez, Brown and Cantwell in offering this legislation.\n  As we respond to the moral question of how we honor our sacred trust \nto care for our returning servicemembers and veterans, I am reminded of \nmy grandfather, who signed up for duty in World War II the day after \nPearl Harbor. He marched across Europe in Patton's army, and when he \ncame home to Kansas, he could have very easily faced some tough times.\n  He could've had trouble paying for college, or finding a job, or even \nfinding a home. But at the time, he lived in a country that recognized \nthe value of his service--a country that kept its promise to defend \nthose who have defended freedom. And so he was able to afford college \nthrough the GI Bill, and he was able to buy a house through the Federal \nHousing Administration, and he was able to work hard and raise a family \nand build his own American Dream.\n  And after I think about my grandfather, and the opportunities he had \nas a veteran, I then think about a veteran I met named Bill Allen, who \ntold me that on a trip he took to Chicago, he actually saw homeless \nveterans fighting over access to the dumpsters. Think about that. \nFighting over access to the dumpsters.\n  Each and every night in this country, more than 200,000 of our \nNation's veterans are homeless. And nearly twice as many will \nexperience homelessness over the course of a year. There is no single \ncause for this.\n  Homeless vets are men and women, single and married. Many suffer from \nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder; others were physically and mentally \nbattered in combat. A large number left the military without job skills \nthat could be easily used in the private sector.\n  All have risked their lives for their country. All deserve--at the \nvery least--the basic dignity of going to sleep at night with a roof \nover their head. And every day we allow them to go without, it brings \nshame to every single one of us.\n  This is wrong. It's wrong because we're quick to offer words of \npraise for our troops when they're abroad, but quick to forget about \ntheir needs when they come home. It's wrong because we have the \nresources and the programs in place to help solve this problem. And \nit's wrong on a fundamentally moral level--the idea that we would allow \nsuch brave and selfless citizens to suffer in such biting poverty. And \nso it is now our responsibility--it is now our duty--to make this \nright.\n  These heroes often have not connected to vital housing and supportive \nservices that could make all of the difference. Many more low income \nveterans and veteran families live at the margins and are at risk of \nbecoming homeless in the absence of permanent housing solutions and \nsupportive services. While it's one thing to get veterans off the \nstreets temporarily, it's another to keep them off--to place veterans \nin real, permanent homes. In fact, the VA has consistently identified \npermanent housing as one of the top three unmet needs in the fight \nagainst veteran homelessness. And despite the tremendous demand for \nhomeless services, the federal government serves only a tiny fraction \nof those who are in need.\n  That's why I'm introducing a bill today called the Homes for Heroes \nAct. This is a bill that would help expand access to long-term, \naffordable housing by creating a fund so that the community and \nnonprofit organizations could purchase, build, or rehabilitate homes \nand apartments for veterans.\n  So that we don't just leave them to face their personal challenges on \ntheir own, the organizations would also provide services like \ncounseling, employment training, and child care to the veterans who \nlive in this housing. And the Homes for Heroes Act would expand the \nnumber of permanent housing vouchers for veterans from the current \nnumber of less than 2,000 to 20,000, and make this authorization \npermanent. These are vouchers that have been highly successful in \ngiving veterans the chance to afford a place to live.\n  Every day in America, there are men and women on street corners with \nhandwritten signs that say ``Homeless Veteran--Will Work For Food.'' \nSometimes we give a dollar, sometimes we just keep walking. These are \nsoldiers who fought in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq. They \nmade a commitment to their country when they chose to serve and now we \nmust keep our commitment to them. Because when we make the decision to \nsend our troops to war, we also make the decision to care for them, to \nspeak for them, and to think of them--always--when they come home.\n  This kind of America--an America of opportunity, of collective \nresponsibility for each other--is the kind that so many of our parents \nand grandparents came home to after the Second World War. Now it's time \nfor us to build this America for those sons and daughters who come home \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lott, Mr. Allard, \n        and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1083. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nincrease competitiveness in the United States, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation from \nlast Congress--the Securing Knowledge, Innovation, and Leadership Act \nof 2007 or the ``SKIL Act of 2007''. In the past two years, there has \nbeen so much focus by this Congress and this Administration on \nrestoring America's competitive advantage. The President has proposed \nthe America's Competitiveness Initiative. Last Congress, I was proud to \ncosponsor the Protecting America's Competitive Edge bills and the \nAmerican Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2006. In the 110th \nCongress, I have cosponsored along with 44 other Senators the America \nCOMPETES Act. This is a bipartisan legislative response to \nrecommendations contained in the National Academies' ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm'' report and the Council on Competitiveness' ``Innovate \nAmerica'' report.\n  The one thing we have learned through the process of retaining \nAmerica's competitiveness is that everyone has to do their part to keep \nour country's economy strong and viable. Currently, we are working very \nhard on comprehensive immigration reform and I am pleased to be a part \nof that process. However, our country, right now, is losing its \ncompetitive edge in the global market. Why? Because our immigration \npolicies prohibit us from retaining some of the ``best and brightest'' \nstudents currently graduating from U.S. colleges and universities--\nespecially those with advanced degrees in science and technology. We \nalso continue to lose highly qualified and highly skilled workers to \nforeign competitors because of our failed immigration system.\n  Recently Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates made it clear the dire \nsituation we are faced with today in terms of high-skilled labor \nshortages:\n  ``For generations, America has prospered largely by attracting the \nworld's best and brightest to study, live, and work in the United \nStates. Our success at attracting the greatest talent has helped us \nbecome a global innovation leader, enriched our culture, and created \neconomic opportunities for all Americans.\n  Unfortunately, America's immigration policies are driving away the \nworld's best and brightest precisely when we need them most . . . \nMoreover, the terrible shortfall in our visa supply for the highly \nskilled stems not from security concerns, but from visa policies that \nhave not been updated in over a decade and a half. We live in a\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\ndifferent economy now. Simply put: It makes no sense to tell well-\ntrained, highly skilled individuals--many of whom are educated at our \ntop colleges and universities--that the United States does not welcome \nor value them. For too many foreign students and professionals, \nhowever, our immigration policies send precisely this message.\n  This should be deeply troubling to us, both in human terms and in \nterms of our own economic self-interest. America will find it \ninfinitely more difficult to maintain its technological leadership if \nit shuts out the very people who are most able to help us compete. \nOther nations are recognizing and benefiting from this situation. They \nare crafting their immigration policies to attract highly talented \nstudents and professionals who would otherwise study, live, and work \nhere. Our lost opportunities are their gains.''\n  The U.S. Department of Labor projects that between 2002 and 2012 \nthere will be 2 million U.S. job openings in the fields of computer \nscience, mathematics, engineering and the physical sciences. The SKIL \nbill would retain foreign students educated in the U.S. to ensure \ncontinued competition in the global market.\n  As I have stated before, a critical part of America's economy is our \nability to innovate but our current immigration policies are \nthreatening future growth. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's \nrecent announcement that the 2008 cap for H-1B workers was met in one \nday makes clear that we urgently need to reform our policies for \nhighly-skilled workers in the scientific and technology fields. Because \nthe U.S. has already met the cap for H-1B visas, foreign students \ngraduating from our universities this spring are virtually shut out of \nthe U.S. job market. This situation is unprecedented. If we don't act, \nAmerica's technology companies will be harmed and our economy will \nsuffer. The SKIL bill will allow the U.S. to remain competitive in this \nglobal economy.\n  The SKIL bill promotes competitiveness and allows the U.S. to remain \ncompetitive in this global economy. While I encourage and intend to be \na part of the continued dialogue on overall immigration reform, I urge \nmy colleagues to act quickly on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4311-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 140--TO AUTHORIZE LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN THE MATTER \n               OF THE APPLICATION OF COMMITTEE ON FINANCE\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 141\n\n       Whereas the International Tracing Service (ITS) archives \n     located in Bad Arolsen, Germany, which are administered by \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross, contain an \n     estimated 50,000,000 records on the fates of some 17,500,000 \n     individual victims of Nazi war crimes;\n       Whereas the ITS archives at Bad Arolsen remain the largest \n     closed Holocaust-era archives in the world;\n       Whereas, although access to individual records can be \n     requested by Holocaust survivors and their descendants, many \n     who have requested information from the ITS archives have \n     reported facing significant delays and even unresponsiveness;\n       Whereas the ITS archives remain inaccessible to researchers \n     and research institutions;\n       Whereas the Agreement Constituting an International \n     Commission for the International Tracing Service, signed at \n     Bonn June 6, 1955 (6 UST 6186) (commonly known as the ``Bonn \n     Accords'') established an international commission of 11 \n     member countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, \n     Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, the United \n     Kingdom, and the United States) charged with overseeing the \n     administration of the ITS Holocaust archives;\n       Whereas, following years of delay, in May 2006 in \n     Luxembourg, the International Commission of the ITS agreed \n     upon amendments to the Bonn Accords that would allow \n     researchers to use the archives and would allow each member \n     country of the International Commission to receive digitized \n     copies of archive materials and make the records available to \n     researchers under the respective national laws relating to \n     archives and privacy;\n       Whereas the May 2006 amendments to the Bonn Accords require \n     each of the 11 member countries of the International \n     Commission to ratify the amendments before open access to the \n     Holocaust archives is permitted;\n       Whereas, although the final signature was affixed to the \n     amendments in October 2006, only 5 out of the 11 member \n     countries of the International Commission, the United States, \n     Israel, Poland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, have \n     ratified the amendments;\n       Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has for \n     years been working tirelessly to provide public access to the \n     materials in the Bad Arolsen archives;\n       Whereas, on March 8, 2007, representatives from the 11 \n     member countries of the International Commission of the ITS \n     met in the Netherlands and reviewed the current ratification \n     status of each country and the ratification process in its \n     entirety;\n       Whereas it is a moral and humanitarian imperative to permit \n     public access to the millions of Holocaust records housed at \n     Bad Arolsen;\n       Whereas it is essential that researchers obtain access \n     while Holocaust survivors are living, so that the researchers \n     can benefit in their scholarly work from the insights of \n     eyewitnesses;\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, there have been \n     far too many instances of survivors and heirs of Holocaust \n     victims being refused their moral and legal right to \n     information, for restitution purposes, slave labor \n     compensation, and personal closure;\n       Whereas opening the historic records is a vital \n     contribution to the world's collective memory and \n     understanding of the Holocaust and efforts to ensure that the \n     anti-Semitism that made such horrors possible is never again \n     permitted to take hold;\n       Whereas anti-Semitism has seen a resurgence in recent \n     years, and as recently as December 2006, the President of \n     Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, held the second Holocaust denial \n     conference in Tehran in one year; and\n       Whereas in light of this conference, the anti-Semitic \n     rhetoric of President Ahmadinejad, and a resurgence of anti-\n     Semitism in part of the world, the opening of the archives at \n     Bad Arolsen could not be more urgent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends in the strongest terms all countries that have \n     to date ratified the amendments to the Agreement Constituting \n     an International Commission for the International Tracing \n     Service, signed at Bonn June 6, 1955 (6 UST 6186) (commonly \n     known as the ``Bonn Accords'') to allow for open access to \n     the Holocaust archives of the International Tracing Service \n     (ITS) located at Bad Arolsen, Germany;\n       (2) commends the countries that have committed to expedite \n     the process of releasing the archives and expects those \n     countries to abide by their commitments;\n       (3) strongly urges all countries that have to yet to ratify \n     the amendments to abide by the treaty obligations made in May \n     2006 and to expedite the ratification of the amendments;\n       (4) strongly urges all member countries of the \n     International Commission of the ITS to consider the short \n     time left to Holocaust survivors and unanimously consent to \n     open the ITS archives should all countries not ratify the \n     amendments by May 2007;\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\n       (5) expresses the hope that bureaucratic and diplomatic \n     processes will not further delay this process;

Mr. President, this Sunday communities across the globe \nwill mark Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Memorial Day. As we mourn the millions \nwho were lost at the hands of the Nazis, how can anyone justify denying \nvictims and historians access to files documenting the Nazis' atrocious \nacts?\n  Yet, that is exactly what is happening. Last December, I wrote to the \nambassadors of nine countries about an issue of utmost importance--the \nopening of the Bad Arolsen Holocaust archives.\n  Unfortunately, the response from many of these countries has been \ndisappointing. Thousands of Holocaust survivors, historians, and \nresearchers are still being denied access to files that tell the story \nof unspeakable crimes committed by the Nazis. Many of the files are \nabout the survivors themselves; still, they cannot view them.\n  The story of how this unacceptable state of events came about goes \nback 60 years. After the Allies won the Second World War, they took \npossession of millions of files and documents, penned by the Nazis \nthemselves, which chronicled every aspect of their horrific Final \nSolution. To maintain this catalogue of atrocities, the Allies \nestablished an archive called the International Tracing Service, in the \ntown of Bad Arolsen, Germany. Today, Bad Arolsen contains some 30 to 50 \nmillion pages that record the individual fates of over 17 million \nvictims of Nazi persecution.\n  The Tracing Service was established to unify families and help \nsurvivors learn the ultimate fate of their lost loved ones. Yet, access \nto the records remains severely limited and very few survivors have \never been allowed direct, much less prompt access. The justification \nfor this delay was supposedly privacy concerns, logistical problems \nassociated with making the records widely accessible, and fears of new \nlegal claims. None of these can justify the tragic result--thousands of \nelderly survivors have passed away in recent years, never knowing what \nhappened to their families, even though the answer may be sitting on a \nshelf in Germany. This is simply tragic.\n  Eleven countries serve on the International Commission that \nsupervises the Tracing Service. Last May, after years of delay, they \ncommendably agreed to make these archives public for the first time. \nThey also agreed to place digitized copies at Holocaust research \ncenters in other countries, but only after each of the 11 countries--\nthe United States, Israel, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, \nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom--completed \ntheir own ratification procedure. In light of the advanced age of the \nremaining survivors, all committed to make ratification an urgent \npriority, with the goal of concluding the process by the end of 2006.\n  But as of December, when I wrote my letters, only the United States \nand Israel had ratified the agreement. Since then, the United Kingdom, \nPoland, and the Netherlands have joined the United States and Israel in \ncompleting ratification. However, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, \nItaly and Luxembourg have not done so.\n  Today, I am submitting a Senate Resolution calling on the Senate to \njoin people around the world in observing Yom Hashoah, Holocaust \nMemorial Day, commending the countries that have completed ratification \nof the agreement to make the Bad Arolsen archives public, calling on \nthose countries yet to complete ratification to do so immediately, and \ncalling on the International Commission to approve immediate \ndistribution of electronic copies of the documents from Bad Arolsen to \nresearch centers around the world, including the United States \nHolocaust Memorial Museum, so that survivors will be able to document \ntheir experience, and learn the fates of their lost loved ones.\n  Last fall, the Government of Iran hosted a conference; its absurd and \noutrageous premise was that the Holocaust did not occur. At a time when \ndangerously deluded efforts to deny the Holocaust are on the rise, how \ncan we keep the Nazis' own records from proving their horrors to the \nworld? And how can we deny the Nazis' victims--who have suffered enough \nfor a thousand lifetimes--the truth they so clearly deserve?\n  Yom Hashoah reminds us of one of the greatest evils that has ever \nbefallen the human race, and it mourns the millions who were lost as a \nresult of that evil. The countries of the International Commission have \nan opportunity to do a little good by shedding light on that evil. That \nis the best way they could observe Yom Hashoah this year.\n\n[[Page S4313]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4312-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4312-S4313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 142--OBSERVING YOM HASHOAH, HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY, \n  AND CALLING ON THE REMAINING MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE INTERNATIONAL \nCOMMISSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRACING SERVICE TO RATIFY THE MAY 2006 \nAMENDMENTS TO THE 1955 BONN ACCORDS IMMEDIATELY TO ALLOW OPEN ACCESS TO \n                        THE BAD AROLSEN ARCHIVES\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kohl, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Casey, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Wyden) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Last May, after years of delay, they \ncommendably agreed to make these archives public for the first time. \nThey also agreed to place digitized copies at Holocaust research \ncenters in other countries, but only after each of the 11 countries--\nthe United States, Israel, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, \nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom--completed \ntheir own ratification procedure. In light of the advanced age of the \nremaining survivors, all committed to make ratification an urgent \npriority, with the goal of concluding the process by the end of 2006.\n  But as of December, when I wrote my letters, only the United States \nand Israel had ratified the agreement. Since then, the United Kingdom, \nPoland, and the Netherlands have joined the United States and Israel in \ncompleting ratification. However, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, \nItaly and Luxembourg have not done so.\n  Today, I am submitting a Senate Resolution calling on the Senate to \njoin people around the world in observing Yom Hashoah, Holocaust \nMemorial Day, commending the countries that have completed ratification \nof the agreement to make the Bad Arolsen archives public, calling on \nthose countries yet to complete ratification to do so immediately, and \ncalling on the International Commission to approve immediate \ndistribution of electronic copies of the documents from Bad Arolsen to \nresearch centers around the world, including the United States \nHolocaust Memorial Museum, so that survivors will be able to document \ntheir experience, and learn the fates of their lost loved ones.\n  Last fall, the Government of Iran hosted a conference; its absurd and \noutrageous premise was that the Holocaust did not occur. At a time when \ndangerously deluded efforts to deny the Holocaust are on the rise, how \ncan we keep the Nazis' own records from proving their horrors to the \nworld? And how can we deny the Nazis' victims--who have suffered enough \nfor a thousand lifetimes--the truth they so clearly deserve?\n  Yom Hashoah reminds us of one of the greatest evils that has ever \nbefallen the human race, and it mourns the millions who were lost as a \nresult of that evil. The countries of the International Commission have \nan opportunity to do a little good by shedding light on that evil. That \nis the best way they could observe Yom Hashoah this year.\n\n[[Page S4313]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4313-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        SENATE RESOLUTION 143--HONORING COACH EDDIE G.

The \nSpartans secured the 2007 National Title in dramatic fashion by \novercoming a 1 to 0 deficit to defeat Boston College 3 to 1 in the NCAA \nMen's Championship Final. This victory is a\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\ngreat source of pride for all those affiliated with Michigan State \nUniversity and for the entire state of Michigan.\n  Championships are won by doing all the little things right, by not \ngiving up, and by trusting one another regardless of the obstacles. All \nof these traits were on display Saturday night when, in the waning \nmoments of the championship game, the Spartans mounted a final charge \nto capture the 2007 NCAA Title. The Spartans scored 3 goals in the \nfinal 10 minutes of play. The game was tied until the last minute of \nregulation, when Justin Abdelkader scored the go-ahead goal with 18.9 \nseconds remaining. The Spartans solidified this hard-fought victory by \nscoring an empty netter set up by an Eagle team that desperately fought \nto tie the game.\n  The Spartans upset victory before a record setting crowd of 19,432 at \nthe Scottrade Center in St. Louis completed a highly entertaining and \nrewarding season. MSU Hockey's third NCAA title is being celebrated \ntoday in East Lansing, Michigan. The members of the championship team \nare being honored with a parade followed by a rally at Munn Ice Arena. \nThis is a victory for the Spartan team and MSU community, as well as \nfor the many fans, friends, and family whose strong and unwavering \nsupport was exhibited throughout the Spartans' memorable championship \nseason.\n  Each member of the MSU team made important contributions to the \nSpartans' success, including players Justin Abdelkader, Tim Crowder, \nJeff Dunne, Tyler Howells, Brandon Gentile, Ethan Graham, Bobby Jarosz, \nJustin Johnston, Tim Kennedy, Kurt Kivisto, Chris Lawrence, Bryan Lerg, \nJeff Lerg, Zak McClellan, Jim McKenzie, Steve Mnich, Chris Mueller, \nMichael Ratchuk, Matt Schepke, Chris Snavely, Jay Sprague, Daniel \nSturges, Nick Sucharski, Ryan Turek, Daniel Vukovic, Brandon Warner, \nHead Coach Rick Comley, Assistant Coaches Tom Newton and Brian Renfrew, \nand Athletic Trainer Dave Carrier.\n  MSU Spartans' Head Coach Rick Comley, who was named a 2007 National \nCoach of the Year finalist, became the third coach in college hockey \nhistory to win national titles at two institutions, the first with \nNorthern Michigan University. Coach Comley recorded his 714th career \nvictory on Saturday. He currently holds the distinction of being the \nthird winningest coach amongst active hockey coaches and fifth \nwinningest in NCAA Hockey history. He has continued the successful \nSpartan Hockey tradition established by Ron Mason, the Spartans' former \nhead coach, current athletic director, and the all-time winningest NCAA \nHockey coach.\n  Throughout the 2007 championship season, the MSU men's hockey team \nhas demonstrated a commitment to unselfish play, always placing team \nsuccess ahead of individual accomplishments. However, I would be remiss \nif I did not acknowledge the outstanding individual effort displayed by \nsophomore goal tender Jeff Lerg, whose instrumental play throughout the \nseason helped to secure the title and earned him both NCAA Midwest \nRegional MVP honors and a place on the Frozen Four All Tournament team.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in congratulating Coach \nComley and the 2007 Michigan State University Spartans on their NCAA \nMen's Hockey National Championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4315-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4315-S4316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MSU SPARTAN HOCKEY NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Each member of the MSU Hockey organization \nmade essential contributions to the team's success.\n  MSU Spartans' Head Coach Rick Comley has become only the third coach \nin college hockey history to win national titles at two institutions, \nand has earned over 700 career wins.\n  A record crowd of over 19,000 people attended the Frozen Four \nChampionship game in St. Louis, and the enthusiasm shown by the people \nof Michigan and the students of MSU demonstrate Michigan's strong \nsupport for the MSU Hockey organization.\n  I know how important the families and friends of the team have been \nin providing unwavering support and always cheering on their Spartans.\n  In the final weeks of the season, with an uncertain forecast of their \nplayoff position, the Spartans rallied together with unrivaled team \ncharacter and focus, and starting with the 1st round playoffs in Grand \nRapids, MI, they went on undefeated to clinch the championship.\n  Michigan State University has always stood as a center for excellence \nin both athletics and scholarship, especially with the guidance of \nUniversity President Lou Anna K. Simon, and athletic director and \nrenowned former MSU Hockey coach, Ron Mason.\n  I am a proud MSU alumnus myself, and was beyond delighted to see this \ngreat team win the national championship.\n  The MSU Spartans displayed unparalleled team camaraderie, and have \nshown their ability to unite both on and off the ice has led them to \nwell-fought victories.\n  The Spartan Hockey Team demonstrated superior strength, skill, \nperseverance and determination and has made Michigan State University \nand the entire State of Michigan proud.\n  I congratulate the MSU Spartan Hockey Team on winning the 2007 NCAA \nChampionship and recognize all the players, coaches, staff, fans, and \nothers who were instrumental in this great achievement.\n  Again, this is a wonderful day for Michigan State University. We are \nvery proud of our hockey members and particularly proud of a member of \nmy staff, Jeff Muich, whose brother Steve is a member of that team.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to Calendar No. 91, H.R. 137.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 137) to amend Title 18 United States Code to \n     strengthen prohibitions against animal fighting, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this bill has broad bipartisan support with \nmore than 300 co-sponsors in the House. The companion Senate bill is S. \n261. The lead Senate sponsor is Senator Cantwell. There are 30 Senate \ncosponsors. The Senate Judiciary Committee considered and voted to \nreport the bill favorably on March 8, 2007, and the Senate bill is on \nthe Senate Business Calendar. The legislation in similar forms has \npassed one or both Houses of Congress several times. The bill also has \nstrong endorsements ranging from the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation to the poultry industry to hundreds of law enforcement \ngroups nationwide. The bill has been endorsed by the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Humane Society of the United States, and \nnumerous other animal rights and law enforcement groups, including more \nthan 400 police departments.\n  This bill contains a clarifying amendment like the one we adopted in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee to ensure that it does not affect \nlegitimate hunting activities.\n  Animal fighting is cruel. In this spectacle, dogs and roosters are \noften drugged to make them hyper-aggressive and forced to keep fighting \neven after suffering severe injuries. The animals are enclosed in a pit \nthat they cannot escape, and often are killed during the fights.\n  Animal fighting also spawns other criminal conduct, and endangers \npublic safety. Animal fighting is often associated with illegal \ngambling, narcotics trafficking, public corruption, and gang activity. \nCockfighting has been identified as a pathway for the spread of bird \nflu, and banning animal fighting is an important step to protect \nagainst this pandemic.\n  Federal anti-animal fighting legislation is already on the books, but \nthis new law brings penalties for animal fighting more in line with \nother penalties for animal cruelty and creates new tools for law \nenforcement to enforce these laws nationwide. Those engaged in animal \nfighting ventures must know that this crime is serious and will be \npunished as a felony.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, and any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record, \nwithout further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 137) was ordered for a third reading, read the third \ntime, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/10/senate-section/article/S4317-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 11, 2007\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
