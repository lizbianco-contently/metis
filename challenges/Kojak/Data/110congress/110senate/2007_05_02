Mr. President, the Senate will now begin a 60-minute period \nof morning business, the majority controlling the first half, \nRepublicans controlling the final portion. Following the usage of all \nmorning business, we will resume consideration of S. 1082, the FDA \nauthorization legislation.\n  Yesterday, Senator Dorgan offered an amendment relating to drug \nreimportation. A cloture motion was filed on that last night. The \ncloture vote will occur tomorrow morning. Amendments in the second \ndegree to the Dorgan amendment would have to be filed 1 hour prior to \nthe cloture vote. I hope other Members who have amendments will file \nthem as quickly as possible, to work with the managers. We have \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi who are handling the legislation. They have a \ngood relationship. They have done a lot already on this complicated \nlegislation.\n  Yesterday, I indicated to the staff on both sides of the aisle that \nit may be necessary to have votes as early as noon on Monday. I hope we \ncan finish the FDA bill tomorrow. If we can, then likely there would be \nno votes and we would move to other legislation, which would be WRDA, \nwhich has passed the House overwhelmingly. It came out of committee \nunder the guidance of Senators Boxer and Inhofe, and we should be able \nto finish that bill next week.\n  Immigration is still on line to come up in the last 2 weeks of this \nwork period. Next Wednesday, a week from today, I will rule XIV \nlegislation that will put us in line to move to this during the last 2 \nweeks of this work period. It is legislation that is badly needed. We \nhave had numerous meetings of Democratic and Republican Senators that \nhave been going on for about 3 months. Progress has not been as we \nanticipated on either side, but we are going to move to this. Something \nhas to be done. If we don't complete this legislation over here, then \nit certainly won't be done this year. Next year, a Presidential \nelection year will make it very difficult. The three areas, of course, \nthat are of concern are border security, and it is necessary that we \nvisit that to see what can be done; with temporary workers, a pathway \nto legalization for the 12 million people who are here with bad paper; \nthen we have to finally make sure we do something to make sure the \nemployer sanctions aspect of the law is meaningful. At the present \ntime, it is not. We have a lot to do there. I have had conversations \nwith Senator Kennedy, Senator Leahy, and a number of other interested \nSenators over the last several weeks, including Senator Kyl and others \non the Republican side.\n  Mr. President, the President did veto the spending bill we sent him \nlast night. It is unfortunate, but he did veto it. There will be a \nveto-override vote in the House tonight, it is my understanding.\n  The first piece of legislation dealing with another bill to send to \nthe President will come to us from the House. I have had a number of \nconsultations with Speaker Pelosi. At this stage, we are going to wait \nand see what happens at the White House today. The ball is in the \nPresident's court. He has to come forward with something that is \nsatisfactory to Democrats and a significant number of Republicans.\n  There has to be some change of direction in the war. We find \nourselves in\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nthe middle of a civil war where hundreds and hundreds of people are \nbeing killed each week, where we are losing soldiers at a rate that is \nuntoward even in this war. Last month was the highest casualty rate \nthis year. In the 51 months of the war, it is one of the highest \ncasualty rates. So it is something for which we have to carry the \nwishes of the American people into legislation and change this war and \nbring our troops home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/02/senate-section/article/S5440-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are now in the fifth year of the war \nin Iraq. Once again this year, the President failed to include an \nhonest cost of the war in the budget he sends to Congress every year. \nWhy is that so important at this time? If the President had initially \nsent to Congress a realistic budget instead of one that is intended to \nmake his fiscal policies look less irresponsible, our men and women in \nthe service wouldn't be faced with debate after debate after debate on \nemergency spending bills to pay for the cost of the war. Unfortunately, \nagain, he did not send us a budget that was honest and paid for the \nwar. So what we have now is an emergency spending bill for Iraq and \nother emergencies.\n  Unfortunately, last night--and sadly, in my opinion--the President \ndecided to say no to our men and women in Iraq, to our veterans, to \nvictims of Katrina, and to many other people who needed this measure \npassed and signed by him.\n  Democrats understand that our troops and their families should not \npay for the President's budget games. That is why we passed funding for \nthe emergency supplemental at record speed--faster, in fact, than the \nRepublicans did in the last 2 years. Back in 2005, the Republican \nCongress didn't send the President emergency funding until May 10. In \n2006, the Republican Congress did not send an emergency funding bill \nuntil June 15. Not only did we send the White House a bill earlier than \never, we sent legislation that contained more funds than the President \nrequested and all the money our troops need. Unfortunately for our \ntroops, yesterday, 4 years after President Bush declared ``mission \naccomplished'' and 12 days after it was reported that 104 American \nservicemembers died in April, making it the deadliest month since the \nsurge began, the President decided to veto that bill. With that, he \ndecided to delay the funding for our troops.\n  Included in that bill were billions of dollars to help solve the \nproblems facing our men and women in uniform when they return home. The \nPresident didn't ask for those critical dollars. In fact, he has never \nincluded our wounded warriors as a cost of the war. Their families and \nnow both Houses of the Congress understand the obligation to our heroes \nand have included them as a cost of war in this bill.\n  The bill we sent to the President provided money to improve Walter \nReed and other VA facilities that we know are in disrepair and money to \nhelp increase access to medical and mental health services for our \nreturning soldiers. More than $143 million was included to improve the \nVA's polytrauma center, which, among other things, would have helped \nthe VA better diagnose and treat the increasing number of traumatic \nbrain injuries which have emerged as a signature wound of this war.\n  The legislation also provided $100 million for the VA to target areas \nwhere mental health care is lacking. According to the VA's own \nstatistics, more than 35 percent of returning Iraqi and Afghani \nveterans who have sought care have done so for mental health problems. \nWe provide the funds in the bill we sent to the President. \nUnfortunately, he said no.\n  Additionally, we put in $61 million for hiring and training of new \ncompensation and pension claims adjudicators. That is important money \nbecause we are hearing from far too many of our returning soldiers that \nit is taking them months to get the benefits they have earned. These \nnew claims processors will help address that growing backlog of claims. \nUnfortunately, last night the President said no.\n  What we have today for our veterans, 4 years after President Bush \ndeclared ``mission accomplished,'' he decided to veto this bill. He \ndecided to delay funds that would have addressed the problems facing \nour veterans.\n  Not only did Democrats send the President funding earlier than ever, \nwe listened to the military leaders, we listened to the Iraq Study \nGroup, and we listened to the American people and included a provision \nto redeploy our forces from the Iraqi civil war. Americans \noverwhelmingly oppose the President's escalation plan. General Abizaid, \nGeneral Casey, and other top former officials have made clear that a \nsurge will not be a solution to a civil war in Iraq. Reportedly, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff were not in favor of escalation, and even Colin \nPowell opposes the escalation. In fact, Colin Powell, who we know saw \ncombat in Vietnam, said:\n\n       I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into \n     Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian \n     violence, this civil war, will work.\n\n  GEN John Abizaid, former commander of U.S. Central Command, said:\n\n       I do not believe that more American troops right now is a \n     solution to this problem.\n\n  The Iraq Study Group, made up of Republicans and Democrats, called \nfor the redeployment of our forces. But the President ignored all of \nthem. He decided instead to escalate the number of troops in Iraq.\n  This escalation is in its third month, and so far the results are not \npromising. The Iraqi Government reported that violence from February to \nMarch increased. Officials said the number of car bombings in Baghdad \nis rising. According to the U.N., sectarian violence in the capital has \nnot declined one bit. Officials have also reported that sectarian \nviolence outside the capital has increased. As I mentioned, 104 \nAmerican troops died in April--the deadliest month since this surge \nbegan.\n  The redeployment provision this Democratic-led Congress included in \nthe bill provided the President with an opportunity to force Iraqis to \nfinally take responsibility for their own country. We are in the fifth \nyear of this war, and Iraqis have yet to stand up for themselves. They \nare not policing their own streets. They are not running their own \narmy. Their Government is a mess. Something has to be done to show them \nthey have to get their act together, they have to take ownership of \ntheir own future.\n\n  That is what the redeployment provision did in our bill. It said to \nIraqis: After 5 years--5 years--and thousands of U.S. lives, you have \nto take responsibility for your future. It said: You must stand up.\n  Well, unfortunately, for America's security, 4 years after President \nBush declared ``mission accomplished,'' and after we have lost 3,351 \ntroops, the President, last night, vetoed the bill. By doing so, he \nignored calls from military experts and the American people for \nredeployment and the need to make clear to the Iraqis they have to take \nresponsibility for their own future.\n  The President asked our Nation for patience after the first and \nsecond years of this war. Then he asked the American people for more \ntime after the third year, and more time after the fourth year.\n  This year, the fifth year of the war, he is now again asking us for \npatience, for the American people to just stand by as more of our young \nmen and women die and as the Iraqis continue to shirk their \nresponsibility for their own country.\n  It is clear our troops are now policing an open-ended civil war. Now, \nmore than ever, we need a new direction in Iraq. Unfortunately, \nyesterday, and, sadly, the President vetoed a bill which\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\ndid provide a way forward. In doing so, he withheld millions of dollars \nfor our troops and for our veterans and ignored the advice of military \nleaders and the Iraq Study Group and, importantly, the will of the \nAmerican people.\n  Today the President stands alone against the vast majority of \nAmericans desperately seeking a new direction in Iraq. It is now up to \nhim to come to the negotiating table and provide the American people \nwith a real strategy for success.\n  Mr. President, we also have before us today a bill on the FDA.\n  Can I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has only about a half a \nminute remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I see another colleague on the Senate \nfloor, and I ask him how much time he is going to need.\n  Mr. BROWN. Five or ten minutes. Go ahead.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes to speak to the FDA bill that is in front of us today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, all of us in the Senate share the same \ngoal of making sure the Food and Drug Administration stays as the gold \nstandard for drug safety and effectiveness, and the legislation that is \nbefore the Senate today moves us toward that goal.\n  Throughout our country, researchers, scientists, and doctors are \nmaking 21st century medical advances, and the legislation we are \nlooking at will ensure we have a 21st century FDA. It provides the \nresources, the authority, and the oversight to ensure that safe drugs \nmove from the lab to our medicine cabinets without delay.\n  Like other Members of the Senate, I worked on the FDA reforms back in \nthe 1990s. Those reforms responded to the challenges we faced then. The \nbill before us now responds to the challenges we face today.\n  In recent years, we have seen a lot of problems at the FDA with drug \napproval and postmarket surveillance. The bill we have addresses those \nchallenges and ensures the FDA has the resources and the tools to \npromptly and thoroughly review new drugs and medical devices.\n  The bill reauthorizes and improves two pieces of legislation that \nwill be critical in providing a timely review process. It creates a new \nsystem to actively monitor drugs after they have been approved by the \nFDA. It strengthens science at the FDA and, importantly, improves \ntransparency. It improves oversight and information about clinical \ntrials, and it works to prevent potential conflicts of interest among \nadvisory committee members.\n  Like many Americans, I was shocked at the recent revelations \nconcerning drugs that posed risks to public safety but remained on the \nmarket for far too long. This legislation moves to address those \nconcerns by instituting strong, new protections, including postmarket \nstudies that will be made available to the public. I believe this new \ntransparency and vigorous oversight is the right path toward restoring \npublic confidence in the FDA.\n  The bill takes critical steps also to improve medical care for our \nchildren. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act that is included in \nthis bill uses incentives and regulations to put America's children \nfirst. It builds upon the legislation we enacted back in 1997 that \nensures pediatric medicine is a priority and that information on \npediatric drugs is readily available. It extends and improves a program \nthat has undertaken nearly 800 studies and has helped to provide \npediatric labeling information for 119 drugs.\n  The Pediatric Research Improvement Act included in this bill is \nanother critical component of improving pediatric care. It provides \nneeded safety measures through mandatory clinical trials. It will help \nto continue pediatric oversight programs that have required trials for \nmore than 1,000 pediatric drugs since 1998. All too often, doctors are \nnot given guidance on the proper dose of prescription drugs for \nchildren. This bill is going to eliminate that guesswork so our \nchildren get the right doses for safer, more effective treatment.\n  The bill also provides help to our Nation's children through the \nPediatric Medical Devices Safety and Improvement Act. Every year, we \nsee these wondrous technological improvements in medical devices. \nHowever, sometimes those improvements do not account for the needs of \nthe children and the pediatricians who treat them. What that means is \nessential, often lifesaving devices do not meet the size or the scope \nor the needs of sick children. This bill will push manufacturers to \ndevelop and produce devices that are safe and effective for children \nand infants. Through incentives and investor outreach, this bill will \nensure that exciting advances in lifesaving devices are not just \nlimited to adults.\n  This legislation also delivers greater safety while providing better \naccess. I believe it will improve the way we deliver safe innovative \nhealth care in America, and it is really my hope it will also begin to \nrestore confidence in the institutions that safeguard our public \nhealth.\n\n  The American public deserves nothing less than the gold standard of \ncare from our FDA. When a nervous parent or worried senior visits their \ncorner pharmacy, they deserve to know the product they buy on that \nshelf has been approved by a thorough and complete process. When a \npatient begins to take a new drug, they deserve a system that has \nactively tracked that drug and provides the patient with information on \nany risks they might face. Everyone--drug companies, researchers, \npatients, and doctors alike--deserves a system that supports an \nefficient and timely FDA approval process.\n  So I am very eager to move this legislation forward and get it to a \nvote so we can begin to deliver what the American people deserve. I \nhope this Senate moves quickly on this bill and we are able to move it \nalong in the process very shortly in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, our trade policy is fundamentally flawed. \nYears of wrongheaded trade pacts have sent millions of jobs overseas, \ndevastated our communities, and opened our Nation too often to serious \nhomeland security concerns.\n  When we open our borders to trade, as we should, we open them to \nnational security threats. Congress must assure the American people we \nhave done everything within our power to protect their safety and their \nhealth and their welfare and to promote fair trade.\n  It is estimated that less than 10 percent of foreign cargo is \ninspected before entering our country. We must both ensure that our \nports are operated securely and with clear lines of accountability, \nunlike the deal to transfer operation of six U.S. ports to a state-\nowned company controlled by the United Arab Emirates that this \nadministration approved just last year.\n  The decision to allow a UAE-controlled company to run our ports had \nsignificant national security implications. The UAE was, and still may \nbe, a financial and travel outlet for known terrorists. It was not \nuntil leaders in both parties in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives called attention to this enormous blunder that this \ndeal was stopped.\n  It is imperative Congress take steps to ensure our homeland security \nneeds are secured every bit as much as our economic well-being.\n  Today, I am introducing, with Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, \nthe Trade-Related American National Security Enhancement and \nAccountability, TRANSEA, Act.\n  This act requires the Office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative, in collaboration with the Departments of State, \nHomeland Security, and Justice, to submit a report to Congress \ndetailing the national security considerations of proposed trade \nagreements prior to commencing and after concluding those trade \nnegotiations.\n  The bill also requires future trade agreements negotiated by the \nadministration to include a national security waiver that allows the \nPresident to suspend any terms of the agreement should it be required \nin the interests of U.S. national security.\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\n  Lastly, as a final safeguard, the legislation creates a new \nCongressional Executive Commission on Trade Security, requiring the \nappointment of Commissioners by both political parties in both Chambers \nof Congress.\n  The Commissioners will be charged with annually certifying that the \nterms of the free-trade agreement do not pose a threat to our Nation's \nnational security interests. Should the Commission find that compliance \nwith the agreement would pose a threat, the President will be obligated \nto exercise his or her waiver to the extent necessary to ensure the \nsafety and the security of the United States of America.\n  In a post-9/11 world, U.S. economic policy can simply no longer be \nviewed in the narrow scopes of bottom lines and profit margins. \nHomeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said, in 2006:\n\n       We have to balance the paramount urgency of security \n     against the fact that we still want to have a robust global \n     trading system.\n\n  We can do both. It is the responsibility of our Government to ensure \nthat while opening markets for our exporters, as we should, our first \npriority remains the safety and the security of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the war \nsupplemental which was vetoed last night at 10 minutes after 6 by the \nPresident. It is my understanding that today leaders from both sides of \nthe Senate will go to the White House, this afternoon, to begin talking \nabout where we go next.\n  I rise today to talk a little bit about what has got us to where we \nare, why we are where we are, and what, in my judgment, as one Member \nof the Senate, we need to be focused on.\n  I am glad the President vetoed the war supplemental with timelines \nfor withdrawal. It is absolutely wrong to tie the money to support our \ntroops to arbitrary timetables that have nothing to do with success or \nfailure but only to do with the declaration of a cause being lost. We \nshould never declare, as Members of the Senate, our cause to have been \nlost. And we should never hold hostage the money for our troops based \non arbitrary deadlines or thresholds.\n  It is, however, important for us to debate the war on the floor of \nthe Senate. I hope when the next supplemental comes, it will be a \nsupplemental that goes to support our men and women who have been \ndeployed in defense of freedom, to give them everything they deserve \nand everything they need without strings and complication. To do so \nwill not keep us in the Senate from debating the war, but it will \nclearly separate the money to support our troops from whatever the \ncourse that debate may take.\n  We have a long history in this country of many great Americans taking \nexactly the same position. One of those great Americans, Walter George, \na Member of the Senate, from Georgia, a Democrat, in 1955--when Dwight \nEisenhower was President of the United States of America and Adlai \nStevenson had been his first opponent, and would be his second opponent \nin the 1956 Presidential election--the big issue of the day was the \nissue of Quemoy and Matsu and Red China's attempt to expand its \ninfluence on those islands and the policy of the United States of \nAmerica and our President, Dwight Eisenhower. In Time magazine, April's \nissue, 1955, Walter George, Senator, Democrat from Georgia, a man in \nwhose legacy and in whose shadow I now serve, said the following:\n\n       If it would advance the cause of peace, I would be happy \n     for the President to declare his policy. But how would it \n     advance the cause of peace to inform the enemy of what we \n     intend to do?\n       I know one thing--\n\n  George said, and I continue to quote--\n\n     if we do fulfill our high mission and our high destiny, it \n     will be because we have resolved to do our dead level best to \n     advance peace, to advance security, to shore up a shaky \n     world. Only by doing that can we vindicate the sacrifice of \n     those who died on land and at sea, and fulfill the hopes of \n     men and women in every free land.\n\n  It has been 52 years since that statement was made, but it could \nnever ring more true than it rings today. Walter George was absolutely \nright, and Walter George, a Democrat, came to the defense of Dwight \nEisenhower, a Republican who was President, when Dwight Eisenhower was \nbeing forced to play our hand in a critical issue of the day. We should \nnever force our chief executive officer, nor should we force our \ngenerals, nor our troops in the field, by declaring our hand before the \ncards are dealt.\n  There are a few other quotes I wish to share with my colleagues as I \nlead up to the point I want to make this morning, and these are \ncontemporary quotes and these are quotes about Iraq. These are quotes \nabout the supplemental. These are quotes about our brave men and women \nin harm's way. The first is by General Lynch, the commanding officer of \nthe third ID. When asked about whether funding should be tied to an \narbitrary timetable for withdrawal, he said:\n\n       Ultimately, a precipitous withdrawal would increase the \n     probability that American troops would one day have to return \n     to Iraq and confront an enemy that is even more dangerous \n     than today.\n\n  He is absolutely correct. Every time this country waited or every \ntime it determined to withdraw from a conflict or looked the other way \nfrom a challenge of evil, it only had to muster itself in greater \nnumbers and fight with greater losses at a greater day in the future.\n  General Lynch continued:\n\n       No matter how frustrating the fight can be and no matter \n     how much we wish the war was over, the security of our \n     country depends directly on the outcome in Iraq. The price of \n     giving up there would be paid in American lives for years to \n     come. It would be an unforgivable mistake for leaders in \n     Washington to allow policies and impatience to stand in the \n     way of protecting the people of the United States of America.\n\n  I could not say it better myself.\n  Lastly, for quotes from contemporaries, Gary Kurpius, commander of \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the following:\n\n       The time to debate the war is not in front of a microphone \n     making irresponsible statements, and it's certainly not in \n     the funding bill that keeps our troops alive. If our troops \n     need funds, it is the responsibility of Congress to provide \n     them the money. Debate the war elsewhere.\n\n  My last quote is from an e-mail I got from Captain Schratt, on the \nground with the U.S. Army in Baghdad right now, a couple of weeks ago \nwhen this debate was going on. He e-mailed me and said: I see they are \ndebating whether or not they can not support the war and still support \nme. He said: Please tell them I am the war.\n  That is the truth. Our troops are the war. They are deployed and they \nare fighting and their funding should not be restrained or constrained \nor in any way hinged on political gymnastics. Those gymnastics belong \nin the speeches on this floor and the dialogue we have with our \nadministration.\n  Now, it is my understanding there are some who are talking about a \nsecond supplemental to come, to be an incremental supplemental, maybe \n60 days at a time. I would implore the Senate to consider not doing \nthat because that brings uncertainty to our troops in the field and \nonly partial funding on a daily or on a 60-day basis, which is wrong. \nThere are others who are talking about maybe benchmarks--not timetables \nfor withdrawal but benchmarks for the achievement of the Iraqi people. \nThat may or may not be wise, depending on what those are, and I will \nreserve judgment, but I will tell my colleagues one thing. A lot of us \naround here have selective memories and have forgotten the fact that we \nhave had some benchmarks.\n  In fact, when we went into Iraq, the President of the United States, \nGeorge W. Bush, declared three succinct benchmarks. He said: When we \ndeploy our troops, we will do the following: A, we will search and find \nthe weapons of mass destruction that the U.N. and the entire world \nbelieved were there, and in fact we found the remnants and the \nevidence, although never the smoking gun. Then, second, he said: We are\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\ngoing to give the Iraqi people a chance to hold free elections and \ndetermine a new Constitution and self-determine their future. The \nIraqis have held three elections. They have a parliament. They have \nestablished a self-determined democracy in their way of doing so, and \nit is functioning. Then the President said: Our third goal will be to \ntrain the Iraqi Army so that it can protect and defend that fledgling \nGovernment and we will come home.\n\n  Those are three benchmarks. Two of the benchmarks have been achieved. \nThe third benchmark is what the surge is intended to accomplish.\n  Today in downtown Baghdad and in Anbar Province, American troops are \nsleeping and eating and deployed in the neighborhoods--not in bases--\nside by side with Iraqi troops. The securing of neighborhoods is taking \nplace, the holding of neighborhoods is taking place, and the rebuilding \nof those neighborhoods is soon to follow. In the months ahead, if we \nremain committed to the cause, if we fund our troops, we have the \nopportunity to reduce the violence, to allow the reconciliation that is \nso necessary.\n  So as people debate whether we ought to put benchmarks in \nsupplemental appropriations for our men and women in harm's way, I hope \nthey will recognize we have benchmarks, three that we established when \nalmost every Member of the Congress voted to go into Iraq, two of which \nhave been completely met and satisfied and a third is partially there \nand will ultimately be achieved if we don't pull the plug and we \ncontinue to fund our troops.\n  War is never fun and it is always controversial. There is not a one \nof us in this room who does not wish war was ever necessary. But we \nknow as we look back upon history, as Walter George, the Senator from \nGeorgia, said: We have to honor the lives of those who were lost on \nland and sea to preserve freedom and liberty and democracy for the \npeople of the United States of America. We are at such a day today with \nour battle in Iraq and in the overall war on terror. Iraq is but a \nbattle in that war. We don't need to send signals that we will quit; we \ndon't need to declare that we have lost. We need to declare the resolve \nto see the mission through. There are 140,000 brave men and women \ndeployed in Iraq right now committed to the cause. When they come home \nand I talk to them, to the man and to the woman, they all say: We are \nthere for the right reason. We are making progress. Continue to support \nme, and we will do the job.\n  So as the leaders go to the White House today to discuss with the \nPresident where we go next, as we look to what we do in this \nsupplemental, let's resolve to fund our troops. Let's resolve to do it \nwithout condition on our troops. Let's resolve to do it without \ndeclaring defeat but instead in the interest of and with a commitment \nto victory. Then, if we have debate--and we should and we must--let's \nhave it on the floor, unattached to funding, not restricting our troops \nbut deciding what our course will be and the absolute objective to be, \nrather than a conditional debate that only sends a message to our enemy \nthat our resolve may be lost and we may be turning the other way. As \nWalter F. George said in 1955, an American Democratic Senator from \nGeorgia, in support of a Republican President, we should honor the \nlives that have been lost and stay true to our commitment, and it will \nnever be in our interests to declare to our enemies what our intentions \nmight be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, 3 months ago, the President of the United \nStates asked Congress to pass an emergency war spending bill that would \nprovide our brave men and women in uniform with the funds and the \nflexibility they need to succeed in what has been called the central \nfront on the war against al-Qaida in Iraq. Instead, this body helped \npass a bill that substitutes the opinions of politicians for the \njudgment of our military commanders. The bill Congress passed was, in \nmy view, unacceptable, and late. Eighty-five days after the President \nhad requested the funds on an emergency basis, Speaker Pelosi finally \nforwarded the bill to the President yesterday. It was no surprise that \nthe President vetoed the bill within hours because he had said he \nwould, and so the outcome was predictable.\n  The President, in his address to the Nation last night, made it very \nclear that it remains his desire to work with Congress to resolve this \nmatter as quickly and expeditiously as possible. Today, he is holding a \nbipartisan meeting with congressional leaders at the White House for \nthat purpose.\n  We have known for weeks that this legislation was flawed and that we \nwould find ourselves in this place--a bill that included a surrender \ndate, when we tell our enemies we would simply give up, and one larded \nwith porkbarrel spending in order to secure the votes of recalcitrant \nMembers who were unwilling to vote for this flawed bill on its merits.\n  The President outlined these shortcomings last night.\n  First, he said the bill would mandate an artificial deadline for \ntroops to begin withdrawing from Iraq. The withdrawal could start as \nearly as July 1 and would have to start no later than October 1 \nregardless of the situation on the ground. The language in the bill \ndefies sound military logic and, I would say, common sense itself. It \nmakes no sense to tell the enemy when you plan to start withdrawing. \nSetting a deadline for withdrawal is setting a date for failure, and it \nwould be irresponsible. As the President made very clear last night, \nsetting this deadline for withdrawal would also demoralize the Iraqi \npeople and encourage the killers across the broader Middle East, such \nas al-Qaida, and send a signal that America will not keep its \ncommitments.\n  Second, the bill would impose impossible conditions on our commanders \nin combat. After forcing most of our troops to withdraw, the bill would \ndictate the terms on which the remaining commanders and troops could \nengage the enemy. American commanders in the middle of a combat zone \nwould have to take fighting directions from politicians thousands of \nmiles away in Washington, DC.\n  Third, as I mentioned, the bill is loaded with billions of dollars of \nnonemergency porkbarrel spending that has nothing to do with fighting \nthe war on terror and which demeans the importance of this particular \nlegislation, designed as it is to support our troops who are literally \nin harm's way.\n  Democratic leaders know that many of us in Congress disagree with \ntheir approach and their desire to use this bill as an opportunity to \nmake a political statement about their opposition to the war. Yet we \nknow there are not enough votes to override a veto. It is time to put \npolitics behind us and support our troops with the funds they need. \nSome have confused the need to debate, which I agree with, with cause \nfor delay, which I disagree with. There should be no cause for delay in \ngetting these emergency funds to our troops, and the debate will indeed \ncontinue.\n  In February, we began sending the first of the reinforcements that \nGeneral Petraeus, the new commander in Iraq, requested. Not all of \nthese reinforcements have arrived; roughly half of them have. As \nGeneral Petraeus said just last week, it will be at least the end of \nthe summer before we can assess the impact of this new operation, the \nBaghdad security plan, or surge. We ought to give General Petraeus's \nplan a chance to work.\n  In the months since our military has been implementing this plan, we \nhave actually begun to see some important results. General Petraeus \nnoted that one of the most important indicators of progress is the \nlevel of sectarian violence in Baghdad. He reported that, since \nJanuary, the number of sectarian murders has dropped substantially. \nSpectacular suicide attacks that have caused great suffering in Iraq \ncontinue because these attacks are largely the work of al-Qaida, the \nSunni extremists--the enemy that everyone agrees we should be fighting, \nor at least some say we should be fighting. At the same time, they \nwould impose arbitrary deadlines, imposing a surrender date on our \ntroops.\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\n  The objective of these al-Qaida attacks is to reignite the sectarian \nviolence in Baghdad and breaking support for the war here at home. That \nwas the goal of al-Zarqawi, whom we were fortunate to be able to take \nout of the fight, and that is the fight now of the remaining al-Qaida \nextremists in Iraq. General Petraeus explained it this way:\n\n       Iraq is, in fact, the central front of al-Qaida's global \n     campaign.\n\n  It just boggles my mind, Mr. President, for some of us to stand here \non the floor and say we ought to withdraw our troops from Iraq when, in \nfact, al-Qaida--the enemy that hit innocent Americans and killed 3,000 \nof them on September 11, 2001--considers Iraq to be the central front \nin their campaign against the West. Al-Qaida's role makes the conflict \nin Iraq far more complex than a simple fight between Iraqis. Many also \nbelong to the same terrorist network, as I said, that attacked us on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Were we to leave prematurely, were we to leave a \npower vacuum in Iraq, al-Qaida would no doubt, as they did in \nAfghanistan earlier, use that power vacuum as an opportunity to \nregroup, to plan, to train, to recruit, and then to export additional \nterrorist attacks against the United States here on this continent.\n  We need to give our troops all of the equipment and training and \nprotection they need to prevail. Without a war funding bill, the \nmilitary has to take money from some other account--notably, the Air \nForce or Navy--just in order to make sure the Army has the resources \nthey need, so the troops can have the equipment they need, so they can \nrotate back on a timely basis and come home to the loving arms of their \nfamilies, to repair existing equipment. And worst of all, in one sense, \nfailing to send this money on a timely basis to the military hurts the \nmilitary families who are waiting behind, anxious, as we all \nunderstand, for the welfare and safety of their loved ones. Our troops \nand their families deserve better.\n  So I hope that after the last 86 days, which have been characterized \nby political theater and gamesmanship, where some have been more \nfocused on the 2008 election and trying to find ways to gain political \nadvantage, I hope Republicans and Democrats, the legislative branch and \nexecutive branch, can come together and do what we should have done \nmonths ago--get the funds to the troops as soon as possible, without \nthe surrender deadline, without tying the hands of our military \ncommanders and making their opportunity for success impossible, and \nwithout the porkbarrel spending that demeans the noble sacrifice of \nthese brave men and women.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back our remaining time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself, \n     Mr. Carper, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, \n     Mr. Enzi, Mr. Burr, and Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1010 to amendment 990.\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROTECTION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY.\n\n       This title, and the amendments made by this title, shall \n     become effective only if the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services certifies to Congress that the implementation of \n     this title (and amendments) will--\n       (1) pose no additional risk to the public's health and \n     safety; and\n       (2) result in a significant reduction in the cost of \n     covered products to the American consumer.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment for myself, \nas well as for these cosponsors: Mr. Carper, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \nMr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Burr, and Mr. Menendez. This is \nan amendment to the amendment proposed by Mr. Dorgan.\n  Improving the health and quality of life for Americans is very \nimportant to all of us, and access to safe and effective prescription \ndrugs is a major step in accomplishing these goals. With recent \nscientific advances, a number of medical therapies have been made \navailable to treat and, in some cases, to cure diseases. We want \nAmericans to continue to have access to safe and effective drugs that \nare approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  But we must not create opportunities for potentially dangerous drug \nproducts from foreign countries to reach the American consumer. For \nexample, counterfeit products, those that have been tampered with or \nthose of unknown origin, should not be brought into this country. I am \nconcerned that allowing the importation of prescription drugs would \nallow such risks to become more likely.\n  The amendment proposed by the Senator from North Dakota will put in \njeopardy the process we now have to ensure the safety of prescription \nmedications and protect the health of the American people.\n  I am offering this second-degree amendment to require the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to certify that the importation of drug \nproducts will not pose additional risks to Americans and will, indeed, \nlower costs to consumers.\n  If, as some argue, a policy of importation is safe and will reduce \ncosts, this amendment should not be a problem.\n  We have debated this issue before on several previous occasions. For \nexample, during the consideration of annual appropriations bills for \nthe Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and \nrelated agencies, when considering the Greater Access to \nPharmaceuticals Act, and even during the debate and passage of the \nMedicare Modernization Act of 2003, a similar amendment to require the \nsafety of imported drugs was considered and unanimously approved each \ntime.\n  In all these instances, the Senate has adopted this amendment by a \nunanimous vote. The safety of the American consumer must be our No. 1 \npriority. These safeguards should also be applied to this proposal.\n  We should be certain that any change we make in the law does not \nresult in less protection in terms of the safety of the drugs supplied \nto the American people and will, indeed, make prescription drugs more \naffordable. Liberalization of protections that are designed to keep \nunsafe drugs out of this country, especially considering the terrorist \nthreats we face now, should occur only if the necessary safeguards are \nin place. This amendment will ensure that the concerns of the last two \nadministrations regarding safety and cost-effectiveness are addressed \nprior to the implementation of this proposal.\n  Counterfeiting of drugs has become a more common practice throughout \nthe world, and the transshipment of these counterfeit products through \nCanada is one of the most serious dangers we face. The Canadian \nGovernment itself has said that drug products shipped to\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nCanada for resale in other countries do not fall under the Canadian \nregulatory system, and they can provide no assurance as to the safety \nor authenticity of such drugs.\n  In fact, President Bush yesterday released a Statement of \nAdministration Policy strongly opposing any provision that allows the \nimportation of drug products outside the current safety system of the \nFood and Drug Administration. The statement declares that the \nPresident's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill if \nthis provision is included.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Statement \nof Administration Policy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2007.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n        s. 1082--food and drug administration revitalization act\n\n                         (Sen. Kennedy (D)-MA)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports reauthorization of the \n     Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and the Medical Device \n     User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA). These two programs \n     account for nearly one quarter of the Food and Drug \n     Administration's (FDA) annual budget and support more than \n     2,000 Agency employees who work diligently to ensure the \n     safety and efficacy of the medical products on which the \n     American people rely. Reauthorizing PDUFA and MDUFMA will \n     enhance FDA's ability to more efficiently and effectively \n     regulate drugs, biological products, and medical devices, a \n     critical component of the Agency's public health mission. \n     Additionally, the Administration is committed to \n     reauthorizing the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act \n     (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), which \n     have provided invaluable information to the Agency about \n     medical products' interaction with pediatric populations.\n       The Administration shares the goal of S. 1082 to provide \n     FDA with the appropriate tools and resources to enhance the \n     safety and efficacy of the products the agency regulates. \n     However, the Administration has serious concerns with S. 1082 \n     in its current form and will work with Congress to address \n     them as the legislative process moves forward.\n       The Administration appreciates that portions of S. 1082 are \n     consistent with the Administration's recommendations for \n     reauthorization, which strengthen FDA's ability to ensure the \n     safety and availability of new drugs and medical devices, \n     create a new program for review of television advertisements, \n     and strengthen post-market review. These user fee programs \n     expire at the end of the current fiscal year, and their \n     timely reauthorization is critical to the ability of FDA to \n     continue to carefully and expeditiously review and approve \n     new drugs and devices to benefit the health of the American \n     people.\n       The Administration is committed to further improving drug \n     safety through better tools for surveillance of drug events, \n     improved scientific tools for evaluating drug safety \n     problems, and better means of communicating drug safety \n     problems to providers and patients. However, the \n     Administration is concerned that the bill, as written, would \n     require significant resources to implement burdensome process \n     changes that will not contribute meaningfully to improving \n     drug safety. For example, the prescriptive timeframes to \n     develop and process Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies \n     are particularly burdensome and are not likely to contribute \n     to improving drug safety. Additionally, the Administration is \n     concerned about the provision in S. 1082 that would use \n     increased user fees to fund certain additional drug safety \n     activities that were not agreed to during the statutorily \n     required Agency-industry negotiations. This provision reopens \n     and is inconsistent with the Administration PDUFA proposal \n     that was developed through extensive consultation.\n       There are other provisions in S. 1082 that also raise \n     serious concerns. Specifically, the bill would make changes \n     to the BPCA and PREA to reduce the incentives to conduct \n     clinical trials for children, thus reducing the effectiveness \n     of the program. It also would impose administrative burdens \n     that would make the programs inefficient and in many ways \n     unworkable. These provisions would reduce the flexibility the \n     agency needs to conduct these programs, require an \n     inefficient duplication of scientific expertise, and cause \n     delays in the review of pediatric assessments. Both BPCA and \n     PREA have been very successful in providing the necessary \n     incentives for drug companies to conduct pediatric clinical \n     trials to improve our understanding of how drugs work in \n     children, thus enhancing the quality of their medical care. \n     BPCA and PREA should be extended without modification.\n     Potential Amendments: Follow-on Protein Products and \n         Importation of Prescription Drugs\n       The Administration supports the goal of making safe and \n     effective drugs available and affordable for American \n     consumers. While some in Congress may be interested in \n     attaching legislation related to follow-on protein products \n     to this bill, the Administration believes that these complex \n     issues should be considered thoroughly through a robust \n     scientific, regulatory, and legal discussion. Sufficient \n     discussion has not yet occurred and should not be abbreviated \n     for the convenience of a particular legislative vehicle. Any \n     legislative proposal considered to authorize a regulatory \n     pathway for follow-on protein products must, as a first \n     priority, ensure the safety and efficacy of the resulting \n     products, thus protecting patient safety. Furthermore, it \n     should also include adequate intellectual property \n     protections for innovators, in order to maintain the research \n     enterprise that has generated life-saving medications. The \n     Administration believes further discussion must take place \n     before addressing these issues in legislation. The \n     Administration strongly opposes the inclusion in this bill of \n     any provision related to follow-on protein products.\n       The Administration would also strongly oppose any provision \n     that might be added on the Senate Floor regarding the \n     importation of prescription drugs that does not address the \n     serious safety concerns identified in the December 2004 \n     Department of Health and Human Services Task Force Report on \n     Prescription Drug Importation. The Administration believes \n     that allowing importation of drugs outside the current safety \n     system established by the FDA without addressing these \n     serious safety concerns would threaten public health and \n     result in unsafe, unapproved, and counterfeit drugs being \n     imported into the United States. As a result, if any such \n     importation provision were included in the final version of \n     the bill presented to the President, the President's senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n       The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion of any \n     unrelated provisions that would disrupt the timely \n     reauthorization of the user fee program. The Administration \n     looks forward to working with Congress to reauthorize PDUFA \n     and MDUFMA expeditiously to avoid any disruptions to these \n     successful programs.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, these conditions contained in this \namendment are the same as those the Senate has previously adopted on \nother occasions on other bills. I urge the Senate to again support this \nlanguage and approve this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis cooperation. For the information of our colleagues, if we get \ncloture on the Dorgan amendment tomorrow, sometime prior to the \nexpiration of the 30 hours, we will vote on the Cochran amendment. That \nis a notice for Members about when we will address this issue. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  The Senator from Colorado raised important issues during the markup, \nand he has a very significant amendment to offer to the Senate. I hope \nwe will hear from him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 982\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment, and I call up amendment No. 982.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 982.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To strike provisions related to market exclusivity)\n\n       Strike subparagraphs (D) and (E) of section 402(a)(6).\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first, I thank the chairman, Senator \nKennedy, and the ranking Republican, Senator Enzi, for the bipartisan \nway in which they have worked in the committee, of which I am a new \nmember. It is the HELP Committee, standing for Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions. I appreciate the opportunity to have offered this \namendment in committee, as well the opportunity to offer it on the \nfloor. It is a very important committee.\n  The bill, coming out of committee, can withstand some improvement. I \nknow both Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy have sat down and made many \nchanges that I think will help relieve some of the concerns we have \nabout the bill. That is now in the form of a managers' amendment which \nis before the Senate.\n  The issue I remain concerned about is an issue that was in the \noriginal bill.\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\nIt remains in the bill, in the managers' amendment, and that is an \namendment to the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act passed in 1997. \nThis is an incentive program we put in place for the last decade that \nsays to the pharmaceutical industry that if you would put some effort \ninto getting children's medications, pediatric medications properly \nlabeled for the market, then we will give you, in effect, an extension \nof 6 months on your patent rights. This has been an extremely \nsuccessful program. For the life of me, I don't understand why the \nbill's sponsors feel it is important to put this provision in the bill.\n  This is a chart that reflects the drug studies that have been \ncompleted for kids, which equates to more drugs available for \npediatricians to use in treating childhood diseases. As one can see, \nthe red square on the chart is with no incentives, and very little \neffort was being made. But when the 6-month exclusivity provision was \nprovided in the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, we can see how \ndramatic the increase was and how the marketplace responded to this \nincentive.\n\n  In my view, we should not be removing or reducing the incentive for \nany pharmaceutical company to invest in children. Right now, with what \nthe current managers' amendment has in it, it takes the 6-month \nexclusivity and reduces it to 3 months, and it has it applied to those \nthat are referred to as the blockbuster drugs. In my view, I think we \nneed to make sure everybody understands how very important this program \nis. If we go messing with it, we are going to reduce the incentives \nthat are in it that have been working so well.\n  The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act allows the FDA to grant \ndrug sponsors pediatric exclusivity. This is 6 months of additional \nmarket exclusivity--as I said, an extension basically of the patent \nrights--in exchange for conducting and submitting reports on pediatric \ndrug studies. Current law is working. There is no reason I see to \nchange significantly a program that is working.\n  The goal of the program is to develop additional health information \non the use of such drugs in pediatric populations so they can be \nadministered safely and effectively to children. This goal is reflected \non this chart as being reached. Also, using pediatric research and \ndevelopment legislation to attack large pharmaceutical companies, in my \nview, is an abuse of power at the expense of kids. The data shows \npediatric legislation has resulted in a substantial increase in \npediatric prescribing information on the labels of those products, \nwhich have fulfilled the requirements necessary to be granted the \npediatric exclusivity extension.\n  Here is what the GAO study on the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children \nAct has said about how the program has been working for the last \ndecade. This study was issued on March 22 of 2007, so it is a current \nevaluation, and here is what they say:\n\n       Prior to enactment of the Food and Drug Administration \n     Modernization Act of 1997, which first established incentives \n     for conducting pediatric drug studies in the form of \n     additional market exclusivity, few drugs were studied for \n     pediatric use.\n\n  Very few were done, as reflected on the chart.\n\n       As a result, there was a lack of information on optimal \n     dosage, possible side effects, and the effectiveness of drugs \n     for pediatric use. Almost all the drugs--about 87 percent--\n     that have been granted pediatric exclusivity under the Best \n     Pharmaceuticals for Children Act have had important labeling \n     changes as a result of pediatric drug studies conducted under \n     this Act.\n\n  As a result, exclusivity is working. In fact, it is working so well \nthat, in my view, with increased exclusivity we may have even had more \nresearch and development in the area of pediatric pharmaceuticals. But \nthat issue is for another day.\n  My amendment doesn't request an increase in what has been working. We \nmerely ask that we return in this piece of legislation to that \nexclusivity-linked period, which is 6 months, which has been working so \nvery well under current law.\n  Some Members want to try to damage the blockbuster drug companies by \nreducing the exclusivity for those businesses, but in reality the ones \nwho are really being hurt are our kids because we take away the number \nof choices a pediatrician has in providing drug therapy for those kids \nwho could be seriously ill.\n  I ask my colleagues to support me in my amendment and to return us to \nthe 6-month exclusivity and away from the 3-month exclusivity period we \ncurrently have in the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in a few moments we will hear from \nSenator Dodd, who was the architect for the whole undertaking in terms \nof testing for children, and also for the children's prescription drug \nprogram which has been immensely successful. He deserves great credit \nfor it. I am sure he gets a great deal of satisfaction from it. It was \nbipartisan, with Senator DeWine, going back many years, and certainly \nSenator Clinton has added an additional dimension to this whole \nproposal. But Senator Dodd has studied this issue very carefully, and \nhe really is the originator of the concept. He has followed it closely, \nand he will speak to the Senate on this matter in a very short time.\n  I see my friend from Ohio on the Senate floor, who also wishes to \naddress it, but I will just say a brief word. I believe what we have in \nthe legislation, which was earlier fashioned by the Senator from \nConnecticut, is the way to go, and I would hope the Allard amendment \nwill not be accepted.\n  One of the major elements in the FDA bill is the program providing \nincentives for developing the new drugs, and Senator Dodd, Senator \nClinton, Senator Alexander, and many others have been champions of this \nprogram, as was our former colleague, Senator DeWine. The \nreauthorization of an effective program is an opportunity to strengthen \nthose aspects that work well and to improve those that need adjustment. \nSenator Dodd took up this challenge and renewed the information about \nhow the program has worked over the years since Congress last reviewed \nit.\n  He found that companies were sometimes rewarded with billions of \ndollars in additional sales in return for doing studies that cost them \nonly a few million. Clearly, one must provide incentives to develop new \ndrugs for children, but we must be responsible in doing so. That is why \nin this reauthorization, Senator Dodd included a proposal to adjust the \nperiod of market exclusivity for drugs that generate over a billion \ndollars in sales. If they generate over a billion dollars in sales, \nthese blockbuster drugs will receive only 3 months of exclusivity \ninstead of 6 months, available to other drugs.\n  The Allard amendment would delete this sensible provision and give \nall drugs the full 6 months. That could be worth billions of dollars \nfor a major medication. Those extra 6 months don't just apply to sales \nfor use in children, they apply to all sales. That means a heart drug \ntested in children would get 6 months protection from competition, so \nit can wrack up big returns.\n  The amendment we face embodies a policy that has no proportionality. \nIt gives the same broad protection to a drug such as Lipitor or Xanax \nas it does to a specialty drug that might be helpful in treating ear \ninfections in children. Senator Dodd's proposal has that sense of \nproportional reward, but the amendment overturns it. That is the wrong \napproach, and I hope the Senate will reject it.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from Ohio wishes to \naddress this issue, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy, and I want to join \nmy colleagues, and I will precede Senator Dodd and join him and Senator \nKennedy and others in urging a ``no'' vote on the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Colorado.\n  Drugmakers, as we know, have exclusive rights to market a \nprescription drug under a patent. That means no generic drugs are \nallowed on the market. There is no price competition and nothing to \nprevent drugmakers from charging top dollar for their products. Top \ndollar, as many of our constituents know all too well, for a \nprescription drug can be breathtaking. A 30-day supply of Nexium, the \nlittle purple pill, costs about $193; a 30-day supply of Exelon, an \nAlzheimer's drug, is $214; a 30-day supply of Pravachol, a statin drug, \nis $168. Under current law--under current law--drugmakers are rewarded \nan additional 6 months of competition-\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\nfree time on the market when they agree to evaluate a prescription drug \nfor use in children--6 months.\n  That is a tradeoff. It is a tradeoff the House and Senate agreed to, \nwhere adult consumers of this drug--adult consumers of the drug--are \ndenied a less costly generic version of, for example, Prilosec, for an \nadditional 6 months. This means their out-of-pocket health care costs--\nor their employer, or their insurance company, or the government--are \nsignificantly higher than they otherwise would be. That is the \ntradeoff.\n  At the same time, drugmakers agree to conduct pediatric testing they \nwouldn't have done voluntarily, sometimes for reasons all their own, \nand those tests provide invaluable information to pediatricians for the \nproper use and dose of medicines prescribed to children. That was the \nagreement--the 6-month exclusivity agreement. That incentive has worked \nto increase, we all agree, the number of pediatric tests drugmakers \nconduct. That is important. Pediatricians now have access to new \ninformation that has enabled them to make better use of prescription \ndrugs to help our Nation's children.\n  My colleague, Senator Dodd, championed the 6-month exclusivity law in \nhis efforts in this area, as did my predecessor in the Senate, and so \nmany others, and their work has improved the lives of children. \nNeedless to say, the Senator from Connecticut would not arbitrarily or \nrecklessly make changes to the pediatric exclusivity law. It was his \nidea and his work. He clearly isn't going to compromise it. But he is \nrecommending one change, and this amendment, the Allard amendment, \nundoes that change, which is included in S. 1082.\n  He is recommending if a drug generates more than $1 billion in \nrevenues--that is, it is a blockbuster drug--if the drug generates more \nthan $1 billion in revenue, that drug should receive an additional 3 \nmonths of market exclusivity instead of 6 months. The reason is both \nsimple and compelling.\n  It costs about $13 million--think about these numbers--it costs about \n$13 million to conduct pediatric testing on a new drug. If a drugmaker \nis taking in $1 billion a year on that drug, $13 million is about 1 \npercent of their revenues on that drug. Giving that drugmaker an \nadditional 6 months of market exclusivity on a $1 billion drug costs \nhealth care consumers and taxpayers--the taxpayers who cover the cost \nof public health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA--it \ncosts them millions of dollars each day.\n  This is not, as Senator Allard said, a provision to punish the drug \ncompanies. It is a provision to help people with their out-of-pocket \ndrug costs. It is a provision to help taxpayers who fund Medicare, \nMedicaid, and the VA. It is a provision to help those businesses that \nare funding health care and drug plans for their employees.\n  The Federal Government could do it another away. The Federal \nGovernment could reimburse drugmakers for the cost of pediatric tests. \nIt could reward them with a 600-percent profit on conducting those \ntests, and it would still cost appreciably less than rewarding them an \nadditional 6 months of exclusivity. That is why we made the decision \nnot to do it that way. But in light of the astounding imbalance between \nthe cost of conducting a pediatric test--$13 million--and the reward \nthat 6 months of exclusivity provides when it comes to a $1 billion \ndrug, Senator Dodd recommended we cut that in half. We provide 3 months \nof exclusivity for billion-dollar drugs instead.\n  It is still a breathtaking reward: A $1 billion drug gets a 3-month \nexclusivity instead of a 6-month exclusivity for a $13 million test--a \nbreathtaking reward for one pediatric test, but it is measurably more \njustifiable than the 6-month moratorium on price competition.\n  Common sense, fiscal responsibility, and the fact that all of us in \nthis Chamber report to U.S. taxpayers dictate that we support Senator \nDodd on this modest change in his own program. The Allard amendment \ngives $1 billion drugs a 6-month exclusivity instead of 3. The logic \nis, if 6 months of market exclusivity is working to prompt drugmakers \nto conduct pediatric testing, we shouldn't change it. By that logic, we \nmight as well give drugmakers 100 years of market exclusivity. I am \nsure that would work, too.\n  The point is, we have to draw the line to encourage pediatric \ntesting, which this will, and to save money for our employers, for our \ntaxpayers, and for senior citizens' out-of-pocket costs. When a \ndrugmaker earns hundreds of millions of dollars, in many cases out of \nthe pockets of U.S. taxpayers, for a pediatric test that costs about \n$10 million, that is unnecessary, it is unjustifiable, and it is \noutright wrong.\n  Please vote for common sense, for protecting our children, for U.S. \ntaxpayers, for consumers, and against the Allard amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming, who is managing \nthe time, has granted permission for me to speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I forgot to ask unanimous consent that the following \nindividuals be added as cosponsors on my amendment: Senator Bond, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to respond to this concern \nabout drug companies investing relatively little and having huge \nreturns. That doesn't apply to every drug.\n  Obviously, when you are developing a product for the market, there \nwill be some that work out rather easily and the development costs may \nnot be too much. But there are other drugs that require a substantial \namount of work and analysis, and a considerable amount of thought has \nto go into the labeling. When those costs get high and when you hit \nthose, the profit margin is not so large. I hate to see us pick out a \nfew companies that may have had a windfall and then punish our children \nand say we are going to take away an incentive that has resulted in 80 \npercent of the children's drugs that have come to the market being \napproved and getting the proper licensing they require.\n  In my view, we pick out a few outrageous circumstances and then we \ntry and take away an incentive that has been working so well for us.\n  My point, again, is why mess with that incentive when it is working \nso very well? As I had indicated here on the charts, we had such \ntremendous results in getting children's pediatric drugs to the market. \nThis allows the pediatrician more choice in selecting therapies for \ntheir patients. It means better medicine. I also believe that the more \nproducts you have on the market, the more competition you have, and the \nmore competition you have, that then holds down the price of drugs. \nWhat we need to do is rely on the markets to control the price of \ndrugs, to control supply. I hate to see the Government or this Congress \ntry to apply any kind of artificial parameters that somehow or other \nwould mean we would have fewer drugs for the treatment of our kids and \ntheir ailments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment by \nSenator Allard which would strike a cap on pediatric research \nincentives for blockbuster drugs with more than $1 billion in annual \nsales. That sounds like a lot. We are going to quibble here about \nwhether they get 3 months of additional time or 6 months of additional \ntime. They have had 6 months of additional time.\n  Incidentally, this is one time per drug. This is not every time they \ncan come up with a child's use they can extend another 3 months or 6 \nmonths; this is one time on any drug, they can get an extension of 6 \nmonths.\n  Now we are going to decide that a company that comes up with a really \ngreat drug is only going to get 3 months versus 6 months because they \nmake $1 billion in annual sales? Three months' worth would be $250 \nmillion in annual sales, and that sounds like a lot, but when you \nfigure out what is profit out of that, it is a much smaller number.\n  I congratulate Senator Dodd for originally coming up with this \nincentive. He came up with the idea for 6 months, and it worked. You \nhave seen the chart that shows how dramatically there was an increase \nin the number of drugs that were studied for kids and how proper doses \nwere derived for kids. The Allard amendment ensures that pediatric \nstudies that are essential to our children's health and well-being will \ncontinue to take place, that they\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\nwill continue the same as they have with the same incentives and the \nsame requirements. Under current law, in exchange for performing a \npediatric study, a manufacturer can receive an additional 6 months of \nmarket exclusivity, one time per drug. This is a powerful incentive to \nensure pediatric studies are completed. The substitute amendment we are \ndebating today limits this exclusivity to just 3 months, and I am \nconcerned that this will reduce or limit the number of pediatric \nstudies. Senator Allard's amendment would revert back to current law. \nIf we support and pass the amendment of Senator Allard, we go to \ncurrent law, so manufacturers can receive the additional 6 months of \nmarket exclusivity.\n  Before incentives, there were very few pediatric studies. In the 7 \nyears before Congress authorized incentives, only 11 pediatric studies \nwere completed; 7 years, 11 studies--embarrassing. But at least 132 \npediatric studies were completed, and more are ongoing. The current \nincentive system works.\n  This is not an abstract policy issue. Pediatric drug studies can mean \nthe difference between life and death for our children. For example, \ninitial research indicates that Viagra, which is a blockbuster drug, \ncan work miracles for children with pulmonary fibrosis, a rare and \npotentially fatal lung disorder. Viagra seems to relax and expand blood \nvessels in afflicted children's lungs. Incentives spurred Pfizer to \nperform studies that are now underway and could save approximately \n28,000 children who might otherwise die or suffer greatly. Without \npowerful incentives, such studies might not get done.\n  The Democratic witnesses at the HELP Committee's--the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pension Committee--recent hearing agreed that \ncaps are a risky experiment. The number--zero incentives, 11 studies; \nstrong incentives, 132 studies--that speaks for itself. Reducing \nincentives will certainly reduce the number of pediatric studies. We \nshould not undercut a system that is proven to help kids and then say \nwe are improving the program. I don't think so.\n  I strongly agree we need to do everything we can to make health care \nmore affordable and accessible, but harming a worthwhile program that \nsaves kids' lives is the wrong way to do it. It is wrong to play the \npolitics of drug pricing at the expense of our kids. We should protect \nthese incentives which are proven to work.\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Dodd for coming up with the idea of \nproviding these incentives. I wish to note for the record it was at 6 \nmonths that we provided that. I ask that you support the Allard \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me first begin by thanking Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi for including the Best Pharmaceuticals for \nChildren Act and the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement \nAct in the bill before us. I congratulate them, particularly Senator \nKennedy for his efforts of putting all this together, this major \nlegislation which is going to be so important for the health and well-\nbeing of all our citizenry. I am very grateful to him, and to Senator \nEnzi as well, for leading the minority on this issue and making it \npossible for us to be here today to discuss these issues.\n  My friend from Colorado and I worked together on this issue. I \nappreciate the comments about the effort we made over the past decade \nor more to try to do what this bill was designed to do and has done, \nand that is to increase the clinical trials and testing of products \nused in our younger Americans--children.\n  In too many cases, prescription drugs were being tested for adults, \nand there was an assumption that a smaller dosage of that product would \nbe all that was necessary to take care of children. Obviously, that was \nnot the case, as we heard in significant testimony over the years.\n  Countless hours have gone into the work on this legislation. The \nPresiding Officer has been a tremendous help. I thank him for his \nefforts, along with others on this committee helping us put this \ntogether.\n  It must be an Ohio tradition. As he has heard me say on occasion, \nSenator Brown has been tremendously supportive, working on this issue. \nHe was active on the issue when he served in the other body, and he \nbrought his talents and knowledge to the issue when he arrived here \nrecently. His predecessor, Senator DeWine, was my cosponsor on this \nbill for a decade, on a bipartisan basis putting the legislation \ntogether that has produced the results which have been identified by \nSenator Allard and Senator Enzi already this morning.\n  We find ourselves here having worked very carefully together on a \nbipartisan basis for more than a decade to craft legislation. None of \nus are claiming perfection here. The idea was to try to induce the \nindustry to step forward and do something they had not done before--to \ntest their products in children. We were not certain when we started \nout how this would actually work. Ten years ago, we saw a situation \nwhere the majority of drugs being used in children were not being \ntested for their use.\n  Children are not simply little adults. The results of drug studies \nconducted under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act have shown \nthey should not be treated as such. The initiative contained in the \nbill before us on pediatric medical devices is a similar effort to \nensure children are not left behind as cutting-edge research and \nrevolutionary technologies for medical devices advance.\n  Senator DeWine, as I mentioned, and I authored this bill more than a \ndecade ago, at a time when only 11 drugs on the market that were being \nused for children had actually been tested and studied for that use. \nPrior to the enactment of this legislation a decade ago, pediatricians \nwere essentially flying blind because they lacked information regarding \nthe safety and effectiveness of drugs they were prescribing. It was \noften the children who suffered the most.\n  What we have learned over this past decade after 10 years of \nexperience is that children have been exposed to ineffective drugs, \nineffective dosing, overdosing, or drug side effects that were \npreviously unknown. In 10 years, nearly 800 studies involving more than \n45,000 children in clinical trials have been completed as a result of \nthis legislation. Useful new pediatric information is now part of \nproduct labeling for more than 119 drugs.\n  In sum, there has been a 20-fold increase in drugs studied in \ninfants, children, and adolescents as a result of the legislation I \nauthored 10 years ago. Children with a wide range of diseases such as \nHIV/AIDS, cancer, allergies, asthma, neurological and psychological \ndisorders, and obesity can now lead healthier and more productive lives \nas a result of new information about the safety and efficacy of drugs \nthey use to treat and manage their diseases when previously there was \nnone. This successful program for children will expire on the 30th of \nSeptember unless we reauthorize it.\n  I have spent months crafting a proposal to reauthorize this \nlegislation, which is now reflected in the underlying bill. It had been \nmy hope that this initiative would continue in that bipartisan \ntradition that began more than a decade ago. Fashioning legislation \nwhen there are 100 of us here, trying to come up with ideas, and yet \nbalance disparate views and opinions. There are some, frankly, who \nwould have no periods of exclusivity and believe the industry ought to \nbe doing this as a matter of obligation to one out of four Americans. \nYou have heard from others who think we ought to provide extended \nperiods of exclusivity, longer than 6 months. It is not easy to fashion \nthese compromises here, where you can put something together that does \nwhat we want to do, all the while ensuring that the program can \ncontinue to generate more benefits than were originally contemplated. \nThere has to be some limitation in terms of how we deal with all this.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Harkin, Bingaman, Murray, Reed, Clinton, \nand Brown, who all cosponsored the legislation I introduced which, as I \npreviously mentioned, has been incorporated on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent that these letters be \nprinted in the Record so my colleagues will know the bill we are \nconsidering is not something we threw together haphazardly. This was \nmajor, extensive work with major organizations in this country\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\nthat spend every waking hour working on children's diseases and issues \nthat affect their health.

Edward Kennedy,\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Dodd and Clinton:  As \n     organizations working to ensure better health care for the \n     nation's children, we write to thank you for your \n     longstanding commitment to children's health and to express \n     our support for legislation to reauthorize the Best \n     Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric \n     Research Equity Act (PREA) and to improve children's access \n     to safe medical devices. We are very pleased that BPCA and \n     PREA reauthorization language and S. 830, the Pediatric \n     Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act, have been included \n     in the Chairman's mark of S. 1082, the ``Food and Drug \n     Administration Revitalization Act,'' for consideration by the \n     Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n     tomorrow.\n       Over the past decade, Congress has enacted bipartisan \n     legislation that has dramatically increased the number of \n     drugs tested and labeled for children. The results from BPCA \n     are extraordinary--over 336 requests have been generated for \n     over 780 pediatric studies, resulting in over 115 new drug \n     labels for children. Sen. Dodd's BPCA reauthorization \n     language strengthens this very successful existing program in \n     several important ways, including ensuring prompt label \n     changes, requiring that all study protocols and results be \n     made public, improving adverse events reporting for children, \n     and identifying and addressing important gaps in treatments \n     for children's diseases. In addition, the BPCA language \n     includes a reasoned approach to address the small percentage \n     of drugs for which the exclusivity provision has far exceeded \n     the incentive it was intended to provide pharmaceutical \n     companies.\n       S. 993, the Pediatric Research Improvement Act (PRIA), \n     introduced by Sen. Clinton and included in the Chairman's \n     mark, reauthorizes the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 \n     (PREA), which requires drug manufacturers to test their \n     products for use in children. This law ensures that children \n     are not a therapeutic afterthought and has generated \n     impressive and invaluable safety and dosing information for \n     children. Since the 2003 passage of PREA, 55 drugs have new \n     or improved pediatric labeling. These drugs range from \n     treatment of ear infections to the prevention of rejection of \n     organ transplants. S. 993 places children on equal \n     therapeutic footing with adults by creating the presumption \n     that medicines coming onto the market for illnesses and \n     conditions that occur in children will be labeled for \n     pediatric use and be available in formulations (e.g., \n     liquids, chewable tablets) that children can take.\n       The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of \n     2007 provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring that \n     children are not left behind as cutting-edge research and \n     revolutionary technologies for medical devices advance. Like \n     drugs, where for too long children were treated like small \n     adults, many essential medical devices used extensively by \n     pediatricians are not designed or sized for children. \n     According to pediatricians, the development of new medical \n     devices suitable for children's smaller and growing bodies \n     can lag 5-10 years behind those for adults. S. 830 improves \n     incentives for devices for small markets--while still \n     preserving the ability to ensure the safety of new products \n     once on the market. It provides assistance to innovators, \n     streamlines regulatory processes, and elevates pediatric \n     device issues at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and \n     the National Institutes of Health.\n       Despite support for the Chairman's mark, we are \n     disappointed that a key provision to make PRIA permanent has \n     been omitted. As this legislation moves to the floor of the \n     Senate, we urge you to restore the permanent authority of the \n     FDA to ensure that children have properly studied medications \n     as a matter of fact, not chance.\n       We are grateful for your longstanding leadership and \n     commitment to improving the health of our nation's children \n     and look forward to working with you toward swift Committee \n     action and passage of these pediatric therapeutic bills by \n     the full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Academy of Pediatrics; Elizabeth Glaser \n           Pediatric AIDS Foundation; AIDS Alliance for Children, \n           Youth & Families; American Academy of Child and \n           Adolescent Psychiatry; American Brain Coalition; \n           American Pediatric Society; American Psychiatric \n           Association; American Thoracic Society; Arthritis \n           Foundation; Association of Medical School Pediatric \n           Department Chairs; Children's Cause for Cancer \n           Advocacy; National Association of Children's Hospitals \n           (N.A.C.H.); National Organization for Rare Disorders; \n           National Research Center for Women and Families; \n           Society for Pediatric Research.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: As organizations working to ensure \n     better health care for the nation's children, we write to \n     express our support for your legislation to reauthorize the \n     Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), which has been \n     included in S. 1082, the ``Food and Drug Administration \n     Revitalization Act.'' Since its original enactment in 1997, \n     this legislation has directly resulted in an extraordinary \n     increase in the number of drugs tested and labeled for \n     children. In the past ten years, BPCA has prompted over 780 \n     pediatric studies and yielded 115 new drug labels for \n     children, fundamentally changing the practice of pediatric \n     medicine and the quality of health care for our nation's \n     children.\n       Since the inception of BPCA, Congress has recognized the \n     need to ensure that it strikes the appropriate balance \n     between cost to consumers and benefits to children. This year \n     we have the data to show that we can adjust the exclusivity \n     provision without losing pediatric studies. In February, the \n     Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published \n     a study of the profits drug manufacturers received from the \n     additional 6 months of pediatric exclusivity. The study found \n     that ``the Pediatric Exclusivity Program overcompensates \n     blockbuster products for performing clinical trials in \n     children.''\n       The approach taken by your BPCA reauthorization legislation \n     appropriately addresses the small number of products for \n     which the benefit of additional exclusivity has far exceeded \n     the incentive it was intended to provide. By limiting \n     exclusivity only for those products with sales over $1 \n     billion, your proposal can address concerns about excessive \n     profits without jeopardizing the extraordinary benefits of \n     BPCA for children's health. The adjustment will significantly \n     reduce the overall cost of pediatric exclusivity to \n     consumers. We therefore oppose Senator Allard's amendment to \n     strike this reasonable exclusivity adjustment from S. 1082.\n       We are grateful for your leadership and commitment to \n     improving the health of our nation's children and look \n     forward to swift passage of BPCA by the full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n         AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth & Families; American \n           Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; American \n           Academy of Pediatrics; American Brain Coalition; \n           American Pediatric Society; American Psychiatric \n           Association; American Thoracic Society; Arthritis \n           Foundation; Association of Medical School Pediatric \n           Department Chairs; Children's Cause for Cancer \n           Advocacy; Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation; \n           National Association of Children's Hospitals \n           (N.A.C.H.); National Organization for Rare Disorders; \n           Society for Pediatric Research.\n\n  Mr. DODD. To anyone offering to flyspeck this proposal and offer \nvariations to it, I would say that months and months have gone into \nthis legislation which we think has had the dual effect of ensuring \nthat the ramifications of expanding the length of exclusivity, as some \nhave proposed, have been carefully considered along with proposals to \nlimit the length of exclusivity to 3 months for all drugs, as others \nhave proposed. The bill before us balances many viewpoints on this \nprogram and is a proposal that 15 major organizations involved with the \neffort strongly support.\n  Throughout the 10-year history of the Best Pharmaceuticals for \nChildren Act, Congress has recognized the need to ensure it strikes the \nappropriate balance between the cost to consumers and benefits to \nchildren. By instituting a 5-year sunset in both the original \nlegislation in 1997 and the first reauthorization in 2002, Congress was \nacknowledging the ongoing need to evaluate the cost of the incentive \nunder this act to consumers in relation to the benefit of having \nmedications properly studied and labeled for children.\n  The 6-month incentive of exclusivity has been very successful in \ngenerating pediatric studies. Yet after 10 years,\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\nexperience and data have shown us that for a small number of drugs, \npediatric exclusivity has far exceeded the carrot that was designed to \nencourage people to move forward.\n  In February of this year, the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation published a study of the profits drug manufacturers \nreceived from the additional 6 months of pediatric exclusivity.\n  The study found that most of the drugs studied under the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act in recent years received relatively \nmodest returns. In fact, data shows that many drugs came close to \nbreaking even with respect to financial returns on investment for \nconducting pediatric trials. In one place they may have had a negative \nreturn.\n  However, the study also found, and I quote them here, that ``the \npediatric exclusivity program overcompensates blockbuster products from \nperforming clinical trials in children.''\n  S. 1082 contains a very reasonable, workable mechanism to address \ncost concerns. By adjusting exclusivity from 6 months to 3 months only \nfor those products with U.S. sales over $1 billion, I think S. 1082 can \naddress consumer concerns about excessive profits without jeopardizing \nthe extraordinary benefits of this legislation.\n  I don't think it is too much to ask. That is why we have the sunset \nprovisions in this program, to be able to go back and analyze how this \nis working every 5 years. So for those products in excess of a $1 \nbillion, we shorten exclusivity. I am satisfied.\n  Pfizer, a leading drug company in this country, supports this \nproposal. The producer of the largest blockbuster drug in the world \nsays this is a good compromise. Why are my colleagues having a hard \ntime? If a major drug company who has benefitted under this exclusivity \nand manufactured blockbuster drugs says this bill is a sound \ncompromise, what is the problem my colleagues have with this proposal?\n  If Pfizer, a company that has benefitted from this program says this \nbalance is a healthy one, why can't my colleagues be happy with it?\n  This bill is a good bill. It has done a good job for people. But \nlet's remind ourselves that we also have a responsibility to consumers. \nAnd when consumers find themselves in a situation where they can't \nafford lifesaving medicines, then it is time for us to strike a \nbalance. This bill has a sunset provision in it. I am for the sunset \nprovision. I am for it because we need to come back again in 5 years \nand assess where we are on this issue rather than make a determination \nthat in perpetuity this is a program and a balance that makes sense \nforever.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, eliminating the \nexclusivity adjustment, as the amendment offered by my colleague from \nColorado would do, would increase the cost of exclusivity to the \nFederal Government by $50 million over 10 years. So in addition to the \nconsumers, taxpayers are going to be asked to pay an additional $50 \nmillion under the Allard amendment.\n  Again, if we have drug companies saying they think this proposal is a \ngood balance, why are we adding a $50 million pricetag to the taxpayers \nwith the Allard amendment, not to mention the cost of these drugs \nincreasing as a result of extending exclusivity from 3 months to 6 \nmonths for products with sales in excess of $1 billion?\n  As I said, this is something I have worked on for a long time in a \nbipartisan fashion: to strike a balance as we've tried to do for 10 \nyears between benefits to children and cost to consumers. To now say \nall of us who have worked on this program are wrong, all of the \norganizations involved with children's health are wrong, and drug \ncompanies that have benefitted from this program are wrong--but we know \nbest. We know best. We think those billion-dollar products deserve to \nbe protected. We think the taxpayers should foot the $50 million bill \nand the cost of these drugs are irrelevant in this debate. Well, they \nare not irrelevant.\n  We may do great damage to something we are trying to achieve after a \ndecade of hard work on a bipartisan basis to put this together. I say \nrespectfully to my friend from Colorado and the Senator from Wyoming, \nwe have worked hard to strike these balances. It is not easy. These are \ncomplicated issues. It requires cooperation on both sides of the aisle \nto get the job done. That is what I have done for a decade with Members \nof that side of the aisle to see to it that we have a good, strong \nbill. The result is a program which has gone far beyond what we \nanticipated might happen.\n  The slight adjustment we have made after analyzing this bill after 10 \nyears is little to ask. If one of the largest beneficiaries of the \nprogram is satisfied, and if the organizations who support this program \nbelieve it is all right, why are we adding a $50 million pricetag and \nasking consumers to pay more?\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Allard amendment when the vote \noccurs. I thank Senator Kennedy and others who have worked so hard to \nmake this possible. This is a very important piece of legislation, and \none that can do an awful lot of good. The amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Colorado puts that at risk. Our children in this country \ndeserve better than what he is offering, which is to try to break up \nthe delicate balance I have tried to put together for a decade.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my dear colleague from Tennessee \nfor allowing me to go first, and also my two colleagues on the \nDemocratic side, Senators Carper and Stabenow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander be permitted to go \nnext and then Senator Carper and then Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I think it would be \nuseful if we rotate it back and forth.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we have an agreement among the four of us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator from Delaware is satisfied, that is fine \nwith me.\n  Mr. ENZI. One of the things we are trying to do is keep the debate on \nthe children's amendment so we can get a conclusion to the children's \namendment before time deadlines come up. So if those who wanted to \nspeak on other issues can reserve their time until later, that would be \nvery helpful.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would add to that request the Senator from Oklahoma \nafter Senator Stabenow.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We still have the Pastore rules in effect, which means \nthe debate on the first 2 hours is supposed to be on matters which are \nsubject to it. I mean it is not generally enforced, but Senator Enzi \nand I are trying to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest from the Senator from Utah?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, including the two \nmanagers of the bill on both the Democratic and the Republican side.\n  I rise in support of the Allard amendment. I want to take a few \nminutes to talk about pediatric testing and research provisions \nincluded in this bill. I have strongly supported both the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Improvement \nAct.\n  As my colleagues know, current law provides 6 months of exclusivity \nfor drugs that do research and development in the area of pediatric \nuse. I am very interested in keeping it that way. That has proven very \nefficacious in the Hatch-Waxman bill. It keeps companies involved in \ndeveloping great drugs for children in this area. So it is a very \nimportant part of this.\n  I was deeply involved in those negotiations in 1997 with my former \ncolleague, our former colleague, Senator Mike DeWine. I have supported \nthese efforts from Ohio Senator Mike DeWine that brought additional \npediatric testing of prescription drugs to our attention during \nconsideration of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. He fought long and \nhard to encourage drug companies to conduct clinical trials on \npediatric uses of their drugs.\n  His efforts paid off and this program has been extremely successful. \nAs a result, pediatric drugs are safer and more effective for children. \nThe bill before us today reduces the 6-month exclusivity period for \nblockbuster drugs to 3 months.\n  I emphasize again this market exclusivity has provided the incentive \nneeded to increase research and development for pediatric drugs. We \nused the\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\nsame type of an approach on the orphan drug bill many years ago. At \nthat time there were only a few orphan drugs. Today there are over 300 \nbeing developed. It is the same principle here.\n  The Allard amendment restores current law and provides 6 months of \nexclusivity for all drugs. As I mentioned last night, my good friend \nand colleague from Connecticut, Senator Chris Dodd, has also shown \ngreat leadership on this issue when FDAMA was being considered in 1997. \nHe held a hearing on this issue earlier this year with his ranking \nRepublican member, Senator Lamar Alexander, who has served long and \nwell on this committee.\n  That hearing was very insightful, and I believe many of us are trying \nto do the right thing as we reauthorize both programs. I urge my \ncolleagues not to lose sight of the purpose of these two programs as we \nmake decisions on this part of the bill. We want good solid information \nabout the safest way to prescribe drugs for children.\n  By giving companies market exclusivity to conduct clinical trials, we \nwill know the safest dosage levels for children. So let's not lose \nsight of the original purpose of these programs: to help children have \nthe safest dosages for prescriptions.\n  Now, it is no secret I support the Allard amendment. I would just \nlike to add a few more facts. Nearly two-thirds of the drugs prescribed \nfor children have not been studied and labeled for pediatric use. I \nknow the importance of accurate clinical information about a drug's use \nin the pediatric population. This smaller body mass and higher \nmetabolic rates of children mean they often respond differently to drug \ndosing than adults do.\n  A drug that is safe and effective in adults may not always be safe \nfor children. The question is not whether we should study the safety of \ndrugs for children but how we make that research happen.\n  In 1997, Congress considered this issue and created an incentives \nprogram for companies to study the use of their drugs in pediatric \npopulations. The program offers an additional 6-month patent protection \nor exclusivity to drug manufacturers to help recoup the cost of \ninvesting in these critical pediatric studies. It is a win-win \nsituation. Drug companies have the incentive to invest time and extra \nresources for a small share of the market, and, more importantly, \nchildren get the research they need.\n  The evidence is that the incentives for exclusivity should be \nmaintained, not lowered. Despite the fact that the bill providing the \nincentive for pediatric studies was enacted a decade ago, nearly two-\nthirds of the drugs prescribed for children have not been studied and \nlabeled for pediatric use.\n  We have had a great deal of study about the need for this incentive \nand how it should work.\n  The fact remains that there is a persistent public health need for \naccurate clinical information about how adult drugs will work in \nchildren.\n  Children are not adults, for reasons that the Senator from Oklahoma, \nDr. Coburn, has well explained to this body.\n  Much of what our colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, has just \nsaid underscores the need for a continued, strong, exclusivity \nprovision.\n  The statistics he cited about the success of this program are truly \nremarkable and a significant milestone in the history of public health.\n  The only place where there seems to be disagreement on Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act is the exclusivity period for what \nsome define as ``blockbuster drugs.'' I know the Senator may call the 6 \nmonths period ``gouging'' but that ``gouging'' may very well be the \nincentive that has led to the FDA receiving more than 400 proposed \npediatric-study requests and receiving 144 completed studies.\n  Those who support the Senator's amendment--and I know it is well-\nintentioned--suggest that without the 6 months' incentive, the \npediatric testing will still continue and will be robust. Who knows if \nthis is true?\n  I wonder if we want to call their bluff and take away this powerful \nincentive? I don't think we can take that chance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, first I would like to congratulate \nSenator Dodd and others who over the past 10 years have developed this \npiece of legislation. It has been remarkably effective. I think it is \nimportant as we talk about this that we remind ourselves what we are \nsaying. What we are saying is, we live in this country with all of \nthese wonderful pharmaceutical drugs for adults, but in many cases, \nbefore this legislation had been enacted, doctors were flying blind. \nThey were guessing about the effect of these drugs on children.\n  That sometimes had very unfortunate results. I know that in my home \nState of Tennessee a drug for whooping cough was given to a number of \nchildren. There had been a clinical trial for the effect it would have \non adults but not on children. And the children were so seriously \nharmed by the drug that the Centers for Disease Control later found \nthat the drug was the reason they needed stomach surgery.\n  So it is remarkable that 10 years ago Senator Dodd and others--\nSenator DeWine, Senator Hatch, and many others who have been \nmentioned--came up with the idea that if we strike this balance that \nSenator Dodd has referred to several times and give the companies that \nmake the drugs a little more time, 6 months with their patent, that \nthey in return would then conduct trials on these drugs on how they \naffect children.\n  No one knew at that time exactly what would happen. They were \nguessing. This is long before I came to the Senate. But they guessed \nwell. As a result, as has been said, about one-third of the drugs that \nare given to children now have had testing and trials for use in \nchildren. Now doctors, when we bring our babies and grandbabies in, \nhave a better idea of what they are doing. They are guessing less. It \nis better for the children.\n  In my family we have two new grandchildren under the age of 2. \nSenator Dodd, being younger than I am, has two children who are young \nlike that. Maybe he has heard what I have heard. My mother used to say \nto me when I would go to the babies and they were happy, she would say: \n``Son, don't try to make a happy baby happier.''\n  In effect, what she was saying is, leave it alone if it is happy. \nWell, this is a happy piece of legislation for which Senator Dodd and \nothers should have a lot of credit. My suggestion would be let's not \ntry to make a happy piece of legislation happier. It is happy because \none-third of medicines are being studied, and doctors know more about \nwhat they are giving to their patients who are children.\n  What the Allard amendment would do is keep the law the way it is. It \nis the bill that is on the Senate floor that would change things.\n  I understand this is an estimate, but I listened to the testimony. \nThe Senator from Connecticut suggested we are all racing here at the \nlast minute and changing it. Wait a minute. We had a hearing on this \nsome time ago. It was a terrific hearing. I was there. We heard various \npoints of view, a lot of celebration about the effect of this act over \nthe last 10 years. The only reason I was not a cosponsor of this \nlegislation was because I wanted to hear the testimony about what the \neffect would be of changing this law that is a happy law that has \nworked so well for so long. As a result, it created the situation where \na third of the children have drugs that doctors know more about.\n  After listening to all the testimony, if I were going to change the \nlaw, I would make the incentive 7 months or 8 months or 9 months. Why \nwould I do that? The reason is, at the hearing it was said that while a \nthird of the drugs that are administered to children have had been \ntested for use in children, probably we need two-thirds of the drugs \nthat are ready for adults to have that sort of testing. In other words, \nwe are about halfway where we want to go if we want to have drugs that \nare tested to see what their effect will be on children.\n  So my question was, if giving 6 months' incentive has gotten us \nhalfway where we want to go, then maybe to get all the way where we \nwant to go, we should go to a 7 months' or 8 months' incentive. But my \nfeeling at the end of the hearing was, well, the existing law has \nworked well by providing an incentive of 6 months. Let's leave it like \nit is. The end result of the legislation that is on the floor is not to\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\nleave it like it is but to change it, to reduce it from 6 months to 3 \nmonths, which is exactly backwards.\n  What the effect of this reduction will be is to reduce the \nopportunities for tests of drugs for children, which would fail to move \nus along toward the goal of having two-thirds of drugs studied for use \nin children.\n  I applaud Senator Dodd. I give him great credit for this. When he \nretires from the Senate in another 30 years, this will be one great \nfeather in his cap, as well as for Senator Clinton and others who have \nworked on this. But I would go back to what my mother said: ``Don't try \nto make a happy baby happy.'' Let's not try to make a happy piece of \nlegislation happy. Let's leave it the way it is. It has worked for 10 \nyears. Let's let it work for another 5 years the way it is. Adopting \nthe Allard amendment would keep it the way it is.\n  I have one suggestion for Senators Kennedy and Enzi, if I may. Maybe \nthey would want to consider it as part of the managers' amendment. We \nheard testimony at our hearing that perhaps our goal should be someday \nto get two-thirds or three-fourths of the drugs that are for adults \nstudied for use in children. Today it is one-third. I think it would be \nuseful for us at a future time to know exactly what our goal ought to \nbe. Maybe it ought to be 90 percent. Maybe it ought to be 50 percent. \nBut I wanted to suggest to the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nSenator from Connecticut that we might want to include in this \nlegislation asking the FDA or the appropriate agency to study what \npercent of drugs approved for adults should also be tested for \nchildren, what is that proper goal, so that the next time this issue \ncomes up we have some informed judgment about it. A quick review of the \nmedical literature shows there hasn't been any such study. I could be \ncorrected if there has been. If there hasn't been, I suggest we make \nthat a part of the legislation. I make that simply by suggestion, not \namendment. I intend to vote for the Allard amendment, and I have stated \nthe reasons why. If we have a happy piece of legislation, let's keep it \nhappy. That will do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 990\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to change the subject for a moment, \nif I may. The overall subject is the same; that is, the legislation \nthat is before us. I salute Senators Kennedy and Enzi and their staffs \nfor providing an excellent piece of legislation. It was not an easy \nthing to do on a difficult subject. I thank them for their efforts and \nfor getting us to this point.\n  Yesterday evening, our colleagues and friends, Senators Dorgan and \nSnowe, filed an amendment to S. 1082 that would allow for reimportation \nof prescription drugs from Canada and from certain other countries. In \nprevious years, a number of us, including me, supported reimportation \nlegislation, so long as the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ncertifies that the reimportation of prescription drugs can be done both \nsafely and cost-effectively.\n  Earlier this morning Senator Cochran filed a second-degree amendment \nto the Dorgan-Snowe legislation that seeks to require that \ncertification in the context of this legislation that is before us \ntoday. Senator Cochran's amendment would require the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to certify that the provisions within the \nDorgan-Snowe reimportation program would pose no additional risk to the \npublic's health and safety.\n  In addition, the Cochran amendment would require the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to certify that this reimportation program \nwould result in a significant reduction in the cost of prescription \ndrugs to the American consumer. So there are two goals. These few lines \nthat Senator Cochran just introduced were passed by unanimous consent 4 \nyears ago in 2003. In 2002, this language passed the Senate by a vote \nof 99 to nothing. It is clear, at least to me, from these past votes \nthat this is not the first time the Senate has taken up this issue and, \nagain, with some consensus.\n\n  Since the last time reimportation was before this body, Senators \nDorgan and Snowe have worked hard to address many of the safety \nconcerns folks had raised in previous iterations. I commend both of \nthem and their staffs for working diligently to try to address a number \nof these concerns. I believe they have made significant progress. For \ninstance, concerns were voiced earlier that the FDA would not have \nenough funds to operate a reimportation program. To provide the FDA \nwith additional resources, the revised Dorgan-Snowe proposal would \nincrease user fees paid by those drug wholesalers and pharmacies \nparticipating in the program from 1 percent to 2.5 percent of the total \nprice of the drugs that are reimported. This moves us closer to \nensuring that FDA will have the resources they need to operate this \nprogram effectively.\n  Senators Dorgan and Snowe's new legislation would also allow the FDA \nmore time to phase in the number of drug exporters and importers that \nwant to participate in the program. A slower phase-in would give the \nFDA more time to ensure that the importers and exporters are aboveboard \nand should help alleviate concerns that we would unknowingly allow \nunscrupulous vendors into this reimportation program.\n  Although Senators Dorgan and Snowe address a number of the drug \nsafety concerns, I believe a couple of possible shortfalls remain, \nespecially when it comes to stopping the proliferation of counterfeit, \nadulterated drugs. Specifically, this legislation relies on what are \ncalled paper pedigrees to show a drug's chain of custody, but there is \nno guarantee that these paper pedigrees could not be forged to hide \npossible counterfeiting, possibly leaving American consumers with a \nless safe drug supply. Moreover, this bill relies on what some believe \nare unproven and untested anticounterfeiting technologies to guarantee \ndrug safety. While I give credit to my friends for trying hard to build \nsafety into the proposal, it is not yet clear that anticounterfeit \ntechnologies, which the proposal relies so heavily upon, is yet at the \npoint of being both widely available and, more importantly, cost \neffective.\n  In addition, it is unclear to me if this reimportation program would \ngive the FDA the authority to conduct inspections of foreign \nmanufacturing plants. It is unclear to me whether the countries \npermitted under this bill to export drugs into the United States have \nthe same kind of safety and quality control standards that we enjoy at \nhome.\n  In the end, drug reimportation will only work if we are able to \nensure that the drugs we import are as safe as those manufactured and \nsold in the United States. If the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, the person who directly overseas the FDA to ensure the \npublic's health and safety, is not prepared to certify that the \nimportation is safe, then that gives me pause, and I believe it should \ngive us pause. We don't have a reimportation program operating right \nnow, but the incidence of drug counterfeiting and adulterated drugs \nstill exists. In the last few years, prescription drugs that contained \nbogus or dangerous ingredients as well as actual drugs that were \ndeceptively labeled to hide their origin have made their way into the \nUnited States. For example, 4 years ago, counterfeits of the \ncholesterol drug Lipitor were found in the United States and made their \nway to a number of American consumers. Recently, FDA warned consumers \nabout counterfeit drugs from multiple Internet sellers.\n  Many would argue that the FDA already has its hands full. If that is \ntrue, how do we in good faith add another layer of complexity such as \nreimportation to an already overburdened and underresourced system \nwithout also demanding that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ncertify that reimported drugs are safe for American consumption.\n  Similar to most of my colleagues, I am not opposed to reimportation, \nbut I do firmly believe that despite the very real progress that has \nbeen made with respect to the earlier Dorgan-Snowe proposal, some \nuncertainties remain in the revised legislation they offered yesterday. \nBecause of those remaining concerns, I support the Cochran amendment \nand ask my colleagues to do the same.\n  Similar to some of my colleagues, I have held in my hands medicines \nthat appear to be the same as the prescription medicines manufactured \nin this\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\ncountry. They were the same size, same shape, same color. They have the \nsame markings. The wrapping and the materials they come in are the \nsame. They appear to be, for all intents and purposes, the same \nlegitimate prescription medicines. They were not. In some cases, they \ncontained materials that were unsafe, and in other cases they contained \nmaterials that were not helpful to the person suffering from a \nparticular malady. I would like to say that those concerns for that \nkind of behavior have gone away. They haven't. The profit motives for \nthose who would like to sell bogus drugs, counterfeit drugs, the \neconomic attraction of doing that is enormous. As a result, I think we \nneed to proceed with caution.\n  I again commend Senators Dorgan and Snowe. They are trying hard. \nTheir staffs are trying hard to get us to the point where the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services can actually certify that we can reimport \nthese drugs in a way that is safe and cost effective. We will be voting \nlater today to determine whether we have gotten that far. The Cochran \namendment made sense before, and I think it still makes sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Members and the \ngreatest convenience, we will vote on the Allard amendment at 12:25. \nWhat I would like to do is propose a consent agreement that we vote at \nthat time. I know the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from \nMichigan want to talk. We have 35 or 40 minutes. Probably Senator \nAllard and Senator Dodd would want to make a comment before we get to \nthe vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 12:25 the Senate vote in relation to \nthe Allard amendment 982 and that the time until then be for debate \nwith respect to the amendment, with the 40 minutes divided as 20 \nminutes being divided equally between Senator Allard and Senator Dodd \nand 20 minutes between the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from \nOklahoma; furthermore, that no amendments be in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1011\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be temporarily set aside and call up amendment No. \n1011 for the purposes of offering the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself, Mr. \n     Thune, Mr. Lott, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1011.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

First, Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his \nincredible leadership and work on this very important legislation, and \nSenator Enzi, as well, for his leadership and work and partnership with \nSenator Kennedy on this legislation. I also thank Senator Dodd for his \nyears of advocacy for children. I join with him in opposing the Allard \namendment, and believe Senator Dodd has given us the first step as to \nwhere we need to go in terms of more medicines being available for \nchildren. I thank him for all of his leadership.\n  Mr. President, I today am offering an amendment--a bipartisan \namendment, with Senator Thune, as well as Senator Lott and Senator \nBrown; we also have Senator Kohl joining us--to close a loophole that \nthe brandname pharmaceutical companies are using to prevent competition \nby delaying the entry of generic drugs.\n  Our amendment is based on the citizen petition provision that is \nincluded in a bill Senator Lott and I introduced last session and again \nthis session, but it has been greatly improved by contributions from \nSenator Brown. I particularly thank him for his hard work and \ncontributions to this amendment.\n  The citizen petition process is intended to allow citizens to raise \nlegitimate issues regarding drug products, and it is very important we \nhave that. However, the brandname pharmaceutical companies have \nincreasingly used citizen petitions to delay access to safe, effective, \nand affordable generic drugs.\n  Simply put, citizen petitions have become PhRMA petitions to block \nconsumers from having access to affordable medicines, unfortunately. \nThe cost to employers, consumers, health insurance plans, and \nGovernment health plans, as a result of delayed entry of generics, \namounts to hundreds of millions of dollars--and in some cases billions \nof dollars.\n  For that reason, our amendment has the support of a very broad range \nof consumer groups, business groups, labor, pharmacy, and other \norganizations, including the AARP, the chain drugstores, General \nMotors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler, the AFL-CIO, the Alliance for Retired \nAmericans, CalPERS, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare, Families USA, the Pharmaceutical Care Management \nAssociation, the UAW, and the Coalition for a Competitive \nPharmaceutical Market, which is a broad coalition of our employers and \ninsurers across the country.\n  What would our amendment do? Our amendment would, first, preserve the \nright to file citizen petitions and raise legitimate safety issues. \nThis is very important. We do nothing to take away the citizen \npetition. It would reduce the filings, though, of frivolous citizen \npetitions, and it would stop frivolous petitions from delaying generic \nentry--and thus costing businesses, consumers, and taxpayers--by \nallowing needed competition to bring down prices in the pharmaceutical \nmarket.\n  It would do so by, first, requiring the generic approval process to \nmove forward while a petition is considered, unless the petition has \nraised legitimate public health concerns about the drug.\n  Second, it would require that final action on a petition be taken \nwithin 6 months of the petition being received.\n  Third, it would require petitions to be signed and include a \nverification that the petitioner has taken reasonable steps to ensure \nall relevant information is included in the petition and whether any \npayments have been made in exchange for filing the petition. This is \nvery important.\n  And, fourth, it would ensure transparency surrounding FDA's decisions \non whether to delay generic drugs on the basis of a citizen petition.\n  Our amendment improves upon the language in the Stabenow-Lott bill in \nthat it sets timelines for FDA to evaluate petitions and absolutely \nensures that if it is a legitimate public safety issue, then medicines \nwill not be approved unless and until the safety issues are resolved.\n  Why do we need this amendment? Any person or organization can file a \ncitizen petition with the FDA raising concern. We certainly want people \nto be able to do that. However, the process right now is being used in \nways that are unintended.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act closed a lot of loopholes that the \nbrandname companies were using to delay generics from going into the \nmarketplace. So, unfortunately, they have looked to another tool. They \nare now using these frivolous citizen petitions.\n  Between passage of the Medicare Modernization Act and April 30, 2006, \nbrandname companies filed 45 citizen petitions requesting that the FDA \ndelay approval of a competing generic drug. Of the 45 petitions, the \nFDA has ruled on 25 of them. Of the 25 petitions, 92 percent of them \nwere denied.\n  The brandname companies often file these petitions right on the eve \nof the generic drug being approved, making it very clear that delay is \nthe goal. These are ``11th hour'' petitions, as they have been called, \nand 12 of those ``11th hour'' petitions--12 of them--were denied in \nwhole and 1 in part by the FDA.\n  What do the petitions ask for? Do they raise new and important \nissues? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Although the petitions are \nfiled before or after a generic drug has received tentative approval \nfrom the FDA, they commonly simply request additional studies or \nadditional data, based on mere speculation by the brand companies.\n  The FDA typically will not approve a generic drug until all the \nunderlying issues of a citizen petition have been addressed. As a \nresult, although the FDA regulators provide that citizen petitions \nshould be addressed within 6 months--and that is what our amendment \nsays--the average review time is 10 months. And 10 months means lots of \nlost dollars. It leaves consumers paying more, businesses paying more, \nand insurers paying more.\n  The fact is the vast majority of petitions filed by brand companies \nhave nothing to do with science and everything to do with delaying \ngeneric drugs, stopping the competition. Consumers lose as a result of \nthat.\n  In December 2005, Merrill Lynch released a report analyzing brand \ncompany use of the FDA citizen petition processes. The analysis \ninvolved a review of citizen petitions filed by brand companies since \n2001. They said there was a ``sharp uptick'' in the number of citizen \npetitions filed by brand companies in 2004 and 2005 and,\n\n       In many instances, the filing of [these citizen petitions] \n     by branded companies coincided with the expiration of a \n     product's patent (or other marketing exclusivity) effectively \n     delaying generic competition for months and sometimes \n     years.\n\n  Why is this important? Well, I want to give you a few examples.\n  Flonase is a drug that is used to treat nasal symptoms and allergies. \nIt is a very commonly used drug. In this case, the brand company filed \nmultiple citizen petitions in an effort to delay the generic \ncompetition, a lower priced drug, from going on the market. All three \ncitizen petitions were denied.\n  According to the FDA:\n\n       [The brand company] has not articulated sound public policy \n     grounds for supporting a stay. In addition, [the brand name \n     company] has not demonstrated that the delay resulting from \n     the stay is not outweighed by public health and other public \n     interests.\n\n  In other words, no sound public policy, but, unfortunately, the delay \ntook months to resolve.\n  The following quote from Gary Buehler, Director of the Office of \nGeneric Drugs at FDA, was reported in\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\nthe New York Times on February 23, 2006:\n\n       The agency was required to consider the petitions and to \n     write responses. That took time and delayed the approval \n     [process].\n\n  So what happened? Even though all of these petitions were denied by \nthe FDA, it took so much time, and generic entry was delayed by 656 \ndays, and the brand company was able to get $1.65 billion more in \nsales.\n  We see with all of these drugs shown on this chart delays that have, \nin fact, allowed the brandname company to be able to continue sales. \nUnfortunately, these higher costs are paid by our seniors, consumers, \nand businesses that offer medication, as well as by insurers \nthemselves.\n  We have not only large delays, but even in the case of 5 days, $17 \nmillion more in sales. So there is great incentive to use delaying \ntactics in order to be able to continue this process.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is up. Let me say this amendment was \ncarefully constructed to allow citizen petitions to continue. The \noverwhelming evidence from the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of \nInspector General, as well as the FDA, and others--the overwhelming \nevidence is we are seeing this as a new loophole that is being used to \ndelay effective competition and lower cost medicine from going into the \nmarketplace. We can fix that and keep the citizen petition for \nlegitimate issues. We certainly want that. We certainly are concerned \nabout safety, as is the FDA. But it is time to close this loophole.\n  I thank my colleagues who are cosponsoring this amendment and urge \nsupport for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 982\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a minute in support of \nSenator Allard's amendment. I also want to recognize Senator Dodd's \nwork, and I believe he truly cares about us getting pharmaceuticals to \nchildren. But I think the bill as written today has some very great \nrisks for our children.\n  I practice medicine. I can remember 25 years ago, for so many of the \ndrugs, we did not know what we were doing as they related to children. \nWe had sometimes great outcomes and sometimes poor outcomes as to the \navailability and knowledge of pharmaceuticals for children.\n  We have a system that started 10 years ago that has been highly \nsuccessful. Mr. President, 144 drugs have now been studied in kids. We \nknow what we are doing with 144 drugs. With 25 of those drugs, we now \nknow not to use them for children.\n  How did we get there? We created an incentive that said: We will give \nyou a 6-month patent extension if you will study pediatric indications \nand do a study on pediatric patients for this drug. It worked. As a \nmatter of fact, it worked great.\n  Now, I am having trouble understanding, as a physician, the therapy \nSenator Dodd wants to put on this. He is back to practicing medicine \nthe way we did pediatrics 25 years ago with his amendment. I certainly \nhope he is right if he wins because there are going to be a lot of \nchildren in trouble if he is not.\n  What his amendment actually says is, if you made $1 billion off a \ndrug, you only get a 3-month extension. I can see how we could look and \nsay they are making too much money. But only 1 out of every 10 drugs we \nstudied in pediatrics was a blockbuster drug. So what is happening with \nthese high-profile drugs they are making a lot of money off of is they \nare the things that are funding the other 130 studies of drugs that are \nnot blockbusters, that are not profitable.\n  So what Senator Dodd has put in this bill--and I know it is well-\nmeaning--is to limit that profitability, hoping drugs will become more \nreasonable, and gambling--a very risky gamble--that the research on \npediatric drugs will continue with that 3-month extension.\n  He may be right. But as someone who cares for kids in my own \npractice, I am not willing to take that gamble. I am not willing to \nsay: What if he is wrong? What if the studies go from 144 to 15?\n  Now that we are seeing all these new drugs coming out, we are not \ngoing to have a study for kids? We are going to take away opportunities \nfor young children to have the benefits of a new drug because they are \nnot studied? Or we are going to use the drugs anyhow, even though they \nare not indicated and we do not know what we are doing, in a hope--not \nin a knowledgeable, scientific way but in a hope we are doing some \ngood?\n  We have a system that has worked very well. Senator Dodd was \nsupportive of that system. I do not know that he is right. He could be \nright. But the question will be: What if he is wrong? What if the next \n100 drugs that come out for maladies that could have an application for \nchildren--especially some very small used drugs, specialty drugs for \nchemotherapy, and have a very low incidence of usage in kids--what if \nthey are not available? What if they are not made available? How many \nchildren are not going to get that drug? Now the system is paying for \n90 percent of the studies on drugs that aren't the blockbusters, and we \nare going to cut the incentive in half. It may work. I don't know where \nthe knowledge is, the scientific inquiry, or the study that says that \ngoing from 6 months to 3 months is the right amount. What about 2 \nmonths? What about 1 month? What about 5 months? We don't know. So what \nare we going to do? We are now going to go back and practice on \npediatric drug studies the way we used to practice on children. We are \ngoing to guess.\n\n  What the Allard amendment says is: We are not real happy there is \nthis amount of tremendous profit, but we do understand that the profit \noff the blockbuster drugs is actually paying for 90 percent of the \nstudies on nonblockbuster drugs for kids, that we are going to take \naway that incentive. It is really comforting as a physician to know now \nwhat I didn't know before in terms of giving a kid a medicine and \nknowing how it is going to be metabolized, knowing its half-life, \nknowing it is different in a child and being able to dose it correctly, \nand confidently saying to a parent: I have given you something that is \ngoing to fix your child, that is going to cure this illness, and I know \nyou are not going to have a side effect from it.\n  What we have done has worked. Why would we mess with it unless we \nknow? I have listened to this debate. I don't see anybody telling me \nhow we know we are not going to disincentivize further drug studies. If \nsomebody can show me that, then I will be happy to vote against the \nAllard amendment. But there is not anybody who can show me \nscientifically that we are going to have another 144 drugs studied if \nwe cut this in half. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. I can't see into \nthe future, but I am cautious enough to know I love the progress we \nhave made.\n  If we change this, if we change it--and it sounds as if, from the \ndebate here, the Allard amendment isn't going to be approved--we better \ndarn sure know what we are doing, and we better darn sure say that \ntaking money away from drug companies in terms of extending patents is \nnot going to have a negative impact in terms of positive benefits.\n  I am not the greatest defender of the drug companies. I authored the \nfirst bill that was signed by President Clinton which allowed \nreimportation of drugs into this country. Why did I do it? I think we \nneed to have a worldwide market on pharmaceuticals. We don't. We have a \ncontrolled market everywhere except in this country. The American \ntaxpayers end up subsidizing the research and subsidizing the profits. \nBut I also recognize that some of these drugs' profits are the very \nthings that allow me to now give comfort to a mother and a father when \nthey have a very sick child.\n  I hope Senator Dodd has the wisdom to know that he has done it just \nright and that there is not going to be one cancer chemotherapeutic \nagent that wasn't studied in children because it is not a blockbuster \ndrug, and now that we are going to cut it to 3 months, that there will \nstill be an incentive to make sure that the next child with a sarcoma \nor the next child with an aplastic anemia or the next child with a \nleukemia that is resistant to bone marrow transplant or anything else \nis going to be able to have the medicine.\n  We are going to go back to the way we practiced medicine 10 or 12 \nyears ago. We are not going to know, and we are going to shoot from the \nhip and pray and hope. What we have today is we don't have to pray and \nhope anymore. We now have the studies.\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\n  I don't know the answer to it, and I am not saying Senator Dodd is \nwrong, but I think a legitimate question to ask is, What if he is \nwrong? What if he is wrong? How many children aren't going to have \ndrugs? How many children are going to have a drug complication? How \nmany children are going to have a drug interaction? How many children's \nlives aren't going to be saved because we decided the drug companies \nare making too much money and we are going to tell them how much they \nshould make?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to divide my 10 \nminutes, and I would like to spend a few minutes on another part of the \nbill, the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for including this bill \nwhich I authored in the underlying legislation.\n  The pediatric medical devices provision of the underlying bill is not \nsubject to an amendment, but I want my colleagues to know what we have \ndone with this provision, which is a complementary piece of legislation \ndealing with a similar set of issues as under the Best Pharmaceuticals \nfor Children Act. That is, ensuring that medical devices used in \nchildren are safe and designed specifically for children. One of the \nfundamental hurdles with respect to children is that the market for \nproducts designed for them is relatively small. However, I believe the \nproposals in the underlying bill will make a huge difference in the \nlives of children.\n  This initiative provides a very comprehensive approach to ensuring \nthat children are not left behind as cutting-edge research and \nrevolutionary technologies for medical devices advance.\n  Like drugs, where for too long children were treated like small \nadults and were just given reduced dosages, many essential medical \ndevices used by pediatricians are not designed or sized for children, \nand that has been the case for many years. Pediatric providers have had \nto resort to jury-rigging or fashioning makeshift device solutions for \npediatric use. When that is not an option, providers may be forced to \nuse more invasive treatments or less effective therapies. This \nlegislation addresses the need to promote pediatric device development \nby providing incentives to manufacturers while at the same time \nequipping the Food and Drug Administration with appropriate authority \nto monitor and ensure the postmarket safety of medical devices used \nsignificantly in children.\n\n  One such example which highlights the need for this legislation is a \ndevice known as the Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib, a \ndevice invented, developed, and brought to market by Dr. Robert \nCampbell, Professor of Orthopaedics at the University of Texas Health \nScience Center. Dr. Campbell appeared before the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee in late March and testified about the \narduous 14 years it took to bring the titanium rib to market. Dr. \nRobert Campbell made remarkable breakthroughs with this technology but \nthe hurdles he faced were, at times, seemingly insurmountable.\n  I want to put up a photograph of a boy named Devin Alvarez, of \nHialeah Gardens, Florida, which shows the remarkable difference this \ndevice has made for him. Devin was born with six ribs missing and a \nvery small left lung and kidney. At birth, the doctors did not believe \nhe was going to survive his first night. In May 2002, Devin underwent \ntitanium rib implant surgery and the curve of his spine was reduced to \n45 degrees. Devin stood straight for the first time in his life and, at \npresent, Devin is a very typical 9-year-old boy who enjoys playing \nsports such as golf and baseball.\n  Again, remarkable ideas for pediatric medical devices happen \nregularly, but the incentives to transform ideas into new FDA-approved \ndevices simply don't exist. So the motivation for the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act legislation 10 years ago dealing with \npharmaceutical products for children is the same motivation behind this \nlegislation--to encourage the medical device industry to develop and to \nengage in the kind of research to allow these technologies to emerge.\n  In describing the pediatric medical devices bill which is now \nincluded in this legislation, Dr. Campbell, who has been so \ninstrumental in all of this, said:\n\n       This bill represents an historic step forward for \n     children's medical and surgical devices similar to those \n     steps taken on drugs. It will help future medical inventors \n     of pediatric devices to avoid my mistakes and my frustrations \n     so that they can get their devices ``off the napkin,'' if you \n     will, and into the pediatric patients who need them, in a \n     safe and timely fashion.\n\n  I thank my colleagues from Massachusetts and Wyoming for working hard \nto make sure this will be a part of the underlying bill. I am grateful \nto them. It is my understanding that concerns have been raised by some \nin the medical device industry regarding a particular provision of the \nbill related to equipping the Food and Drug Administration with \nauthority to ensure the safety of medical devices in children once they \nare already on the market.\n  The provisions in the bill mirror the recommendations made by the \nInstitute of Medicine in its 2005 report on pediatric medical device \nsafety. The Institute of Medicine found serious flaws in the current \npostmarket safety surveillance of these devices and the provisions in \nmy bill correct those serious flaws. I am disheartened by those who \nwould attempt to deprive children and physicians with information that \npertains to device safety.\n  I think we have made some tremendous advances for children and their \nfamilies in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant material \nrelating to the medical device provision of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric\n\n\n                                              AIDS Foundation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the Elizabeth Glaser \n     Pediatric AIDS Foundation, I would 1ike to thank you for your \n     leadership in introducing the Pediatric Medical Device Safety \n     and Improvement Act of 2007 and offer our strong support for \n     this legislation, which will improve the health and we11-\n     being of children across the country.\n       This legislation will ensure that children enjoy the same \n     protections as adults do when using necessary medical \n     devices. Over the last few decades, countless innovative \n     medical device products have been developed as a result of \n     cutting-edge research and new technologies. As you know, \n     children are being left out of the equation. Many challenges \n     limit children's access to safe and effective medical \n     devices, including differences in size, weight, metabolism \n     rates, etc. With very few devices available for pediatric \n     use, pediatric providers must resort to fashioning make-shift \n     devices for their patients. Left with no alternative options, \n     providers may be forced to use older or less optimal \n     interventions, which can be less effective and could pose \n     greater risk.\n       The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of \n     2007 recognizes the urgency for greater development of \n     medical devices created with children's special needs in \n     mind. It provides a comprehensive approach to improving \n     children's access to medical devices and includes provisions \n     to assist innovators with technical and financial resources, \n     streamline the regulatory processes, elevate pediatric device \n     issues at the FDA and NIH, and improve incentives for devices \n     for small pediatric populations--while still preserving the \n     ability to ensure the safety of new products.\n       Thank you for your leadership and commitment to this issue. \n     We look forward to working closely with you to ensure that \n     children across the U.S. benefit from this important piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pamela W. Barnes,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    The Society for Cardiovascular\n\n\n                                Angiography and Interventions,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Education and Early Childhood \n         Development, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor \n         and Pensions, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd: I am writing to express our support for \n     passage of your Pediatric Medical Device Safety Act of 2007. \n     We greatly appreciate your efforts to expand pediatric \n     patients' access to safe medical devices. Your proposal will \n     be an important step forward.\n       The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and \n     Interventions is a professional association representing over \n     3,700 invasive and interventional cardiologists. SCAI \n     promotes excellence in cardiac catheterization, angiography, \n     and interventional cardiology through physician education and \n     representation, and quality initiatives to enhance patient \n     care.\n       Fortunately, cardiovascular disease is far less common in \n     the pediatric population\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\n     than it is in the adult population. This good fortune does \n     however frequently lead to unique challenges for the \n     pediatric interventional cardiologist who treats these \n     patients. Some of the challenges are clinical and we are more \n     frequently solving those problems, saving children's lives \n     and avoiding the trauma of surgery. Other challenges, and \n     perhaps the most frustrating ones are related to obtaining \n     the safe medical devices necessary to treat these patients. \n     Devices that are available to our colleagues in Europe are \n     not available in America. We support the FDA's efforts to \n     ensure that only safe and effective medical devices are used \n     on patients in our country, but when the entry barriers into \n     the American markets are so high that manufacturers refuse to \n     enter--some patients suffer and die needlessly. Required is \n     an appropriate balance between the sometimes mutually \n     exclusive goals of safety and availability.\n       We are especially pleased that your legislation will \n     require the FDA to issue guidance to institutional review \n     committees (IRCs) on how to appropriately consider the use of \n     the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) at their institution. \n     When HDE devices are not part of an ongoing trial, IRCs \n     (which focus on reviewing the care of patients in trials) are \n     sometimes confused.\n       We believe that giving the FDA explicit statutory authority \n     to extrapolate from adult to pediatric patients in \n     appropriate situations could help FDA officials expedite \n     their review of some pediatric medical devices.\n       We applaud the provision that allows companies to make a \n     profit on HDE devices designed for children. This change will \n     encourage the development of more devices by providing an \n     opportunity for profit and also by reducing concerns about \n     audits, specifically those using different assumptions which \n     could determine a profit was made when a manufacturer \n     calculated their financial situation differently. We note \n     that the 4,000 cap is arbitrary and far below the 200,000 \n     patient limit that is placed on orphan drugs. We believe that \n     more devices could be made available to pediatric patients \n     and those with congenital heart disease if that cap is \n     raised. We encourage you to consider such an increase either \n     as a part of this legislation or broader FDA reform \n     legislation.\n       We also understand that there are some concerns on the part \n     of industry about the section 522 provisions of this \n     proposal. As clinicians, we are not in a position to evaluate \n     the precise impact of those provisions but we certainly hope \n     those concerns can be resolved.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff to \n     support passage of this legislation and thank you once again \n     for your efforts. Our Senior Director for Advocacy and \n     Guidelines, Wayne Powell will be coordinating this effort for \n     the Society and he may be reached at (202) 375-6341 or \n     wpowell@scai.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Gregory J. Dehmer, M.D., FSCAI,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 28, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the 60,000 primary care \n     pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, and surgical \n     specialists of the American Academy of Pediatrics who are \n     committed to the attainment of optimal physical, mental and \n     social health and well-being for all infants, children, \n     adolescents, and young adults, we write today to express our \n     gratitude and support for the ``Pediatric Medical Devices'' \n     legislation. This legislation is an important step towards \n     improving the process for the development of needed pediatric \n     medical devices.\n       Children and adults often suffer from many of the same \n     diseases and conditions, however their medical device needs \n     vary considerably. Children are not just small adults and \n     medical device technologies manufactured for adults often do \n     not fit the needs of children. This problem forces \n     pediatricians to ``jury-rig'' adult medical devices that are \n     often too large, in order to make them fit smaller bodies. \n     This practice, however, is not always effective and leaves \n     children without optimal treatment. Additionally, children's \n     device needs vary considerably due, not only to size, but \n     also to different rates of growth, anatomy, physiological \n     differences and physical activity levels.\n       This legislation offers incentives to device manufactures \n     to create needed medical devices specifically designed to \n     meet the needs of pediatric patients and it gives the FDA the \n     authority to require post-market studies to ensure continued \n     efficacy and safety of these devices. The need for pediatric \n     medical devices to treat or diagnose diseases and conditions \n     affecting children is clear; it is essential that medical \n     devices be manufactured with children's needs in mind.\n       Thank you for your continued commitment to improving the \n     health and well-being of children. We look forward to working \n     with you as this important legislation moves through \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       American Pediatric Society.\n       Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs.\n       Society for Pediatric Research.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Stryker Corporation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2007.\n     Senator Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of Stryker Corporation \n     (``Stryker''), I am pleased to announce our support for your \n     legislation to improve the availability and safety of \n     pediatric medical devices--the Pediatric Medical Device \n     Safety and Improvement Act of 2007. Like you and your \n     colleagues, we want our children to have access to the \n     fullest and best range of possible medical treatments, even \n     if that means doing or inventing something new just for them.\n       We view this as our responsibility both as the leading \n     manufacturer of orthopaedic oncology prostheses in the United \n     States and as a global medical technology company with a \n     significant presence in other medical specialties, including \n     craniofacial deformities such as cleft lip and palate. We \n     take pride in partnering with and sponsoring a range of \n     medical organizations, including one which last year was able \n     to provide free cleft lip surgeries to 8,531 children in 23 \n     countries. The surgery took only about 45 minutes and cost \n     $750 per child, but the corrective surgery changed, in a \n     positive way, forevermore the lives of each and every child \n     and the lives of their families, too.\n       We sincerely appreciate your leadership role on children's \n     issues. We take very seriously not only our commitment to \n     children with cancer and craniofacial deformities but also \n     our responsibility to ensure that our devices are safe and \n     effective for use in pediatric patients.\n       As you may know, there has been significant progress over \n     the past two decades in the management of patients with \n     musculoskeletal cancers that has improved both the survival \n     rates and quality of life of afflicted individuals. Twenty \n     years ago, the standard treatment for any primary malignant \n     bone and soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity was amputation \n     of the affected arm or leg. Since that time, Stryker is proud \n     to have partnered with leading pediatric oncology surgeons to \n     develop limb-sparing, surgical solutions, including the \n     implantation of a growing prosthesis that can be elongated to \n     account for children's growth.\n       As with cancer, the treatment of craniofacial deformities \n     is an area in which Stryker has also significantly improved \n     and broadened its range of available medical products and \n     solutions. With continued innovation of new and improved \n     craniomaxillofacial technologies, Stryker hopes to continue \n     to transform the lives of children with craniofacial \n     deformities, such as craniosynostis and cleft lip and palate.\n       It is our hope that your legislation will further spur the \n     evolution of novel health care solutions for children. The \n     bill's efforts to streamline approvals for devices with \n     pediatric indications, improve incentives for the development \n     of devices for small pediatric populations, and encourage the \n     establishment of non-profit consortia for pediatric device \n     development should be commended.\n       Stryker stands ready to assist you in your drive to \n     stimulate the further development of child-centered medical \n     technologies while closely monitoring the safety of such \n     products after they have entered the market. Thank you again \n     for your leadership on this important issue, and we look \n     forward to working with you to advance your bill as medical \n     device reauthorization legislation moves forward in the 110th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Ed Rozynski,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Global Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Advanced Medical\n\n\n                                       Technology Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Education and Early Childhood \n         Development, Senate Committee on Health, Education, \n         Labor, & Pensions, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd: On behalf of the Advanced Medical \n     Technology Association (AdvaMed), I am writing in support of \n     the Pediatric Medical Device Safety Act of 2007. We \n     particularly appreciate your willingness to work together \n     with all stakeholders in the development of this legislation. \n     Your bill is an important step in ensuring expanded access to \n     medical devices for children.\n       As you may know, AdvaMed represents over 1,300 of the \n     world's leading medical technology innovators and \n     manufacturers of medical devices, diagnostic products and \n     medical information systems. Its member companies are devoted \n     to helping patients lead longer, healthier, and more \n     productive lives through the development of new lifesaving \n     and life-enhancing technologies.\n       AdvaMed fully supports the development of medical devices \n     for pediatric patients. Your bill goes a long way to \n     encourage the development of pediatric devices. As your \n     legislation is considered, AdvaMed would like to continue to \n     work with you to strengthen your legislation to enhance \n     development of and access to pediatric devices. For example, \n     we have a number of proposals to highlight existing FDA \n     regulatory tools that could improve the number of devices \n     cleared and approved for pediatric use. We also have \n     recommendations to improve the proposed pediatric \n     Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) and propose a \n     compassionate use provision for extremely small pediatric \n     populations to enhance your legislation.\n       Sec. 522 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (FFDCA) provides the FDA with broad authority to require \n     postmarket\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\n     surveillance for any product for which FDA has concerns. We \n     believe that the FDA's authority under Sec. 522 is sufficient \n     to cover pediatric patients. In fact, we are concerned that \n     the language in your bill may unintentionally reduce access \n     to medical devices for pediatric patients.\n       Finally, although we recognize and appreciate your efforts \n     to restrict the types of studies in your postmarket database \n     to only ``scientific'' studies, we believe the language in \n     your bill duplicates both the database that FDA is currently \n     working to establish and the clinical trial registry \n     legislation and legislation currently being contemplated by \n     the HELP Committee.\n       In closing, thank you once again for your work on ensuring \n     access to medical devices for children. We look forward to \n     working with you on these and other improvements to your \n     legislation as the bill moves through the Committee and the \n     Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stephen J. Ubl.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Respironics, Inc.,\n\n                                 Murrysville, PA, August 16, 2006.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: Respironics, Inc. is a global medical \n     device company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We are the \n     worldwide leader at anticipating needs and providing valued \n     solutions to the sleep and respiratory markets. We employ \n     approximately 4,700 employees and have annual sales in excess \n     of one billion dollars.\n       In our business, we often are called upon to work with \n     pediatric patients. Based on this work, it is clear that \n     changes are needed to facilitate an improvement in the \n     availability of diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices \n     for children.\n       Currently, a draft of a bill entitled ``To improve the \n     process for the development of needed pediatric medical \n     devices'' is being circulated among some Senators for \n     discussion. After reviewing this bill, Respironics believes \n     that the changes contemplated by this bill could help improve \n     the availability of medical devices for children. Therefore, \n     Respironics supports enactment of the bill.\n       We hope that you will join Respironics in supporting this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             David P. White, M.D.,\n     Chief Medical Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Breas Medical AB,\n\n                               Molnlycke, Sweden, August 17, 2006.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and DeWine: On behalf of Breas Medical, \n     I would like to thank you for your efforts to expand the \n     availability of medical devices for children. We appreciate \n     your long-standing leadership on behalf of children and \n     welcome your interest in ensuring that they are not left \n     behind when it comes to critical medical advances. Our \n     devices were developed in Europe and are available for home \n     use in the pediatric population there. We have partnered with \n     companies in the United States, including Sleep Services of \n     America, and now have FDA approval for device use in adults. \n     We are seeking approval for the use of our devices in \n     children where there is a great need.\n       While children and adults suffer from many of the same \n     diseases and conditions, their device needs can vary \n     considerably. Cutting-edge research and revolutionary \n     technologies have led to the development of many innovative \n     medical products, however, very few are designed specifically \n     for children. We support your efforts to address the barriers \n     to pediatric device development through legislation, \n     particularly in the following areas:\n       1. Improving the ability of the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) to track how many and what types of \n     devices are approved for children each year;\n       2. Streamlining pediatric device approvals by allowing the \n     extrapolation of adult data to support pediatric indications, \n     as appropriate;\n       3. Encouraging device manufacturers to create products for \n     conditions that affect small numbers of children by removing \n     existing restrictions on profit;\n       4. Improving federal support for pediatric device \n     development by creating a coordinated research agenda and \n     establishing a contact point at the National Institutes of \n     Health to help innovators access existing funding;\n       5. Improving pediatric device availability by establishing \n     demonstration grants to promote pediatric device development, \n     including connecting inventors and manufacturers, product \n     identification, prototype development, and testing; and\n       6. Improving post-market safety of pediatric devices by \n     allowing FDA to call for postmarket pediatric studies, \n     establishing a publicly accessible database of postmarket \n     studies, and giving FDA the ability to require studies longer \n     than 3 years if needed to answer longer-term pediatric \n     questions.\n       Thank you for your leadership and commitment to this issue. \n     We look forward to working closely with you toward passage of \n     legislation to improve children's access to medical devices.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ulf Jonsson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Seleon, Inc.,\n\n                                Baltimore, MD, September 23, 2006.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: On behalf of Seleon Inc., I want to \n     encourage you to continue your efforts to improve access to \n     medical therapies for children by introducing the bill, ``to \n     improve the process for the development of needed pediatric \n     medical devices'' this fall.\n       Seleon Inc., a medical device manufacturing company, \n     strongly supports this bill. Thank you for your ongoing \n     support of children's health and this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Michael Lauk, Ph.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric\n\n\n                                             AIDS, Foundation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Dodd and Clinton: As \n     organizations working to ensure better health care for the \n     nation's children, we write to thank you for your long-\n     standing commitment to children's health and to express our \n     support for legislation to reauthorize the Best \n     Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric \n     Research Equity Act (PREA) and to improve children's access \n     to safe medical devices. We are very pleased that BPCA and \n     PREA reauthorization language and S. 830, the Pediatric \n     Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act, have been included \n     in the Chairman's mark of S. 1082, the ``Food and Drug \n     Administration Revitalization Act,'' for consideration by the \n     Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n     tomorrow.\n       Over the past decade, Congress has enacted bipartisan \n     legislation that has dramatically increased the number of \n     drugs tested and labeled for children. The results from BPCA \n     are extraordinary--over 336 requests have been generated for \n     over 780 pediatric studies, resulting in over 115 new drug \n     labels for children. Senator Dodd's BPCA reauthorization \n     language strengthens this very successful existing program in \n     several important ways, including ensuring prompt label \n     changes, requiring that all study protocols and results be \n     made public, improving adverse events reporting for children, \n     and identifying and addressing important gaps in treatments \n     for children's diseases. In addition, the BPCA language \n     includes a reasoned approach to address the small percentage \n     of drugs for which the exclusivity provision has far exceeded \n     the incentive it was intended to provide pharmaceutical \n     companies.\n       S. 993, the Pediatric Research Improvement Act (PRIA), \n     introduced by Senator Clinton and included in the Chairman's \n     mark, reauthorizes the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 \n     (PREA), which requires drug manufacturers to test their \n     products for use in children. This law ensures that children \n     are not a therapeutic afterthought and has generated \n     impressive and invaluable safety and dosing information for \n     children. Since the 2003 passage of PREA, 55 drugs have new \n     or improved pediatric labeling. These drugs range from \n     treatment of ear infections to the prevention of rejection of \n     organ transplants. S. 993 places children on equal \n     therapeutic footing with adults by creating the \n     presumption that medicines coming onto the market for \n     illnesses and conditions that occur in children will be \n     labeled for pediatric use and be available in formulations \n     (e.g., liquids, chewable tablets) that children can take.\n       The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of \n     2007 provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring that \n     children are not left behind as cutting-edge research and \n     revolutionary technologies for medical devices advance. Like \n     drugs, where for too long children were treated like small \n     adults, many essential medical devices used extensively by \n     pediatricians are not designed or sized for children. \n     According to pediatricians, the development of new medical \n     devices suitable for children's smaller and growing bodies \n     can lag 5-10 years behind those for adults. S. 830 improves \n     incentives for devices for small markets--while still \n     preserving the ability to ensure the safety of new products \n     once on the market. It provides assistance to innovators, \n     streamlines regulatory processes and elevates pediatric \n     device issues at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and \n     the National Institutes of Health.\n       Despite our support for the Chairman's mark, we are \n     disappointed that a key provision to make PRIA permanent has \n     been omitted. As this legislation moves to the floor of the \n     Senate, we urge you to restore the permanent authority of the \n     FDA to ensure that children have properly studied medications \n     as a matter of fact, not chance.\n       We are grateful for your long-standing leadership and \n     commitment to improving the health of our nation's children \n     and look forward to working with you toward swift\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\n     Committee action and passage of these pediatric therapeutic \n     bills by the full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.\n       AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth & Families.\n       American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Brain Coalition.\n       American Pediatric Society.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Thoracic Society.\n       Arthritis Foundation.\n       Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs.\n       Children's Cause for Cancer Advocacy.\n       National Association of Children's Hospitals (N.A.C.H.).\n       National Organization for Rare Disorders.\n       National Research Center for Women and Families.\n       Society for Pediatric Research.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me go back, if I can, to my proposal on \nthe Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the objections raised by \nmy colleague from Colorado to it. Just for the record and so we \nunderstand what we are talking about, according to a study recently \npublished in the Journal of the American Medical Association that \nlooked at the costs and benefits of these pediatric trials. It showed \nthat the overwhelming majority of drugs studied under this incentive \nprogram are not blockbusters.\n  In fact, the study found that less than 20 percent were. That leaves \n80 percent of drugs completely unaffected by the underlying bill which \nthe Allard amendment seeks to amend. To be clear, the proposal in the \nunderlying bill that would adjust exclusivity from 6 months to 3 months \naffects less than about 20 percent of drugs studied under this program. \nUsing data from this recent study, 80 percent of drugs studied under \nBPCA--those which do not fall into the blockbuster category--the 6 \nmonths' exclusivity would remain unchanged. It doesn't change that at \nall; only in cases where there has been over $1 billion in prior year \ndrug sales will the underlying bill change the exclusivity to 3 months.\n  This is to strike a balance. Obviously, I feel very strongly, having \nauthored this legislation, about ensuring that appropriate clinical \ntrials occur to protect children's health. Our notion was, when we \nwrote the legislation 10 years ago, that the 6 months of exclusivity \nwould be the carrot that would incentivize the industry to go forward. \nThere were some concerns expressed at the time that 6 months wasn't \ngoing to be anywhere near enough and that we would need more \nexclusivity. Some in the industry suggested a year or even 3 years of \nexclusivity. We settled on 6 months as the appropriate balance at the \ntime.\n  What happened, of course, is we had this wonderful explosion of work \nthat occurred. It resulted in nearly 800 clinical trials involving more \nthan 45,000 children, with new pediatric labeling information on more \nthan 119 drugs where previously there was none. I recall the debate on \nthis program ten years ago very well, the industry said: Six months is \nnever going to be enough; none of us will step up to the plate on this. \nAnd they really argued very strenuously for something longer than the 6 \nmonths. In fact, the 6 months has worked well, and almost all requests \nissued to drug companies to conduct pediatric trials under this program \nhave been accepted.\n  What I have had growing concern about is the 20 percent of drugs \nreceiving exclusivity where the profit realized as far exceeded the \ncarrot intended to provide to drug companies. So to strike that balance \nbetween the cost to taxpayers and the benefits to children, we are \nsaying that where sales of a drug being studied under this program \nexceed $1 billion in prior years, the company can get 3 months' \nexclusivity.\n  I don't know what the right answer will be on this issue. Neither me \nnor my colleague from Oklahoma can say with absolute certainty. But I \nrecall the debate 10 years ago when many said 6 months will never be \nenough. Six months has done very well by the industry, as it turned \nout.\n  So by striking this balance and having the sunset provision which I \nstrongly support in this legislation--and I have from the beginning--it \nwill allow us to review periodically how we are doing with all of this.\n  There is an increase in Federal spending of $50 million over 10 years \nas a result of the Allard amendment. I can't invoke a point of order \nbecause the impact on federal spending is outside our current budget \nwindow, but the Allard amendment comes with a $50 million pricetag to \ntaxpayers.\n  I believe this program is working well. We think by adjusting the \nlength of exclusivity from 6 months to 3 months for a limited number of \ndrugs, we are striking the right balance. The 5-year sunset will give \nus a chance to assess the program again and make a judgment: How are we \ndoing here? Are we getting more or less of what we thought we would in \nthe process? At that time, we will make a judgment again as to how we \nought to go forward.\n  It is not easy to strike these balances. I know my colleagues who \nhave engaged in these debates, try to come up with answers that will \nsatisfy the various elements and concerns various Members have. That is \nwhat Mike DeWine and I did 10 years ago and why I had such a good \npartner in this where we struck that balance. Mike was under a lot of \npressure to have a lot more than 6 months of exclusivity. I was under \npressure in saying: Why do we give them any exclusivity? So we \ncompromised on 6 months to see what happened. We got great results.\n  I would love to predict with absolute certainty that what we craft \nhere will produce those same results. I can't say that absolutely. But \nbased on the analyses of others who have looked at this, their \nconclusion is this is a pretty healthy balance between consumer \ninterests, taxpayer interests, and the needs of children. We will see \nwhat happens over the next 4 or 5 years as to whether this is \ncontinuing to produce the desired results. I believe it will. I think \nwe will get that.\n  Here again, based on recent data, under my proposal, 80 percent of \ndrugs studied under this program will see no change in the exclusivity \naward of 6 months. Again, for the 20 percent of drugs in the \nblockbuster category, they can receive 3 months of exclusivity. I still \nbelieve many will go forward, given that incentive.\n  So respectfully I say to my friend from Colorado--we serve on two \ncommittees together and we work well together on a lot of issues here. \nI respect him immensely. I do not question at all his motivations in \noffering this amendment. This disagreement is over the impact of his \nlanguage versus the language I have crafted in this legislation as part \nof the committee print.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject the Allard amendment and to stick \nwhat with what we put together in the underlying bill. It is a good \nbalance between taxpayer interests, consumer interests, and the \ninterests of children and their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I understand I have 10 minutes allocated to me. I would \nlike to take 4 minutes and allocate those to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me say, as Senator Dodd finishes, that \nnobody has worked more tirelessly than he on behalf of children's \nhealth and specifically as it relates to prescription drugs. He did \nlist a long list of people, including taxpayers and so forth.\n  This is about children, plain and simple. It is one group. It is our \nchildren, this country's kids. In 1997, I authored what became the Food \nand Drug Cosmetic Modernization Act. Prior to that, there weren't any \nclinical studies done for pediatric purposes. It was on the heels of \nthat that Senator Dodd and others created the exclusivity--exclusivity \nthat Senator Allard is not changing. What we are changing is in the \nbase bill and going from 6 to 3 months.\n  The reality is that, prior to the enactment, we didn't have companies \nthat were studying the right dosages, what side effects there were, and \nwhether it was effective in children. Sure, we had it for adults but \nnot for kids. We have made tremendous progress. Under this pediatric \nexclusivity, though, we would cap it at 3 months. Companies that \nexceeded a dollar value--we pulled this out of the sky. Why $1 billion \nand not $2 billion? If it was $2 billion, why not $4 billion? Why not \n$100,000? The reality is that none of us knows. There is no expert\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\nwho can tell us what is the right amount of incentive needed for a \ncompany to go through the types of trials to get these indications for \nkids. Why? Because every drug is different, and, more importantly, \nevery child is different. So if we are going to err, I suggest that we \nerr on the side of what has worked. Eighty-seven percent of all \npediatric drugs have pediatric indications. It has been the carrot of 6 \nmonths.\n  Members will come to the floor and vote for or against the Allard \namendment. I believe it is crucial that if we err, we err on the side \nof what already has worked and what continues to work. If Senator Dodd \nprevails, I hope he is right. I hope he is right because we won't know, \nuntil this bill sunsets, whether in fact the incentive wasn't great \nenough for companies to go through this process to find out the \nindications for children.\n  The people who will suffer because of our willingness to arbitrarily \nchange will be the kids. That is the same group I started with--the \nones we should be solely focused on. It was the kids when this was \ncreated 10 years ago; it should be the kids today. If we are going to \nerr, let's err on the side of the kids and not use this as a way to \npotentially alter the profitability of an industry or a given company. \nLet's make sure that the true beneficiary of the work of this body is \nin fact the children of this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado for yielding me the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in recognizing the \nfine work that Senator Dodd has done in the area of children and \nchildren's health. He recognized one decade ago how important it was to \nhave incentives in place for drug companies to properly label drugs so \nthey are available and a physician has some guidance when they are \nputting therapy out.\n  I particularly thank Dr. Coburn for bringing a message to the floor \nthat reflects his practical experience, in a period of time when there \nweren't a lot of drugs specifically labeled for children, to help him \nestablish the proper dosage and to be aware of the side effects that \nmay happen to various age groups. Also, I thank the Senator from North \nCarolina for his comments.\n  I think I bring a certain degree of practical experience to this \ndebate as a veterinarian. We are frequently put in a position where we \nhave to recommend drugs for therapy without having had research done. \nYou have to extrapolate what you think might happen. The drug companies \nwill do research on those products on which they can make a profit. I \nam talking about veterinary prescription drugs right now. There is a \nplethora of medications available in the human market. Many times, in \ntreating eye conditions or some exotic problem in a species where there \nisn't much of a market, we have to take the scientific literature that \nwe know, and perhaps we know what the reaction may be in humans or \nmaybe in some other species, where the drug company has done the \nresearch to reflect what the adequate dosage is, and we extrapolate \nthat and predict as best we can what the reaction and how effective \nthat drug may be at a certain dosage.\n  I think our children's health is too valuable to put a physician in a \nposition where they have to make those sorts of subjective evaluations. \nI happen to believe the incentives we put in place a decade ago are \nworking. That belief is substantiated by people who have looked at the \nprogram--the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act--and what happened \nas a result of that. I am not the only one who believes that. We had a \nstudy by the GAO, whose responsibility it is to look at programs to see \nwhether they are working. They give this program a strong A. It is \nworking. I don't think we ought to be messing with a program that has \nworked. Three months may be adequate, but there are a lot of other \ndrugs that we have to still get on the market.\n  Several years back, during the Reagan administration--and it might \nhave been President Reagan who said it--there was a general belief in \nWashington that if it is making a profit, let's tax it; if it is \nworking, let's regulate it to death. Here is a program that is working \nbecause we have backed off on the rules and regulations. I don't think \nwe ought to be making a decision, in light of the work that has yet to \nbe done in moving pediatric medications to the market, to mess with \nthis. Maybe 10 years from now it might be even more appropriate; I \ndon't know. This is, to a certain degree, subjectivity. I think we have \na huge need in making sure we have adequate medications available to \ntreat children.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that we should not be messing with \na program that works, and we need to support this. I also wish to point \nout that this doesn't have an impact. There is not a budget point of \norder on this particular amendment. It doesn't add to the deficit of \nthis country. So it is a program we can move forward on, without \nincreasing the cost to the Federal Government.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this most important \namendment because it is very important, it is important to the \npractitioner who is trying to provide the best care that scientists \nwill allow him to provide to patients--in this case, children. If we \ndon't keep these choices available for the practitioner, then what \nhappens is he doesn't have the options he should have to give the best \ncare to our children?\n  So for our children's health in the future, I think we need to pass \nthis amendment and go back to current law, which has been working so \nvery well for us today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be able \nto proceed for 2 minutes. I yield myself 1 minute and 1 minute to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the benefit of the membership, we are \nhaving a good, substantive debate this morning. We are going to vote on \nthis amendment in a few minutes.\n  Because of the meetings of the leadership at the White House, we will \nnot be able to have votes until 4 o'clock this afternoon. That doesn't \nmean that Senator Enzi and I are not prepared to move ahead in lining \nup some other amendments. We have that intention.\n  After this vote, the next vote will be at 4 o'clock. If there are \nthose who have additional amendments, we ask them to come over. We are \nmoving along. We have several items that are almost complete, which we \nwill include. If there are any final amendments, we hope Senators will \nbe in touch.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Wyoming for his good cooperation \nand for making progress on a very important bill for the health and \nsafety of American families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, encourage people to get their \namendments to us, so we can talk about the amendments. The amendment \nprocess is a difficult thing around here because it doesn't allow for \nsome of the tweaks noticed by people who have expertise in that area. \nIf we get to talk about them first, sometimes there can be \nmodifications to them before they are put in. We want to move this \nalong and have some things to vote on at 4 o'clock today. I hope \neverybody will cooperate on it.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy and his staff and my staff who have been \nworking together with anybody who has an amendment. They were working \nat 3 and 4 o'clock this morning on different things, trying to get them \nironed out so that it would be possible to move the bill forward.\n  Mr. President, what's wrong with limiting exclusivity for blockbuster \ndrugs? It is the exact opposite of what we should do. The whole point \nof the law is to leverage the large adult market for the benefit of the \nsmaller kids' market. The effect of the cap will be to discourage \ncompanies from studying the effects of the most-widely used drugs on \nkids. Seventy-five percent of the drugs are not being studied under the \ncurrent incentive. We need more studied, not less.\n  Are not companies only studying blockbuster drugs that make the most \nmoney, not the drugs needed most in kids? No. According to a Tufts \nUniversity study, only about 10 percent of drugs with pediatric \nexclusivity are blockbusters. GAO says most products obtaining \nexclusivity have annual sales of less than $200 million.\n  Do companies get to choose the drugs they study? What is to stop \ncompanies\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\nfrom ``cherry picking'' to make money, not help kids? No drug is \neligible for pediatric exclusivity unless FDA requests, in writing, a \npediatric study of the drug. FDA's decision is based on whether more \ninformation about safety and efficacy for children is necessary.\n  Doesn't the Duke/JAMA study demonstrate that 6 months of additional \nexclusivity is a windfall? It's been said that a cynic is someone who \nknows the cost of everything, and the value of nothing. That applies \nhere. The Duke/JAMA study concluded that the financial benefit of \nexclusivity for blockbuster drugs often exceeded the cost of the \npediatric study. This completely misses the point. This law is not \nabout micromanaging drug company profits. It's about helping kids. In \nfact, the very last sentence of the study reads: ``Clearly, however, \nthe greatest return of the exclusivity program is the benefit derived \nin obtaining new information relevant and applicable to the care of \nchildren, and this benefit should not be compromised.''\n  Companies can spend only a few million dollars on a study and get \nmany millions in return. Shouldn't the reward be equal to the amount \nspent on studies? The incentive is designed to raise the priority of \npediatric studies among all the competing research priorities for drug \ndevelopment within companies. Just covering the cost of the studies \nwill not do it--the drug company knows it can put those same dollars \ninto the development of a drug for adults that will earn much higher \nprofits. Incentives work by making pediatric study more attractive than \nother studies for drug companies.\n  Aren't windfall profits unfair? No. The benefits to kids, and to \nsociety in general, from pediatric studies far outweighs the cost.\n  What are workability issues with the exclusivity cap? FDA says the \ncap has ``serious workability issues.'' It is unclear how FDA will \nobtain the right type of sale data or how the data's accuracy can be \nverified. FDA would spend lots of time litigating the validity of \nexclusivity decisions, and less time making drugs safe for kids.\n  Why shouldn't we restrict excessive drug company profit? The problem \nis not excessive profits. The problem is that most drugs aren't tested \nfor kids. It is wrong to play the politics of drug pricing at the \nexpense of kids.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offered an amendment yesterday that a \nnumber of my colleagues have spoken on, both in favor and against. When \nI laid down the amendment yesterday, I did not speak on it, so I wish \nto take some time to describe what the amendment is, why it is \nimportant, and why those who have spoken against it are wrong.\n  Let me describe, first of all, what the amendment is about, and let \nme do it, if I might, by asking unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nshow on the floor of the Senate two bottles of medicine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, these two bottles of medicine contain \nLipitor. Most people know about Lipitor. It is a cholesterol-lowering \ndrug. This particular prescription drug is produced in Ireland, and it \nis sent from that production point, in a plant, by the way, that is \napproved by our Food and Drug Administration. We inspect that plant, as \nwe do others. So they produce an FDA-approved drug--this drug has been \napproved--in a plant in Ireland that has been inspected by the FDA. \nThese two bottles of medicine containing Lipitor, 20 milligrams, \nidentical bottles with a difference in color, are sent to two different \nplaces in this case but sent to many places around the world. This one \nis sent to the United States to be sold to consumers in the United \nStates that want to lower their cholesterol. This one is sent to \nconsumers in Canada for those Canadians who wish to take Lipitor to \nlower their cholesterol.\n  There is a difference. Oh, not in the medicine, not in the bottle, \nand not in the instruction. What is the difference? The American \nconsumer is told: You have to pay twice as much. Let me say that again. \nThe difference is the price. The Canadian consumer is told: You pay \nhalf the price. The American consumer is told: You pay double the \nprice.\n  Now, I use the Lipitor as an example only to describe a very \nsignificant problem. We have price controls on prescription drugs in \nthis country. Those price controls are not established by the \nGovernment. They are not established by the Congress. These price \ncontrols are imposed by the pharmaceutical industry.\n  I have a problem with the pharmaceutical industry saying to the \nAmerican consumer: We have a deal for you; we want you to pay the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs. We are going to \nsell them all over the world: Italy, Japan, Germany, France, China. We \nare going to sell our prescription drugs, and in almost every \ncircumstance, in other countries, we are going to give them a lower \nprice. But to you consumers in the United States, we say: You pay the \nhighest prices.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples, and I will use Canada, but I \ncould be using any number of countries around the world. Lipitor. We \npay 96 percent more. Plavix, 46 percent more. Prevacid, 97 percent more \nthan if you were to buy it in Canada. Zoloft, 52 percent more. It goes \non and on.\n  I said yesterday that I actually sat on a bale of straw on a farm \ntalking to a bunch of folks, and there was a fellow in his 80s sitting \non a straw bale talking about life and things, and he said: You know, \nMr. Senator, my wife has been fighting breast cancer for 3 years. Every \n3 months, we have driven to Canada to buy Tamoxifen because we save 80 \npercent by buying Tamoxifen to help my wife fight her breast cancer--we \nsave 80 percent by buying it in Canada. So every 3 months, for 3 years, \nwe have been driving back and forth to Canada because it is the only \nway we can afford that drug. He said: How do you justify that? How do \nyou explain the\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\ndifference in price? I said: I can't. It doesn't make any sense to me.\n  I don't come here to be critical of the pharmaceutical industry, I \ncome here to be critical of their pricing policy. Their pricing \npolicies are unfair to the American consumer. Yes, the pharmaceutical \nindustry produces miracle drugs; a fair amount of them are produced \nwith research we pay for through the American taxpayer at the National \nInstitutes of Health. Others are produced with the research and \ndevelopment done by the drug industry themselves. But I would say that \nmiracle drugs offer no miracles to those who can't afford to buy them, \nand that is the point.\n  What is fair pricing for pharmaceutical drugs, and why is it so \nunfair at this point to the American people? I introduced a piece of \nlegislation with many of my colleagues, and let me read a list of the \nbipartisan cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats, who sponsored the \nlegislation that we introduced in this Congress, the very legislation I \nhave now offered as an amendment to this bill. Let me go through a list \nof some of the names. Myself, Senator Snowe, Senator Kennedy, Senators \nStabenow, Bingaman, Feinstein, Nelson, Kohl, Schumer, Inouye, Brown, \nSanders, Senators Grassley, McCain, Specter, Collins, Durbin, Pryor, \nLevin, Leahy, Tester, Conrad, McCaskill, Johnson, Casey, Boxer, \nSalazar, Clinton, Lincoln, Feingold. Thirty-three sponsors for this \nlegislation that I have offered as an amendment here today.\n  Let me now begin to describe a few of the opponents' arguments and \nthen respond to them. My colleague, Senator Cochran, came out and \noffered an amendment that says in order for this to be effective, the \nSecretary would have to certify that it poses no additional risk to the \npublic health and safety. Well, that is an amendment that is designed \nto kill the bill because the Health and Human Services Secretary will \nnot certify to anything.\n\n  Does anyone think the Health and Human Services Secretary or the FDA \nor anybody is going to certify that the chicken feed served to 3 \nmillion chickens with contaminated material from China, which now goes \ninto our food source that humans are eating in this country today, that \nposes a risk? Or how about we say that we want them to certify that the \nvegetables imported into this country from Mexico pose no additional \nrisk? Does anyone think anybody is going to certify to that? Do you, \nreally?\n  I could go on at great length. Does anybody know of any circumstance \nin which any part of our food supply is certified by anybody saying \nthat the import of this poses no additional risk? No. So this is an \namendment designed to make this inoperative.\n  What my amendment does is actually make our drug supply safer with \nrespect to the importation. Because the fact is people are now going \nback and forth across the border, those who can get there by car. Most \nAmericans can't, but most are bringing prescription drugs back across \nthe border for a 3-month supply. This makes that even safer.\n  I am going to go through a number of the safety areas here, but first \nlet me say this. I understand that the pharmaceutical industry wants to \ncontinue its pricing policies. I understand that. It is perfectly \nunderstandable. I have some differences with them.\n  In the morning, perhaps while you are brushing your teeth or shaving, \ngetting ready for work, you might turn on the television and what do \nyou hear them saying on television? They say, well, you need to go talk \nto your doctor. You are brushing your teeth and thinking, why on Earth \nshould I go talk to my doctor? Because the television advertisement \nsays that you need to see if the little purple pill is right for you. \nYou need to ask your doctor whether you ought to take the purple pill. \nI don't know what the purple pill is, but you get this urge that you \nthink, maybe I should go ask somebody. If everybody is taking the \npurple pill, maybe I should find out if the purple pill is right for \nme. Maybe it is right for my colleague from Wyoming or West Virginia. \nMaybe we all ought to be taking the purple pill. I don't know.\n  If they ever describe what the purple pill does, they also have to \nthen describe what the potential risks might be of the pill. But in \nmost cases, the TV just says, go talk to your doctor to see if it is \nright for you. So we have a lot of advertising going on, and we \ndramatically increase the use of prescription drugs. Go talk to any \ndoctor and ask them if patients are coming to them and telling them \nwhat kind of prescription medication they want to take because they \nheard it on television. Go ask a doctor, and I tell you what the doctor \nwill say. Absolutely.\n  Of course, these are medicines that you can only get because a doctor \nhas said you need them and, therefore, I prescribe them. Television \nadvertising is creating a demand. I am not here with an amendment on \ntelevision advertising, but I am observing that every morning they ask \nwhether the purple pill, or whatever other medicine they are talking \nabout, is right for you and that you ought to be visiting with your \ndoctor about it.\n  In addition to the issue of demand, there is the issue of pricing. I \ndon't know. Somebody doesn't have to give me five reasons or three \nreasons or even two reasons. I want somebody to give me one reason, \njust one, that says we think it is perfectly defensible that the \nAmerican people ought to be charged the highest prices for prescription \ndrugs. Or in the specific case I mentioned, we think it is perfectly \ndefensible that the American consumer taking Lipitor ought to be \ncharged twice as much as the Canadian consumer. Give me one reason. I \nam not asking for five, just one reason. I can't believe there is one \nperson on the floor of this Senate that has the ability to construct \none thoughtful reason in support of that policy.\n  Let me put in the Record a letter the AARP has written yesterday. Let \nme read a little bit of it:\n\n       On behalf of the AARP's more than 38 million members, we \n     urge you to support the Dorgan-Snowe importation amendment. \n     This amendment provides for the safe, legal importation of \n     lower price prescription drugs from abroad.\n       In the quest for lower-priced prescription drugs, many \n     Americans are already importing prescription drugs from \n     abroad. [The Dorgan-Snowe] amendment would create a framework \n     for the safe, legal importation of prescription drugs that \n     will better protect the health and pocketbooks of those \n     desperate for lower-priced prescription drugs. We are also \n     very pleased to see that the [Dorgan-Snowe] amendment \n     includes a number of safety requirements including \n     inspections and measures to prevent the counterfeiting of \n     imported drugs.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                                   April 30, 2007.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: AARP is pleased to endorse your \n     importation amendment to S. 1028, the Prescription Drug User \n     Fee Amendments of 2007. Your amendment will provide for the \n     safe, legal importation of lower-priced prescription drugs \n     from abroad. We applaud your continued leadership on this \n     important measure to help reduce prescription drug costs.\n       Brand name prescription drug prices continue to rise at \n     unsustainable rates. AARP's latest Rx Watchdog report \n     released in March 2007 found that manufacturers' prices for \n     nearly 200 of the brand-name medications most commonly used \n     by older Americans rose 6.2 percent in 2006--nearly twice the \n     3.2 percent rate of general inflation. These prescription \n     drug price increases particularly burden the tens of millions \n     of Americans who lack access to affordable prescription drug \n     coverage.\n       In the quest for lower-priced prescription drugs, many \n     Americans are already importing prescription drugs from \n     abroad. Your amendment would create a framework for the safe, \n     legal importation of prescription drugs that will better \n     protect the health and pocketbooks of those desperate for \n     lower priced prescription drugs. We are also very pleased to \n     see that your amendment includes a number of safety \n     requirements including inspections and measures to prevent \n     the counterfeiting of imported drugs.\n       We believe the phase-in set forth in your amendment will \n     enable better management of those important new activities. \n     It is important that any importation system begin with \n     Canada. However, ultimately in order to be sustainable, any \n     importation system would have to go beyond Canada. Finally, \n     no importation system could function if entities \n     (particularly pharmaceutical manufacturers) were allowed to \n     shut off or manipulate supply of their product. Your \n     amendment grants the Federal Trade Commission the authority \n     to prevent such abuse.\n       We understand that there may be attempts to limit \n     consumers' ability to import prescription drugs by attaching \n     a certification\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\n     requirement to your amendment. AARP believes that your \n     amendment strikes the right balance between providing a \n     workable system of importation while at the same time \n     ensuring the safety of imported pharmaceuticals. Thus, we \n     believe that any amendment that would require Administrative \n     certification in any form would be nothing more than an \n     attempt to prohibit the implementation of an importation \n     system. We oppose such a change to your amendment.\n       As you know, our members widely support legislation that \n     would allow for the safe, legal importation of prescription \n     drugs. They have expressed strong interest in knowing how \n     their elected officials vote on key issues that affect older \n     Americans. As part of our ongoing effort to let our members \n     know of action taken on key issues, we will be informing them \n     how their Senators vote on your amendment when it comes to \n     the Senate floor.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues on \n     both sides of the aisle to enact this needed legislation. If \n     you have any further questions, please feel free to contact \n     me, or have your staff contact Anna Schwamlein Howard of our \n     Federal Affairs staff at 202-434-3770.\n           Sincerely,\n     William D. Novelli,\n       Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is interesting to me that those who have spoken \nagainst this come to the floor of the Senate with the specter of \ncounterfeiting. Counterfeiting exists at this point. My amendment will \nmake it less likely. This puts in place the very safety features and \nthe very capability to try to shut that down. But if they are talking \nabout counterfeiting that is existing now, it is existing without these \nkind of safety precautions on importation.\n  Let me describe a man, a very courageous man named Dr. Peter Rost. He \ncame to testify at a hearing we held on the subject of reimportation. \nPeter Rost was responsible for a region in northern Europe where they \ndid this routinely. They had an approach in Europe called parallel \ntrading. If you are in Germany and want to buy a prescription drug in \nFrance, that is not a problem. If you are in Italy and want to buy a \nprescription drug in Spain, that is not a problem. They have done this \nfor a couple of decades. Dr. Peter Rost was in charge of a region in \nnorthern Europe. He said:\n\n       I never once--not once--heard the drug industry, regulatory \n     agencies, the government or anyone else saying that this \n     practice was unsafe. And personally, I think it is outright \n     derogatory to claim that Americans would not be able to \n     handle reimportation of drugs, when the rest of the educated \n     world can do this.\n\n  This from Dr. Rost. He actually paid a price for speaking out and \nspeaking the truth. He actually was working for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals \nat the time. He has had a little problem with his employer, but that is \nanother story perhaps for another day. But Dr. Rost said it right, in \nmy judgment.\n  Let me, if I might, show this quote from Tommy Thompson, former \nHealth and Human Services Secretary. He says:\n\n       The law is this: In order to import drugs from any country, \n     and especially Canada, I have to certify that all those drugs \n     are safe. That's an impossible thing. If Congress wants to \n     import drugs, they should take that provision out, because \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services cannot certify \n     that all drugs coming into America are safe.\n\n  Let me tell you something about Tommy Thompson. I like Tommy \nThompson. He was a Governor from Wisconsin. That's a guy with spirit. I \nkind of like him. In fact, I think he is thinking about running for \nPresident. I probably will not vote for him because I am going to vote \nfor a Democrat in this coming election, but I like Tommy Thompson. Do \nyou know what he said to me at the elevator, right outside this Senate \ndoor after he left Health and Human Services? He was getting off the \nelevator as I was coming on the elevator, and I had been down to see \nhim about this issue of reimportation of prescription drugs. I said: \nSecretary Thompson, why don't you work with us to get this done?\n  He said: I can't.\n  He explained there are lots of things going on, including the White \nHouse makes the call on this policy, et cetera. At any rate, after he \nleft as Secretary of HHS, he was coming off an elevator out here and I \nwas getting on the elevator. We said hello. I like him. I think he was \na good Secretary.\n  He turned around and said to me: Byron, he said, keep going on that \nimported drug issue. You are right about that. You are right about \nthat.\n  That is after he left office. He comes from Wisconsin. He knows. That \nis a State that borders Canada. He knows his constituents are able to \njust go miles up into Canada and seek prescription drugs for a fraction \nof the price.\n  Let me respond for a moment to this issue of safety because my \ncolleague from Mississippi and others have spoken about it. David \nKessler, he served for 8 years as FDA Commissioner. He is a terrific \npublic servant. In my judgment, there has been none better than Dr. \nKessler over at the FDA. Here is what he said:\n\n       [The Dorgan-Snowe bill] provides a sound framework for \n     assuring that imported drugs are safe and effective. Most \n     notably, it provides additional resources to the agency to \n     run such a program, oversight by the FDA of the chain of \n     custody of imported drugs back to FDA-inspected plants, a \n     mechanism to review imported drugs to ensure that they meet \n     FDA's approval standards, and the registration and oversight \n     of importers and exporters to assure that imported drugs meet \n     those standards and are not counterfeit.\n\n  Let me make one with respect to this. A couple of my colleagues stood \non the floor and said: Well, you would create a giant bureaucracy in \norder to do this. That is interesting. The Congressional Budget Office \nactually scored this bill we have introduced. Do you know what the \nscore was? This will save $50 billion in a 10-year period.\n  Mr. BYRD. With a ``b''?\n  Mr. DORGAN. With a ``b,'' $50 billion; just over $5 billion of that \nsavings is to the Federal Government; just about $45 billion of that \nsavings is to the American consumer. Is that an illusion? No, that is \nthe score we have.\n  We come to the floor of the Senate and the question is asked: Whom do \nyou stand for? Whom do you stand with? Some will say: You know what, we \nbelieve--they will not say that. I do not believe they will stand and \nsay: We believe the current surprising strategy is right, by which \nAmericans are charged the highest price. I don't think they will say \nthat. I think what they will see is we think there are serious safety \nissues with this.\n  Let me again refer back to the expert who would perhaps know more \nabout this than any other American. I have heard things read on the \nfloor of the Senate by the assistant this or the assistant that. The \nlast assistant we had come over to a hearing I held had not even read \nthe bill. That is some assistant. At any rate, we don't have to worry \nabout assistants. Let's worry about Dr. David Kessler, who I think is \nthe preeminent authority. He said we can do this; we can do this, and \nit will make the drug supply in this country safer.\n\n  I wish to talk about the issue of safety. It is not as if \nprescription drugs are not coming into this country from other \ncountries. They, of course, are. Our pharmaceutical industry, and \nothers, manufacture all over the world and then they ship these drugs \ninto our country to be sold here. But there is a law that prohibits \nanyone other than the manufacturer to ship them in. Lipitor is made in \nDublin, Ireland; Nexium is made in France; Tricor is made in France; \nActos is made in Japan; Vytorin is made in Singapore and Italy and the \nUnited Kingdom. Those are pills made elsewhere, the medicines are made \nthere and they are shipped here. Are they safe? Sure. I believe they \nare safe. I believe we have an enormously safe drug supply, despite the \nfright that is discussed on the floor of the Senate about \ncounterfeiting.\n  Is counterfeiting an issue? Sure, it is. It has nothing to do with \nthis subject. Counterfeiting exists now and we have to take action and \nsteps to fight it and we should fight it aggressively. But the fact is, \nthis legislation that we introduce has a range of safety features that \nwill guarantee the safety of FDA-approved prescription drugs that are \nimported into this country.\n  First of all, we provide that only FDA-approved medicines with a \n``chain of custody'' will be sent into this country. Dr. Mark \nMcClellan, who used to head the FDA, and I was very critical of him \nbecause he continued to speak as if he represented the pharmaceutical \nindustry instead of regulating it as head of the FDA, he and I had \nsubstantial differences, but even he said the chain of custody in \nCanada is safe, almost identical to the chain of custody for \nprescription drugs in the United States.\n  If that is the case, and he said it, then tell me with respect to \nthis risk,\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nI go to a little one-room drug store in Emerson, Canada, with a woman \nnamed ``Sylvia'' and a number of other senior citizens. We take a \nlittle bus up to a one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada, and they \nbring their prescriptions.\n  That drug store has a licensed pharmacist, as the drug store a few \nmiles south of the border has, a licensed pharmacist and a chain of \ncustody from the drug manufacturer to the wholesaler to the retailer to \nthe drug store. We go to that drug store and Sylvia and her friends buy \nprescription drugs at a fraction of the price they would have bought it \nin Fargo, ND, that morning. Tell me, is there a risk in that \ntransaction? The answer is no. Don't represent there is because there \nis not.\n  The chain of custody is nearly identical. I am speaking now of \nCanada. Tell me there is a risk and you are wrong, there is not.\n  All the protestation on the floor of the Senate on this issue is \nprotestation in support of the pharmaceutical industry. I like the \nindustry. I have been helpful to them. I support research and \ndevelopment tax credits to find new prescription drugs. I have done a \nnumber of things to say I want us to be able to have a successful \npharmaceutical industry in this country. But I am not willing to go so \nfar as to say it is OK to me, I will be quiet if you decide the pricing \nstrategy is we are going to price our prescription drugs at the highest \nprices for the American consumer. I will not sit in this chair and say \nit is fine with me. It is not, and that ought not be fine for any \nMember of the Senate. It should not.\n  Mr. BYRD. No. No.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make some comments on safety. One-quarter of the \nprescription drugs taken in this country are produced outside this \ncountry in foreign manufacturing plants. In the last 5 years, the FDA \nhas inspected more than 850 foreign drug factories in 41 different \ncountries. The drug industry wants to take advantage of the global \neconomy to manufacture their drugs in lower cost countries, but they do \nnot want a licensed U.S. pharmacist and drug wholesalers to be able to \ntake advantage of the global economy to get the best price for the \nAmerican consumer.\n  Let me say that again. The pharmaceutical industry wants to take \nadvantage of the global economy for the purpose of their manufacture \nand profitability, but they do not want a licensed U.S. pharmacist or \nlicensed wholesaler to be able to access those same drugs from a \nlicensed wholesaler or pharmacist in another country in order to pass \nalong lower prices to the American consumer. I do not think that is \nright.\n  We have addressed all the issues that have been raised by two former \nSecretaries of Health and Human Services, saying in order for me to \ncertify, we need to have this and that. We have addressed those safety \nissues in this legislation. Yet if you listen to the opponents who \nstand on the floor of the Senate with the talking points, there are \nsafety and security issues and all these issues--I mean I have gotten \nthe talking points, too, from the pharmaceutical industry. Heck, if I \nwere in their position, I would want to keep this situation as long as \npossible. You have a good deal, don't give it up.\n  But one of my colleagues yesterday, speaking on the floor, said: The \npeople who are offering this amendment--and again this amendment goes \nfrom Senator Kennedy to Senator McCain to Senator Grassley to Senator \nStabenow back and forth, Republicans and Democrats. One Senator, one of \nmy colleagues, stood up and said there are political motives.\n  I said I hope you don't mean that, and I hope you will withdraw that. \nThis is a thoughtful serious debate. There are plenty of people who \nfeel strongly in opposition to my amendment. Fine. But then you should \nstand and debate the proposition that you support. We support the \ncurrent situation. We support the circumstance in which a pricing \npolicy that prices the prescription drugs higher for the U.S. consumer \nis already with us. That ought to be the proposition you stand and \nsupport.\n  You ought not stand and say there are significant safety issues here \nbecause that is not the case. It is not.\n  There is much to say, and a number of my colleagues will continue to \ndebate this issue. My own view is this is a hard issue to get passed on \nthe floor of the Senate. I say that having had some experience with it.\n  I must say I admire the pharmaceutical industry. They have been tough \nopponents. They feel strongly about their profitability. They say a \ncouple of things. No. 1, this is unsafe. It is not. No. 2, it would \nsomehow exacerbate counterfeiting. It will not. Counterfeiting now \nexists. We need to address that, but this would in many ways make the \nsupply of drugs safer. They say a number of other things they believe--\nthat this would cause the American people to change their buying habits \nin ways that would be unhelpful to them. They believe you do not have a \nchain of custody that you can control or see that is transparent. That \nis not true.\n  You know, I mentioned earlier about this issue of the industry \nitself. I want the pharmaceutical industry to succeed. They succeeded. \nThis has been a very successful industry. They have made a great deal \nof money. But on this issue of research and development, I want them to \nengage in research and development. We are doing it here in the public \nsector of the NIH. We turn that material over to the pharmaceutical \nindustry. They do research and development. Good for them. They spend a \nmassive amount of money on promotion and development. I think that is \nof some concern for a number of people, but I am not here saying I do \nnot want the pharmaceutical industry to succeed. There are those who \nalso say, in addition to safety and other issues, they will say, all \nright, if you do not allow a pricing policy that prices prescription \ndrugs at the highest level for the American consumer, it will mean less \nresearch and development by the pharmaceutical industry.\n  The fact is, more research and development has gone on in other \ncountries in which they charged lower prices for the same prescription \ndrugs. So how does that hold water? It does not. My hope is, at long \nlast, perhaps, this Senate will stand up for the interests of the \nAmerican consumer. At long last, we can put to bed these specious \narguments about safety because they are not applicable. Read the bill. \nThese arguments about safety are not accurate. Let's put to bed this \nconnection between counterfeiting. It is not accurate. Let's also stop \ntalking about how this would shut off research and development. That is \nnot accurate.\n  Let's talk about what this bill would do, what this piece of \nlegislation, this amendment we have now offered is. It would save about \n$50 billion over 10 years, $5 billion a year. It would probably require \nthe drug industry to reprice for sure because, the fact is, if they are \npricing at the highest levels to the American people, and they say that \nis the only way they can recover their costs, perhaps others ought to \nbe paying more to recover costs. I don't know. I am saying that the \nindustry, I believe the top seven U.S. pharmaceutical companies, a \ncouple of years ago made $34 billion together. The industry has done \nvery well. But there are a whole lot of folks in this country who \nhaven't.\n  It was about 9:30 one night in a tiny town north of Highway 2 in \nNorth Dakota. I had a town meeting. At the end of the town meeting, an \nolder woman came up to me, and she was probably in her early eighties. \nShe said: Mr. Senator, may I speak to you? I said: Sure. She grabbed my \nelbow with her hand. She began to speak. Her eyes welled up with tears \nand her chin began to quiver. She said: I am in my eighties. I don't \nhave much money. She said: I have got heart disease and diabetes. My \ndoctor prescribes medicines for me that are too expensive. I cannot \nafford them. Is there any way you can help me, Mr. Senator? Is there a \nway you can help me?\n  This woman, with tears in her eyes, was asking: Is there someone who \ncan help me manage this disease of mine because I cannot afford these \nmedicines?\n  We have taken steps to try to be helpful. I might say that some in \nthe drug industry have taken steps by offering programs to low-income \npeople. It is not enough. But I commend those who have and recognize \nit. But we should not have to do that in this country. We should not \nhave the highest prices for prescription drugs. We should not have an \n80-year-old woman driving\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\nto Canada to pay four-fifths less in cost for Tamoxifen to treat her \nbreast cancer. That should not happen.\n  So let's do this. Let's create a regime of safety--which we have \ndone. Wonder about it? Go talk to Dr. David Kessler. You find a better \nexpert, you tell me his name. We have created a regime of safety here \nthat will work. Then let us decide to proceed, as Europe has done, as \nothers have done, to allow the global marketplace to work for real \npeople, to work for ordinary folks, not only the big interests. The big \ninterests always do well. At the end of the day, when all of the dust \nsettles, and all of the shouting is over, guess who almost always wins. \nYes: Them that's got is them that gets and I ain't got nothing lately. \nI think that was Ray Charles.\n  Isn't that always the case? When the dust settles, the big interests \nalways win. Let's hope when the dust settles here tomorrow morning, and \nwe have a vote on something that is important, is something that will \nhelp a lot of American people, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of \nmillions, let's hope when the dust settles here, ordinary Americans \nwill say, you know what. We won today in the Senate. Hallelujah, we won \na vote in the Senate. Let's hope that is the case tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, there is not much I can add to the \nbrilliant remarks made by Senator Dorgan. I think he, in a very \ncomprehensive manner, made clear why the Senate and this country should \nmove to prescription drug reimportation. I think he very ably answered \nthe objections that we know are sure to come and made the case as well \nas could be made.\n  I want to touch on some personal reflections on this issue. Some \nyears ago, as the Congressman then from the State of Vermont--and I \nlive an hour and a half away from the Canadian border. My State borders \nCanada. Some years ago, I put together what, in fact, turns out to be \nthe very first bus trip to take constituents over the Canadian border \nto buy low-cost prescription drugs.\n  All of us have days which are transformative where something happens \nwe will never forget, and that is the day I will never forget. On that \nday we took a busload of Vermonters, mostly women, many of the women \nstruggling with breast cancer. We went from St. Albans, VT, to \nMontreal, Canada. I will never forget the look on the faces of those \nwomen who were struggling for their lives when they bought breast \ncancer medicine at 10 percent of the cost they were paying in the State \nof Vermont. The drug was Tamoxifen, a widely prescribed drug for those \npeople who are struggling with breast cancer.\n  These women walked in fighting for their lives, many of whom did not \nhave a lot of money. They walked in there and they could not believe, \nliterally could not believe, the cost of that medicine which they \nneeded to keep them alive. At that moment some years ago--it may well \nhave changed since then--the cost was one-tenth what it was in the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  The question is a very simple question: How do you have a drug \nmanufactured by a company, manufactured in the same factory, put in the \nsame bottles, sold in Canada, in some cases for one-tenth the price \nthat same medicine is sold in the United States of America? How \npossibly can that happen?\n  Now, as it occurs, I am not a great fan of unfettered free trade. I \nhave very serious concerns about what our trade policy is doing in \nterms of throwing American workers out on the street, moving plants to \nChina and other low-wage countries. But I am always amazed that on the \nfloor of Congress, when it comes to representing the interests of \nmultinational corporations, people are always speaking about how great \nunfettered free trade is; it is not a problem; American workers going \ndown the street; workers in China paid 30 cents an hour. That is okay. \nThat is part of globalization.\n  Well, why isn't it part of globalization that prescription drug \ndistributors and pharmacists can pick up FDA safety-approved medicine \nat a fraction of the price they are currently forced to pay, and lower \nthe cost of prescription drugs in this country very substantially? Why \nis that not a process of globalization that every Member of the Senate \nshould be supporting?\n  We should not kid ourselves as to what this debate is about. I think \nmost Americans understand that large multinational corporations have \nenormous power over the Congress. You have big oil running up \nrecordbreaking profits, receiving tax breaks and corporate welfare. You \nhave credit card companies with tremendous power over what goes on in \nCongress, able to charge Americans 25, 28 percent usurious interest \nrates. You have insurance companies blocking national health care \nefforts so all of our American people can have health care as a right \nof citizenship. But at the top of the list of powerful, greedy special \ninterests, at the top of that list, that very impressive list, stands \nthe pharmaceutical industry. They are at the top.\n  So when you talk about powerful interests, look at the pharmaceutical \nindustry and the impact and the power they have in terms of what goes \non here in Congress. Since 1998, the pharmaceutical industry has spent \nover $900 million on lobbying activities; $900 million since 1998. That \nis more than any other industry in the United States of America.\n  It is hard to believe, but there are now over 1,200 prescription drug \nlobbyists right here in America, many of them right here on Capitol \nHill. That amounts to more than two lobbyists for every Member of the \nHouse and the Senate. They have us well covered. These people are paid \ntop dollar as lobbyists. These are former leaders of the Republican \nParty, former leaders of the Democratic Party.\n  Let me tell you, they are hard at work today. They will be hard at \nwork tomorrow. What they have done successfully, year after year after \nyear, is when an effort comes up in the House and an effort comes up in \nthe Senate, they descend like locusts into the offices of Members of \nCongress and say: Don't vote for change. Keep the status quo alive. \nMake sure the American people continue to pay the highest prices for \nmedicine in the entire world.\n  Since 2000--I don't know if you are supposed to talk about these \nthings on the floor of the Senate. I will. Since the year 2000, the \npharmaceutical companies have contributed almost $250 million in \ncampaign contributions. Let me repeat that. Since the year 2000, the \npharmaceutical companies have contributed almost $250 million in \ncampaign contributions.\n  What this debate is about is not just whether we are going to lower \nthe cost of medicine in this country and save billions and billions of \ndollars for the consumers of our country, for people with acute and \nchronic illnesses, for our seniors; it is also about whether the \nCongress of the United States is, in fact, prepared to stand up to the \nmost powerful, the greediest special interest in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  In my view, the time is long overdue for us to begin to make some \nfundamental changes in our prescription drug policies in this country. \nThe time is long overdue for us to lower the price of medicine for our \npeople, which not only will help people, of course, pay for their \nprescription drugs, it will lower the entire cost of health care in the \nUnited States.\n  We spend far more money per capita on health care than does any other \ncountry on Earth. If we lower the cost of prescription drugs, we will \nhave an impact on that.\n  Tomorrow I will be speaking at greater length on this issue, but I \nthink the arguments are so clear that prescription drug reimportation \nmakes sense. The idea, as Senator Dorgan has mentioned, that somehow we \ncan import tomatoes and lettuce from farms in Mexico and in Latin \nAmerica, that is okay, but we cannot reimport prescription drugs from \nCanada with FDA regulations, that is impossible, makes sense to nobody \nat all. Food coming in from China, no problem; FDA-regulated \nprescription drugs coming from Canada, oh, my word, it can't be done. \nGive me a break. Of course, it can be done.\n\n  What this issue is about is not drug safety. What this issue is about \nis the profits of the pharmaceutical industry and the enormous power \nthey have over Congress. Now is the time for us to say to the drug \ncompanies: You have dominated what goes on year after year after year. \nYou, in the drug industry, wrote the prescription drug Medicare bill. \nYou have resisted year after year every effort to reform how we price \nmedicine in the United States.\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\n  Maybe the year 2007 might be the moment in which Members of Congress \nhave the courage to stand up and say enough is enough. Let's support \nthe men and women and children, the seniors of our country. Let's lower \nthe cost of prescription drugs. Let's pass prescription drug \nreimportation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, thank God for Bernie Sanders, the Senator \nfrom Vermont. Thank God. Sail on, brother.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will have a lot more comments on this bill \nat a later time. In light of the comments by the Senator from North \nDakota about the importance of reading the bill, I wasn't sure that I \nhad read the most recent copy of it. I think I have the most recent \ncopy of it now. It is a fascinating 140 pages that is being attached to \nour 300-page drug safety bill. The reason I am checking it is because \nin the past we have noticed some strong implications for safety \nproblems with drug importation, and I want to make sure we are not \nopening the door for even more safety problems. I had hoped that the \nbill on safety wouldn't have to get into the safety of imported drugs, \nbut I can see that is not the direction we are going. I am more than \nhappy to address it.\n  I am fascinated by the discussion today because the people who \nnormally are talking about free trade are now talking about some \nrestrictions. That would be my side of the aisle. Those who normally \nrail at any kind of opening of the market to anyplace outside of the \nUnited States are the ones who are supporting this bill. It is kind of \na reversal of situations.\n  I have heard the Senator from North Dakota talk about the way the \nCanadian Government is subsidizing the grain in that country and how \nthat gives them an unfair advantage in the United States market and how \nwe have to be sure that doesn't happen. Yes, the Canadian Government \nsubsidizes. Yes, the Canadian Government gives an unfair advantage to \ntheir citizens. On drugs, the Canadians do some interesting things, \ntoo. They are a very small, limited market compared to the United \nStates.\n  Sometimes in business when you are trying to price things, you say: I \ncould pick up a little bit more in the market if I changed my price a \nlittle bit. But I am only willing to go after the fringe in order to do \nthat. That is kind of what has happened in Canada. Canada has made it a \nlittle more difficult for the drug companies because they say: We are \ngoing to negotiate the price. I love that word ``negotiate.'' Normally \nthat means there is a little give and take on both sides and some \nadvantages that are picked up on both sides in order for the outcome \nthat is derived.\n  In terms of pharmaceuticals, usually ``negotiation'' is the code word \nfor ``price fixing.'' That is what they have done in Canada. They have \nfixed the price. If you want to be able to sell your drug up there, \nthey will tell you what bid you better come in at and they are willing \nto have various pharmaceuticals bid against each other for the right to \nenter that fringe market, a small portion of what is in the United \nStates but a potential customer. If you can cover your costs and pick \nup a few more sales, perhaps you can increase profits. It is a little \naccounting trick, but it happens. But they negotiate the price.\n  There are five drugs for heart that do similar things. They make the \nfive drugs for heart bid against each other. That means one or two of \nthem will win the bid. If your doctor prescribed one of the other three \nin Canada, you are out of luck. The decision by the doctor is taken \naway because you will get a good price on the pharmaceutical that may \nnot be quite right for you, but it will be cheaper than what you could \nhave gotten. That is not the way we work it in the United States. We \ntry to have competition between all of the different products and hope \nthat brings the price down.\n  There is some positive indication that it does bring the price down. \nWe have the Medicare plan D. When they did the calculations on how much \nthat was going to cost, it was considerably higher than what it \nactually came in at when there was competition among the providers, who \nin some cases represent more people than Medicare or Medicaid or the \nveterans and negotiate prices, but they negotiate realizing that we are \nforcing them to provide all of the pharmaceuticals, not just one or two \nout of five. If they are providing a plan, they have to provide for the \nprescription drugs.\n  When I was doing hearings across Wyoming, I had a little surprise \nalmost at every meeting that I had to explain Medicare Part D. That was \nsomebody saying: I can't get the prescriptions I really want. I was \ndoing all of this promotion before Part D even went into effect. So I \nknew something was wrong with that kind of a response. It occurred to \nme that maybe those were veterans. We negotiate the price on drugs for \nveterans. That means when the Government is doing it, they have to say: \nYou know, I don't think your price is low enough so we are just not \ngoing to make that available to our people.\n  Did you know that a whole bunch of veterans are taking prescriptions \nunder plan D because they can't get what they want under veterans? It \nis an interesting situation. When you negotiate these things, you \nchange some of the dynamics and you do not make everything available. I \ndon't think we in the United States are going to settle for just having \nsome, although if we can tap the cheap one in Canada where they fix the \nprice, that will lend an advantage to people in the United States. I am \nready to admit that. I am ready to admit if we didn't have restrictions \non ethanol and subsidies in this country, we would bring in a whole \nbunch of ethanol from Brazil. But we are going to protect the ethanol. \nAgain, it is a different group of people who are talking about that \nthan are talking about drug importation.\n\n  Let me get back to drug importation because that is important. The \nSenator from North Dakota several times--in fact, all the time--used to \nsay ``where are all the dead Canadians'' when he was talking about \nsafety. That is what my colleague from North Dakota used to come down \nto the Senate floor and say when he was talking about importation. He \nalways asked that question. It may have escaped the notice of those of \nus in this body that he didn't ask that question anywhere in \nyesterday's debate or today's debate. Why not? Because two summers ago, \nfive people in Hamilton, Ontario, died from taking counterfeit Norvasc. \nNorvasc is a blood pressure drug taken by millions upon millions of \npeople who rely on it for their health and well-being. Since so many \npeople take it, it is a target for counterfeiters looking to make a \nquick buck. I know he did say that counterfeiting is going to happen \nanyway. Probably. It happens in virtually every industry, and there are \nsome countries that actually specialize in it. But imagine opening an \nopportunity for counterfeiters, an opportunity for them.\n  In the portions of the bill I have gotten through already, I know \nthere are some pretty tight restrictions on who can be an exporter and \nwho can be an importer and how packages will be labeled and all of \nthose sorts of things. It is a marvelous effort to try to tighten it up \nso that what you buy is what you think you are getting. But how many of \nus, when the program was to first start, would know what to look for or \neven who to order from in order to be sure the drugs we are getting are \nsafe? How do you do that? It is a tremendous opportunity for \ncounterfeiters. We already have a problem with counterfeiters. There is \nno way you can write off the counterfeit argument.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be able to show some three-dimensional \nobjects on the Senate floor, the same as the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I will leave this on the desk so people can take a look at \nit. This is the Norvasc product with which the Canadians had a problem. \nIt killed people. I want Members to take a look at the packaging. I \nhave the external packaging. I have the internal packaging. I have the \npills themselves. I challenge anybody to see the difference. We are \ngoing to put some special labels on anything that gets shipped into the \ncountry. I am sure nobody would ever be able to counterfeit any labels \nthat were coming into the\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\ncountry. It just couldn't happen. There are now dead Canadians, and it \nsaddens me to say that I believe there will be even more. These \nunfortunate individuals got their fake pills from a brick-and-mortar \npharmacy. If that is what is happening when you buy drugs in person in \nCanada, who knows what you might get when ordering from a Web site that \nsays it is in Canada but could really be based anywhere in the world.\n  In fact, some of the drugs that have been intercepted by the FDA have \ncome through Canada but actually were from Saudi Arabia. Communication \nworldwide is transparent these days. Whom you think you are ordering \nfrom is not always whom you are ordering from. Right now that practice \nis referred to as hiding the maple leaf.\n  I would like to invite my colleagues to visit with me when I am \nfinished my remarks. I have these pills I would like them to take a \nlook at. There are other examples, too.\n  So anybody who holds up two bottles and says, this one is this and \nthis one is this, they can't be sure if the one that is being imported \nis really from the country they are talking about. It has to be a \nconcern. That has to be tightened up. There have to be some ways people \ncan really tell.\n  There is also a difference between whether you are importing for an \nindividual or you are importing for a pharmacy. If you are importing \nfor a pharmacy and they get a counterfeit load, it is not just one \nperson who dies. It is the whole community, everybody who is taking \nthat medication. So there needs to be some concern with these things.\n  As I said earlier, we all want to have affordable drugs. We would \nlike to bring down the cost of medicine every way that we possibly \ncan. But a counterfeit or tainted drug is unsafe at any price.\n\n  I want to add another thing on the counterfeit drugs. You can take \nthe pills and you can grind them up and do a chemical analysis of one \npill against the other, and they will come out identical. Now, part of \nthe problem is the way you put these together to make them dissolve \nproperly so what you need in your bloodstream gets into your \nbloodstream.\n  A number of the imported drugs that have been confiscated are shown \nthey will not even dissolve. If you take a pill, and it goes completely \nthrough your whole system, you could die. It is a serious problem. It \nlooks good, it even checks out good, but there are processes for \nputting these things together.\n  From my brief reading of the bill, I am also worried about some of \nthe biologic information that may be in there that could be imported as \nwell.\n  The Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act is about \nrestoring the trust of the American people in the FDA. That is where it \nbelongs. We should have a lot of concern.\n  There is an amendment that is going to come up everybody is working \non right now to make sure it would work, and it talks about some \nincreased safety with food. Now, food, some of it, such as tomato \npackaging, is pretty well there. It is not put in another container. It \nis hard to fake. But there can be problems. We had problems with \nspinach in this country. We have a big problem with pet food right now, \nand it is because of China.\n  China--how much do you trust them with your drugs? We have been \ntrusting them with our pet food, and they are killing our pets. It took \na little thing called melamine that increases the protein count in the \nfood. It does not increase the protein, it just increases the protein \ncount. It makes it look like a much richer food than it is. \nUnfortunately, it kills. Unfortunately, they have not just been using \nit in pet food; they have it in their regular food chain, and \nchildren--young children--got it, and the children died. When they \nchecked on it, they found out they died of starvation, even though they \nhad what should have been a good protein diet. There was a little \nmelamine in it, and it was starvation rather than poisoning.\n  But if they do that to food products, how much would we worry about \ndrug products that come in from there? I know there are some \nlimitations on where they can come from, but if they get into the \nEuropean Union, there does not appear to be any constraint on it then, \nand it could be transferred on over to the United States. So throwing \nour borders open to drug importation would, instead, falsely place \ntrust in criminals trafficking in illegal pharmaceuticals.\n  I think the American people deserve better. I hope we do not make \nthis move at this point in time, and that we constrain the bill to \nthose things we know will add safety to our pharmaceuticals and medical \ndevices and things for children in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with the ranking member of the HELP \nCommittee--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--in \nraising the concerns and agreeing with the concerns he has raised about \nthe reimportation proposal which has come forward from the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, which has been debated on this floor a number of times.\n  The issue, of course, is the safety and efficacy of products which \nAmericans buy. The FDA has been given the responsibility and has \nexecuted that responsibility extraordinarily well to make sure when an \nAmerican citizen buys a pharmaceutical product or a medication, it is \nwhat it says it is and it does what the doctor prescribes.\n  If you start buying medications internationally, you are in the \nposition where you have no capacity for the FDA to monitor that \npurchase. So the drug may be represented to be an FDA-approved drug, \nbut it could easily not be. In fact, case after case has been \ndiscovered of adulterated and changed medication coming into this \ncountry under the representation the medication which is being \npurchased is medication which has been approved by the FDA. So you are \nbasically opening up a massive loophole in the area of safety for the \nAmerican citizenry.\n  Now, the demand for this comes from the cost of the drugs. People \nwant to be able to go across the border to Canada, which is obviously a \nvery sophisticated nation, and buy a pharmaceutical product there, \nwhich costs significantly less than the same pharmaceutical product may \ncost in the United States. That is a natural instinct of the market \neconomy and of people. But critical to this exercise, of course, is the \nability to get a safe drug.\n  If you go across the border, and you buy a pharmaceutical product \nwhich is alleged to be one thing, and it turns out to be another thing, \nthe damage it causes you is going to be economically much more \nsignificant than the savings which you may have accomplished by \npurchasing that drug across the border.\n  Also, it should be noted that with the Part D pharmaceutical program \nwhich we now have relative to Medicare, the pressure--because \npharmaceutical products are now insured and people receive them under \nthe insurance plan as created under the Part D program, which has been \nan extraordinary success to supplying pharmaceuticals, though its cost \nremains extraordinarily expensive for the next generation of \nAmericans--but pharmaceutical products are now available under an \ninsurance program to most American seniors, and, as a result, if you \nare a senior, one of the people most likely to use a large number of \ndrugs, and most often are on a fixed income and have problems \npurchasing drugs as a result of the fixed income situation--those \nissues were addressed by Part D to a large degree relative to the \nsenior purchasing drugs; and it did create the ancillary problem of \ncreating a huge cost which has to be borne by the next generation--but \nrelative to the supplying of drugs, the pressure which was forcing \npeople to take the chance of purchasing a drug internationally has been \nrelieved to some degree, significantly in the area of senior citizens.\n  I proposed language which would create a safe pharmaceutical \napproach, where you would create an Internet pharmacy approach, where \nyou would create a regime under the FDA where people could go on the \nInternet and buy pharmaceutical products knowing they have been \napproved by the FDA.\n\n  Today, unfortunately, that is not the case. If you go on the \nInternet, and you purchase something through a pharmaceutical firm off \nthe Internet, you do not know whether that product--even though it may \nbe represented to be FDA-approved--is FDA-approved because there is no \nway to certify the\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\nsite you are purchasing from is an FDA-approved supplier.\n  So this reimportation bill is essentially going to create an \natmosphere where those Internet pharmacies are going to become \nbasically the ``wild west'' of supplying drugs in this country, and you \nare going to see people going on to these Internet pharmacy sites and \npurchasing drugs they think are being represented as an American-\napproved drug that has been reimported--and is at a lower price--but \nmay actually be a totally adulterated drug which will do significant \nharm to you.\n  We have seen instances of that already--dramatic instances. Case \nafter case has been reported of people being significantly harmed and \nin some instances dying as a result of buying pharmaceuticals off the \nInternet that turned out not to be what they were represented to be \nfrom international sites.\n  So at a minimum, this reimportation proposal, which has received \nsignificant support in the past because it has a motherhood name on \nit--even though it might be actually creating significant problems for \nchildren and for other people in this country as a result of the risk \nit puts people at--at a minimum, this proposal should be subject to \ncreating some sort of a regime where FDA has the ability to monitor and \nto approve and to make available to the public the knowledge that \nInternet pharmaceutical sites have been approved by the FDA. That is \nwhat my amendment does. It tries to address that.\n  So we should not move forward precipitously in the way that is \nproposed by the Senator from North Dakota. We should not be supporting \nthis simply because it has a nice name on it and because he can hold up \ntwo bottles which are the same drug but costs differently in a managed \neconomy in Canada and a market economy here in the United States. We \nshould, rather, set up a structure where FDA can be sure that when you \nbuy that pharmaceutical product through an Internet site that is \ninternational or from a Canadian pharmacy, that you are getting what \nthey claim you are getting, so when you take that drug, you benefit \nfrom it and are not harmed by it.\n  This all, however, gets to a bigger issue. Probably, there is not \ntime right now to go into it in depth. But the bigger issue is, where \ndo pharmaceutical products come from? Where do all these amazing \nproducts, the biologic products that are saving lives in this country \nand are creating such a much better lifestyle come from? Remember, they \ndo not come from trees, and they are not grown in North Dakota in the \nsugar beet fields. They are developed through processes which involve \nyears--years of investigation and research.\n  The average pharmaceutical product in this country takes 12 years and \n$800 million to bring to the market. Think about that: 12 years and \n$800 million before you can produce a product Americans can take. That \nis a pharmaceutical product. If you are getting in the biologics area, \nwhich is a much more complicated area, it takes even longer. It is even \nmore complex, and in many instances it is even more expensive.\n  It is these products that are changing the life expectancy of people \nand making the quality of life of people so much better. We have \nbasically gone from a medical regime in this Nation where invasive \naction was always the first call, was always the first event, where you \nbasically went under the surgical knife, to a regime where you are \ngiven pharmaceuticals or biologics to try to address a very serious \nillness. It is a huge step, an exponential step in the direction of \nbetter health care and a better lifestyle for Americans and for the \nworld.\n  Where are these products developed? Well, they are developed here in \nthe United States. Why are they developed here in the United States? \nWhy are almost all the major pharmaceutical breakthroughs and all the \nbiologic breakthroughs coming in the United States? Because we have a \nmarket system which allows people to take the risks to develop those \nproducts.\n  We do not fix prices, as they do in Canada or in England, at a rate \nthat is so low that nobody would be willing to invest in developing \nthat product because the return on that investment is too low. We allow \npeople who make the investment, who take the risk, who put the 12 years \nin, who invest $800 million, to get a reasonable return on their \ninvestment and on their effort. As a result, we have the explosion in \nadvances in technology, in medical technology, in biologics, and in \npharmaceuticals.\n  It is a result of the fact that people who want to take that risk, \nand who have the ability to pursue that type of opportunity to make \nlife better for people by creating these pharmaceutical products and \nthese biologic products, have the capacity to get resources to do it. \nIt is called capital markets.\n  Now, capital does not flow for goodwill. People do not invest in \nthings because it makes them feel good, in most instances. People \ninvest where they are going to get the best return on the dollars they \ninvest, or a reasonable return on the dollars they invest. So we have \nto maintain an atmosphere in this country where people are willing to \nput money--cash, capital resources--into the investment and research \nand development of pharmaceutical and biological and device products.\n  But if you listen to the other side of the aisle, almost every \nproposal they come forward with seems to be of the view that these \nproducts are grown in some wheatfield in North Dakota, that they do not \ntake any effort, that they do not require any capital, they do not \nrequire any expertise, research, or time. All they require is to be \nprice fixed, to be limited in their ability to be distributed relative \nto the price that is charged.\n  Time and again, the other side of the aisle has come forward with \nproposals which basically undermine the incentive for capital to flow \ninto these research areas. Believe me, if capital is disincentivized \nfrom going into these areas because they do not get a reasonable \nreturn, they will go somewhere else--they will go into developing \nsoftware, into gaming, into whatever it is that happens to give them a \nreasonable return, into investing in some other country's activities in \nsome area.\n  Capital does not flow out of goodwill into pharmaceutical production, \ninto biologic production, into device production. It flows into those \naccounts because they expect a reasonable return.\n\n  Now, sure, the countries of Canada, England, and the European common \nmarket, to some degree, are living off of the fact that we give people \na reasonable return on our pharmaceuticals and biologics in this \ncountry. That is absolutely true, and it is reasonably disgraceful. In \nfact, in Canada, they threaten to take people's patents away if they \ndon't--they basically capture American patents if they don't sell these \ndrugs at a price which nobody would have invested in them in the first \nplace to produce them were the price fixed at that level. But that is \ntheir policy.\n  Now, we could subscribe to that policy, which is what the other side \nof the aisle wants us to do. They proposed it in Medicare negotiations, \nthey proposed it now and passed it here in the child drug review. They \nproposed it in this reimportation, and they proposed it in the \nnegotiated language relative to Medicare, and in biologic generics. In \nall of these areas they are basically saying: Well, drugs must appear \nin the marketplace. We don't have to be concerned with the fact of \ngetting capital into the investment exercise. We don't have to be \nconcerned with the fact that it takes years and years to research these \nproducts and hundreds of millions of dollars to bring them to the \nmarket, they just appear. We can basically, for lack of a better term, \nkill the goose that is laying the drug or the biologic or the \npharmaceutical or the device that is saving people and not worry about \nit.\n  Well, that is not true. If you were to follow all of the proposals \nfrom the other side of the aisle, or even a significant amount of them, \nwe would see investment in this area start to dry up. We would see a \ncontraction of the production of pharmaceuticals that save lives, of \nbiologics that save lives, of devices that save lives. We would see \nfewer and fewer of those coming to the American people and to the world \nbecause people wouldn't invest in that activity any longer, or the \ninvestments would be significantly curtailed because money would flow \nin other directions.\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\n  This concept of the marketplace totally escapes the other side of the \naisle. This concept that drugs have to actually have some flow of \ncapital behind them to be produced because it takes so long to get them \nto the market, and it takes so much money to actually research them--\nand that is especially true in biologics and equally true in devices. \nIt totally escapes the other side of the aisle. Their idea is, we have \na good line, we have a motherhood statement, let's let people go buy \nthe drugs somewhere else at a price that is fixed at which nobody would \nhave ever produced the drug in the first place if that was the price. \nLet's negotiate so we have a regime of price setting at the Federal \nlevel, which basically eliminates the capacity for that drug to be \ncompetitive.\n  Let's create a biologic generic which basically wipes out the \ncapacity of the true biologic to actually come to the market and be \nsuccessful. Let's create an atmosphere where testing on children of the \ndrugs will basically not have a fiscal return which will make it \nworthwhile to test them on children. Let's do all of those things in \nthe name of the motherhood language of getting a better price for drugs \nfor Americans, ignoring the fact that what you are actually going to \nend up doing is dramatically limiting the number of drugs coming to the \nmarket for Americans, and therefore significantly impacting the quality \nof life of Americans and our ability to advance the dramatic and \nrevolutionary activity that we are seeing in bringing biologics to the \nmarketplace, which are basically curing and have the potential to cure \ndiseases which have been extraordinarily threatening to the American \npopulation for so long.\n  It makes no sense, if you look at the substance of the issue, what \nthey are proposing. It is totally inconsistent. They are saying they \nare doing this to help people. What they are actually ending up doing \nis harming not only the people of today who won't be able to get the \ndrugs because they won't be produced but people in the future because \nthe drugs won't be brought to the market. There is a blindness to the \nfact that market forces are at work. I guess it is just a function of \nthe fact that you want to get out a good press release, so you are \ngoing to send it out. Of course, anybody who takes the position I just \noutlined is immediately demagogued, and the pejorative tool of the drug \nindustry is thrown out there.\n  Well, I am hardly that, since I was one of the few people in this \nChamber who actually aggressively opposed and tried to stop the \nMedicare Part D Program, which was the biggest windfall the drug \nindustry ever got and which was voted for by many of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle and which ended up putting an $8 trillion \nbill which is unpaid for onto our children's future.\n  More importantly, the reason I take the position I take is because I \nbelieve very strongly that America should not give up its lead in one \nof the industries where it is at the cutting edge and where it is \nproducing jobs and where it is producing the intellectual capital that \nis going to keep us a vibrant, strong economy. In addition, we should \nnot give up an industry or undermine an industry and geniuses and \ncreative individuals who are producing products which are saving lives \nand are giving people a better livelihood. So I am not going to sign on \nto these various jingoistic proposals which are brought to the floor \nfor the purposes of putting out good press releases about how I did \nthis or that for motherhood at the expense of undermining the quality \nof care for future generations by basically limiting dramatically the \nability of people to get capital who want to be creative, who want to \ninvest, and who want to do research in the area of producing biologic \nproducts, pharmaceutical products, and medical devices.\n\n  That is why I take the position I take, to say nothing of the fact \nthat if you start haphazardly importing products from the Internet and \nfrom countries such as Canada, as strong as Canada is, without any FDA \noversight or approval of those products, you are going to harm a lot of \npeople at the end of the day. A lot of people are going to be hurt, and \nsome people are going to die as a result of buying products which have \nnot gone through FDA approval and which are not subject to FDA \noversight because they are bought from a pharmacy or a provider in \nCanada, and that product may have come out of India or it may have come \nout of Afghanistan. It may have come out of Pakistan. It may be \nadulterated, and it may kill. The same can be said by a factor of 10 \nrelative to purchasing on Internet pharmacies.\n  So there are some big issues at play. There are big issues at play \nrelative to the future of the health of Americans on the issue of \nimportation, on the issue of negotiation and Medicare, on the issue of \nbiologic generics, and on the issue of making sure that children are \nadequately tested relative to the application of drugs which are \nbrought to the market. There are big issues relative to safety and big \nissues relative to whether this country remains on the cutting edge of \nproducing products that help people and give them a better lifestyle \nwith a biological, pharmaceutical, or medical device. We shouldn't just \npass these proposals willy-nilly for the sake of putting out a nice \npress release.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMint. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1018\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1018.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the notification provision with respect to drugs \n       deemed to have risk evaluation and mitigation strategies)\n\n       In section 214(b)(3)(B) of the bill, insert ``, except with \n     respect to the drug Mifeprex (mifepristone), such assessment \n     shall be submitted 6 months after the applicant is so \n     notified'' before the period at the end.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, my amendment calls for the Food and Drug \nAdministration to conduct an assessment of the risk evaluation and \nmitigation strategy, which we refer to as REMS, for Mifeprex, commonly \nknown as RU-486, within 7 months of the effective date of this \nlegislation.\n  According to the legislation before us, any drug that is currently on \nthe market with restrictions on its distribution or use, which includes \nRU-486, would be required to have a risk evaluation and mitigation \nstrategy. This means that RU-486 would be subject to periodic \nassessment of how well the risk management plan, including its \nrestrictions, is working. Unfortunately, the bill does not establish a \ndeadline for the risk evaluation for RU-486.\n  The current RU-486 abortion regimen was approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration in September of 2000. Since that time, the regimen has \nbeen linked to the deaths of seven women, including three Americans. \nThe public has learned since November of 2004, through the release of \ndocuments by the FDA through a Freedom of Information Act request, that \nover 1,000 additional women have experienced adverse effects from the \nRU-486 regimen, including 9 life-threatening incidences, 232 \nhospitalizations, 116 blood transfusions, and 88 cases of infection. It \nshould be noted this dangerous drug is attacking young, healthy women.\n  I also want to point out the approval process for RU-486 was highly \nirregular in the first place. The drug regimen was approved under FDA \nsubpart H, which is a regulation that applies to certain new drugs used \nfor treating serious or life-threatening illnesses. While certain \nconditions may arise during pregnancy that are dangerous, pregnancy \nitself is hardly a serious or life-threatening illness.\n  The RU-486 regimen actually requires the use of two drugs: RU-486, \nwhich kills the child, and misoprostol,\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\nwhich causes the uterus to expel the dead baby. G.D. Searle, the \nmanufacturer of misoprostol, never sought to have its drug approved by \nthe FDA for abortions. Nevertheless, the FDA, in what appears to be an \nunprecedented decision, mandated that misoprostol be used for \nunapproved ``off-label'' use in an abortion regimen along with RU-486.\n  Finally, the FDA approved the RU-486 regimen based on data submitted \nfrom clinical trials in which there was no control group comparison. \nThis directly violates Federal law and appears to be unprecedented as \nwell.\n  In my opinion, the FDA has not done enough to curb the use of this \ndeadly drug, and for far too long the FDA has put politics ahead of \nscience and ahead of women's health. When the Clinton administration \nexpedited the approval process for RU-486 in the final days of its \ntenure, many medical professionals expressed serious concerns about the \nFDA's rush to bring RU-486 to market. Since then, the statistics have \nproven these concerns to be well-founded.\n  The legislation we are considering today has everything to do with \ndrug safety. Yet we have a drug on the market that has killed several \nwomen and injured many others. My amendment simply sets a 7-month \ndeadline for the FDA to assess the risk evaluation and mitigation \nstrategy for RU-486. Given all the adverse events associated with this \ndrug, this is the least we can do.\n  This is not an abortion issue, it is a women's health issue. Even \nthose who support abortion agree there are serious problems with this \ndrug. Let me read several quotes from abortion supporters which were \npart of a New York Times story that ran last year: ``None of these \nwomen should be dying; it's shocking,'' said Dr. Peter Bours, an \nabortion provider in Portland, OR, who is rethinking whether to offer \npill-based or medical abortions.\n  Dr. Warren Hern, an abortion provider in Denver, said the latest \nreports demonstrated that abortions by RU-486, or Mifeprex, were far \nriskier than the surgical ones. ``I think surgery should be the \nprocedure of choice,'' Dr. Hern said. ``Pills,'' he said, ``are a lousy \nway to perform an abortion.''\n  I quote again from another source: ``The complications associated \nwith RU-486 far exceed the complications of surgical abortion,'' said \nDr. Damon Stutes. He is an abortion provider in Reno, NV. He refuses to \noffer pill-based abortions.\n  Dr. Stutes, whose clinic has been bombed, said he was uneasy about \nagreeing with abortion proponents on anything. But the truth is the \ntruth, he said.\n  Another quote:\n\n       One needs to tell patients that the medical procedure, even \n     though it seems more natural, may be more likely to result in \n     death.\n\n  That is Dr. Phillip G. Stubblefield, a professor of obstetrics and \ngynecology at Boston University.\n  It is clear that even the supporters of abortion believe this drug is \ndangerous. It also appears that even the leader of the abortion \nindustry--Planned Parenthood--supports actions by the FDA to further \nexamine the safety of the drug. Dr. Vanessa Cullins, vice president for \nMedical Affairs at Planned Parenthood, told the San Francisco \nChronicle:\n\n       We are glad there will be continuing investigations by the \n     FDA. We will work with the CDC, the FDA, and academicians to \n     figure this out.\n\n  The FDA needs to quickly complete its risk evaluation on RU-486. That \nis what my amendment guarantees. I urge my colleagues to support it. I \nunderstand that Senator Kennedy will accept a voice vote on this. I \nlook forward to supporting it, along with all of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 990\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to some of the debate on \nthe floor of the Senate in opposition to the amendment I have offered \nwith many colleagues dealing with the reimportation of prescription \ndrugs. Especially entertaining was to hear the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, describe North Dakota wheatfields. The Senate is \na place of fascinating and interesting debate. I expect we will have \nmore of that in the coming hours, leading up to a vote tomorrow on a \ncloture motion on this amendment.\n  The continued and insistent reference to this amendment posing safety \nrisks, or risks of unsafe prescription drugs, is at odds with \neverything we know to be the case. I described Dr. David Kessler, and I \nsuggested if anybody knows a more important, better informed expert \nthan Dr. David Kessler, who was head of the FDA for nearly 8 years, \ntell me his or her name. I described the statement that Dr. David \nKessler made that says this will make the prescription drug supply \nsafer. In fact, the regime of safety we have put into this amendment is \nappropriate, important, and will mean that we will be able to allow \nreimportation without a safety risk.\n  Despite the evidence, we continue to hear this issue. I was thinking, \nas I was listening to this a while ago, about the Lincoln-Douglas \ndebates, when Lincoln became enormously exasperated at one point and he \nsaid to Douglas: Tell me, how many legs does a horse have?\n  Douglas said: Well, four, of course.\n  Lincoln said: Now, if you were to call the tail of a horse a leg, \nthen how many legs would a horse have?\n  Douglas said: Well, five.\n  Lincoln said: You see, that is where you are wrong. Just because you \ncall the tail a leg doesn't make it a leg at all.\n  The same principle holds true now on the floor of the Senate. You can \nsay what you want, but that doesn't make it true. Safety issues? That \ndoesn't exist in the amendment we are talking about. This will make the \ndrug supply safer. While I am speaking of Lincoln and Douglas, let me \nsay something else that Lincoln said, which has always been interesting \nto me. He was describing his opponent's arguments. He said: Your \nargument is as thin as the homeopathic soup made from boiling the \nshadow of a pigeon that has been starved to death.\n  Wasn't Abraham Lincoln wonderful? That description can still exist \nfor some of the arguments we are hearing these days on some of these \nissues.\n  I hope my colleague was not serious a few moments ago when he said \nthis is an amendment that is not worthy and is put out by a bunch of \npeople who want to put out press releases and aren't concerned about \nthe safety of the drug supply. My colleague surely doesn't mean to say \nthat Senators Grassley, McCain, Snowe, and Collins on his side and \nSenators Kennedy, Stabenow, Brown, and so many on our side--the 33 \nSenators who have come to a serious issue with a thoughtful proposal--\ndid so because they want a press release. My colleague knows better \nthan that. He perhaps ought to tell the Senate he knows better than \nthat.\n  I respect those who disagree with this amendment. I hope they will \nrespect as well our determination to correct something we see as a \nserious problem. When my colleague says we don't want to give up our \nlead, describing our lead in pharmaceuticals and the development of \nprescription drugs, I don't want to give that up. Let me tell you \nanother lead we don't want to give up; that is, the lead in providing \nthe highest prices in the world to the American consumer who needs \nprescription drugs. That is a lead we ought to relinquish right now. I \nwonder if my colleague would agree with that.\n  Mr. President, this is an interesting debate, a useful debate. It \nwill conclude tomorrow with the vote. My colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Stabenow, has gone across the bridge that connects our two \ncountries, taken busloads of senior citizens and has been involved in \nthis issue for many years, believing that we ought to insist on fair \npricing for prescription drugs for the American people. I am pleased \nthat she was one of the people who helped put together the bill \nintroduced by 33 Senators, and I am pleased that she is a strong \nadvocate for the amendment that we have added to this piece of \nunderlying legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment we have \nput together, led by the Senator from North Dakota. I thank him for his \npassionate leadership and advocacy and the way he is able to speak in \nvery commonsense terms about what this is all about. What we are \ntalking about is common sense. We are talking about whether we have the \nmost competition\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nthat will allow the best price for people related to their medicine. I \nalso am looking around for Senator Brown, who is also here to speak. I \nthank him publicly for his help on another amendment that relates to \ncompetition and closing patent loopholes relating to generic drugs. I \nthank him again. Senator Brown has been a wonderful advocate on these \nissues.\n  I find it so interesting whenever we hear that we cannot lower the \nprice of prescription drugs without losing research. Let me comment on \nthat first. Here is what is happening today as it relates to the \ndevelopment of new medicine. We all want that. We all want that, those \nof us who supported overwhelmingly, the 63 Members of the Senate who \nvoted for stem cell research to provide new lifesaving research and \ntools for our researchers. We came together and said, yes, we want new \nlifesaving research.\n  That is not what this debate is about. The debate is about whether \nthere is going to be a closed market to folks who get to set the price \nwithout competition or whether there will be competition so people can \nafford to buy medicine. The reality is that our structure is such right \nnow, as it relates to the way we bring drugs to market, that you start \nwith basic research, of which last year $29 billion was paid for by the \nAmerican taxpayer--$29 billion. Now, the industry then added another \n$39 billion, according to the PhARMA Web site. They are allowed to \nwrite off their research as a business expense, or take an additional \namount--the R tax credit on top of that to write off their research. \nSo the taxpayers are paying, it is fair to say, the majority of what it \ncosts in basic research right now for new lifesaving medicine.\n  Personally, I am willing to do that because I think it is incredibly \nimportant. It is in our public interest. Having all of us together as \ntaxpayers invest in the National Institutes of Health and other \nlifesaving research makes sense to me. After we do that, we allow the \ncompanies to take that information and research and begin to develop \nmedicine. That is fine, too. We then allow up to a 20-year patent, so \nthat the company that does this development can recoup their costs \nwithout the same kind of competition from a generic company, another \nkind of company. So we give them a privileged status. We cover their \ncosts, after we as taxpayers have helped them or may have fully funded \nthe research done in the beginning. So we go through all this, and all \nthat I ask on behalf of the people of Michigan and all I think we are \nasking for is, when they get done with the patent, people be able to \nafford to buy the medicine and that we have the kind of competition \nthat allows that to happen.\n  One piece is to make sure patents are not extended beyond 20 years \nunfairly by manipulation. I will have an amendment that deals with \nclosing some loopholes. The other is to make sure we open our borders \nto allow our pharmacies, our hospitals, our medical schools, all those \nwho are providing prescription drugs to consumers, to be able to \npurchase those and get the best price.\n  In Michigan, it may be from Michigan or it may be from Ohio or \nWisconsin, but it may be 5 minutes across the bridge in Canada. In \nfact, Mr. President, that is what we find 5 minutes across the bridge. \nI have had a lot of opportunities to put seniors on buses to go to a \npharmacy in Canada to see the fact that you are looking at 30-, \n40-, 50-percent cheaper prices. I think of my sister-in-law when I say \nthis. She was diagnosed with breast cancer, and thank God is doing well \nand has recovered. But when I look at the drug Tamoxifen that many \nbreast cancer patients are required to take, or are asked to take, in \nMichigan, the last time I looked, it was about $360 a month for that \nmedicine. Five minutes across the bridge, it is $60. That is a huge \ndifference. That is a huge difference in somebody's ability to get the \ntreatment they need for breast cancer. That can be replayed over and \nover again as it relates to medicine.\n  Now, what is also interesting is that prescription drugs are being \nbrought across the border every day legally by the companies \nthemselves. Lipitor, which was developed in Michigan--and I am proud of \nthat--is manufactured in Ireland. They bring it back. There is no \nargument about safety when they are bringing it back. We have, right \nnow, around the world, from Slovakia to China to India, medications \nthat are being brought into this country by the companies themselves, \nunder safe conditions.\n  Our legislation puts into place safety requirements that will allow \nthe same thing to happen if it is a wholesaler, a pharmacy doing \nbusiness with another pharmacy. There is no rocket science here. The \nvery same safety provisions can be put into place. We also know that, \nin doing that, it is important to put that language directly into this \nbill. It is important. We have put in there a chain-of-custody \nrequirement to ensure that drugs are handled not only by authorized \npersons but shipments must use anticounterfeiting technology to assure \nthe products' integrity.\n  We do a number of things that relate to registering with the FDA and \nagreeing to strict requirements to ensure safety. But those \nrequirements are not all in the bill. Why is that? Because we know that \nin the past we have seen--we see again now--a second-degree amendment \nto say that citizens cannot get the best price, and pharmacies cannot \ndo business with pharmacies across the border, unless the Secretary \ncertifies safety. And we know that for whatever political reasons, that \nhas not happened over the years. That is actually current law.\n\n  To get beyond the politics of this, we have worked on a bipartisan \nbasis, with wonderful bipartisan support, to actually put the safety \nprovisions that are required into the bill so the certification by the \nSecretary is not necessary.\n  We have had legislation passed by the Senate with wonderful \nbipartisan support in the last few years on related issues that involve \nreimportation. Last July, 68 Senators voted for an amendment to \nprohibit U.S. Customs and Border Protection from stopping individuals \nfrom importing FDA-approved drugs--individual reimportation.\n  I thank Senator Vitter for his leadership. I have been pleased to \nwork with him on this issue of individuals being able to import \nmedicines for themselves. Senator Vitter and I also worked together to \nmake sure trade agreements cannot be used as a backdoor way to stop \nreimportation of cheaper prescription drugs into this country.\n  We are already on record as supporting this effort to lower \nprescription drug prices and create competition. It is my hope that, \nonce again, in this bill we will reaffirm that we support the FDA \ncreating safety regimens--we know they exist--to be able to bring \nmedicine safely into the United States from other countries, and we \nwill no longer allow a group--it is the only group I know that is able \nto stop trade at the border. Everyone talks about free and open trade, \nand yet in Michigan you can bring auto supplies back and forth every \nday, you can bring all kinds of agricultural products, you can bring \nanything back and forth across the border except medicine, except \nprescription drugs, unless you are a drug company. Drug companies can, \nbut if you are somebody trying to make sure you get the lowest possible \nprices to consumers through a pharmacy, a hospital, medical school, or \nother businesses, you are not allowed to do it. It doesn't make any \nsense.\n  I believe we need to take off this protectionism which has been in \nplace for years which has put consumers and businesspeople, frankly, \ninto a situation where they are paying higher prices for medicine than \nthey should.\n  This is not about research. I conclude by saying that according to \nSEC filings, 2\\1/2\\ times more is spent on marketing and advertising \nbrand-name prescription drugs in the United States than is spent on \nresearch. This is not about research. We as taxpayers are leading the \nway on funding research, and we all support doing that. This is about \ncompetition versus protectionism and whether consumers will get the \nvery best price for lifesaving medicine.\n  I urge the adoption of our amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1018\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I understand there is no further debate \nwith respect to the pending amendment No.\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\n1018, so I ask that the amendment be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, amendment No. 1018 is the DeMint amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1018) was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa yield to me for \n1 minute?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from Iowa.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 990\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of Senator Dorgan's \namendment called the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act. \nWe want to add the provisions on the importation of drugs to this \nmeasure. Obviously, I support that effort. That legislation is the \nresult of a collaborative effort by this Senator, Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Snowe, and Senator Kennedy to finally make drug importation \nlegal in this country. This is one effort which I hope the new \nDemocratic Congress can finally get passed because last time, my own \nparty did not want to see this passed, even though I worked hard to get \nthat done.\n  Now is the time for us to make this happen. This is a golden \nopportunity this year to get it done. I think we are well on the way to \ngetting it done.\n  I have been a longtime proponent of drug importation. In the years \n2000, 2002, and 2003, I supported amendments permitting importation of \nprescription drugs from one country--Canada.\n  In 2004, Senator Kennedy and I worked together on a bill that would \nauthorize drug importation, but it did not survive the partisan \npolitics of that year.\n  I then introduced my own drug importation bill in 2004 with the \nnumber S. 2307. After introducing my bill, I began working in \nconjunction with the efforts of Senator Dorgan, Senator Snowe, and \nSenator Kennedy. So in this provision before us, we combined our \nefforts so that we could all get behind the same bill and have a better \nchance of getting it passed. Of course, that is where we are, working \ntogether this very minute.\n  Making it legal for Americans to import their prescription drugs is a \ntop priority at the grassroots level, as it shows up in my 99 town \nmeetings I have every year in each of our 99 counties, and I have been \ndoing that for 26 years. So I think I have a feel for what the \ngrassroots of my State wants Congress to hear.\n  This is one issue about which I constantly hear, although I am \nprobably hearing it a little bit less now that we have the Part D \nprovisions of the Medicare bill because for people who couldn't afford \ndrugs, who maybe relied on imports or at least drugs from other \ncountries, they are able to get them a little better through the \nsubsidization under the Part D Program. But I still hear about this \nissue, and that is why I am still working to get it passed. So this \nneeds to be a top priority in Washington as it is at the grassroots of \nAmerica.\n  I have long advocated allowing American consumers access to safe \ndrugs from other countries, but I have not looked at this solely or \neven most importantly as a health issue. I have looked at it more often \nas a free-trade issue. Imports of any kind coming into our country \ncreate competition and keep domestic industry of all segments of our \neconomy more responsive to the consumer, giving the consumer what they \nwant at a price they are willing to pay and a quality they care about.\n  In the United States, we seem to import anything that the consumer \nwants to buy in America, but we don't do it for pharmaceuticals. So why \nnot, with this legislation, do for pharmaceuticals what we do for \neverything else American consumers want to buy? That is what breaking \ndown the barriers to trade is all about. That is where our country has \nbeen for 50 years, breaking down barriers to trade around the world. \nYet we keep this barrier up. Consumers in the United States then pay \nfar more for prescription drugs than those in other countries.\n  If Americans could legally and safely access prescription drugs \noutside the United States, then drug companies would be forced to \nreevaluate pricing strategies. More competition would have an impact. \nThey would no longer be able to gouge the American consumer by making \nthem pay more than a fair share of the higher costs of research and \ndevelopment, which is a resource we need for research and development, \nbut why should just the American consumers pay for that?\n  It is true that pharmaceutical companies do not like the idea of \nopening up America to the global marketplace. They want to keep the \nUnited States closed to other markets in order to charge higher prices \nhere. However, with this amendment, prescription drug companies will be \nforced to be competitive and establish fair prices in America.\n  The drug companies will try to find, of course, loopholes to protect \ntheir bottom line, but I think our amendment is comprehensive enough to \nkeep that action illegal. It would not allow, for instance, \nmanufacturers to discriminate against registered exporters or \nimporters. It would prohibit drug companies from engaging in any \nactivities to restrict, to prohibit, or to delay the importation of a \nqualifying drug. The amendment would give the Federal Trade Commission \nthe authority to prevent this kind of possible abuse of the system.\n  I also understand that there will be an attempt to kill this \namendment, as it has been, I believe, in the years 2000, 2002, and \n2003, by an amendment that would require a certification about health \nand safety. That amendment is designed to kill the underlying Dorgan \namendment. It is a clever amendment and for sure can legitimately be \ndetermined to be a poison pill.\n  Our efforts develop an effective and safe system that gives Americans \naccess to lower prices. This amendment requires that all imported drugs \nbe approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The amendment sets a \nstringent set of safety requirements that must be met before Americans \ncan import drugs from that country.\n  The amendment requires all exporting pharmacies and importing \nwholesalers to be registered with the Food and Drug Administration, as \nwell as being inspected. It gives the authority for the FDA to inspect \nentire distribution chains of imported drugs, and it sets very \nstringent penalties for violation of the safety requirements in this \nbill, including criminal penalties and up to 10 years in prison.\n  Don't be fooled by the poison pill amendment to which I just \nreferred. Voting for that amendment is a vote to kill drug importation.\n  With the Dorgan amendment, we are going to get this job done because \nwe need to make sure Americans have even greater, more affordable \naccess to wonder drugs by further opening the doors to competition in \nthe global pharmaceutical industry.\n  I think Americans have been waiting for this for a long period of \ntime. When a country such as ours allows every other product to come \ninto this country that the consumer wants for the best price and the \nbest quality, there is no reason we should make an exception for \npharmaceuticals. We must make sure they have access to these affordable \nprescription drugs. So I urge my colleagues to support the Dorgan \namendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to chime in for a minute on this \namendment, and I want to set a little background. Why do we want to \nimport prescription drugs? What is the reason behind it? The reason is \nthat there is not a true international market in pharmaceuticals. \nSenator Stabenow quoted a figure of $29 billion worth of Government \nresearch. That is not quite accurate. There is $29 billion that goes to \nNIH, but that is not all related to drug development. Probably half of \nthat is. So we do have a great investment in drugs. There is no \nquestion\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\nthat the American consumer subsidizes the pharmaceuticals of almost \nevery other nation in this world. So the purpose behind this amendment \nis a good one.\n  I would draw attention to the fact that Senator Brown and I passed a \ndrug reimportation bill in the late 1990s that became law, and \nPresident Clinton signed it. Donna Shalala, however, under the same \nguidelines, refused to carry out that mandate--that bill is still on \nthe books, by the way--claiming there was nothing they could do that \nwould make them safe and that they could assure they were safe.\n  I am going to vote for this amendment, and I think it is right that \nwe should develop a worldwide market on pharmaceuticals, but I am not \nsure we are going to accomplish this. Having authored the first bill on \ndrug reimportation when I was a Member in the House, what I have seen \nis that the problem is much bigger than what we are attacking. I find \nit kind of peculiar and strange that we haven't gone a little further. \nWhat really needs to happen is we need to tell all our friends around \nthe world that tell the pharmaceutical companies what price they will \npay for drugs, we need to tell them what price we will pay for their \nproducts. As soon as we did that, guess what. There would be a \nworldwide market on pharmaceuticals. We may get there through \nreimportation, but I don't think so. I think it is going to get \nsqueezed down. I think greed conquers technological difficulty almost \nevery time.\n  So I think this is a good step, but if we really want to solve this \nproblem, let us put an amendment on the floor which says that any \ncountry that essentially fixes the price on pharmaceuticals, their \nproducts coming into our country will have their prices fixed. Can you \nimagine if we were to tell BMW what they are going to get for a BMW \n531, or Volkswagen what they are going to get for one of their \nvehicles, or Toyota what they are going to sell a car for? That is \nessentially what they are doing to the pharmaceutical industry in this \ncountry.\n  I believe this is a good amendment, and I am supportive of \nreimportation, but I don't believe it solves the problem. I don't want \nthe American people to think that if we pass this, all of a sudden the \nprice of drugs is going to come down. It will not. It is great that we \nare doing it, but we are not going far enough. We need to ask the \nadministration to carry out the strength of their ability through \nExecutive orders to create true competition throughout the country and \nthroughout the world on pharmaceutical prices.\n  Regardless of all the precautions and the well-thought-out plans of \nSenator Dorgan--and I know Senator Brown has worked on this for years, \nas has Senator Stabenow and Senator Vitter and several others--I \nbelieve they will get around it. I believe they will sign contracts for \nfixed quantities of drugs, and then the countries that have the \npotential to take a drug that was produced here or produced by a \nmanufacturer that is based out of this country, they will limit the \namount of drugs that are available to them based on the contract they \nsign for the number of drugs. So we will have made everybody feel \nbetter, but we will not really have created a worldwide market for \npharmaceuticals. That is what I think we have to do.\n  I would like to put out to the author of this amendment, as well as \nthe sponsors, that we ought to think bigger on how to handle this \nbecause what we really have is one industry where there is not true \nfree trading. We are not ever going to get the benefits, we are not \never going to relieve the burden of the American consumer, who is \npaying to subsidize drugs in Germany, in England, in France, and in \nJapan, we are not ever going to take that burden off until we really \ncreate a true worldwide market in pharmaceuticals. I am just hesitant \nto believe this is going to accomplish it.\n  Like I said, I am going to vote for it. I believe it is a step in the \nright direction, but I think we need to be more bold. If we really \nbelieve in the benefits of international free trade, then we should do \nwhatever is in our power to insist it become an international market \nfor pharmaceuticals. That way, the pharmaceutical companies won't have \nto use the only market there is in our country to subsidize the \nvariable costs and the research that they contribute to a lot of the \ndrugs that come today.\n  So I am supportive, I think it will pass, but I would reach out to \nthe other Members who are interested and say: Let's do something \nbigger. Let's do something that will really fix it and do it fairly \nquickly. We will have a thriving pharmaceutical industry that way. It \ntruly will be based on competition. Intellectual properties that are \ntruly researched and supported by the country--we as Americans, if we \nhave done that, we will get the better benefit from it if we have a \ntrue international market. I think the drug companies would like to see \nthat as well.\n  I understand they are trying to get return on invested assets. I \nbelieve it is important that everyone has a fair price for a \npharmaceutical and that people make money when they sell a \npharmaceutical. But we have to have an international market, and we \nhave to solve it that way.\n  I thank Senator Brown for allowing me the time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 985\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coburn for his always \ninnovative approach and his support of this and for all he does in \nworking on health care issues generally and especially on prescription \ndrugs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and on behalf of Senator Brownback and myself, I call up \namendment No. 985.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Brownback-Brown \namendment, No. 985, which provides incentives for pharmaceutical \ncompanies to develop and manufacture treatments for neglected tropical \ndiseases. According to the World Health Organization, more than 1 \nbillion people--that is one of every six people worldwide--are affected \nby at least one neglected tropical disease. In addition, neglected \ntropical diseases claim roughly 500,000 lives every year. However, less \nthan 1 percent of the roughly 1,400 drugs registered between 1975 and \n1999 treated such diseases.\n  This disparity is obviously due to the lack of financial incentives \nfor pharmaceutical companies to bring neglected tropical disease \ntreatments to market because these diseases disproportionately affect \nlow-income countries, mainly in Africa. Creating incentives for \ncompanies to invest in treatments for these diseases is not only in our \ncountry's national interest, but it is consistent with the longstanding \ntradition of this country of caring for those less fortunate around the \nworld.\n  This amendment would award a priority review voucher to any company \nthat brings a neglected tropical disease treatment to market. Priority \nreview is an existing FDA process by which drugs are reviewed in 6 \nmonths as opposed to the average time of 18 months. This priority \nreview voucher would be transferable and could be applied to any drug \nin a company's pipeline.\n  This voucher, which would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars \nfor a company with a new blockbuster drug, would also benefit \nconsumers. That is because it would give consumers earlier access to a \nnew prescription drug. Most importantly, creating incentives for \npharmaceutical companies to develop and manufacture neglected tropical \ndisease treatments will obviously save lives.\n  I commend Senator Brownback for his hard work on behalf of \nimpoverished populations who desperately need our attention. He is \noffering Members of this body the opportunity to simultaneously save \nlives in developing nations, get U.S. consumers access to new medicines \nmore quickly, and engage the drug industry in a win-win proposition. It \nis a rare opportunity, and I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport the Brownback-Brown amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1011\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments on two other \namendments, the first being the Stabenow amendment, which I have also \ncosponsored, along with Senators Lott and Thune. That amendment will \nsave U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars while restoring the \nintegrity of the citizen petition process. That is important because \nthe citizen petition process is fundamental to our Nation's democratic \nsystem.\n  Under U.S. law, individuals and organizations have the right and \nshould have the right to petition the Federal Government, which is \nanother way of saying they have a right to communicate their views and \nhave their views heard. The Federal Government is, after all, an \nemployee of the American people. Americans absolutely should have the \nright to weigh in on Government policies and actions.\n  Unfortunately, some brand-name pharmaceutical companies have \nregularly exploited the citizen petition process, filing frivolous \npetitions solely for the purpose of delaying the approval of generic \ndrugs. They have been quite successful at it. Since 2003, brand drug \ncompanies have filed dozens and dozens of citizen petitions trying to \nstop or delay FDA approval of competing generic products. Ninety-five \npercent--roughly 19 in 20--of these petitions have been denied \noutright. What about the other 5 percent? FDA either hasn't acted on \nthem or has approved them in whole or in part because they had no other \nchoice--the brand companies had simply reiterated a factual issue that \nhad already been addressed by FDA. In other words, even the approved \npetitions, the approved 5 percent, were frivolous.\n  While drugmakers waste FDA's time and taxpayers' money, American \npatients are forced to continue paying top dollar--the name-brand \nprice--for the medicines they need. Frivolous citizen petitions have \ncreated delays that often range from 11 to 15 months, preventing price \ncompetition for drugs that generate millions of dollars in revenue each \nday. American consumers--American taxpayers, who help finance Medicare, \nMedicaid, and VA health care--can't afford it. These costs are borne \nnot just by consumers and taxpayers but also employers.\n  I have worked closely with Senator Stabenow to make sure this \namendment doesn't interfere with the right of individuals or companies \nto petition FDA and that the amendment ensures these individuals that \nthe concerns raised in their petitions will still be taken seriously by \nFDA. What this amendment does do is fight back against the \nunjustifiable and costly delays caused by frivolous petitions submitted \nfor the express purpose of blocking price competition in the \nmarketplace.\n  No one, not the drug industry or any other industry, should be \nallowed to make a mockery of one of our democratic rights--the right to \npetition our Government--particularly at the expense of patients and \ntaxpayers. Ms. Stabenow's amendment, cosponsored by Senator Thune and \nSenator Lott, will put a stop to a tactic which is as costly as it is \nunethical. I urge every Member of this body to support it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 990\n\n  Mr. President, I also would briefly speak out on the Dorgan \nreimportation amendment, joining Senators Grassley and Stabenow and so \nmany others in both parties in supporting the reimportation amendment.\n  Some time ago, about 10 years ago, from my northeast Ohio \ncongressional district when I served in the House of Representatives, \nalong with the Presiding Officer, I used to sponsor bus trips to Canada \nwhere we would take mostly senior citizens to a Canadian drugstore \nright across the river from Detroit--Windsor--which was about a 3- or \n4-hour bus drive from Lorain County, where I lived. We would take a \nbusload of 40 seniors and others--mostly seniors, as I said. We would \nbuy prescription drugs in Canada--same dosage, same package, same drug \nmanufacturer, for half or even sometimes a third the cost because the \nCanadian Government directly negotiated on behalf of 30 million \nCanadians, negotiated directly with the drug company for specifically \nless expensive drugs. It was clear to me then that reimportation was \nlegislation we needed so seniors did not have to go to Canada; instead, \nthat wholesalers, the Drug Marts and the CVS's of the world and the \nmom-and-pop drugstores can negotiate, could get those prices wholesale \nfrom Canadian drugmakers or companies and bring those prices \nsignificantly down for American consumers.\n\n  As Senator Coburn said, when we were House Members we passed \nlegislation 8 or 9 years ago. That legislation was never implemented \nthe way it should have been. The Dorgan amendment will save money for \nAmerica's seniors, for America's drug consumers, for prescription drug \nusers. It is an important amendment, and I ask for support for the \nStabenow amendment, the\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\nDorgan amendment, and the Brownback-Brown amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I stand today in support of an amendment to \nS. 1082 offered by Senator Dorgan and several of our colleagues. This \namendment is identical to a bill sponsored by the Senator from North \nDakota, a bill I am proud to cosponsor.\n  We have a serious problem today with drug prices all across our land. \nThe American people have asked us to do something constructive about \nthis crisis. Why is it Americans pay the world's highest prices for \nprescription drugs? This is simply not fair, and I have to believe we \ncan do better in America. While the issues contributing to prescription \ndrug prices are many and complex, this amendment, the Pharmaceutical \nMarket Access and Drug Safety Act, offers a genuine and workable piece \nof the solution.\n  It is no secret to anyone that Americans already import many \nprescription drugs, and I have heard from constituents in my home State \nof Pennsylvania about buying drugs outside of this country. A recent \nstudy shows that would cost from 35 to 55 percent less than \nconstituents of mine are paying. They can pay a much lower price if \nthey are able to get prescriptions from another country. Seniors who \nare living on limited incomes are especially vulnerable and need to cut \ncosts wherever they can.\n  We all know the high cost of health care across all of our States is \nprohibitive for so many vulnerable citizens--children, working \nfamilies, and older citizens. The reality is when the monthly budget \nhas been spent on necessities such as food or childcare, doctors' \nvisits, housing, transportation--when all those costs are incurred, \nmany families do not have money left over for medicine. These \nindividuals may have no choice but to forgo needed medicine and hope \nfor the best.\n  Another recent study found 43 percent of uninsured Americans ages 19 \nto 64, and even 18 percent of insured adults, did not fill a \nprescription because of cost. This is in the richest country in the \nworld. We can do a lot better than that, and we must do better than \nthat.\n  I support this legislation because it gives us the opportunity to \nhelp families in America, and to do so safely. There are a number of \nsafety features that are intended to guarantee that only safe and \neffective--let me say that again, only safe and effective--FDA-approved \ndrugs are imported across our borders. These safety features are \ncomprehensive. For purposes of time, I want to highlight a few.\n  First, this act allows only the importation of FDA-approved medicines \nwith a chain of custody, to ensure that drugs are handled only by \nauthorized persons. In most cases, the medicines that are imported \nunder this act are identical to the medications sold in the United \nStates--literally the same medications made by the same manufacturers.\n  Exporters would be required to maintain detailed records and a sample \nof each lot sent to the U.S., so that the FDA can conduct testing on \nany lot at any time. The FDA would have broad authorities, including \nthe power to cease importation of a drug or to suspend a registered \nexporter without notice. The FDA also has the authority to inspect all \nfacilities in the chain of custody of a drug.\n  The bottom line is this bill gives the FDA broad authority and the \nresources to ensure that imported drugs are in fact safe. It is \nunacceptable that working parents have to make a choice between \nmedicine they cannot afford for their child and making the rent payment \non time. It is unacceptable that older citizens have to choose between \npaying for needed medication and paying for food.\n  This Chamber can do something about this challenge, can do something \nabout this Hobson's choice so many families face every day in America. \nThe Dorgan amendment provides an effective regulatory framework to \nensure that imported drugs are safe for our families. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support this amendment which will provide an invaluable \npiece of the solution to making FDA-approved prescription drugs \naffordable for everyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.) The senior Senator from Maine \nis recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that has \nbeen introduced by Senator Dorgan with whom I have joined as a \ncosponsor regarding drug importation.\n  First of all, I commend Senator Dorgan for his longstanding \nleadership and advocacy on this issue which has been for the better \npart of a decade. Regretfully, we are still at a point where we have \nbeen unable to pass legislation that would create a drug safety regime \nfor drug importation.\n  That is the purpose of our amendment, Members of the Senate, as we \ntoday consider legislation to address an essential new function in how \nthe FDA will finance the cost of reviewing new drugs; that is, the \ncritical process of bringing new medications to market to Americans.\n  At the same time, this bill has directly raised a number of issues in \nhow we assure that drugs are as safe as they should be, how we can \nbring new low-cost generic biologics to market. Key to this debate on \nthis legislation that is pending before the Senate is the adage, which \nwe have heard time and time again, that is: A drug which is not \naffordable is neither safe nor effective.\n  The simple fact is, even with the new Part D prescription drug \nbenefit as part of the Medicare Program that has been in place for more \nthan 2 years now, we still have at least 60 million Americans overall \nthat today pay the full price of medications, have no help whatsoever \nbecause many have no health insurance or their insurance does not \nprovide coverage for prescription drugs.\n  At the same time, the price that Americans are paying is the highest \nprice in the world. For those of us who are fortunate to have \nprescription drug coverage, the estimated cost of medications is part \nof the major exorbitant increase in the cost of health care.\n  Many of my colleagues have recognized that our system lacks \ncompetition that would assure our constituents more affordable access \nto lifesaving medications. That is why I am very pleased to join with \nthe Senator from North Dakota, and we have the support of a bipartisan \ngroup of colleagues in the Senate, along with Senators Grassley and \nKennedy and Senators McCain and Stabenow who are unified with us in \nsupporting this bipartisan approach.\n  Today, our voices echo those of 8 out of 10 Americans who are calling \nfor safe importation. After nearly 3 years of awaiting Senate \nconsideration of our legislation in 11 related hearings on this subject \nin the Senate, we simply must move forward. The reason is abundantly \nclear. We know the cost of health care is rapidly rising in America.\n  Prescription drug prices have contributed to that exorbitant \nincrease. Compared to 1990, nearly twice as much of our health care \ndollar goes to medications. As the GAO has readily told us, the cost of \nprescription drugs commonly used by seniors has consistently increased \nat two to three times the rate of inflation, as indicated by this\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\nchart, when you are comparing brand drugs, generics, and the CPI.\n  That is why we can no longer afford to postpone any action. We have \nacted before. We acted on legislation back in 2000. Then we also took \naction with respect to the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003 which \ncreated a Part D prescription drug program. We have found the \nrequirements for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify \nthe safety and savings of drug importation have blocked any action; it \nhas become a roadblock to safe importation.\n  While FDA was unable to point to a single individual harmed by \nCanadian drugs--and in Europe, where they have had a track record of \nmore than 30 years of parallel trading--it has proven that this trade \ncan be conducted safely.\n  Time and time again, they have demonstrated that their process of \nparallel trading has worked without any harm to their consumers. \nWithout a doubt, Americans would not be turning to imports if there was \nnot substantial savings. Indeed, the CBO has told us that countries \nfrom which we would import under this bill would pay 35 to 55 percent \nless for a brand prescription drug. Let me repeat that--35 to 55 \npercent less than we pay today.\n  In other words, American consumers are paying 35 to 55 percent more \nthan foreign consumers when it comes to medications. That is \nremarkable. We have seen so many objections to this legislation for the \nbetter part of a decade. That is why we have taken it upon ourselves to \ndevelop a regime that has been incorporated in this amendment and in \nour legislation that would address every facet, every issue that is \nassociated with safety in order to allow drug importation to occur.\n  As I said earlier, the European Union has already engaged in parallel \ntrading for three decades without incident. As seen here on this chart, \nwhere we have incorporated 31 different key safety provisions in our \nlegislation, and compare that to the Medicare Modernization Act that \npassed in 2003 that created the Part D prescription drug benefit to the \nMedicare Program, only 6 provisions that related to safety were \nincorporated in that landmark initiative.\n  We include 31 different initiatives to address every single safety-\nrelated issue that has emerged in this debate. Whether it has been on \nthe floor of the Senate, whether it has been in the course of hearings \nor elsewhere, we have addressed every safety-related issue to create a \nregime that should create the assurance that this can be done safely \nand without harm to Americans so they can benefit from lower priced \nmedications.\n  Americans deserve to have the lower priced medications. The FDA can \nconduct this program. They can conduct this regime. They should work \nproactively to assure these drugs are safe. We give them the means and \nthe wherewithal and the resources in order to accomplish this. We \ncomprehensively address the various concerns that have been raised \nmonths and years about drug importation so we can get something done.\n  People say: Well, let's just certify safety. Well, as I have said \nearlier, it is a roadblock. It is an impediment to get anything done. \nIt essentially becomes the poison pill. We have tried certification. We \nhave given the Secretary of Health and Human Services under two \nadministrations--this administration and the previous administration--\nthe ability to do that, to certify it. They are unwilling to do so \nbecause they have said they do not have the resources, they do not have \nthe means.\n  Well, we are giving them the means and the resources. But to pass \nanother amendment that simply calls for the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to certify drug importation is a roadblock. It is a road \nto nowhere with respect to this initiative. That is why Senator Dorgan \nand I took a different route.\n  We address all the safety questions. We do not certify to ensure \nsafety, we take action with these provisions. What we do is employ the \nmeasures to actually make drug importation safe.\n  Opponents claim importation will cause harm. But they fail to note \nthat the greatest threat to the safety of Americans is the inability to \ntake a drug as it is prescribed. That exacts a toll on thousands, if \nnot millions, of Americans each and every year, not to mention lives \nlost.\n\n  Some say Americans would receive drugs from illegitimate sources, but \nunder our legislation, Americans will receive imported drugs from 32 \ncountries with high standards. In most cases Americans will purchase an \nimported prescription drug from their local pharmacies just as they do \ntoday. The pharmacies will receive these drugs from the U.S. \nwholesalers which import them. These wholesalers will have been \nregistered. They will be inspected. They will be monitored by the FDA. \nThis higher level of safety is also a first step in establishing a \nhigher standard for handling of prescription drugs right here in the \nUnited States where we have had the preponderance of problems.\n  Our legislation allows individuals to directly order medications \nusing an FDA-registered and approved Canadian pharmacy. Again, just as \nwith wholesalers handling prescription drugs, the FDA will examine, \nregister, and inspect these facilities on a frequent basis. The FDA \nwill assure the highest standards for such functions as making sure the \nmedical history is recorded of the individual, verifying prescriptions, \nand tracking the shipments.\n  Some say consumers will get medications they should not be getting. \nRegardless of whether one purchases imported drugs from the local \npharmacist or uses a Canadian pharmacy, we assure that a legitimate \nprescription and a qualified pharmacist will be vital ingredients to \nensuring safety. In fact, we have many standards incorporated in this \nlegislation in which it would occur.\n  We adopted language that had been introduced by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, with respect to Web sites and domestic \nInternet pharmacies so that we assure that properly licensed pharmacies \nand pharmacists are behind Web sites that are offering these \nmedications.\n  Some say importation will allow unapproved drugs to enter the United \nStates. Again, on that point, our legislation is abundantly clear. \nEvery drug received will always be FDA-approved. If any difference \nexists in a foreign drug, even the most minute, our legislation assures \nFDA will evaluate the product and determine its acceptability. If the \ndrug is not bioequivalent to a U.S. drug, the Secretary may reject \napproval of that medication.\n  Some say we will import counterfeits. The truth is, today the FDA \ndoes not know even the level of domestic counterfeiting where, as I \nsaid earlier, the preponderance of the problem exists. It is simply not \nemploying the very anticounterfeiting technologies which our \nlegislation demands in order to ensure that we protect against the \nthreat of counterfeits. The fact is, we employ technologies today like \nthe ones we use now for twenty-dollar bills. We can use the same for \nprescription drugs.\n  Moreover, this bill supports development of future anticounterfeiting \nand track-and-trace technologies, very effective methods which we hope \nwill be used to protect all drugs. For those who say consumers would \nnot know who has handled the imported prescription drug, again, our \nbill requires a chain of custody, a pedigree to be maintained and \ninspected to help ensure the integrity of imported medications. A \npedigree for prescription drugs was mandated, believe it or not, by law \nin 1988 and still has not been implemented by the FDA. Under our \nlegislation, at last we will require pedigrees to be implemented for \nall medications.\n  Some opponents will even attempt to alarm Americans about the \ncountries from which we import drugs, citing Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia, \nand members of the European Union. But consider that another member is \nIreland where Lipitor is made. Again, I call your attention to this \nchart which indicates the European Union and other countries from which \nwe import drugs designated in blue. They either meet our standards or \nhave even higher ones, ones as you can see in this chart, all of the \nblue countries from which we would import. They have our standards or \nthey exceed our standards.\n  In contrast, this chart denotes the countries in red from which, \nagain, our manufacturers import medications. That is interesting. The \nFDA inspects pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in these countries \ndenoted in red. These are countries from which manufacturers will \nimport products. It includes China, India, Bulgaria, Jordan,\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\nand other countries. In fact, they have lower standards. So what I have \nindicated, based on what this map shows, is that we have the blue \ncountries from which we would allow importation of drugs that would be \nFDA-approved, facilities inspected, documented. We would have pedigrees \nand technologies to track the shipments. These are countries that meet \nor exceed our standards. Today we already have FDA pharmaceutical \nmanufacturing plants in these countries in red that, in fact, have \nlower standards. So we already, amazingly enough, allow medications to \ncome in from countries that have lower standards. Why do we? Because \nthey are inspected by FDA. So the same process can't work for countries \nthat meet or exceed our standards already, that already have a track \nrecord in parallel trading in and amongst their own countries, and we \ncan't do it today for those countries when FDA already does it for \nother countries that have lower standards? Because that is where many \nof our medications are manufactured. That is where our manufacturers \nimport and FDA inspects those facilities before those medications enter \nthe United States. So this is already done. It is done with countries \nthat have lower standards, and we find that acceptable. Yet we say we \nare not finding it acceptable from countries that already have a track \nrecord of parallel trading amongst their own country without injury to \nany of their consumers over the last 30 years that meet or exceed our \nstandards. It simply doesn't make sense.\n  We are setting a model for improving safety because we are saying we \nare going to create 36 different measures for establishing safety for \nthe American consumer to assure all those concerned that we have the \nmeasures in place and the resources with which to do it. So to those \nwho say importation is unsafe, we show them how it shall be safe under \nour legislation. It sets a model and a standard.\n  Some say consumers will not see significant savings. But drugs \nimported under this program will be labeled as imports so consumers \nwill have the opportunity to do some comparative shopping. They will be \nable to take those prices and do a side-by-side comparison between the \nimports and those medications they buy in the United States. Consumers \nhave become well aware of foreign pricing and the competition that \nexists between imported and wholesalers. We know they will achieve \nconsumer savings; there is no question. That is why so many Americans, \nincluding many of my constituents from the State of Maine who have been \nable to access medications from Canada, have had to take bus trip after \nbus trip. They have been compelled to do that in order to achieve \nsavings because of our unwillingness to address this issue in the \nSenate and the overall Congress. This legislation should have been \naccomplished a long time ago.\n\n  In terms of savings, it should be interesting to note the independent \nanalysis of the Congressional Budget Office which has confirmed that \nthe savings, indeed, should be substantial--not surprising. It would be \nvery substantial, indeed. They estimate a 10-year direct savings alone \nof $50 billion to the American consumer--$50 billion. That is probably \non the conservative side. The Federal Government stands to save $6.1 \nbillion in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs alone. This is only the \nsavings that CBO projected from purchases of imports. With increased \ncompetition in our markets, we could indeed save more, having \ncompetition, having the pharmaceutical industry have some competition \nin their pricing. Understand, individuals can't import medications. \nPharmacists can't import medications. Only manufacturers can. So we are \nsaying: Let's set a standard. Let's allow imports that benefit the \nindividual consumer with safety-related provisions put in place.\n  In fact, in a recent Commerce Committee subcommittee hearing, we had \nthe opportunity to hear from a number of experts. We heard from a \npharmaceutical economist who estimated that importation could result in \na 12- to 20-percent reduction in domestic drug costs. That is an annual \nsavings, not over 10 years, of up to $40 billion per year, as \ncompetition is created for consumer savings. So as a direct result of \nthe competition that would develop as a result of importation, \nconsumers alone could save up to $40 billion a year.\n  So at a time when health care spending is reaching 16 percent of GDP \nand is climbing, this competition is an imperative. It is central. It \nis central to the consumer who is facing double-digit increases in \nprescription drugs. Prescription drugs are not getting cheaper in \nAmerica. They are getting more expensive. As I said, the American \nconsumer is spending 35 to 55 percent more than the foreign consumer. \nHealth care spending is 16 percent of the GDP. Much of the increase in \nhealth care spending is attributed to the rising cost in prescription \ndrugs.\n  So that is why this becomes all the more important to the American \nconsumer and, indeed, to the Federal Government that will save $50 \nbillion over 10 years and 6 billion alone in Medicare and Medicaid \nspending. That is important to our own interests and to our budgetary \nconcerns about the growth in these respective programs.\n  Some have argued that we haven't provided the resources necessary to \nrun an importation program. But we have established a means of \nfinancing, a small fee based on the value of imported drugs which will \nnow be set at a cap of 2.5 percent. We have always agreed that the FDA \nshould have adequate resources. In fact, we heard from previous \nSecretaries of Health and Human Services, we don't have the resources \nto certify safety. So now we are providing a certification for that by \nincluding this cap of 2.5 percent for a fee on the total import of \nmedications. This is what CBO has indicated to us would be necessary in \norder to accomplish and implement these safety-related measures. We \nthink it is important the FDA have the resources that are essential for \nregulation, for monitoring inspections of both domestic wholesalers, \nwho would import the prescription drugs, as well as the Canadian \npharmacies from which American consumers could order.\n  Some say our bill is intended to adopt Canadian prices. Again, quite \nthe contrary. We open importation to 32 countries which meet our safety \nstandards. We are not simply adopting the price of another country. \nRather, we are purchasing in a world market. That is a critical point. \nWe are allowing American consumers to benefit from worldwide prices \nbecause of the competition that would be allowed. Obviously, something \nis happening in other countries where we want to import these \nmedications because they are paying 35 to 55 percent less than American \nconsumers. Why should that be the case? These are countries, by the \nway, that meet or exceed our standards when it comes to drug safety. \nYet American consumers are paying 35 to 55 percent more for the same \nmedications.\n  Some say we compel manufacturers to sell the product. But our bill is \nvery clear on that specific point. We never compel any manufacturer to \nsell any particular product. But when a manufacturer chooses to sell \nproduct, the bipartisan bill prohibits discriminatory acts against \npharmacists and wholesalers who sell these medications. Those actions \nhave reduced supplies of essential drugs for some Americans, at peril \nto their health.\n\n  We are saying they cannot take action that discriminates against a \npharmacy because they have sold those drugs to an American consumer. \nThey are not penalized because their supplies are cut off by the \nmanufacturer as a means of punishment and discrimination.\n  Now, some say importation will threaten research and development. But \nthe fact is, manufacturers will invest just as other industries do, in \norder to develop innovative products and remain competitive. The \ntaxpayer is a partner in that investment. The American taxpayer is a \npartner. The taxpayer makes investments in research and development. In \nfact, we fund nearly $30 billion a year to do basic and applied \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health alone--$30 billion.\n  So as you can see on this chart, as to R spending from all the \ncompanies, we--the United States consumer and taxpayer--fund and \nunderwrite much of their research and development.\n  As I said earlier, other industrialized countries pay 35 to 55 \npercent less for their drugs. But because of the higher prices \nAmericans pay for their medications, the American consumer ends up\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\npaying $99 billion more for their prescription drugs each year than \notherwise would be the case. Let me repeat that. Because we pay 35 to \n55 percent more than foreign consumers, American consumers end up \npaying $99 billion more for their medications.\n  With all that additional profit, the industry spends about $9 billion \nmore on research and development than they do in Europe. That is 10 \ncents return on the dollar for all that added profit margin. So while \nthe American consumers spend $99 billion more for their prescription \ndrugs than foreign consumers, in Europe, for example, American \npharmaceuticals spend only $9 billion more--from that $99 billion--on \nresearch and development than they do in Europe. We spend only $9 \nbillion more here than they do in Europe on research and development. \nThat means American pharmaceuticals are netting $90 billion more, that \nthey are only investing $9 billion more in research and development.\n  So it is not undercutting their ability for research and development, \nnot to also mention, by the way, the American taxpayer invests more \nthan $30 billion at the National Institutes of Health alone for basic \nresearch as well.\n  In fact, if you look at the R spending of the largest \npharmaceutical firms--as indicated again by this chart--it is not \nmarkedly different from many other firms. If you look at other firms, \nsuch as Intel, Microsoft, Lucent, and others with high research and \ndevelopment costs and relatively low production costs, their research \nand development spending averages about 14.3 percent of gross \nrevenues--not much different--yet their products are highly \ncompetitive, very competitive. You have seen the software, cell phones, \ncomputers, laptops, whatever. You have seen the very competitive \npricing today, yet they make an investment of 14.3 percent for research \nand development as a percentage of their gross revenues.\n  Yet, paying the world's highest prices for drugs does not ensure \nadditional research, but it certainly does decrease access to drugs. So \nwhile they do not invest in considerably more research and \ndevelopment--since we pay $99 billion more in prices for prescription \nmedications, and they only spend $9 billion more on research and \ndevelopment, and the taxpayer spends $30 billion at NIH alone, as I \nindicated; but even, comparatively speaking, it is 14.4 percent of \ntheir gross revenues that are invested in research and development--if \nyou compare that to, as I said, Intel, Microsoft, Lucent, and other \ncompanies, which is 14.3 percent, you find more competitive products in \nthe technology arena. Their prices are coming down. The American \nconsumer is not benefiting from the investments that are being made by \nthe pharmaceuticals, yet it is a highly profitable industry. So we are \nnot seeing the same benefits that would yield lower prices for the \nAmerican consumer.\n  Now, in conclusion, let me say, I hope this Senate will adopt this \namendment that creates the kind of safety regime that would ensure drug \nimportation will become a reality. Simply certifying safety on the part \nof the Secretary of Health and Human Services has been tried and yet \nhas never accomplished that goal. It has been an impediment to drug \nimportation. It has occurred twice in the last 10 years, and for \nwhatever reasons the Secretaries in the previous administration and \nthis administration have concluded they will not certify the safety \nregime because there has been no safety regime. It could be done, but \nit has not been done through the agencies. FDA could do it. It has not \naccomplished it. It has not implemented it. It has not had the impetus \nto pursue it. That is why we have taken it a step further. This \nlegislation has been examined, reexamined, based on the concerns that \nhave been expressed by those who have been opposed to it in the past \nsaying they have concern about safety.\n  We understand that. So we have gone a step further and incorporated \nevery safety-related measure possible that is achievable, measurable, \nand provide the FDA with the resources to accomplish it.\n  The Senate has voiced its view to provide market access on this issue \non many occasions, even by virtue of passing the certification \nstandard. Obviously, I think there has been an indication on the part \nof the Senate to support some type of initiative that allows for drug \nimportation. But we want to mitigate the concerns that have been \nexpressed repeatedly about the issues of safety by incorporating all of \nthose measures in this amendment that is pending before the Senate.\n  In fact, 68 Members of this body voted to adopt the amendment that \nwas offered by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, to the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. But we need more than to simply allow \nimportation. We must provide an effective framework that will address \nthe concerns that will ultimately ensure the safety of our consumers.\n  Sixty-eight Members of this body supported blocking the Customs \nagency from banning drug importation, so it is obvious Members of this \nSenate truly want to pass a measure that will allow for drug \nimportation. That is why I think this legislation logically affords us \nthe ability to provide the safety and, at the same time, allow \nconsumers in America to benefit from competition, from lower prices, \nbased on the track record and the experience of other countries that \nhave been adopting this approach for many decades.\n  Competition is what is missing in this process. It will work for the \nconsumer. To date, the process has not worked for the consumer where \nthey have benefited from lower prices for medications because there has \nbeen no competition. Competition has been virtually absent. I note the \ncomment of the former Pfizer CEO, Hank McKinnell, who wrote:\n\n       Competition is good medicine for economies. . . . Name an \n     industry in which competition is allowed to flourish--\n     computers, telecommunications, small package shipping, \n     retailing, entertainment--and I'll show you lower prices, \n     higher quality, more innovation, and better customer service. \n     There's nary an exception. Okay, there's one. So far the \n     healthcare industry seems immune to the discipline of \n     competition.\n\n  Those are the words of the former Pfizer CEO, Hank McKinnell.\n  It is indeed time to make competition work to benefit consumers and \ntaxpayers. Americans deserve and will seek out affordable life-\nsustaining medications. We must assure that access is safe. That is \nwhat we accomplish in this amendment that is pending before the Senate.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, for \nhis leadership on this question and for all those who are supporting \nthis initiative.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority whip.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1022\n\n         (Purpose: To ensure the safety of human and pet food.)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a brief period of time I will be \noffering an amendment which I hope to bring to a vote very shortly, \nperhaps in the next 15 or 20 minutes, depending on the wishes of the \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member, Senator Enzi.\n  This amendment relates to the issue of food safety. This has been one \nof my concerns for a long time as a Member of the House and the Senate. \nI know everyone across America trusts that the food they buy for their \nfamilies and everyone in their house is safe, that they can eat it and \nnot get sick.\n  We all know what has happened over the last several months. Whether \nwe are talking about contaminated E. coli in spinach, salmonella in \npeanut butter, or the latest pet food contamination, people are asking \nquestions of Members of Congress and this Government: Are we doing our \njob? What is happening here? Why are so many dangerous food products \nshowing up so frequently? How can we protect ourselves?\n  For many years I have thought the real answer is to tackle the whole \nissue. I have said it before on the floor, 12 to 15 different Federal \nagencies inspect our food--imagine that--and they all have different \nstandards. Some inspect food every single day. Go to a meatpacking \nplant, poultry processing plant; the food is inspected every single \nday, every minute of every day, as it passes along those lines by the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Fish is another story. Fish is inspected by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. How do they inspect it? By\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\nwhat they call the ``sniff test.'' They lean over and smell the fish, \nand if they have what they call a ``head snap,'' they know they have a \nbad load of fish. Sounds kind of comical, but it is what we get down \nto, by and large, in terms of inspecting fish.\n  So when you go throughout our Government and look at different \nproducts and how they are inspected, it makes no sense why different \nagencies are doing different parts of the food chain. From a consumer's \npoint of view, I do not want to know there are 12 or 15 different \nagencies at work, with their lights on, in Washington, with a lot of \ndifferent employees. I want to know there is one good agency, \nscientifically driven, that is making the right call as to whether \nthere should be an inspection every day, every month, every year--\nwhenever.\n  They do not have that today, and the system breaks down. What we have \nseen happen over the last several months is a clear indication that our \nfood safety system--as good as it may be--needs to be a lot better. So \nI am offering this amendment on food safety.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming who has been very cooperative and \nhelpful in making certain this is a bipartisan amendment. There is \nnothing partisan about food safety. We should all agree that the goal \nis one both parties share, all Americans share. Senator Kennedy has \ngiven me the time to offer this amendment on this important bill early \non, and I certainly appreciate it. Senator Allard from Colorado, a \nveterinarian, has been involved in this negotiation, as has Senator \nHarkin, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee. Many people have \ncome together to take a look at this and make sure it is moving in the \nright direction.\n  There was an early warning. The early warning came a few weeks ago \nwhen we had a pet food crisis. People who own dogs and cats know what I \nam talking about. All of a sudden there was a suspicion that the food \nyou were giving your dog--that animal you love, an animal that is part \nof your family--could be poisoning that animal. Well, for 90 million \nAmericans that is a big deal, and they were concerned about it. So we \nstarted looking into why this pet food was contaminated.\n  That crisis was an early warning signal to America. It was a warning \nsignal that we came to learn had a lot to do with the imports coming \ninto America. More and more imports of food products are coming in from \noverseas. If you believe we have inspectors sitting in China and France \nand Germany and Brazil taking a look at these things as they come off \nthe assembly line, taking a little test sample and running it to the \nlab, you are wrong. It does not happen. In fact, once the shipment is \non the boat, or on the plane, coming to America, the odds are 99 to 1 \nno inspector will ever look at it before it is put into a food \nproduct--99 to 1. Only 1 to 1.5 percent of food products sent to \nAmerica is actually inspected by our Government.\n  Now, we look at what came over from the Chinese and find out they \nwere adding a chemical to wheat gluten, a protein product called \nmelamine. Melamine is a chemical derived from coal, which is used in \nthe manufacturing of plastic. It has no business in anything that is \nedible. It was put into the shipment of protein, this wheat gluten, in \norder to enhance its value because when they tested this wheat gluten \non its arrival, this melamine chemical indicated the presence of \nnitrogen, therefore, more protein, and, therefore, it was worth \nmore. They would sprinkle in the melamine and make more money off the \nshipment. If this were the end of the story, you would say: Well, that \nwas a pretty nice move; they just made a bigger profit off the \nshipment. It wasn't the end of the story. It turns out that wheat \ngluten, when used for pet foods, is toxic. Over 4,000 animals died \nacross America because of melamine and possibly other contaminants. We \nare still investigating.\n\n  So we went to find out how it got into the shipment, and the Chinese \ndid not cooperate. They have started to. I am glad they have. They have \nagreed to visas for our inspectors. But this pet food crisis was a \nwarning sign, a signal to us in America that this dramatic increase in \nimports of food products leaves us vulnerable. Today, it was your cat \nor your dog. Tomorrow, it could be someone in your family whom you \nlove. So we address part of this in this bill.\n  Secondly, it is an indication that the Food and Drug Administration \ndoesn't have the authority or the resources to do their job as well as \nthey should. This is a great agency. They have an awesome \nresponsibility. We heap more and more responsibility on them each year, \nwe provide them very little by way of additional resources, and they \nare being stretched to the absolute limit. Of course, this pet food \ncrisis is an early warning that the whole food safety system has to be \ninvestigated and honestly looked at. So this is a start. It is an \neffort to try to make a difference.\n  I wish to thank Senator Kohl from Wisconsin and Senator Bennett from \nUtah. When the pet food crisis came out, they called a timely hearing \nafter our Easter recess, and we started working on this amendment just \nat that moment, and thanks to them for realizing the importance of this \nissue.\n  I also thank those who helped us draft this legislation--the Center \nfor Science and the Public Interest, the Humane Society, which has been \nterrific from start to finish, the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation, and the Coalition for a Stronger FDA.\n  Special thanks, while I am giving out bouquets here, to my staffer \nDavid Lazarus. This young staffer has really put his heart and soul \ninto this effort. It is his first major legislative undertaking, and I \ncommend him for the very fine job he has done.\n  Let me say very briefly what this amendment will do. First, it deals \nwith pet food because we have just come off of a pet food crisis, but \nit doesn't stop there because this contamination doesn't stop with pet \nfood. Sure, we found it in the cans of dog food and cat food, but guess \nwhat. It ended up in livestock feed. It ended up moving into the \nfeedlots for hogs, turning into pork products we buy in the store. It \nended up in poultry plants, being fed to chickens. We are naive to \nbelieve that any problem in the pet food industry can't possibly make \nit to the human food side of the equation. It can. God forbid that it \never does. We hope we have stopped it in this instance, but it is pure \nluck if we were able to save ourselves from that calamity this time. We \ndon't want it to happen again.\n  There are provisions in this amendment which go directly to the pet \nfood issue, provisions which require the FDA to update their labeling \nstandards for pet food, including nutritional and ingredient \ninformation, working closely with the American Association of Feed \nControl so that the representations on the labels of these cans of pet \nfood are honest representations about what is good for your animal and \nwhat is safe. Also, it requires that the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices establish an enhanced system capable of detecting food \ncontamination and outbreaks of pet illness and death.\n  This amendment also requires the FDA to develop an efficient, \neffective communication plan to coordinate with veterinarians and \nconsumers, owners across America, so that we can find out if we are \ndealing with a need for a recall. Recall data would be consolidated and \npresented in a searchable format. They were recalling pet food so \nquickly that if you went to the FDA Web site, you had to plow through \nall of the corporate press releases to figure out just exactly what was \na dangerous product. When I mentioned this to the FDA, they changed \ntheir Web site, and we put it into law, to make sure they are consumer \nfriendly and have up-to-date information consumers can understand.\n  We work with the Secretary as well and the States on activities and \nprograms to improve the safety of raw agricultural commodities. We go \nbeyond just pet food into all edible products, agricultural products. \nWhat we attempt to do is to have the Secretary share resources with the \nStates to improve State food programs and help States establish \nstandards for inspection. Fifty States, 50 standards, is unacceptable. \nThere should be one scientific matrix we follow so we know that whether \nthe product comes from Oregon or Illinois or New Hampshire, that it is \nsafe.\n  We also establish something that I think is historic. It applies to \npet and human food as well. It is an adulterated food register, to \ncollect information on cases of food adulteration and suspected \nadulteration that are potentially dangerous and improve the speed\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nby which consumers learn about them. We want an early-warning system, \nand in this age of computers and the Internet, we can achieve it.\n  I believe this is critically important. In this case, there was a \nCanadian company called Menu which made dog food. Menu discovered in \nthe middle of February that the cats and dogs were turning up their \nnoses at their product, and then they found those that were eating \ntheir products started to show signs of illness, and then some of the \nanimals died. Do you know how long it took them to report this to the \nFood and Drug Administration? Three weeks. Three weeks, while their \nproducts spread across Canada and North America, on the shelves of \nstores, and unsuspecting customers were buying them, they weren't \nreporting them. Our law now requires reporting within 2 days, and if \nthey fail to report, they face civil penalties, which I hope will be \nimposed on a timely basis so that we let all companies know this kind \nof delay is intolerable.\n  We also do something here that is important. If we find evidence of \nadulterated food, we report it as well to Homeland Security. Why? Well, \nGovernor Tommy Thompson told us why. When he left as Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services under this administration, he said: I find it \nunimaginable that someone hasn't tried to use our food supply--the \nterrorists haven't turned to our food supply to cause injury and death. \nHe understood, as I do, and everyone should at this moment, it is a \nvulnerability for America we need to avoid. So this food registry will \nmove us into a notification phase so the Department of Homeland \nSecurity can at least have notice if there is a problem.\n\n  We also require better access to business records for the \ninvestigation to get to the bottom of it. Where did it come from? How \nis it used? How can we contain the need?\n  We talk about a sense of the Senate in this amendment that points in \nanother direction, maybe going beyond this current crisis into looking \nat an overhaul of our whole food safety system, and we require the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to report annually to Congress \nwith information about their inspections and enforcement.\n  I am going to yield the floor at this point, and I again thank \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi for their help on this important legislation.\n  I wish to tell my colleagues that there were things I wanted to add \nin with this amendment, but in the interest of avoiding political \nconflict and in the interest of not slowing down this important \nlegislation and in the interest of making certain we did achieve \nsomething today, I am saving those arguments for another day.\n  One of them is the issue of mandatory recall, which I think our \nGovernment should have the power to do and currently does not. Our \nGovernment and its agencies do not have the power to recall \ncontaminated food from the shelves. I believe that law needs to be \nchanged. It is not included in this amendment. We will save that debate \nfor another day.\n  Again, my thanks to my colleagues.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Enzi, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Allard, and Mr. Nelson of Florida, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1022.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, before yielding the floor, of course I \nwill leave it to Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy for the timing of \nthis rollcall, but I am ready at any time for it to be called after \nthey have had a chance to make a statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, for his tremendous work and creativity and willingness to make \nrevisions to his amendment so that we can clear up outstanding concerns \nor clarify outstanding concerns people might have had with it. I think \nwe are at the point where that is the case. I would like to make a few \ncomments on it myself.\n  Food safety is an issue that affects us all. It is not a partisan \nissue. We all want the safest food supply possible. It is, instead, our \nshared goal, a goal that requires cooperation and teamwork through a \ncomplicated process, and we have had that.\n  For many of us, the safety and reliability of our food system is \nsomething we all too often take for granted. Day by day, we consume our \nfavorite beverages, enjoy a quick snack, or sit down to a meal at a \nlocal restaurant. We rely on a system of checks and balances that takes \nplace behind the scenes that we are often unaware of until something \ngoes wrong. Then and only then do we realize how dependent we are on \nthe food safety system that is supported by the activities carried out \nby the Federal, State, and local government agencies, as well as by the \nfood industry itself. Together, they inspect, test, research, and \nmonitor our food supply from the farm or ranch where it is produced to \nthe family dinner table where it is consumed. The type and amount of \noversight they exercise depends on the food product, and the degree of \nregulatory scrutiny they demand is commensurate with the degree of \nrisk.\n  In addition to these longstanding authorities and the activities of \nfood safety, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness \nand Response Act of 2002 required the Food and Drug Administration to \nregister food processors, inspect their records, and detain adulterated \nfood. It also requires the Food and Drug Administration to issue \nregulations to ensure the safety of imported foods.\n  Food safety has been making news lately. From E. coli in fresh \nspinach to salmonella in peanut butter to melamine-contaminated pet \nfood, we hear a constant drumbeat of food safety problems.\n  The United States has one of the best food safety systems in the \nworld, but even in the best of systems, there is room for improvement. \nThose improvements can take many forms. For example, we can address how \nfood becomes contaminated in the first place, and we can make advances \nin the processing and handling of food. Our surveillance, testing, and \nreporting systems represent areas we should evaluate, as well as \ninternal and external communications. Interagency cooperation and \ncoordination between Federal and State officials is critical in \nidentifying, tracking, and responding to outbreaks of foodborne \nillness.\n  The amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Durbin, contains \nseveral important elements in that response, but it is the beginning, \nnot the end, of the process of food safety. This amendment does a \nnumber of important things. It establishes standards for pet food and \nsets up early-warning systems for any problems with pet food. The \namendment improves communications systems about all food recalls, and \nit coordinates State and Federal activities on fresh and processed \nproduce. Finally, the amendment creates a database of instances of \nadulterated food so that the FDA can better track patterns of problems \nand target its limited resources where they are most needed.\n  I am pleased we are able to work across party lines to develop an \namendment today that we can all support, and I ask unanimous consent to \nbe a cosponsor, along with Senator Allard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. However, there is much more work to be done. This amendment \nis a good first step on the road to a comprehensive response to food \nsafety.\n  In March 2005, Senator Kennedy and I announced that we were working \nto develop a comprehensive response on another FDA issue, which is drug \nsafety. The bill on the floor this week is a direct result of that \nannouncement and\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nthat pledge to work together. So when I pledge today to work to develop \na comprehensive response on food safety, you can have some sense that I \ndo mean that. I want my colleagues to work quickly and diligently to \nget this amendment to the point where we can accept it. I know we have \nit scheduled for a vote at the moment, too.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I wish to join with Senator Enzi and \nthank our friend and colleague, Senator Durbin, for his strong \nleadership on this issue. This is an issue of enormous importance to \nfamilies across the country.\n  As Senator Enzi just mentioned, over a year ago we made a strong \ncommitment to the Senate that we were going to work on this drug safety \nissue, and we have come here in a bipartisan way to put forward a very \nstrong bill that will ensure greater safety for American families in \nthe area of prescription drugs. I think we are here to say that we will \njoin with our friend and colleague from Illinois to build on what is an \nenormously important amendment and commitment to ensuring that we are \ngoing to have food safety as well as pet food safety in this country.\n  I think this amendment, as has been outlined by Senator Durbin and \nSenator Enzi, reaches the heart of the challenges we face. One is on \nthe issue of surveillance. We understand that is an essential aspect, \nwhether it is food safety or prescription drugs, or whether it is in \nthe area of avian flu, bioterrorism--whatever the challenge that is out \nthere, surveillance is the first thing that needs to be done. We know \nthat today the system is grossly inadequate.\n  Second, we know the information about food and food safety is \nscattered through a number of agencies and through a number of \ndifferent kinds of delivery systems, and that the coordination between \nthe Federal and State is loose. In all of these areas, this amendment \naddresses these issues and questions in a very effective way, to bring \ncommon sense to and put real teeth into the safety provisions.\n  The pet food standards that are in this legislation are strong and \neffective and would be very much appreciated by all Americans who are \nconcerned about this issue. The standards are variable at the present \ntime. The reporting is not good today, and this particular amendment is \nparticularly responsive to that kind of challenge.\n  Finally, this addresses the central concern all of us have read about \nand are concerned about, which the Senator has spoken to, and that is \nthe issue of importation. When you add up all of those kinds of \nelements, we find this is a very solid and meaningful amendment. I \nthink it strengthens the legislation immensely. We have every purpose, \nas we move forward, to find ways we can provide even a greater kind of \nprotection and safety to the food supply for American families.\n  I commend the Senator from Illinois. I think we will be ready to have \na vote on this at the earliest time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nKohl, Cantwell, Schumer, and Biden be added as cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Durbin amendment No. 1022; that no \nother amendments be in order prior to the vote; that the time until \nthen be equally divided and controlled between Senators Kennedy and \nEnzi; and that the vote be scheduled for 4:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we expect the vote at 4:30, for our \ncolleagues. After that, we are going to have a conversation with those \nwho have been primarily interested and concerned about the whole issue \nof biologics. So I give the assurance we are going to address that \nissue in a timely way. That will ultimately be part of this \nlegislation.\n  We also will be able to report on progress we have made on several \nother amendments. There are a few items that are going to necessitate \nour attention through the evening. We had a very good debate earlier \ntoday on the children's provisions; we had an important vote and \ndiscussion on that.\n  This addition this afternoon is enormously important, and I think the \ntime that has been taken to work through this legislation has made it \neven stronger and better than I think it otherwise might have been. I \nam grateful to all of our colleagues who are working with us on both \nsides of the aisle, and particularly the staffs. We are moving forward. \nWe are going to be busy this evening trying to work through some of the \nitems, and we will have the cloture vote tomorrow and the follow-on \nCochran amendment.\n  There is a glimmer in sight about reaching a conclusion to this \nlegislation. Again, we are very appreciative of all who have helped us \nup to this point.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 1022\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we found a typo on page 5 in the \namendment that we want to clear up before the amendment is considered.\n  I ask unanimous consent to modify the amendment as submitted to the \nSenate. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       (3) post information regarding recalled products on the \n     Internet website of the Food and Drug Administration in a \n     consolidated, searchable form that is easily accessed and \n     understood by the public.\n\n     SEC. _04. STATE AND FEDERAL COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall work with the States \n     in undertaking activities and programs that assist in \n     improving the safety of fresh and processed produce so that \n     State food safety programs involving the safety of fresh and \n     processed produce and activities conducted by the Secretaries \n     function in a coordinated and cost-effective manner. With the \n     assistance provided under subsection (b), the Secretary shall \n     encourage States to--\n       (1) establish, continue, or strengthen State food safety \n     programs, especially with respect to the regulation of retail \n     commercial food establishments; and\n       (2) establish procedures and requirements for ensuring that \n     processed produce under the jurisdiction of the State food \n     safety programs is not unsafe for human consumption.\n       (b) Assistance.--The Secretary may provide to a State, for \n     planning, developing, and implementing such a food safety \n     program--\n       (1) advisory assistance;\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today and would like to briefly \nspeak about Senator Durbin's amendment regarding food safety. I was \nhappy to cosponsor this amendment, and I agree with all of the \nsentiments expressed by the Senator earlier today.\n  This amendment deals with many of the underlying problems that allow \nfood safety issues, such as the ones we have dealt with in recent \nmonths that have affected not only humans, but their pets as well.\n  It requires the FDA to set standards for pet food and to update them \nas necessary, and it directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto establish a system capable of detecting pet food contamination and \noutbreaks of pet illnesses and death--this will prevent the type of \nconfusion that continues to surround the recent melamine outbreak, and \nwill help detect these problems much earlier. It requires FDA to \ndevelop effective communication plans to coordinate with stakeholders \nduring outbreaks of both pet and human foods, so people know what is \ngoing on--quickly--and know what to do. It directs the Secretary to \nwork with States to collaborate on activities and programs that assist \nin improving the safety of raw agricultural products such as spinach, \nwhich was the cause of a major food safety recall last fall. \nImportantly, it requires FDA\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nto establish a registry to collect information on cases of potentially \ndangerous food adulteration to help get any dangerous food off of the \nshelves more quickly and to allow FDA to target inspection resources \nwhere most needed.\n  This amendment does many important things--and takes many important \nfirst steps. I know that Senator Durbin would have liked this amendment \nto go a little further, and I agree with his sentiments, but it is \nimportant to at least take the first step.\n  In March of this year, I held a hearing in Madison, WI, on food \nsafety issues at the FDA. The Commissioner of FDA attended, as well as \nthe Director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety. At that time, I \npointed out that outbreaks of foodborne illness caused by produce have \ndoubled since 1998. During this same time, the FDA's food budget has \nsuffered. The number of people getting sick is going up, but the number \nof inspections and food safety tests being conducted is dwindling. So \ntoo are the number of food inspectors and overall staff at the FDA's \nCenter for Food Safety. Imports have risen dramatically over the years, \nbut the FDA is only able to inspect less than 1 percent of them.\n  Events after that hearing seemed to exacerbate what I pointed out. \nThe recent pet food scare, and the ongoing melamine investigation, \nserve as constant reminders that we have been taking this issue for \ngranted, assuming that the FDA has the authority and funding necessary \nto do its job, when that is clearly not the case.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment begins to take care of some of the \nproblems with FDA authority and actions.\n  As the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, which \nhas jurisdiction over the FDA's budget, it is my job to make certain \nthat the FDA has the money to carry out its vital role of protecting \nour food. The Food Center at FDA doesn't have user fees from industry \nto boost its funding--it all comes from the Congress, and has been \nstagnant for far too long.\n  I have been working diligently to make sure that when the fiscal year \n2008 Agriculture Appropriations bill is written, food safety will be \none of its highlights. I do not believe the administration has ever \nrequested enough funding for food safety at the FDA, this year \nnotwithstanding. I plan to correct that. It may not happen all in the \nfirst year being fiscally responsible can be tough--but it will happen. \nWe will provide a significant increase to the FDA this year, so they \ncan implement some of what Senator Durbin's amendment proposes, and \nquite simply, so they can hire inspectors where they are needed, to do \nthe necessary research to prevent outbreaks from occurring wherever \npossible, and so we don't continue to see large recall notices in our \nnewspapers every day. It is not a problem that can be fixed \nimmediately, but I fully intend to meet my end of the obligation in \nmaking sure that FDA has the money that it needs, and can use \nresponsibly, to tackle this problem head on.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nrequest, I ask that the roll be called on amendment No. 1022.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1022, as modified, offered by the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) and the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

COUNTERFEIT-RESISTANT TECHNOLOGIES FOR PRESCRIPTION \n                   DRUGS.\n\n       (a) Required Technologies.--The Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall require that the packaging of any \n     prescription drug incorporate--\n       (1) radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging \n     technology, or similar trace and track technologies that have \n     an equivalent function;\n       (2) tamper-indicating technologies; and\n       (3) blister security packaging when possible.\n       (b) Use of Technologies.--\n       (1) Authorized uses.--The Secretary shall require that \n     technologies described in subsection (a)(1) be used \n     exclusively to authenticate the pedigree of prescription \n     drugs, including by--\n       (A) implementing inventory control;\n       (B) tracking and tracing prescription drugs;\n       (C) verifying shipment or receipt of prescription drugs;\n       (D) authenticating finished prescription drugs; and\n       (E) electronically authenticating the pedigree of \n     prescription drugs.\n       (2) Privacy protection.--The Secretary shall prohibit \n     technologies required by subsection (a)(1) from containing or \n     transmitting any information that may be used to\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\n     identify a health care practitioner or the prescription drug \n     consumer.\n       (3) Prohibition against advertising.--The Secretary shall \n     prohibit technologies required by subsection (a)(1) from \n     containing or transmitting any advertisement or information \n     about prescription drug indications or off-label prescription \n     drug uses.\n       (c) Recommended Technologies.--The Secretary shall \n     encourage the manufacturers and distributors of prescription \n     drugs to incorporate into the packaging of such drugs, in \n     addition to the technologies required under subsection (a), \n     overt optically variable counterfeit-resistant technologies \n     that--\n       (1) are visible to the naked eye, providing for visual \n     identification of prescription drug authenticity without the \n     need for readers, microscopes, lighting devices, or scanners;\n       (2) are similar to technologies used by the Bureau of \n     Engraving and Printing to secure United States currency;\n       (3) are manufactured and distributed in a highly secure, \n     tightly controlled environment; and\n       (4) incorporate additional layers of non-visible covert \n     security features up to and including forensic capability.\n       (d) Standards for Packaging.--\n       (1) Multiple elements.--For the purpose of making it more \n     difficult to counterfeit the packaging of prescription drugs, \n     the Secretary shall require manufacturers of prescription \n     drugs to incorporate the technologies described in paragraphs \n     (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a), and shall encourage \n     manufacturers and distributors of prescription drugs to \n     incorporate the technologies described in subsection (c), \n     into multiple elements of the physical packaging of the \n     drugs, including--\n       (A) blister packs, shrink wrap, package labels, package \n     seals, bottles, and boxes; and\n       (B) at the item level.\n       (2) Labeling of shipping container.--Shipments of \n     prescription drugs shall include a label on the shipping \n     container that incorporates the technologies described in \n     subsection (a)(1), so that members of the supply chain \n     inspecting the packages will be able to determine the \n     authenticity of the shipment. Chain of custody procedures \n     shall apply to such labels and shall include procedures \n     applicable to contractual agreements for the use and \n     distribution of the labels, methods to audit the use of the \n     labels, and database access for the relevant governmental \n     agencies for audit or verification of the use and \n     distribution of the labels.\n       (e) Penalty.--A prescription drug is deemed to be \n     misbranded for purposes of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) if the packaging or \n     labeling of the drug is in violation of a requirement or \n     prohibition applicable to the drug under subsection (a), (b), \n     or (d).\n       (f) Transitional Provisions; Effective Dates.--\n       (1) National specified list of susceptible prescription \n     drugs.--\n       (A) Initial publication.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     publish in the Federal Register a list, to be known as the \n     National Specified List of Susceptible Prescription Drugs, \n     consisting of not less than 30 of the prescription drugs that \n     are most frequently subject to counterfeiting in the United \n     States (as determined by the Secretary).\n       (B) Revision.--Not less than annually through the end of \n     calendar year 2010, the Secretary shall review and, as \n     appropriate, revise the National Specified List of \n     Susceptible Prescription Drugs. The Secretary may not revise \n     the List to include fewer than 30 prescription drugs.\n       (2) Effective dates.--The Secretary shall implement the \n     requirements and prohibitions of subsections (a), (b), and \n     (d)--\n       (A) with respect to prescription drugs on the National \n     Specified List of Susceptible Prescription Drugs, beginning \n     not later than the earlier of--\n       (i) 1 year after the initial publication of such List; or\n       (ii) December 31, 2008; and\n       (B) with respect to all prescription drugs, beginning not \n     later than December 31, 2011.\n       (3) Authorized uses during transitional period.--In lieu of \n     the requirements specified in subsection (b)(1), for the \n     period beginning on the effective date applicable under \n     paragraph (2)(A) and ending on the commencement of the \n     effective date applicable under paragraph (2)(B), the \n     Secretary shall require that technologies described in \n     subsection (a)(1) be used exclusively to verify the \n     authenticity of prescription drugs.\n       (g) Definitions.--In this Act:\n       (1) The term ``pedigree''--\n       (A) means the history of each prior sale, purchase, or \n     trade of the prescription drug involved to a distributor or \n     retailer of the drug (including the date of the transaction \n     and the names and addresses of all parties to the \n     transaction); and\n       (B) excludes information about the sale, purchase, or trade \n     of the drug to the drug consumer.\n       (2) The term ``prescription drug'' means a drug subject to \n     section 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)).\n       (3) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, first, in terms of laying the groundwork \nfor this amendment, let me speak very briefly about the broader \nreimportation debate. I commend my colleagues who have brought this \nissue to the floor, and I certainly join them in pushing strongly for \nreimportation language in this bill. I have worked with many Members of \nthis body, Republican and Democrat, on this issue since I was elected, \nincluding the primary authors of the reimportation amendment that we \nwill be voting on later under this bill. I certainly want to join many \nvoices, again, on both sides of the aisle, in terms of the need for \nthis sort of important legislation that helps stabilize and bring down \nthe price of prescription drugs.\n  My amendment, No. 983, to which I will now turn, is very directly \nrelated to that. It is not a reimportation amendment per se, but it \ngoes directly to one of the primary issues that opponents of \nreimportation regularly bring up, which is safety. My amendment, No. \n983, is about tamper-resistent technology--packaging technology--which \ncan go a long way in meeting all of those safety concerns. I think \nthere are many legitimate ways we can meet them, but this is a very \neffective and a very economical way to help meet any of those concerns.\n  This amendment, No. 983, would require the incorporation of \ncounterfeit resistent technologies into the packaging of prescription \ndrugs. Not just reimported prescription drugs, but all prescription \ndrugs because counterfeit prescription drugs is an issue not simply \nwith regard to reimportation. Specifically, wholesale prescription \ndrugs would contain RFID radio-tagging technology, tamper-resistent \npackaging, and blister security packaging, when possible.\n  This is language directly from my legislation of the last Congress, \nthe Reducing Fraudulent and Imitation Drugs Act. Of course, the purpose \nof that bill and this amendment is to address that safety concern, \nwhich comes up in a number of contexts, but certainly including \nreimportation. By ensuring that prescription drugs are authentic, this \namendment would ensure the drug supply within the United States, as \nwell as prescriptions reimported from Canada and other industrialized \nnations, are indeed safe.\n  Again, the amendment would require that such technologies be used \nexclusively to authenticate the pedigree of prescription drugs. It \nwould actually prohibit such technologies from containing or \ntransmitting any identifying information of a health care practitioner \nor consumer or any advertisement or information about indications or \noff-label uses. So it is specifically for authentication. This is what \nyou are getting. It cannot be used for any other purpose that might \nbring up privacy or other concerns.\n\n  It would also require prescription drug shipments to include a label \non the shipper container that incorporates similar packaging \ntechnologies.\n  Finally, the amendment would require the Secretary to publish a \nnational specified list of susceptible prescription drugs consisting of \nnot less than 30 of the most frequently counterfeited prescription \ndrugs in the United States. This would provide significant assistance \nto efforts by U.S. law enforcement and the FDA to deal with this issue.\n  I hope all of us can join together around this very promising new \ntechnology that can help meet any legitimate safety concerns out there. \nMuch more broadly speaking, of course, I certainly hope we come \ntogether to pass broad-based reimportation language in this bill, which \nI have supported well before coming to the Senate and, being in the \nSenate, certainly support in this context.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. VITTER. Certainly I yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Certainly the Senator remembers when he and \nthis Senator from Florida introduced an amendment a year ago to allow \nthe importation of drugs from Canada for a limited supply, stated as 90 \ndays or less, for personal use, and how we passed that here in the \nSenate. It was watered down once it got into conference in the House. \nIt only allowed Americans going to and from Canada to carry drugs in \nthat capacity--personal use, limited supply.\n  Now we are going to be approaching this, and I ask the Senator, he is \njoining on the Dorgan amendment on the reimportation as one of the \ncosponsors of this amendment, is that correct?\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I honestly do not know if I am technically a cosponsor. I \nam certainly supporting it. I supported our common efforts for several \nyears. Many of the elements of my separate bill have been incorporated \ninto the Dorgan-Snowe language, going back to last year. So we are \ncertainly all working in concert.\n  I again recognize and thank the Senator from Florida for our common \nwork on the amendment last year, which he referenced.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will further yield, does he \nremember in the debate we had when we agreed to that amendment, that \nCustoms had even gotten into the act and was seizing thousands and \nthousands of these pharmaceutical packages for individual use and \nlimited supply? Of course, in my State of Florida that happened with \ngreat frequency since a number of our senior citizens, in fact, do \nthat. Finally we got Customs to come out and say they were no longer \ngoing to do that, they were going to defer it to the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The Acting Administrator of the FDA had actually said \nno, they didn't have an objection to a limited supply for personal use, \nwhether it was ordered by phone or Internet or by the mail, or someone \nwalking across the border.\n  Isn't it interesting that after all of that--and we finally agreed to \nthe amendment--we still come to the year 2007 and we are having to \naddress this issue again?\n  Mr. VITTER. I agree with the Senator, absolutely. We should have \ntaken care of this a long time ago. But we are where we are, and I \ncertainly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address this \nin a full and comprehensive way.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Congressional Budget Office is estimating \nthat this legislation is going to save consumers in this country $50 \nbillion over the next 10 years because so often the price they get it \nfor at the retail outlet here is twice what they can get it for from a \nCanadian pharmacy.\n  It has been a pleasure for me to work with the Senator. I look \nforward to working with Senator Dorgan on his amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Senator from Florida. I certainly have \nsimilar beliefs.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment I presented and certainly urge my \ncolleagues to also support the broader reimportation language, as will \nI.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his patience on this \namendment, and also his understanding that he would work with my staff \nand the staff of Senator Kennedy to see what can be done to make our \ndrug supply safer. I appreciate that.\n  I also thank him for all the efforts he has made on behalf of the \nLouisiana turtle farmers, which was a new industry to me--although they \nhave been exporting turtles all over the world for years--for the work \nhe did drafting and putting together a mechanism for eliminating \nsalmonella in turtles so they can be, once again, pets in the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleagues from Utah, New York, Massachusetts, and Wyoming on \nbiologics. I thank every one of them for their cooperation and help as \nwe move forward.\n  Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to speak about \nbiologic drugs, a large and growing sector of the drug market. Biologic \ndrugs can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year for a single \npatient, and treat devastating diseases such as cancer and its \ncomplications. There is currently no clear pathway for lower cost \ncompetitors to biologic drugs to enter the market, as there is for \ngeneric versions of traditional chemical drugs. I have introduced a \nbill to create such a pathway. I am glad to see my friends Senator \nKennedy, Senator Enzi, and Senator Hatch on the floor to discuss this \nissue with us. I yield to my colleague from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to discuss this issue with my colleagues. As \nthey are aware, this has been my high priority for a number of years, \ngiven that I am the author with Representative Henry Waxman of the Drug \nPrice Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act--or ``Hatch-Waxman''. \nThe Schumer-Clinton bill, which I know has been introduced by \nRepresentative Waxman in the House, is an important contribution to \nthis dialogue. I want to work to reach an acceptable compromise on an \nexpedited basis, and it is clear to me it must be a bipartisan effort.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator for his leadership on generic drugs \nand for his presence here today. In 1984 when the Hatch-Waxman generic \ndrug law was written, very few biologic drugs existed and there was no \nneed to empower the FDA to approve lower cost versions of existing \nbiologic drugs. This is no longer the case and it is time to enact \nlegislation that will allow the FDA to approve safe and effective \nfollow-on versions of biotech drugs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleagues and I agree that creating a \npathway for follow-on biologics is an important issue worthy of our \nconsideration.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say to Chairman Kennedy, the junior Senator from New \nYork and I stand ready to offer a bipartisan amendment to this bill \nthat would establish a pathway for follow-on biologic drugs. We would \nprefer to work with you, and with the distinguished Senators from \nWyoming and Utah. To that end, we would like to work together to \ndiscuss a pathway that protects patient safety, enables consumer access \nto more affordable biologic drugs, and provides appropriate incentives \nfor continued innovation of lifesaving drugs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I agree with my friend Senator Schumer, and note with \ngratitude that the HELP Committee began bipartisan discussions on how \nto accomplish this goal. And while I was disappointed that follow-on \nbiologic legislation was not included during committee consideration of \nS. 1082, it was in good faith that I did not offer an amendment with \nthe understanding that our bipartisan efforts would continue.\n  As my colleagues and I move forward on this important effort, I think \nit is important to identify the key principles that must be contained \nin the legislation: We must provide the FDA with the authority and \nflexibility to approve biopharmaceuticals subject to a workable, \nabbreviated approval pathway that is efficient, effective and \nscientifically grounded. We must also include measures to ensure timely \nresolution of patent disputes, as well as adequate incentives for \ncontinued innovation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I assure the Senators from New York that the conference \nreport on the FDA Revitalization Act will include a pathway to follow-\non biologics that has been reported out of the HELP Committee and that \nis acceptable to the Senators from New York. I plan to hold a markup on \nthis issue on June 13.\n  Mr. ENZI. The heart of the debate is how to construct a regulatory \nframework so that biologic drugs can be safely available under an \naccelerated pathway. It is more difficult to approve biosimilars than \nto approve generic versions of typical drugs. The balance we are trying \nto find is a compromise that promotes access with innovation, while \nalso maintaining the high standards of safety at the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Biologics are complex molecules modeled after key processes occurring \ndaily within the human body. One analogy is that if a typical drug was \na 3 bedroom, 2 bath starter home, a biologic would be a skyscraper. The \nsize, scope and complexity are completely different. The nomenclature \nis, too. As key scientists stated at our HELP Committee hearing on this \ntopic, these are not generic biologics but biosimilars.\n  With many drugs, we can describe their structure with a high degree \nof precision--but not with follow-on biologics. You can't make an exact \n``copy'' of a biologic, like you can for most typical generic drugs. \nFor example, if I was to try to build the skyscraper of a biologic \nwithout the blueprints, as any generic company would need to do to \ncreate a follow-on biologic, I would have to ensure that every copy was \nidentical or there could be fatal results.\n  Because of this, science must be an essential part of any safety \nstandard.\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\nOne piece out of place would cause the entire structure to fall.\n  But to be clear, a safe pathway for an accelerated approval process \nfor biologics, that also preserves innovation, is possible. It is not \njust me who believes it--the FDA, generic and pharmaceutical industries \nhave all said so as well. I have been working across party lines with \nSenators Hatch, Kennedy and Clinton to develop legislation that does \njust that. Our staffs have been working tirelessly on this topic: \nindividually meeting with experts and stakeholders; and as a group, \ntalking with experts from the United States and global leaders. After \nall, we want the same end result--legislation that ensures medicines \nare safe and affordable, and that medical innovation continues to \nflourish.\n  I have a track record of working across party lines to build \nconsensus and find common ground on tricky legislative issues. I know \nthat with a little more time, and through regular order, we will \ndevelop a bipartisan package that accomplishes our common goals.\n  I concur with the chairman and am committed to moving a bipartisan \nbill through the HELP Committee in the near future with the goal that \nit can be joined with the conference on the FDA Revitalization Act.\n  Mr. HATCH. I look forward to working with my colleagues to include \nbipartisan follow-on biologics legislation in the conference agreement \non the FDA Revitalization Act. It is clear that consumers would benefit \ntremendously from an abbreviated pathway for consideration of \nbiosimilar products. Any effort, though, must be based on a sound \nunderstanding of the science involved and it must contain incentives \nfor development of the innovator products which will be copied.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleagues for these commitments. I look \nforward to working together with Chairman Kennedy, Senator Enzi, \nSenator Clinton, and Senator Hatch to develop workable legislative \nlanguage that can be scheduled for a June 13 markup in the HELP \nCommittee and included in the FDA Revitalization Act conference report.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1025\n\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment \nand send my amendment, a sense of the Senate, to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment is set aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1025.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to follow-on \n                               biologies)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO FOLLOW-ON \n                   BIOLOGICS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Food and Drug Administration has stated that it \n     requires legislative authority to review follow-on biologics.\n       (2) Business, consumer, and government purchasers require \n     competition and choice to ensure more affordable prescription \n     drug options.\n       (3) Well-constructed policies that balance the needs of \n     innovation and affordability have broad bipartisan support.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) legislation should be enacted to--\n       (A) provide the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority and flexibility to approve biopharmaceuticals \n     subject to an abbreviated approval pathway;\n       (B) ensure that patient safety remains paramount in the \n     system;\n       (C) establish a regulatory pathway that is efficient, \n     effective, and scientifically-grounded and that also includes \n     measures to ensure timely resolution of patent disputes; and\n       (D) provide appropriate incentives to facilitate the \n     research and development of innovative biopharmaceuticals.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The amendment (No. 1025) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues for their \ncooperation and their help on this particular subject matter. It is a \nmatter of enormous importance, incredible consequence, and enormous \ncomplexity. We thank them for all of their help and assistance in \nbringing us to where we are so that the Members understand better where \nwe are. We are absolutely committed to having that hearing and having \nthe results of that go into our conference.\n  I am enormously appreciative of the patience and the cooperation we \nhave received. I am grateful again to all of those here, colleagues on \nboth sides, for their cooperation in helping us move this forward.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah. I want to congratulate him. He is \nreceiving an honorary degree tomorrow from a great university in his \nState. We were talking about biologics. We think of the Hatch-Waxman \nproposal and acknowledge his work, attention, and help in the \nfashioning of that important piece of legislation, particularly when we \nare thinking about his involvement in the biologics, a clear indication \nwe are going to have some good bipartisan support and we are going to \nhave a team that has a breadth of knowledge and understanding of these \nkinds of subject matters. We wish him well on his trip to Utah and \ncongratulate him on his degree tomorrow.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend and colleague. It is \nso nice of him to say that. I take tremendous interest in this bill, as \nI do every piece of legislation, but this bill in particular.\n  I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for the way they \nhave conducted not only the committee through this process but this \nbill itself. I hope this bill will pass and that we can correct \nwhatever needs to be corrected, and that we will be able to do this \nfollow-on biological work together. If we can do that, this will be a \nmajor breakthrough bill, and will do a great deal of good for the FDA. \nIf that happens, then I think the chairman and the ranking member \ndeserve a great deal of credit. I am very grateful my friend from \nMassachusetts has been so kind to me today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I add my thanks to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe HELP Committee for all of their help and constructive resolution of \nthis. It allows us to pass a very important FDA bill and at the same \ntime move on the biologics.\n  I join my colleague from Massachusetts in congratulating my friend \nfrom Utah on his honorary degree. He will get a doctorate, I imagine, \nand perhaps after he will not only get an honorary degree and be a \ndoctor but maybe he can even create a few biologics after we pass the \nlaw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, to say the distinguished Senator from New \nYork knows how to stick it to a person on the floor is all I can say.\n  I am grateful for this friendship and grateful for his and Senator \nClinton's work on this as well, and willingness to work together in a \nbipartisan way. This is big-time stuff. If we get it right, it will \nsurely do a lot of good, as Hatch-Waxman has done over the last 23 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Honoring Jack Valenti\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was present yesterday at the funeral \nmass at St. Matthew's for Jack Joseph Valenti. I did not know he had a \nmiddle name, Joseph, but I am learning more\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\nand more about him now after his passing. I was a friend of his. I \nthought I knew much about him. But the more I read, the more I find out \nwhat a spectacular man and a marvelous life he lived.\n  I thought I would share with the Senate, since somebody said at the \nmass, as they were permitted to speak--they were one of the few who \nwere selected--I would bet that everybody in this church would like to \ncome up here and be given 10 minutes to say something about their \nfriend Jack Valenti.\n  That person who said that was absolutely right. That is exactly how I \nfelt sitting there: Wouldn't it be nice if I could walk up there and \ntell all of these people and whoever else was listening, share what I \nknew about him. Of course, that was not to be.\n  But today I am going to do that in the Senate for a few minutes, and \ntell the Senate about how this man, who was known to try to help \neverybody in very different circumstances, how he came to know me and \nhow I came to know him.\n  I was elected in 1972, and of course right now it sort of goes by \neasy; my last name is Italian. You know it was pretty well understood \nwhen I was elected that I was Italian--Domenici from out in the West, \nwhen all of the Italians who are in politics are from out here in the \nEast, from New York, New Jersey. People wondered: Where did that guy \ncome from?\n  Well, the truth is, Jack Valenti also wondered. He called me on the \ntelephone and said: Are you Pete Domenici, the new Senator?\n  I said: Yes, sir. He told me who he was. He said: You know, I don't \nknow you, you don't know me, but you probably could easily find out who \nI am. All I want to tell you is: I would like to help you.\n  Now, we are thousands of miles away. I have never seen him. I was \nelected. He is telling me on the phone: I would sure like to help you \nif I can.\n  Of course, I said: Give me your phone number and let me get ahold of \nyou. By the time I asked a few people, they said: You are lucky. He is \none of the people in Washington who knows more about what is going on \nhere, than the man who called you.\n  I quickly arranged a meeting at the Willard Hotel. It was prior to \nits remodeling so it wasn't as nice as it is today. But I didn't know \nbetter. I made arrangements there. Then I invited him to come and \nvisit. Here comes Mr. Valenti to come and meet me there at the Willard \nHotel. I mean, it was a joyous occasion. You would have thought I was a \nlong-lost relative. It was all because he was glad to see a young \nItalian boy get elected to the Senate. He came from an immigrant \nItalian family himself.\n  So we talked. He said: Well, let me try to help you. I would like to \ntell you what his first offer was. Let's go meet some people and see \nwhat we can do about talking about the committee assignments you might \nget.\n  I told him: Here is the one I want. I want the Joint Committee on \nAtomic Energy, because that has a lot to do with my State. So we talked \nand we worked. Sure enough, we were making a little headway and we read \nthat the House had had a meeting of leadership and they had decided \nthere would no longer be a Joint Committee on Atomic Energy so they \nabolished it. So all of my work and all of his work was for naught, \nbecause we decided we were not going do business in a joint manner on \natomic energy.\n  But what a joy it was, the first meeting--not successful in terms of \nour mission but greatly successful in terms of establishing our \nfriendship.\n  I will mention two things in my life and then yield to the Senator.\n  Years later, one of my sons was working here in Washington. Some \npeople know him. His name is David. He had established and built a \ncharter school here, a school in town that ended up being called Maya \nAngelou School, a school named after the great poet laureate. And, of \ncourse, as you would guess from the name of the school, it was sort of \na special school. It was a charter school my son started with the help \nof another man, and it was for the purpose of taking the troubled young \nteenagers, who were either going to jail, because they had already done \nenough bad things, criminal things, they were going to jail, or the \njudge would assign them to this school.\n  This son of mine built this charter school. It got to be a pretty \ngood size. At a point in time he was opening a new building, and he \ncalled me and talked to me and said: You know, maybe I could get some \nhelp from somebody for some computers for these students.\n  This is my second meeting with my friend. I called him up and said: I \nwould like you to meet my son David. I told him why. He said: Of \ncourse. They met, talked on the telephone. Within a very short period \nof time, the charter school I am describing to you, which was a very \ndifficult thing for my son and his friend to run--had a great success. \nHe opened two of them; two of them exist in Washington now. But, lo and \nbehold, shortly after this meeting and our discussion with Mr. Valenti, \nthe computers that were needed for the school to totally fill out all \nof the computer needs arrived as a special donation from somebody.\n  Well, of course, we know the somebody. We found out later our friend \nMr. Valenti worked to get in touch with those who could help donate to \nthese students' needs.\n  He is gone now, but we do not know how many thousands of things like \nthis he did during his life, along with the other things that are more \nnotorious that he did in his job, which was a very open and public job \nfor many years of his life, and a hard one when he worked for the \nmotion picture industry. So we do not know how many people he helped. \nBut I thought maybe I would borrow this few minutes of the Senate's \ntime to put down my thoughts for his wife, who I obviously did not know \nas well as I knew him. But I did get to know her. I saw her at the \nfuneral. Of course, she is having a difficult time. I do not know their \nchildren. I did have a chance to talk to his wife and say I hope that \neverything went well. I think it will. With this, I say maybe no one \nelse in the Senate will do this, but as part of my day, I salute Mr. \nJack Valenti for all he did, and I am very grateful I had the chance to \nsay a few words about him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico. I had \nthe good opportunity to attend that service as well. I will include my \ncomments about Jack Valenti. He was a dear and valued friend of the \nKennedys. We went back a long time with Jack, to the 1960 campaign. It \nwas a long friendship, that endured a lot of very glorious times and \ndifficult and challenging ones as well. He was a person of great \npurpose, with a love for his country, devotion to his industry, which \nhe represented so effectively, and a wonderful friend to many of us. I \nthank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. President, for the benefit of our Members here, we are going to \nrecess shortly and go over to 9:30 tomorrow morning. The hour before \nthe cloture vote will run from 9:30 to 10:30, and we will yield a half \nhour on our side to the proponent of the amendment, Senator Dorgan. \nThen at 10:30 or just about 10:30 we expect we will have a roll call \nvote on the Dorgan amendment, or the motion to invoke cloture on the \nDorgan amendment. Then, depending on how that comes out, we will move \nahead to hopefully conclude work on some of the items we have had good \ndiscussions about today--the Stabenow amendment. I am grateful to \nSenator Stabenow. We spoke about this earlier in the day. We have \nworked with her and made some very important progress and are grateful \nto her for her cooperation.\n  We indicated now to the membership how we are going to proceed on the \nextremely important item of biologics. We now have the drug safety. We \nhave enhanced this bill with food safety. We are going to address in \nour conference the issue of biologics. This is going to be an extremely \nimportant pathway. We have been working with Senator Roberts and \nSenator Harkin on the direct consumer advertising issue. There are some \nvery important constitutional issues. I am grateful to Senator Roberts \nfor his cooperation and help. Senator Kohl has an amendment on reverse \npayments. There is Senator Vitter's amendment and potentially one or \ntwo others that Members have indicated they are giving thought to \noffering, but haven't decided whether they would.\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\n  We are getting close to the end of this, but we still have important \nmatters to do. We are going to try to work with our colleagues. We have \nmade great strides in the evenings. I am very grateful to Senator Enzi \nand particularly to our staffs who have, each evening, including \nthrough the weekend, worked tirelessly to try and ease the differences \non many of these amendments and have done a brilliant job. This \nlegislation is extraordinarily important. We have had several \namendments, important amendments, but we have also worked out some \nothers that have strengthened the legislation.\n  In a few moments, we will go into adjournment until tomorrow. But \nSenators should look forward to the debate at 9:30 and vote at 10:30 on \nthe cloture petition relative to the Dorgan amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the information of the Members, there \nwill be no further votes this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for the consideration of amendment 988.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would withhold, we have a pending \namendment. I will have to object until we clarify exactly where we are. \nWould the Senator give us 30 seconds?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That would be fine. My intention was to set aside the \npending amendment so I could consider this. Then set this aside and go \nback to the pending amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 988\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his tolerance.\n  Mr. President, I introduced last year a bill I called the Child \nMedication Safety Act. We are offering it as an amendment to this \nunderlying bill. It is my anticipation that we will get a vote on it \nultimately. This is to protect children and their parents from being \ncoerced into administering a controlled substance or psychotropic drug \nin order to attend school. The House passed their version of H.R. 1790 \nby 407 to 12 under suspension of the rules in November of 2005.\n  Parents today face many challenges when raising their children, one \nof which is ensuring that their children receive the best education \npossible. My views on education come from a somewhat unique perspective \nin that my wife Kay was a teacher at Edison High School. My daughters \nare both teachers. I can assure my colleagues that I am one of the \nstrongest supporters of quality education. However, it has come to my \nattention that schools have been acting as physicians or psychologists \nby strongly suggesting that children with behavioral problems be put \nimmediately on some form of psychotropic drugs. Schools and teachers \nare not equipped to make these diagnoses and should make it mandatory \nfor the student to continue attending the school. This is clearly \nbeyond their area of expertise. Therefore, I am introducing this \nlegislation to ensure that parents are not required by school personnel \nto medicate their children.\n  The Child Medication Safety Act requires, as a condition of receiving \nfunds from the Department of Education, that States develop and \nimplement policies and procedures prohibiting school personnel from \nrequiring a child to obtain a prescription as a condition of attending \nschool. It should be noted that this bill does not prevent teachers or \nother school personnel from sharing with parents or guardians \nclassroom-based observations regarding a student's academic performance \nor regarding the need for evaluation of for special education.\n  Additionally, this bill calls for a study by the Comptroller General \nof the United States reviewing: No. 1, the variation among States in \nthe definition of psychotropic medication as used in public education; \nNo. 2, the prescription rates of medication used in public schools to \ntreat children with attention deficit disorders and other such \ndisorders; No. 3, which medications listed under the Controlled \nSubstances Act are being prescribed to such children; and, No. 4, which \nmedications not listed under the Controlled Substances Act are being \nused to treat these children and their properties and effects. This GAO \nreport is due no later than 1 year after enactment of this act.\n  I believe it is an extremely important amendment. It protects the \nrights of our children against improper intrusion regarding health \nissues by those not qualified. If a parent or guardian believes their \nchild is in need of medication, then they ought to have the right to \nmake that decision and consult with a licensed medical practitioner who \nis qualified to prescribe an appropriate drug. I am hoping others will \njoin me in support of the amendment. It is a parental rights amendment \nthat should be supported by all.\n  With that, it is my intention that we will be putting this in line to \nget a vote. I ask unanimous consent now to return to the previous \npending amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his cooperation. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the Senator from Oklahoma wants to go into \nmorning business to make a statement. I ask unanimous consent that \nafter he has completed his statement, that I be recognized for purposes \nof offering my Internet pharmacy protection and safety bill to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, may I ask a point of inquiry of the \nSenator from Massachusetts. Apparently the desk is not in agreement \nwith what we did. We set aside the pending amendment for consideration \nof my amendment which I brought up and presented. Then we returned to \nthat amendment. I would like to ask the Chair if that is accurate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator did not offer his amendment. The \nSenator may offer his amendment, but it was not offered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that his amendment be at the \ndesk and be subject to being called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 988.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect children and their parents from being coerced into \nadministering a controlled substance in order to attend school, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n     SEC.   .

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 1269 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the managers of this bill for giving me this time \nto make this presentation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I understand that I may go forward. I \nappreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 993\n\n       (Purpose: To provide for the regulation of Internet \n     pharmacies)\n  Madam President, today we have been discussing, at some depth, and \nappropriately so, how to protect American citizens who purchase drugs \noverseas--from overseas pharmacies or from Canadian pharmacies--or \npurchase drugs on the Internet. This is a very significant issue for \nAmericans, especially as more and more Americans use the Internet for \nthe purposes of buying all sorts of items, including pharmaceuticals.\n  So we need to be sure this extraordinary regime we have set up in \nthis country stays intact that allows a person, when he or she goes \ninto an American drugstore or goes into an American supermarket, to be \nfairly confident the product they buy is not adulterated and the \nproduct they buy is what it says it is and that in the instance of a \npharmaceutical or a medication, it is going to be what the doctor told \nthem to take. That has been one of the great successes of American \nGovernment. It is because the Food and Drug Administration is \noverseeing this effort to protect the food supply and the \npharmaceutical supply.\n  Whether the Food and Drug Administration has the wherewithal, the \nlegal ability, and the technical and physical ability to protect an \nAmerican who buys an overseas product, a medicine, and imports it into \nthe United States is very much an issue. The FDA is very concerned \nabout their capacity to police effectively drugs coming into this \ncountry, especially over the Internet.\n  So I have an amendment to this bill which basically is the Safe \nInternet Pharmaceutical Act, the purpose of which is to give the FDA \nthe authority necessary to protect people who are buying pharmaceutical \nproducts over the Internet. This is, in my opinion, very important.\n  The importance of this has only been further stressed and exemplified \nby a warning that came out today, fortuitously, from the FDA on the \nissue of Internet pharmacies. I want to read extensively from this \nwarning because it goes to the essence of the debate we have heard on \nthe floor, especially from Senators supporting the proposal from the \nSenator from North Dakota relative to reimportation and safety and \ntheir representation that it is safe to buy over the Internet and that \ntheir amendment will make it legal to buy drugs from outside the United \nStates over the Internet through their reimportation language.\n  This warning from the FDA states as follows: ``FDA Warns Consumers \nabout Counterfeit Drugs from Multiple Internet Sellers.'' I am going to \nread quite a bit of the text because I think, first, it is so on point \nand it is so important:\n\n       The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is cautioning U.S. \n     consumers about dangers associated with buying prescription \n     drugs over the internet. This alert is being issued based on \n     information the agency received showing that 24 apparently \n     related Web sites may be involved in the distribution of \n     counterfeit prescription drugs.\n       On three occasions during recent months, FDA received \n     information that counterfeit versions of--\n\n  I may not get all these medical terms correct, but I hope I do.\n\n       On three occasions during recent months, FDA received \n     information that counterfeit versions of Xenical 120 mg \n     capsules, a drug manufactured by Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc. \n     (Roche), were obtained by three consumers from two different \n     Web sites. Xenical is an FDA-approved drug used to help obese \n     individuals who meet certain weight and height requirements \n     lose weight and maintain weight loss.\n       None of the capsules ordered off the Web sites contained \n     orlistat, the active ingredient in authentic Xenical. In \n     fact, laboratory analysis conducted by Roche and submitted to \n     the FDA confirmed that one capsule contained sibutramine, \n     which is the active ingredient in Meridia, an FDA-approved \n     prescription drug manufactured by Abbott Laboratories.\n       While this product is also used to help people lose weight \n     and maintain that loss, it should not be used in certain \n     patient populations and therefore is not a substitute for \n     other weight loss products. In addition the drug interactions \n     profile is different between Xenical and sibutramine, as is \n     the dosing frequency; sibutramine is administered once daily \n     while Xenical is dosed three times a day.\n       Other samples of drug product obtained from two of the \n     Internet orders were composed of only talc and starch. \n     According to Roche, these two samples displayed a valid Roche \n     lot number of B2306 and were labeled with an expiration date \n     of April 2007. The correct expiration date for this lot \n     number is actually March 2005.\n\n  Pictures of the counterfeit Xenical capsules can be seen on the Web \nsite at FDA. I would note they look exactly like the Xenical that is \nlegitimate. We had a Senator here earlier holding up two prescription \nbottles of, I think it was Lipitor, saying: These two bottles are \nexactly the same, and one could be bought in Canada for about a third \nof what it costs in the United States. Well, you can buy this Xenical \nover the Internet for probably about a third of what it costs in the \nUnited States. The only problem is it might kill you. I am going to \nread further:\n  Roche identified the two Web sites involved in this incident as \nbrandpills.com and pillspharm.com. Further investigation by FDA \ndisclosed that these Web sites are two of 24 Web sites that appear on \nthe pharmacycall365.com home page under the ``Our Websites'' heading. \nFour of these Web sites previously have been identified by FDA's Office \nof Criminal Investigations as being associated with the distribution of \ncounterfeit Tamiflu and counterfeit Cialis.\n  At this point, it appears that these Web sites are operated from \noutside of the United States. Consumers should be wary, if there is no \nway to contact the Web site pharmacy by phone, if prices are \ndramatically lower than the competition, or if no prescription from \nyour doctor is required. As a result, FDA strongly cautions consumers \nabout purchasing drugs from any of these Web sites which may be \ninvolved in the distribution of counterfeit drugs and reiterates \nprevious public warnings about buying prescription drugs online.\n\n  Then it lists the 24 Web sites, and some of them have very seductive\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\nnames: ``Pharmacea.org,'' ``MensHealthDrugs.net,'' ``MediClub.md''--\nvery seductive names, in order to draw people into purchasing drugs on \nthese sites.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this press release from \nthe FDA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the FDA News, May 1, 2007]\n\n  FDA Warns Consumers About Counterfeit Drugs from Multiple Internet \n                                Sellers\n\n       The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is cautioning U.S. \n     consumers about dangers associated with buying prescription \n     drugs over the Internet.

(Pictures of the counterfeit \n     Xenical capsules provided by Roche can be viewed at http://\nwww.fda.gov/bbs/topics/news/photos/xenical.html.)\n       Roche identified the two Web sites involved in this \n     incident as brandpills.com and pillspharm.com.

Four of these Web \n     sites previously have been identified by FDA's Office of \n     Criminal Investigations as being associated with the \n     distribution of counterfeit Tamiflu and counterfeit Cialis.\n       At this point, it appears that these Web sites are operated \n     from outside of the United States.

As a result, \n     FDA strongly cautions consumers about purchasing drugs from \n     any of these Web sites which may be involved in the \n     distribution of counterfeit drugs and reiterates previous \n     public warnings about buying prescription drugs online \n     [Consumers are urged to review the FDA Web page at \n     www.fda.gov/buyonline/ for additional information prior to \n     making purchases of prescription drugs over the Internet.]\n       The 24 Web sites appear on pharmacycall365.com: \n     AllPills.net, Pharmacy-4U.net, DirectMedsMall.com, \n     Brandpills.com, Emediline.com, RX-ed.com, RXePharm.com, \n     Pharmacea.org, PillsPharm.com, MensHealthDrugs.net, \n     BigXplus.net, MediClub.md, InterTab.de, Pillenpharm.com, \n     Bigger-X.com, PillsLand.com, EZMEDZ.com, UnitedMedicals.com, \n     Best-Medz.com, USAPillsrx.net, USAMedz.com, BluePills-Rx.com, \n     Genericpharmacy.us and I-Kusui.jp.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. It is, of course, ironic that in the middle of this debate \nover how you make safe drugs that Americans are purchasing, and assure \nthat the FDA has the proper oversight, that the FDA would be issuing \nthis warning. It is a coincidence. The FDA did not do it because we are \nin the middle of this debate. They did it because they had received the \nnecessary information to fairly well substantiate that at least in \nthree incidents the medication that was purchased was not the \nmedication that was approved by the FDA, even though it was represented \nas that medication, even though it came in a bottle that looked exactly \nlike that medication, even though it had a tamperproof seal, and it had \na label and a date as to when that medication would expire and a lot \nnumber. So it certainly looked legitimate. So this just confirms the \nconcern which many of us have that we have to set up a regime where the \nFDA can properly review what is happening relative to drugs that are \nbeing purchased over the Internet, especially. It is not impossible to \ndo that. In fact, it is very doable. That is why I will offer this \namendment.\n\n  The amendment I will offer basically sets up a system whereby the FDA \nwill require that pharmaceutical products sold over the Internet be \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States and that they get an \nFDA seal of approval which is tamper-proof. So if a citizen wants to \nuse a pharmaceutical site, he or she can go on line and call up a \npharmaceutical site, such as drugs.com or whatever--that may actually \nbe a site, so I probably shouldn't use that term--but a site where you \nthink you can purchase drugs at a better price than what you are going \nto have to pay for them somewhere else, they will see on that Web site \na seal like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, only it will be a \ntamper-proof seal which will reflect the fact that the FDA monitors \nthat site, monitors that pharmacy.\n  Also, the pharmacy has subjected itself to American jurisdiction, so \nthat if there is an illegal act, they can be prosecuted, or if there \nare issues of liability, they can be sued; also, that there is contact \ninformation which is based in America relative to that and that there \nis a searchable database where you can go in and find out what that \npharmacy has done in the past relative to its prescription-filling \nactivity.\n  This would all be supported by a fee system which gives the FDA the \nresources to accomplish this type of monitoring. It really seems like \nthe most logical thing to do.\n  There is no way you can stop the imagination and desire of the \nAmerican people to get the best price. That is part of the essence of \nour character. So it is reasonable that Americans are going to use \nonline pharmacies, but we have to make sure we have a system where we \ndo not have one approval process for legitimate purchasing of drugs \nthrough pharmaceutical activity at your local pharmacy and then another \nprocess for purchasing drugs which has absolutely no oversight from the \nFDA if you purchase on the Internet. We have to make sure that if you \nare using an Internet site, the site has been subject to the same \nreview as the local pharmacy down at the corner is subject to, relative \nto the quality and management of that pharmaceutical product they are \nselling. That is what this amendment does.\n  I hope no one will object to it, but I know other people will. But \nthey shouldn't because this is really something whose time has come. So \nI am going to offer this amendment tonight. It is timely, of course, in \nlight of this FDA warning which says there are potentially 24 Web sites \nthey have identified, at least 3 of which are selling adulterated \ndrugs, that they know of, which could seriously harm and possibly, if \ntaken in the wrong dosage, since they aren't the proper drug, actually \ndo more than just harm you, they could permanently injure you.\n  In light of that warning which came out today, it is totally \nreasonable and appropriate that the Congress should certainly, if it is \ngoing to do a drug safety bill relative to the FDA, include in it an \nInternet pharmacy safety regime which will give the American people \nsome confidence that when they go on line to purchase a drug on line, \nthe site, the portal they are purchasing it through, is subject to FDA \nreview and the drug they are purchasing is an FDA-approved drug, which \nis made clear by having this tamper-proof seal of approval. It would \nalso reflect the fact that the FDA actually has physical oversight over \nthat pharmacy, that online pharmacy, and gives the FDA the resources to \ndo that oversight. You can't just say: Go and do it, if they don't have \nthe money to do it; you have to give them the resources to do it.\n  In addition, it sets up a one-stop shopping site at the FDA where \npeople can go on line to the FDA site, check out that Internet \npharmacy, if they wish, and make sure the Internet pharmacy does \nqualify and does carry FDA-approved drugs.\n  I think it is a very proper approach. It is something, as I \nmentioned, which is clearly timely in light of this FDA warning.\n  Madam President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\namendment be set aside and that I may call up amendment No. 993 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself and \n     Mr. Coleman, proposes an amendment numbered 993.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, May 1, 2007, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank my colleagues for allowing me to go forward at \nthis time.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1010\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today to talk about an issue of \ngreat importance but also of great concern: the importation of \nprescription drugs.\n  In their search for more affordable prescription drugs, many \nAmericans have turned to pharmacies in other countries, either via the \nInternet or trips across the border. While I certainly understand their \nneed for affordable drugs, I do have concerns about this particular \nsolution. We must find a way to ensure that the drugs Americans are \nbuying are safe.\n  I believe the Cochran amendment will do just that. Senator Cochran's \namendment allows importation to take effect only if the Health and \nHuman Services Secretary can ensure that it will pose no additional \nrisk to the public health and result in a significant reduction in the \ncost of prescription drugs. So with this amendment, we get safe drugs \nat a reduced price, and our ultimate objective is achieved.\n  Looking closely at the issue of safety, I am also concerned about the \nimportation of counterfeit drugs. Americans deserve to know the label \non the bottle--we have seen colleagues put bottles up and show \ndifferences. Well, Americans deserve to know the label on the bottle \nmatches the pills inside they are taking. The only way to ensure that \nis to provide strong protections. We have all heard horror stories \nabout innocent Americans, starved for cheaper prescription drugs, going \nonline or getting in their cars to go to foreign pharmacies to buy \ntheir medications. They are coming back home with what they think is \ntheir usual medication, but the reality might be quite different.\n  A recent New York Times article talked about the increasing number of \ncounterfeit drugs. While in the past we may have noticed a misspelled \nlabel or off-color pill, today's counterfeit drugs are largely \nundetectable. The pills look correct, the cardboard boxes are the same, \neven the blister packaging and foil backing are all normal. But this is \nnot your grandmother's forged medication. These are modern, scary, \nlife-threatening tactics that place American lives in great danger.\n  While the supporters of the underlying amendment believe their \nproposal addresses some of these concerns, there are a number of safety \nconcerns that I believe must be addressed by the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, and that is why the Cochran amendment is so \nimportant.\n  The underlying proposal would undo current safety protections that \nensure Americans are getting products that are essentially the same \nsubstance and quantity as what their doctor has prescribed.\n  While the proposal requires an importer to retain samples of \nproducts, it does not require that those be tested to ensure the drugs \nare the same as what the doctor ordered.\n  The proposal does not require that imported drugs be approved in \ntheir country of origin. It relies only on a paper trail to enforce \nchain-of-custody requirements, leaving consumers susceptible to \nunscrupulous dealers who can simply forge documents or copy \nanticounterfeit technology.\n  While supporters of the proposal claim that they give FDA the \nauthority to conduct inspections of foreign manufacturing plants, the \nreality is that the United States would actually have to get permission \nfor those inspections from foreign countries, and that is assuming we \ncan even trace the purchase of those products to their country of \norigin in the first place.\n  Importers are not required to disclose the origin of the products \nthey sell, so consumers would have no way to opt out if they wanted to \nensure they were getting Food and Drug Administration-approved \nproducts.\n  Finally, the underlying amendment allows importation from far more \nthan just Canada. Written into the proposal is permission to import \nfrom Canada and other countries, including certain countries in the EU, \neven if the drugs leave the chain of custody of the manufacturer or \nfall outside of the Food and Drug Administration's jurisdiction. \nBecause of the EU structure, we would actually be opening ourselves to \ndrugs from countries such as Latvia, Estonia, and other recent \nadditions to the EU. Some of these countries from the former Soviet \nUnion have counterfeit rates up to 20 percent.\n  The Cochran amendment would ensure these safety concerns are resolved \nand that the Government provides for the protection of the public's \nhealth and safety.\n  Now, in my mind, as we have this debate, the real problem is \naffordability of prescription drugs, and the real solution to that \nproblem is expanding access to affordable drugs in the United States. \nIn that effort, I take a back seat to no one. But at the same time, I \nstrongly believe we must also protect the health and safety of those we \nrepresent.\n  These two goals are not mutually exclusive. We can and must do both. \nI believe this amendment--the Cochran amendment--accomplishes what we \nall want, which is expanding access to safe, affordable drugs. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the Cochran amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1011\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to join Senators Stabenow, \nLott, Brown, and Thune in offering amendment No. 1011. This amendment \nwill help speed the introduction of cost-saving generic drugs by \npreventing abuses of the Food and Drug Administration citizen petition \nprocess.\n  Consumers continue to suffer all across our country from the high--\nand ever rising--cost of prescription drugs. A recent independent study \nfound that prescription drug spending has more than quadrupled since \n1990, and now accounts for 11 percent of all health care spending. At \nthe same time, the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most \nprofitable industries in the world, returning more than 15 percent on \ntheir investments.\n  One key method to bring prescription drug prices down is to promote \nthe introduction of generic alternatives to expensive brand name drugs. \nConsumers realize substantial savings once generic drugs enter the \nmarket. Generic drugs cost on average of 63 percent less than their \nbrandname equivalents. One study estimates that every 1 percent \nincrease in the use of generic drugs could save as much as $4 billion \nin health care costs.\n  This is why I have been so active in pursuing legislation designed to \ncombat practices which impede the introduction of generic drugs. The \namendment offered today, includes provisions based on legislation that \nI first introduced with Senator Leahy in the last Congress, and targets \none particularly pernicious practice by brandname drug companies to \nimpede or block the marketing of generic drugs--abuse of the FDA \ncitizen petition process.\n  FDA rules permit any person to file a so-called citizen petition to \nraise concerns about the safety or efficacy of a generic drug that a \nmanufacturer is seeking FDA approval to bring to market. While this \ncitizen petition process was put in place for a laudable purpose, \nunfortunately in recent years it has been abused by frivolous petitions \nsubmitted by brandname drug manufacturers, or individuals acting at \ntheir behest, whose only purpose is to delay the introduction of \ngeneric competition. The FDA has a policy of not granting any new \ngeneric manufacturer's drug application until after it has\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\nconsidered and evaluated any citizen petitions regarding that drug. The \nprocess of resolving a citizen petition, even if ultimately found to be \ngroundless, can delay the approval by months or years. Indeed, \nbrandname drug manufacturers often wait to file citizen petitions until \njust before the FDA is about to grant the application to market the new \ngeneric drug manufacturer's solely for the purpose of delaying the \nintroduction of the generic competitor for the maximum amount of time \npossible. This gaming of the system should not be tolerated.\n  In recent years, FDA officials have expressed serious concerns about \nthe abuse of the citizen petition process. In 2005, FDA Chief Counsel \nSheldon Bradshaw noted that ``[t]he citizen petition process is in some \ncases being abused. Sometimes, stakeholders try to use this mechanism \nto unnecessarily delay approval of a competitor's products.'' He added \nthat he found it ``particularly troublesome'' that he had ``seen \nseveral examples of citizen petitions that appear designed not to raise \ntimely concerns with respect to the legality or scientific soundness of \napproving a drug application, but rather to delay approval by \ncompelling the agency to take the time to consider the arguments raised \nin the petition, regardless of their merits, and regardless of whether \nthe petitioner could have made those very arguments months and months \nbefore.''\n  And a simple look at the statistics gives credence to these concerns. \nOf the 21 citizen petitions for which the FDA has reached a decision \nsince 2003, 20--or 95 percent of them--have been found to be without \nmerit. Of these, 10 were identified as ``eleventh hour petitions''--\ndefined as those filed less than 6 months prior to the estimated entry \ndate of the generic drug. None of these 10 ``eleventh hour petitions'' \nwere found to have merit, but each caused unnecessary delays in the \nmarketing of the generic drug by months or over a year, causing \nconsumers to spend millions and millions of dollars for their \nprescription drugs than they would have spent without these abusive \nfilings.\n  Among other things, our amendment will, for the first time, require \nall those who file citizen petitions to affirm certain basic facts \nabout the truthfulness and good faith of the petition, similar to what \nis required of every litigant who makes a filing in court. Our \namendment also includes a provision from my bill that directs the HHS \nthat all citizen petitions on generic drug applications be adjudicated \nwithin 6 months of filing, which will put an end to excessive delays in \nbringing needed generic drugs to market because of the filings of these \npetitions.\n  While I strongly support this amendment and I am pleased that many of \nmy provisions were included, I do wish the amendment could have gone \neven farther and include my provision to allow the Department of Health \nand Human Services--the FDA's parent agency--the power to sanction \nthose who abuse the process. While this proposal would not have an \neffect on any person filing a truly meritorious citizen petition, this \nprovision would serve as a strong deterrent to attempts by brand name \ndrug manufacturers or any other party that seeks to abuse the citizen \npetition process to thwart competition. Having said that, I do believe \nour amendment today is an important step in the right direction to \nremove a significant obstacle exploited by brand name drug companies to \nprevent or delay the introduction of generic drugs. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1016\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the Food and Drug Administration \nRevitalization Act is an important step toward protecting American \nconsumers and patients and ensuring the safety of prescription drugs. \nTo increase the safety and efficacy of prescription drug approval, I \nwill offer an amendment to establish the National Centers of \nPharmaceutical Innovation. These Centers, in consultation with the Food \nand Drug Administration, FDA, Commissioner, will modernize medical \nproduct development and enhance product safety.\n  I am very concerned about long delays and the safety of bringing new \ndrugs to patients. The FDA has been faced with the withdrawal of \nprescription drugs from the market due to concerns about increased \nhealth risks. This situation illustrates the difficulty in achieving \nthe right balance in investigating new drugs that, while intended to \nhelp patients, can also come with very serious risks. Furthermore, such \nincidents could lead to the erosion of public confidence in the safety \nof medicines developed by drug companies. Drug companies spend enormous \nsums of money to test potential new candidate medicines. Not only is \nthe process of developing and testing a new drug costly, it is lengthy \nas well. As a result of delays in the clinical trials process, there \nare fewer drug discoveries each passing year, ultimately hindering our \nNation's competitiveness in this field.\n  According to Ernst R. Berndt, Ph.D., Adrian H. B. Gottschalk, S.M., \nMatthew W. Strobeck, Ph.D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, \nSloan School of Management, ``scientific advances and enhanced \n[research and development] efforts, the number of average annual new \ndrug applications, NDAs, and new biologic license applications, BLAs, \napproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been smaller \nafter 2000 than in the mid-1990s. Moreover, recent estimates suggest \nthe average costs of bringing a new medicine to market have increased \nsharply to between $800 million and $1.7 billion, with the lower \nestimate being 2\\1/2\\ times higher than similar inflation-adjusted \nestimates published a dozen years earlier.'' Clearly, there is great \nneed to improve the methods and science that are used to approve \nprescription drugs.\n  I am further concerned that new technologies, including genomics, \nproteomics, and bioinformatics are not being fully incorporated into \nthe drug approval process. Using these new technologies as part of the \nclinical drug approval process has the potential to substantially \nreduce costs and the time needed to develop and test new drugs. \nAdditionally, we must improve the workforce available to pharmaceutical \ncompanies, which is not well trained in the modern tools needed for \nsophisticated drug development. The FDA does not have a structured \nresearch program to bridge this knowledge and workforce gap and has few \nextramural research activities in place to tap the expertise available \nin our Nation's university health programs.\n  This amendment will establish the National Centers for Pharmaceutical \nInnovation to improve the development and testing of new drugs so that \nthey make it to market more quickly and remain there. Up to five \ncenters will be operated by universities in partnership with the FDA to \ndevelop methods to utilize new technology to improve the drug approval \nsystem. They will also expand the quality and number of professionals \ntrained to work in this field. The centers will introduce new \ntechnologies to improve the manufacture of pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnology products.\n  I believe these centers can provide a significant part of the \nsolution to this complex problem. These centers will be established \nfrom qualified universities that have graduate training programs with \nextensive experience in the development and evaluation of medicines; \nand proficiencies in pharmaceutical and biotechnology science and \nengineering. It is the expectation that the work completed by these \ncenters and the FDA would lead to an increased number of drugs brought \nto market by industry, at a decreased cost. Another effect will be an \nenormous gain to the public's health, while decreasing the chance of \nunintentional harm and costs of medical care.\n  The National Centers for Pharmaceutical Innovation hold a promising \nsolution to the problems in drug discovery and safety facing our Nation \ntoday. I encourage my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n\n\n                           Overturning DSHEA\n\n  Mr. HATCH. My office has been inundated by calls from people \nthroughout the country who believe that this legislation, specifically \nthe provision establishing a Reagan-Udall Institute, will overturn the \nDietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. That has not been \nmy reading of the bill, but I wonder if other Senators have heard \nsimilar concerns?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I have received a good many calls as well. And, I \nhave to say that I would be very concerned, as I know the Senator from \nUtah is, if\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\nanything in the bill we are considering, S. 1082, would overturn DSHEA, \na law we fought side-by-side to see enacted.\n  Mr. ENZI. It might be helpful if I explained the provision you are \ndiscussing, as my office has received many calls as well and I believe \nthe callers are not informed about this matter. Subtitle B of title II \nof S. 1028 establishes the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and \nDrug Administration. That simple purpose of that nonprofit Foundation \nis to lead collaborations among the FDA, academic research institutions \nand industry designed to bolster research and development productivity, \nprovide new tools for improving safety in regulated product evaluation, \nand in the long term make the development of those products more \npredictable and manageable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is exactly the purpose of the Foundation, which was \nincluded in the drug safety legislation Senator Enzi and I introduced \nlast year. The Foundation will be financially supported by industry and \nphilanthropic donated funds. A chief scientist at FDA will promote \nintramural research and coordinate it with efforts at the Foundation.\n  Mr. HATCH. That explanation is very helpful. What, specifically, \nwould the role of the Foundation be with respect to dietary \nsupplements?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me make absolutely clear that the Reagan-Udall \nFoundation will in no way override, overturn or conflict with the \nDietary Supplement Health and Education Act. Nothing in this bill would \nhave that effect.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, we took great pains to make certain there would be no \nconflict with DSHEA. Regarding foods, and dietary supplements are \ngenerally regulated as foods, the general directive of the Foundation \nis to identify holes in the evaluation of food safety and identify ways \nto address those deficiencies through collaborative research with \nindustry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So to make this absolutely clear, what you are saying is \nthat the bill we are debating would in no way interfere with consumers' \naccess to dietary supplements?\n  Mr. HATCH. To add to that point, it seems that the language could, in \nfact, help dietary supplement consumers, because it would allow \ncollaboration between government and industry to conduct research on \nissues that might be helpful to supplement consumers?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, that is the case.\n  Mr. ENZI. I agree with Chairman Kennedy's assessment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank you for those assurances and that clarification.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This has been a very helpful discussion, because Senator \nHatch and I could never support legislation that would interfere with \nDSHEA and we are glad to receive the assurances of the chairman and the \nranking Republican on the committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/02/senate-section/article/S5492-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Madam President, when I was a young law student at \nGeorgetown, the event that stands out the most in my memory was a \nmorning that I and a few other young law students working at various \nagencies for the summer had with the then Attorney General. It was \nAttorney General Robert Kennedy. In that meeting, he stressed to us \nover and over again the professionalism of the Department of Justice \nand how the professionals had to stay out of any kind of partisan \npolitics and that he would insist upon it.\n  I was inspired by that meeting. I think it probably shaped my \ndecision to go into public life more than any other single meeting I \nhad.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article in today's USA Today by \nRonald Goldfarb entitled ``Crossing the Line at Justice'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From USA Today, Wednesday, May 2, 2007]\n\n                       Crossing a Line at Justice\n\n                          (By Ronald Goldfarb)\n\n       The current agonies of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales \n     call to mind a dramatic moment in the Robert F. Kennedy \n     Justice Department. Members of his organized crime section \n     were in RFK's office reviewing our pending investigations and \n     cases. One of our group advised Kennedy that his grand jury \n     investigations were about to lead to the indictment of the \n     then-mayor of a large Midwestern city, one that had voted for \n     his brother John Kennedy in the close presidential election \n     of 1960.\n       When my colleague completed his report about the big scalp \n     about to be added to our list of political corruption cases, \n     RFK was quiet. It happened that the scalp in question \n     belonged to President Kennedy's ambassador-designate to \n     Greece. The attorney general smiled slightly and facetiously \n     remarked: ``Well, that's nice. Now my brother's going to have \n     to put me on the Supreme Court.'' The indictment went forward \n     and included others in the city's political (Democratic) \n     machine. All were convicted.\n       That anecdote is relevant today as the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee considers the attorney general's recent dismissals \n     of several U.S. attorneys. When it comes to the proper \n     administration of justice in the Department of Justice, there \n     are politics and there are politics.\n\n\n                              the two p's\n\n       Capital ``P'' politics--that is, party politics, such as \n     the partisan personal shenanigans of Gonzales meddling with \n     the independence of competent prosecutors' discretion in \n     response to political pressures--are improper and have no \n     place in the justice system. Small ``p'' politics, the \n     imposition of discretionary preferences, policies and \n     priorities in the focus of prosecutorial discretion, \n     generally are proper. Partisans must accept them, like it or \n     not. They are not the basis for replacing attorneys general.\n       The distinction is important. When the Justice Department \n     that I served in during the Kennedy administration came to \n     office, ``political'' priorities changed. The internal \n     security division, active and robust during the Eisenhower \n     administration when loyalty was a major concern, was de-\n     emphasized and eventually was deactivated. The organized \n     crime and the civil rights sections, small and quiet in \n     earlier years, grew into major centers of departmental work \n     and were the centerpiece of RFK's regime. That kind of \n     priority setting is proper.\n       Administrations come to office offering change. Like these \n     changes or not, people cannot claim they involve improper \n     politics. Critics have the right to change administrations \n     with their votes in subsequent elections. Had Al Gore been \n     elected, no doubt environmental prosecutions would have taken \n     front and center in the department's efforts.\n       After Sept. 11, 2001, homeland security would have been any \n     attorney general's special interest, RFK's included. So if \n     one deplores the values and priorities of the John Ashcroft \n     and Gonzales administrations at Justice, USA Patriot Act \n     excesses and the like, the recourse will be at the 2008 \n     voting machines.\n       On the other hand, capital ``P'' party politics have no \n     place in any Justice Department. That is the unique \n     indictment of Gonzales, and one that should lead to his \n     replacement. All attorneys general face political pressure to \n     act against their parties' political enemies and to protect \n     their friends. Those are the moments of truth for all \n     attorneys general, the one that Gonzales failed, to the \n     embarrassment of even his own party representatives.\n\n\n                              rfk's tests\n\n       When RFK was attorney general, two comparable moments stand \n     out in my memory. In one, his notorious father's long-time \n     attorney--James Landis, ``a virtual member of the immediate \n     family,'' according to one biography--was charged with \n     failing to file his tax returns for five years. Immense \n     pressures were put on Kennedy to find an excuse not to indict \n     the aging and prestigious former Harvard law dean. RFK stayed \n     out of the decision-making process, and Landis pleaded guilty \n     and received a brief incarceration. But for his close \n     association with the Kennedys, Landis probably would not have \n     suffered so. Everyone wanted to help Landis, but they were \n     super self-conscious about the propriety of doing so.\n       A similar moment arose when an investigation showed that \n     the brother of the influential congressman from New York, \n     Eugene Keogh, had abused his office as a New York state \n     supreme court judge. Kennedy agonized over the political \n     pressures on him; he worried that the not open-and-shut case \n     might not be winnable, after major political embarrassment to \n     Kennedy loyalists. To his credit, Keogh told Kennedy he knew \n     he'd do the right and fair thing. The attorney general's \n     aides pressed him to do what he'd do in any other non-\n     political case. Judge J.

Madam President, I am here today to recognize and pay \ntribute to COL Anthony J. ``Lazer'' Lazarski, Chief of the Air Force \nSenate Liaison, for his 25 years of exceptional service and dedication \nto the U.S. Air Force and our great country. Colonel Lazarski is a \ncommand pilot with over 2,300 flight hours in 12 different types of \naircraft, including the RF-4, F-15, F-16, F-111 and F-117. He has \nsupported combat operations around the world, to include the Libya Raid \nand Operations Desert Storm, Desert Fox, Allied Force, Southern Watch, \nand Iraqi Freedom. Throughout his military career, he has been \nrecognized by his superiors and subordinates as a leader in the air and \non the ground--an Airman with the ability to motivate and lead.\n  COL Lazer Lazarski grew up in North Arlington, NJ, and watched them \nbuild the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center from the basement up. \nHe earned an appointment to the Air Force Academy and graduated in 1982 \nwith military honors. Upon completion of pilot training, he was \nselected to fly the F-111 and earned the distinction of Top Gun for \nboth his T-38 Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals class and his F-111 \nReplacement Training Unit class. While flying in Tactical Air Command \nwith the 79th NATO Tigers at RAF Upper Heyford, he was selected as the \nwing's youngest instructor pilot. Shortly thereafter, he was selected \nas the youngest United States Air Forces in Europe flight examiner. As \na pilot, I can attest to the fact that you only allow your sharpest and \nmost mature pilots to set, evaluate, and enforce the standards for \nother pilots. I happen to be a flight instructor currently. I can \nassure you, they are the very best people. This is a major \naccomplishment he was able to achieve.\n  Colonel Lazarski later transitioned to the F-117 Stealth Fighter and \nearned Top Gun in his third aircraft, this time during a Southern Watch \ndeployment over the skies of Iraq. Colonel Lazarski demonstrated he \ncould not only deliver precise weapons on target on time, he could also \nmotivate and lead others. In recognition of his extraordinary \nleadership, he was named 12th Air Force Flight Commander of the Year, \nand selected to attend the Naval War College.\n  After graduating from the Naval War College in 1994, he served 3 \nyears in Naples, Italy at NATO Headquarters, including as the aide-de-\ncamp to two different Commanders, Allied Air Forces in Southern Europe. \nOne of these Commanders was then LTG Mike Ryan, who would later become \nAir Force Chief of Staff. During his tour, he was one of the first \ncombat troops on the ground in Sarajevo as he helped set up the NATO \nAir Operations Center.\n  In 1997, he transitioned to the F-15 Strike Eagle, serving as the \n336th Fighter Squadron Assistant Operations Officer and deployed \ncommander from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, NC. During this tour he \nalso served as Chief of the Command Post and integrated new command and \ncontrol systems to include hurricane tracking/forecasting systems put \nto test in 3 years of multiple hurricanes.\n  In 2001 he graduated No. 1 from his Air War College Class, earning \nthe Wright Brothers Officership Award and Military Outstanding \nVolunteer Medal. This honor earned him the right to serve the next year \nat Vance Air Force Base, in my home state of Oklahoma as the Deputy \nOperations Group Commander.\n  Due to the superb leadership Colonel Lazarski demonstrated at Vance, \nhe was selected as the Director of Air Combat Command's Commander \nAction Group--the strategic ``think tank'' for our Air Force's lead \ncombat command. In this position he was given the immense \nresponsibility for developing strategy, doctrine, concepts, tactics and \nprocedures for U.S. air and space power employment.\n\n  Colonel Lazarski's next assignment led him back to command, this time \nin Air Education Training Command as the Commander of the 479th Flying \nTraining Group where he was responsible for training new pilots in the \nT-6, and new fighter pilots and weapons officers in the T-38. Colonel \nLazarski oversaw 115 aircraft averaging 300 sorties a day, and despite \nfive hurricanes in one season, no student ever graduated late under \nColonel Lazarski's leadership.\n  In 2005 at the culmination of an exceptional military career, Colonel \nLazarski was reassigned to Capitol Hill as the Chief of the Air Force \nSenate Liaison Division. Here Colonel Lazarski integrated his \nremarkable experience and leadership with ceaseless integrity, \ninitiative, and persistence to result in unparalleled effectiveness on \nbehalf of the Air Force and our Nation.\n  We offer our sincere thanks to Colonel Lazarski, his wife Stephanie, \nand their son Andrew for their unwavering support of our country and \nthe freedom we hold so dear. We congratulate Colonel Lazarski on the \ncompletion of an exemplary active-duty career. Utilizing the theme from \none of my favorite books, Message to Garcia, let me close by saying: \nMessage delivered and job well done! Now a new mission awaits you, and \nI'm honored to have you serve your country again, this time as my \nMilitary Legislative Assistant. Congratulations and welcome!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/02/senate-section/article/S5493-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REMOVAL OF COSPONSOR\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, today I rise to acknowledge the very \nspecial and meaningful contributions of Ms. Heideh Shahmoradi, who is \ndeparting the U.S. Senate after serving as detailee for some 4 years \nfrom the Department of Transportation. I come to the floor today to \nthank personally Heideh for her assistance and professionalism as a \ndetailee to me on both the Environment and Public Works, EPW, Committee \nand the Appropriations Committee.\n  In my former position as chair of the EPW's Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, Heideh provided me with invaluable \nadvice and help in the development and passage of the highway \nreauthorization legislation, Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users: or SAFETEA. Heideh \nplayed a key role in helping the committee understand the complexities \nand implications of SAFETEA which helped to ensure that the final \nlegislation properly balanced these very complex policy and funding \nissues. And as a program expert from the Department, Heideh was able to \nprovide valuable insights on the potential impact of the legislation on \nhighway transportation activities. Heideh not only contributed \nsignificantly in analyzing the legislation but she also performed \nimportant duties, such as research, fact-checking, editing, and \ndrafting report language and legislation. Heideh did it all with \ndistinction and unflappable good humor.\n  Her skills and performance on working on the EPW Committee made it an \neasy decision to bring her back from the Department to help me on the \nAppropriations Committee. Heideh not only continued to assist me on the \nFederal-aid highway programs on the Senate Transportation, HUD, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, but she also quickly \nbecame a resource and expert on all of the other modes under the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  Throughout her tenure on Capitol Hill, Heideh provided technical \nexpertise and programmatic knowledge that was critical in policymaking \ndecisions on both the authorizing and appropriations committees. Her \nability to provide a reality check on legislation helped tremendously \nin protecting the best interests of our communities and\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\ntaxpayers. She is simply a true professional civil servant that we are \nfortunate to have in government.\n  Finally, Heideh is a quick study, adaptable, very good at working \nwith others, and cool under pressure. She also is a person of absolute \nintegrity, honor, and loyalty. To their credit, the leadership at the \nDepartment of Transportation has recognized her accomplishments and \nskills and will be giving her new challenges and opportunities. Her \ndeparture is a great loss to the Appropriations Committee and to my \noffice in particular. She will be missed. I strongly commend Heideh for \nher service to me and the U.S. Senate and, while she is leaving us, she \nwill always be part of the Bond office team. I personally wish Heideh, \nher husband Torrance, and her son Corey all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/02/senate-section/article/S5494-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HONORING KENT ``OZ'' C. NELSON\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, today I wish to acknowledge a \nvery special occasion. It has come to my attention that on May 9, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and the CDC Foundation in \nAtlanta will be honoring Kent ``Oz'' C. Nelson, retired chair and CEO \nof UPS, for his unselfish and untiring work on behalf of CDC and public \nhealth around the globe. They will be dedicating CDC's main auditorium \nas the Kent ``Oz'' C. Nelson Auditorium. This is a great honor for a \nman who truly deserves it.\n  As elected officials, we naturally and rightfully expect to hear from \ninterested constituents and from the leaders of our governmental \ninstitutions about programmatic and capital needs. It is much more \nunusual to hear about such needs from a CEO-level leader of a global \ncorporation like UPS. But over the past 8 years, Oz and many other \nCEO's like him, including Bernie Marcus, Phil Jacobs and Christine \nJacobs, have regularly written, called and visited Washington, DC to \nremind us of the importance of upgrading CDC's Atlanta-based labs and \nfacilities to ensure that the world's best scientists are equipped with \nworld-class facilities to support their work.\n  During a tour of CDC in the fall of 1999, Oz, Bernie and Phil were \ntroubled by the condition of CDC labs and its negative impact on CDC's \nability to recruit top scientists and to protect all Americans from a \nhost of threats ranging from SARS, anthrax and pandemic flu to obesity \nand environmental toxins. Scientists were working in overcrowded World \nWar II Quonset huts and cinder block labs with frayed wiring and poor \nventilation.\n  Oz could have just written a letter. He could have written off CDC's \nproblems as the government's problem. Instead, he helped organize a \nconcerted effort to highlight the problem and encourage a solution. In \nthe last 8 years, Congress has appropriated $1.2 billion of the $1.6 \nbillion needed to complete CDC's master facilities plan. One needs only \ntour CDC's campus and visit with the scientists there to see the \namazing results.\n  As elected officials, we learn early to appreciate people like Oz \nNelson. People who are never too busy to care, never to busy to \nidentify and help solve problems. Since ``retiring,'' and I use that \nterm loosely in Oz's case, he has chaired the Annie Casey Foundation, \nserved on the board of the Carter Center in Atlanta, served on the \nboard of the United Way of America and chaired its national fundraising \ncampaign, chaired the board of the CDC Foundation and been instrumental \nin starting and supporting an Atlanta-based Museum of Patriotism that \ncelebrates the American spirit. And these are just a few of his many \nnonprofit interests.\n  Oz Nelson is, himself, a patriot who embodies the very best of the \nAmerican spirit. And I know those of you who know and have worked with \nOz join me today in congratulating him on the dedication of the new \nKent ``Oz'' C. Nelson Auditorium at CDC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/02/senate-section/article/S5494-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolutions:\n\n       H.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho urging Congress to support Federal \n     legislation transferring management of National Forest System \n     Lands within Idaho to the State of Idaho to be managed for \n     the benefit of the rural counties and schools; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                      House Joint Memorial No. 21\n\n       Whereas, the United States Forest Service administers the \n     management of 39 percent of the land base in the state of \n     Idaho, and an additional 22 percent is administered by the \n     United States Bureau of Land Management; and\n       Whereas, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. Section 471, an 1891 law \n     authorizing the President to establish national forests, the \n     purpose for establishing and administering national forests \n     was to set aside public lands reserved as national forests to \n     be controlled and administered, to the extent practical, in \n     accordance with the Act which provided that ``no national \n     forest may be established except to improve and protect the \n     forest, or to secure favorable conditions of water flows, and \n     to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and \n     necessities of citizens''; and\n       Whereas, it has long been the intent and policy of the \n     federal government to hold rural communities harmless from \n     the creation of federal lands and in 1906 the Committee on \n     Public Lands recognized that the presence of federal lands \n     could create a hardship for many counties, as they provided \n     little revenue or commerce at that time; and\n       Whereas, in 1908, Congress created the Twenty-five Percent \n     Fund Act to pay states and and counties 25 percent of \n     receipts collected from national forests and mandated that \n     payments were to be spent on schools and roads, recognizing \n     that viable communities adjacent to the public lands, with \n     adequate roads and schools, were essential for the \n     development and preservation of the national forests; and\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\n       Whereas, the federal policy of holding counties harmless \n     from the creation of public lands within counties was \n     reiterated in 1916 with the creation of the Oregon and \n     California Grant Lands under the Chamberlain-Ferris Act, and \n     again in 1937 with passage of the Oregon and California Grant \n     Lands Act; and\n       Whereas, the forest resources were intended to be managed \n     in such an environmentally responsible manner that they would \n     produce long-term sustainable revenue to share with schools \n     and counties as well as products for the nation; and\n       Whereas, in 2000, Congress passed the Secure Rural Schools \n     and Community Self-Determination Act, commonly known as \n     public law 106-393, which restored historical payment levels \n     previously made to states and counties from the federal \n     government for road and school purposes due to declining \n     levels of actual forest receipts; and\n       Whereas, the reauthorization of public law 106-393 is \n     pending before the United States Congress and Idaho counties \n     are on record as being strongly supportive of a fully-funded \n     approval of this Act; and\n       Whereas, recently, federal land managers have been faced \n     with an ever-present funding shortage and rural counties will \n     be faced with higher property taxes or a reduction in \n     services if the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act is not reauthorized and appropriated; and\n       Whereas, there is continued concern that if the Act is \n     reauthorized and appropriated it may be the last time it \n     occurs and a long-term solution to these issues is necessary; \n     and\n       Whereas, the state of Idaho is dependent upon healthy \n     national forest system lands for economic benefit, recreation \n     and scenic beauty and it is time to demonstrate a new \n     initiative and commitment to the intent and policy of the \n     federal government to hold counties and schools harmless from \n     the creation of federal lands and construct a path leading to \n     economic stability for rural communities and schools; and\n       Whereas, transfer of the management of the national forest \n     system lands that are not designated as wilderness, proposed \n     or recommended wilderness, wild and scenic river, or national \n     recreation area, or designated roadless area in Idaho, to the \n     state of Idaho would promote better stewardship of the public \n     lands, provide financial returns to the counties, secure \n     public access, meet Congress's intent to hold rural \n     communities harmless from the creation of federal lands, and \n     fund schools, road and bridge infrastructure which would \n     offset significant tax increases in rural counties in the \n     event the Secure Rural Schools payments are not reauthorized \n     or are allowed to expire following the 2006 reauthorization; \n     and\n       Whereas, precedent for state administration of federally-\n     owned lands exists in the state of Idaho at the City of Rocks \n     area in southern Idaho and campground-related facilities and \n     land at Lake Cascade; and\n       Whereas, a transfer of management to the state of Idaho \n     would demonstrate a new initiative and commitment to the \n     intent and policy of the federal government to hold rural \n     counties and schools harmless from the consequences of the \n     reservation of federal lands and construct a process leading \n     to economic stability for rural communities and schools; and\n       Whereas, lands for which management responsibility is \n     transferred to the state of Idaho could be administered by \n     the Idaho Department of Lands in cooperation with county \n     officials and with cooperative oversight by the United State \n     Forest Service and state and local government could \n     establish, or use existing natural resource advisory \n     committees composed of a diverse cross-section of the public, \n     with all decisions and actions relating to the lands being \n     required to comply with every federal and state environmental \n     law; and\n       Whereas, the management of these lands would have to meet \n     the mandates of the Healthy Forest Initiative, the National \n     Fire Plan, and state and county fire mitigation plans: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, That we \n     urge the Congress to support federal legislation transferring \n     management of national forest system lands within Idaho to \n     the state of Idaho to be managed for the benefit of the rural \n     counties and schools with the state of Idaho being held \n     harmless from the costs of administration; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is urged to provide that any \n     transfer of management authority would not affect any rights \n     or authority of the state with respect to fish and wildlife, \n     or repeal or modify any provision of law that permits the \n     state or political subdivisions of the state to share in the \n     revenues from federal lands, or any provision of law that \n     provides that fees or charges collected at particular federal \n     areas be used for or credited to specific purposes or special \n     funds; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is urged to provide that fees or \n     revenues collected under state management be allocated 75 \n     percent, or other appropriate percentage, for the benefit of \n     the counties and schools in which the national forest system \n     lands are located and 25 percent, or other appropriate \n     percentage, for the benefit of the national forest in which \n     the lands administered by the state of Idaho are located to \n     be paid at the end of the year to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, and that amounts allocated to the counties should \n     not be taken into account for purposes of the Twenty-five \n     Percent Fund pursuant to 16 U.S.C. Section 500; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That Congress is urged to seek a long-term \n     solution to the significant issues that will face rural \n     counties in the event the Secure Rural Schools payments are \n     not reauthorized or are allowed to expire following the 2006 \n     reauthorization; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-78. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Idaho \n     stating findings of the Legislature and authorizing the \n     legislative council to appoint a committee to undertake and \n     complete a study of the decline in receipts on National \n     Forest System Lands; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 26\n\n       Whereas, it has long been the intent and policy of the \n     federal government to hold rural communities harmless from \n     the creation of federal lands and in 1906 the Committee on \n     Public Lands recognized that the presence of federal lands \n     could create hardship for many counties as they provided \n     little revenue or commerce at that time; and\n       Whereas, in 1908, the federal government promised rural \n     counties 25 percent of all revenues generated from the \n     multiple-use management of the newly created national forests \n     to support public roads and public schools; and\n       Whereas, in recent decades, the forest resources have not \n     been managed in a manner to produce long-term sustainable \n     revenue to share with schools and counties; and\n       Whereas, in 2000, Congress passed Public Law 106-393, the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. \n     The Act restored historical payment levels previously made to \n     states and counties from the federal government for road and \n     school purposes because of declining levels of actual forest \n     receipts; and\n       Whereas, the reauthorization and appropriation of the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act is \n     pending before the United States Congress, and Idaho counties \n     are on record as being strongly supportive of a fully funded \n     approval of this Act; and\n       Whereas, federal land managers continue to be faced with \n     funding shortages. In the event the Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act is not reauthorized and \n     appropriated, counties will be faced with higher property \n     taxes or a reduction in services and, even if the Act is \n     reauthorized and appropriated, it will likely be the last \n     time, and the state of Idaho must seek a long-term solution; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 2006, House Joint Memorial No. 21 was adopted \n     by the members of the Second Regular Session of the Fifty-\n     eighth Idaho Legislature to provide one option to address the \n     problem of declining forest receipts by urging Congress to \n     support federal legislation transferring management of \n     National Forest System lands within Idaho to the state of \n     Idaho to be managed for the benefit of the rural counties and \n     schools: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislative \n     Council is authorized to appoint an interim committee to \n     undertake and complete an assessment of the decline in \n     receipts on National Forest System lands, which have \n     historically been shared with counties, with the goal of the \n     interim committee's recommendations being to develop a \n     federal, bipartisan, long-term solution that addresses \n     sustainable management of federal forest lands to \n     stabilize payments to Idaho's forest counties, which help \n     support roads and schools, and to provided projects that \n     enhance forest ecosystem health and provide employment \n     opportunities, and to improve cooperative relationships \n     among those who use and care about the lands the agencies \n     manage. The Legislative Council shall determine the \n     membership from each house appointed to the interim \n     committee and shall authorize the interim committee to \n     receive input, advice and assistance from interested and \n     affected parties who are not members of the Legislature. \n     As much as is practicable, the interim committee shall \n     work in cooperation and coordination with the state of \n     Idaho, its counties, its school and highway districts, \n     along with the recognized Indian tribes of the state of \n     Idaho. The interim committee is also authorized to retain \n     the services of consultants, within appropriated moneys, \n     who are familiar with forest receipts, and who can provide \n     necessary economic and other research to assist the \n     interim committee and the Legislature in making an \n     informed decision on this most important topic; and now, \n     therefore, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Idaho legislative interim committee on \n     forest receipts will address National Forest System lands, \n     but only those lands that do not have special designations. \n     The interim committee is directed to formulate a solution \n     that will protect all valid existing rights, existing public \n     access\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\n     and activities, including hunting, fishing and recreation, \n     and that will not be construed to interfere with treaties or \n     any other obligations to the Indian tribes, commitments to \n     county governments, or the General Mining Law or Taylor \n     Grazing Act; and now, therefore, be it further\n       Resolved, That nonlegislative members of the interim \n     committee may be appointed by the cochairs of the interim \n     committee who are appointed by the Legislative Council. \n     Nonlegislative members of the interim committee shall not be \n     reimbursed from legislative funds for per diem, mileage or \n     other expenses and shall not have voting privileges regarding \n     the interim committee's recommendations or proposed \n     legislation; and now, therefore, be it further\n       Resolved, That the interim committee shall report its \n     findings, recommendations and proposed legislation, if any, \n     to the Second Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho \n     Legislature. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/02/senate-section/article/S5497-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORT OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive report of a nomination was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. BINGAMAN for the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n       *Steven Jeffrey Isakowitz, of Virginia, to be Chief \n     Financial Officer, Department of Energy.\n\n  *Nomination was reported with recommendation that it be confirmed \nsubject to the nominee's commitment to respond to requests to appear \nand testify before any duly constituted committee of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/02/senate-section/article/S5497-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, \n             Mr. Burr, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \n             Roberts):\n       S. 1262.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Student Loan \nAccountability and Disclosure Reform Act which I, along with Senators \nAlexander, Burr, Isakson, Allard and Murkowski, am introducing today. \nIn this era of rising college costs, it is more important than ever to \nmake sure that the colleges, lenders and guaranty agencies that provide \nloans to help students pay for college operate in a fair, accountable \nand transparent manner.\n  In fiscal year 2007, the Federal Government, through the Federal \nFamily Education Loan, FFEL, and Direct\n\n[[Page S5500]]\n\nLoan programs is expected to back and provide $65.9 billion in new \nloans to students and their parents for attendance at over 6,000 \nschools. The FFEL program accounts for about 79 percent of new student \nloan volume. There are approximately 3,200 FFEL lenders. Thirty-five \nState and private, nonprofit guaranty agencies back the FFEL loans.\n  Overall, the programs are expected to provide financing to 14.3 \nmillion students and their families this year. These students and their \nfamilies are depending upon us to protect them from those individuals \nwho are using the financial loan programs to benefit themselves to the \ndetriment of students.\n  The focus of this bill is to make colleges, lenders and guaranty \nagencies accountable, by prohibiting lenders and guaranty agencies from \noffering inducements, and colleges from accepting them, and by \nrequiring disclosures to students, their families and the public.\n  There are a lot of ethical, hard-working financial aid administrators \nand lenders who have spent their lives helping students go to college. \nIt is a shame that a few bad actors have cast a shadow over the whole \nstudent loan industry. However, in light of recent revelations about \nthe behavior of a few college officials and a few lenders, it is clear \nthat we need to take steps to protect students and their families from \nany actions and arrangements that are not fully disclosed.\n\n  A key part of this bill is a Code of Conduct for institutions of \nhigher education. It prohibits colleges and their employees with \nresponsibility for student financial aid from receiving anything of \nvalue from any lender in exchange for advantages sought by the lender. \nThe prohibition applies not only to gifts and trips, but to \ncompensation for service on advisory boards and consulting contracts.\n  Colleges are prohibited from designating ``preferred lenders.'' \nHowever, they may collect information from lenders, at the college's \ninvitation or upon the request of a lender, including interest rates, \npayment of origination and other fees, discounts, services and terms \nand conditions of the loans, and the lender's contact information, on a \nstandard electronic template. All templates submitted will be made \navailable to current and prospective students and their families. \nColleges will provide students and parents with a guide that enables \nthe students and parents to do their own evaluation of the loan \nproducts, benefits, and services offered by the lenders. An annual \nattestation of college compliance by a high level college official with \nthe Code of Conduct is required.\n  The bill expands prohibitions on guaranty agencies and lenders, \nincluding provisions that prohibit the offering of any premiums, \npayments, prizes, and tuition payments. Guaranty agencies are precluded \nfrom performing any services for colleges without compensation. Lenders \nmay not provide information technology equipment at below market value. \nBoth lenders and guaranty agencies are prohibited from sending \nunsolicited electronic mailings to potential borrowers.\n\n  Finally, the recent revelations of questionable relationships between \ncolleges and lenders have led to new calls to eliminate any areas of \npotential conflicts of interest. For this reason, it is time to phase \nout the ability of colleges to act as lenders in the FFEL program, a \nprovision commonly referred to as ``school-as-lender.''\n  Higher education is crucial to maintaining America's competitiveness. \nEducation at all levels, including lifelong education opportunities, is \nvital to ensuring that America retains its competitive edge in the \nglobal economy. In this global economy, learning is never over and \nschool is never out. If students and families are to make informed \ndecisions about how to pay for college, they must have clear, accurate, \ncomprehensive information on which to base their decisions.\n  We must help and protect the 14.3 million students and their families \nwho will seek student loans this year to pay for the education they \nneed. Therefore, we must maintain the integrity of the student loan \nprograms. Let's fix the system and restore the confidence of students \nthat they are being treated fairly from the beginning, and through the \ntime they are repaying their loans and realizing their goals.\n  I want to thank Senators Alexander, Burr, Isakson, Allard, and \nMurkowski for joining me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand \neligibility for veterans' mortgage life insurance to include members of \nthe Armed Forced receiving specially adapted housing assistance from \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing that will continue a positive trend in the \nprovision of benefits to severely injured servicemembers and their \nfamilies by making assistance available when it is needed most. My bill \nwould give active duty servicemembers who utilize VA's specially \nadapted housing grant assistance with the ability to also purchase \nVeterans' Mortgage Life Insurance, or VMLI, through VA. Under current \nlaw, the receipt of specially adapted housing grants is the gateway to \nVMLI eligibility. And only those separated from service and legally \nclassified as ``veterans'' are able to purchase coverage through VMLI.\n  Servicemembers and veterans who are blind, have lost the use of both \ntheir legs, and who have other severely disabling conditions are \neligible to receive up to $50,000 in grants from VA to assist with \nneeded housing adaptations, such as the widening of doorways, the \nconstruction of wheelchair ramps, and the installment of handrails. \nNotwithstanding this grant assistance, servicemembers and veterans must \nstill pay any underlying mortgage that exists on the modified home. To \nensure that survivors are not saddled with mortgage debt they cannot \nafford following the death of a severely disabled veteran, VA's VMLI \nprogram is available. Under VMLI, up to $90,000 of coverage, or \ncoverage in the amount of any outstanding mortgage debt, whichever is \nless, is available. Veterans pay premiums at standard mortality rates \nand VA contributes subsidy payments so that all program expenses are \nmet.\n  Until recently, grants under the specially adapted housing program \ncould only be made to individuals who had separated from military \nservice. In recognition of what can be an extremely lengthy recovery \nand separation process for those with profoundly disabling conditions, \nin 2004 we in Congress allowed housing grants to be made to active duty \nservicemembers. However, we did not extend the same access to VA's VMLI \nprogram for those still on active duty, an oversight that my \nlegislation would remedy.\n  VA estimates that roughly 30 servicemembers per year will receive \nspecially adapted housing grants, thus giving rise to VMLI eligibility \nshould my bill be enacted. Because it is optional, VA expects only 15 \nservicemembers per year to purchase VMLI policies. Therefore, subsidy \ncosts associated with my legislation are minimal, less than $500,000 \nover 10 years.\n  This Congress increasingly is recognizing that the benefits provided \nto our wounded servicemembers need to flow immediately, and that \noutmoded distinctions between ``veteran'' and ``active duty \nservicemember'' mean little when it comes to honoring our commitment to \nthem. My legislation continues what I believe is an encouraging trend \nthat looks at the career of a military man or woman as a continuum. It \nis a continuum that begins the day they enlist and it ends the day they \ndie. Our Government's benefits should reflect that reality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nassistance for veterans interred in cemeteries other than national \ncemeteries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing that will improve the availability of \ndignified burials for those who have served our country. The Veterans' \nDignified Burial Assistance Act of 2007 would make three improvements \nto programs designed to ensure that veterans are perpetually honored \nfor their service. Let me start by describing the first improvement \nwhich had its genesis, I am proud to say, in my home State of Idaho.\n  We have in Idaho a State veterans' cemetery located in Boise. The \ncemetery was established with the help of VA's State Cemetery Grants \nProgram, a program which pays for 100 percent of\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nthe costs of establishing, expanding, and improving state cemeteries. \nOver one thousand veterans have been interred in the Idaho State \nCemetery since it opened in 2004. I want to focus on 91 of those \nveterans who were interred through a program pioneered in Idaho called \n``Missing in America.''\n  Through the Missing in America program Idaho cemetery officials, \nworking with veterans' organizations and others, have actively sought \nto locate the unclaimed cremated remains of veterans throughout the \nState. They contacted funeral homes, county coroner offices, and any \nother place where those remains may have been located. Remarkably, they \ndiscovered the remains of 91 veterans. After verifying that they had \neligibility, all 91 veterans were given a dignified burial.\n  I suspect what was found in Idaho would be found in other States. My \nlegislation would incentivize other States to develop Missing in \nAmerica programs like Idaho's by allowing revenue from VA's plot \nallowance benefit to go to states which seek out and inter unclaimed \nremains.\n  Under current law, State cemeteries may be reimbursed for the cost of \ninterring eligible veterans. For each eligible veteran interred, a $300 \nplot allowance may be paid by VA. Revenue from the plot allowance is \nused to operate and maintain the appearance of State cemeteries. \nHowever, plot allowance revenue is not payable to States when veterans \nare interred more than 2 years after the permanent burial or cremation \nof the veteran's body. Thus, since each of the 91 veterans interred in \nIdaho had been left sitting on shelves in an urn for a great deal \nlonger than 2 years, no plot allowance is payable. This doesn't make \nsense. Just as our system of benefits does not abandon or give up on \nveterans who are homeless or chronically ill, so too should our burial \nbenefits system be designed not to abandon or give up on veterans whose \nremains are unclaimed. To that end, my legislation would waive the 2-\nyear limit so that States could receive plot allowance revenue for \ninterment of the unclaimed remains of veterans. The extra plot \nallowance revenue could be used to help states meet costs associated \nwith running this program and other cemetery operation costs. Most \nimportantly, my legislation would reward States for giving veterans \nwhat is long overdue: a fitting burial.\n  The second way my legislation helps to ensure dignified burials is by \nincreasing VA's plot allowance benefit from $300 to $400. As I \nmentioned earlier, the plot allowance can be paid directly to a State \ncemetery for the interment of eligible veterans. But it can also be \npaid to the survivors of veterans who purchase burial space on their \nown in the private market. Under current law, veterans who die in a VA \nfacility, who are in receipt of disability compensation, or who have \nlow incomes and are in receipt of VA pension are eligible to receive \nthe $300 plot allowance benefit. The plot allowance, created in 1973, \nis designed to ensure that veterans are not buried in a pauper's grave. \nWhen the benefit was created, it covered 13 percent of the average cost \nof an adult funeral. Today, it only covers approximately 5 percent of \nthe cost. An independent assessment of VA burial benefits directed by \nCongress and published in 2000 recommended, as an option, increasing \nthe plot allowance to $670, which at the time of the assessment \nrepresented 13 percent of the average cost of an adult funeral. Since \nthat assessment was published, the major veterans' organizations have \npersistently recommended that Congress increase this benefit. In its \nmost recent budget submission, the authors of the Independent Budget \nrecommended that the plot allowance be increased to $745. In 2001, \nCongress took a first step, raising the benefit from $150 to $300. My \nlegislation would take yet another, measured step.\n  Finally, my legislation would authorize $5 million per year under \nVA's State Cemetery Grant Program for VA to assist States in meeting \noperational and maintenance expenses. As I mentioned, the State \nCemetery Grant Program finances the cost of establishing, expanding, or \nimproving State cemeteries. States must agree to provide suitable land \nfor a cemetery and they must meet administrative, operational, and \nmaintenance costs.\n  My purpose in introducing this aspect of the legislation is twofold. \nFirst, VA is in the midst of the largest national cemetery expansion \nsince the Civil War. Guiding its cemetery expansion effort was a \nprospective look at where and how many veterans will be living 20 years \nfrom now. Based on that prospective analysis, national cemeteries are \nbeing built in those areas of the country that have veterans' \npopulations of 170,000 or more and that are not residing within, or \nexpected to reside within, 75 miles of an open State or national \ncemetery. It is therefore highly likely that after this expansion has \nconcluded, no additional national cemeteries will be built for quite \nsome time. Thus, in order to serve veterans' populations in less \ndensely populated areas in the future, VA and the States will need to \nrely more on the State Cemetery Grant Program. Allowing reimbursement \nfor some maintenance or operational expenses will serve to make the \nprogram more attractive to States, which may otherwise decline to \nparticipate in the program due to budget constraints. In fact, the 2000 \nindependent assessment I spoke about earlier made the same point, \nrecommending Congressional consideration of amending the grant program \nto allow for reimbursement of the sort contemplated in my legislation.\n  My second purpose behind this provision is a bit more parochial. \nThere are eight States in the country without any national cemetery, \nincluding Idaho. These are States with small or scattered veterans' \npopulations. VA's criteria for establishing national cemeteries makes \nit unlikely that veterans in these States will ever have access to a \nnational cemetery within the borders of their home State. Yet their \nservice was national in character, and the desire for recognition of \nthat national service through interment in a national cemetery is real, \nif not practical. It is my opinion that the Federal obligation to \nveterans residing in States like my own is therefore heightened. And if \nthe only way to heighten that obligation is by requiring reimbursement \nof a greater share of the expenses now borne by the States, so be it. \nTo my mind, this would be an equitable outcome, and one that I hope VA \nfactors into criteria it will develop should my legislation be enacted.\n  Let me make one final and very important point. The cost of my \nlegislation is in the $8 million per year range. Although I am \nconvinced of the merits of the legislation, I am also committed to \nadhering to our budget rules which require that appropriate spending \noffsets be identified before new spending is advanced. I assure my \ncolleagues that should my legislation be reported from the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, it will be fully offset in accordance with our rules \nand my own principle of fiscal discipline.\n  In summary, the Veterans' Dignified Burial Assistance Act of 2007 \nwill help us along in our collective goal of providing veterans with \nlasting resting places to honor their lives and service. This is good \nlegislation, and I urge the support of my colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1266\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to maintain the free flow of information to the \npublic by providing conditions for the federally compelled disclosure \nof information by certain persons connected with the news media; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with my \ncolleagues Senators Dodd, Graham, Domenici, and Landrieu to introduce \nthe Free Flow of Information Act.\n  The free flow of information is an essential element of democracy. A \nfree press promotes an open marketplace of information and provides \npublic and private sector accountability to our Nation's electorate. By \nensuring the free flow of information, citizens can work to bring about \nimprovements in our governance and in our civic life. It is in our \nnation's best interest to have an independent press that is free to \nquestion, challenge, and investigate issues and stories, without \nconcern for political party, position or who holds power. The role of \nthe media as a conduit between government and the citizens it serves \nmust not be devalued.\n  This principle that we practice at home is also one that we promote \nabroad. Spreading democracy abroad has become a pillar of United States \nforeign policy, and we have recognized that a free and independent \npress is both essential to building democracies and a barometer of the \nhealth of young and often imperfect democratic systems. The example of \npress freedom we set in this country is an important beacon to guide \nother nations as they make the transition from autocratic forms of \ngovernment.\n  Unfortunately, the free flow of information to citizens of the United \nStates is inhibited and our open market of information is being \nthreatened. While gathering information on a story, a journalist is \nsometimes required to accept information under a promise of \nconfidentiality. Without assurance of anonymity, many conscientious \ncitizens with evidence of wrongdoing would stay silent. Restricting the \nmanner in which appropriate news is gathered is tantamount to \nrestricting the information that the public has the right to hear.\n  After a long period when there were few clashes between the media and \nauthorities, a disturbing new trend has developed. More than 30 \nreporters have recently been served subpoenas or questioned in at least \nfour different Federal jurisdictions about their confidential sources. \nFrom 1991 to September 6, 2001, the Department of Justice issued 88 \nsubpoenas to the media, 17 of which sought information leading to the \nidentification of confidential sources. In fact, three journalists have \nbeen imprisoned at the request of the Department of Justice, U.S. \nattorneys under its supervision, or special prosecutors since 2000. As \na result, the press is hobbled in performing the public service of \nreporting news. I fear the end result of such actions is that many \nwhistleblowers will refuse to come forward and reporters will be unable \nto provide the American people with information they deserve.\n  Most jurisdictions in our country have recognized that confidential \nsources are integral to the press's role of keeping the public \ninformed, and have provided some kind of shield so that journalists can \nkeep secret the names of such sources. Every State and the District of \nColumbia, excluding Wyoming, has, by legislation or court ruling, \ncreated a privilege for reporters not to reveal their confidential \nsources. My own State of Indiana provides qualified reporters \nappropriate protection from having to reveal any such information in \ncourt.\n  The Federal courts of appeals, however, have an inconsistent view of \nthis matter. Some circuits allow the privilege in one category of \ncases, while others have expressed skepticism about whether any \nprivilege exists at all. It does not make sense to have a Federal \nsystem of various degrees of press freedom dependent upon where you \nlive or who provides the subpoena. In fact, 34 State attorneys general \nhave argued that the lack of a clear standard of Federal protection \nundermines state laws.\n  In addition, there is ambiguity between official Department of \nJustice rules and unofficial criteria used to secure media subpoenas. \nThe Department of Justice guidelines also do not apply to special \nprosecutors or private civil litigants. There is an urgent need for \nCongress to state clear and concise policy guidance.\n  In response to this situation, 2 years ago, I was pleased to join \nwith my colleague Congressman Mike Pence, and Congressman Rick Boucher \nin the House of Representatives and Senator Chris Dodd in the Senate to \nintroduce the Free Flow of Information Act. This legislation provides \njournalists with certain rights and abilities to seek sources and \nreport appropriate information without fear of intimidation or \nimprisonment. The bill sets national standards which must be met before \na Federal entity may issue a subpoena to a member of the news media in \nany Federal criminal or civil case. It sets out certain tests that \ncivil litigants or prosecutors must meet before they can force a \njournalist to turn over information. Litigants or prosecutors must \nshow, for instance, that they have tried, unsuccessfully, to get the \ninformation in other ways and that the information is critical to the \ncase. These standards were based on Justice Department guidelines and \ncommon law standards.\n  Subsequently, additional protections have been added to this bill to \nensure that information will be disclosed in cases where the \ninformation is critical to prevent death or bodily harm or in cases \nwhich relate to the unlawful disclosure of trade secrets. The bill also \npermits a reporter to be compelled to reveal the source in certain \nnational security situations. Finally, the bill would provide \nprotections to ensure that source information can be provided when \npersonal health records and financial records were disclosed in \nviolation of Federal law.\n  By providing the courts with a framework for compelled disclosure, \nour legislation promotes greater transparency of government, maintains \nthe ability of the courts to operate effectively, and protects \nwhistleblowers who identify government or corporate misdeeds.\n  It is also important to note what this legislation does not do. The \nlegislation neither gives reporters a license to break the law, nor \npermits reporters to interfere with criminal investigation efforts. \nState shield laws have been on the books for years, and I have not seen \nany evidence to support a correlation between reporter privilege laws \nand criminal activity or threats to public safety. Furthermore, the \nFree Flow of Information Act does not weaken our national security. The \nexplicit national security exception will ensure that reporters are \nprotected while maintaining an avenue for prosecution and disclosure \nwhen considering the defense of our country. This qualified privilege \nhas been carefully crafted to balance the distinct and important roles \nof both the press and law enforcement.\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\n  As ranking member of the United States Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I believe that passage of this bill would have positive \ndiplomatic consequences. This legislation not only confirms America's \nConstitutional commitment to press freedom, it also advances President \nBush's American foreign policy initiatives to promote and protect \ndemocracy. Our Nation always leads best when it leads by example.\n  Unfortunately, the press remains under siege in a number of foreign \ncountries. For instance, Reporters Without Borders points out that 125 \njournalists are currently in jail around the world, with more than half \nof these cases in China, Cuba, and Burma. This is not good company for \nthe United States of America. Global public opinion is always on the \nlookout to advertise perceived American double standards.\n  I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Chris Dodd as well as \nMike Pence and Rick Boucher, in the House of Representatives for their \ntireless work on this issue. I look forward to continuing work with \neach of them to protect the free flow of information.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator Lugar, \nalong with Representatives Boucher and Pence in the House of \nRepresentatives, in introducing the Free Flow of Information Act. This \nbill would protect journalists from being forced to reveal their \nconfidential sources, not as an end in itself, but as a means to a \nwell-informed public. I applaud the tireless efforts of the senior \nSenator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, in once again bringing this important \nissue to the attention of Congress and indeed the nation.\n  I hardly have to read the litany of grave wrongs that have been \nexposed because journalists called the powerful to account. And I don't \nhave to remind you how many of those exposures relied on confidential \nsources. Without confidential sources, would we still be ignorant about \nabuse of power in the Watergate era? Without confidential sources, \nwould Enron still be profiting from fraud? How long would torture at \nAbu Ghraib have persisted, if proof hadn't been provided to the press?\n  The free flow of information provides the American people its most \nmeaningful check on abuses such as those. Thomas Jefferson said it \nbest: ``If I had to make a choice, to choose the government without the \npress or to have the press but without the government, I will select \nthe latter without hesitation.'' Jefferson clearly understood that a \nfree Government cannot possibly last without a free press.\n  But today, we find this cornerstone of self-government facing a new \nthreat. This threat has not come from the dictates of a dangerous \ngovernment, but from the best of intentions. In a spate of recent \ncases, prosecutors have used subpoenas, fines, and jail time to compel \njournalists to reveal their anonymous sources. Judith Miller of The New \nYork Times was jailed for 85 days for refusing to reveal a source. Two \nSan Francisco Chronicle reporters were found in contempt of court for \nrefusing to identify sources and hand over material related to the \nBALCO steroids investigation. A Rhode Island journalist was sentenced \nto home arrest on similar charges. Last year alone, a total of some two \ndozen reporters have been subpoenaed or questioned about confidential \nsources. They were all journalists prosecuted only for the offense of \njournalism.\n  The impact of these subpoenas on the broader issue of freedom of \ninformation is undeniable. Last summer, for instance, the editor-in-\nchief of Time magazine testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nThis is what he said about the fallout from the Justice Department's \nefforts to obtain confidential information from a Time reporter: \n``Valuable sources have insisted that they no longer trusted the \nmagazine and that they would no longer cooperate on stories. The \nchilling effect is obvious.''\n  The chilling effect is obvious. Experience has shown us that the most \neffective constraint on free speech need not be blatant censorship: A \nfew cases like Ms. Miller's and the San Francisco Chronicle's, and news \nwill begin censoring itself. We can only speculate as to how many \neditors and publishers put the brakes on a story for fear that it could \nland one of their reporters in a spider web of subpoenas, charges of \ncontempt, and prison. When we minimize the impact of confidential \nsources, serious journalism is crippled. We will find our papers full \nof stories more and more palatable to the powerful and secretive. No \none argues that that is the intention of those prosecuting these cases; \nbut few deny that it could, in time, be their effect.\n  When journalists are hauled into court and threatened with \nimprisonment if they don't divulge their sources, we are entering \ndangerous territory for a democracy. The information we need to remain \nsovereign will be degraded; the public's right to know will be \nthreatened; and I suggest to you that the liberties we hold dear will \nbe threatened as well.\n  That is exactly why we need a Federal reporter shield. Forty-nine \nStates and the District of Columbia have already recognized that need \nby enacting similar protection on the state level either through \nlegislation or court decisions; the Free Flow of Information Act simply \nextends that widely recognized protection to the Federal courts.\n  The new version of this bill expands coverage in two significant \nways. First, it will not only protect the information journalists \nobtain under the promise of confidentiality; it will also cover the \n``work product'' of journalists as well, whether or not it was subject \nto that promise. And second, it no longer limits protection to \nmainstream reporters; the new version also shields any person ``engaged \nin journalism.'' In today's expansive media environment, it would be \nunacceptable to deny the shield to our citizen-journalists.\n  Of course, the reporter shield is not absolute. The public's need to \nknow must be weighed against other goods, and that is why the bill \nestablishes a balancing test that takes into account ``both the public \ninterest in compelling disclosure and the public interest in gathering \nnews and maintaining the free flow of information.'' Specifically, the \nbill will not protect anonymity when disclosure of a source would \nprevent imminent harm to national security, imminent death or bodily \nharm, or the release of personal or health related information. In \nother words, we are balancing our right to know with our need for \nsecurity, whether physical or economic. Secrecy is as necessary in \nextreme circumstances as it is dangerous on the whole.\n  It is on the idea of balance that I would like to conclude. A \nprosecution, whatever its individual merits, sacrifices something \nhigher when it turns on reporters; and so those merits must be balanced \nagainst the broader harms such a prosecution can work. If a free press \ninexorably creates a free government, as Jefferson suggested, then the \nagents of that free government, prosecutors included, owe a high debt \nto journalism. When prosecutors threaten journalism, they have begun to \nrenege on that debt. So I am proud to support this valuable bill, a \nstep toward rebalancing the pursuit of justice and the diffusion of \ntruth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1269. A bill to improve border security in the United States and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I once again today introduced S. 1269, the \nENFORCE Act, because this body has failed to move forward with sound \nimmigration legislation. My bill is a strong step in the right \ndirection to help solve our growing problem of illegal immigration.\n  I did this already. I did this last year. We had a chance to talk \nabout it, but we never were able to get this up to a vote. I do want to \nkeep this subject moving because people are not talking about this \nanymore. This bill focuses on securing our borders and empowering our \ncitizens and law enforcement officers to fight the all-time high flood \nof illegal immigrants. There are around a million illegal aliens \ninfiltrating our borders each year. It also addresses some of the \nlesser known but equally destructive exploitations of our Nation by \nsome of these illegal immigrants.\n  I wish to be clear, for some reason--I am not sure why--- I have been \nhonored over the years to speak at nationalization ceremonies. It is \none of the emotional things a person can go through. When you see \npeople coming into this country and doing it the way\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\nthey are supposed to, they learn the history. Those who have gone \nthrough the legal process know more about the history of America than \nthe average person you run into on the street. I am very strongly in \nfavor of legal immigration.\n  In 1997, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform stated that \n``measured, legal immigration has led to create one of the world's \ngreatest multiethnic nations.'' I agree with that statement. I also \nagree with their statement that when immigrants become \n``Americanized,'' they help cultivate a shared commitment to ``liberty, \ndemocracy, and equal opportunity'' in our Nation. That is legal \nimmigration. I agree with that.\n  However, I am quoting now from Roy Beck, executive director of \nNumbers USA. He stated:\n\n       A presence of 8 to 11 million illegal aliens--\n\n  I think the figure is now approximately 12 million--\n       in this country is a sign that this country has lost \n     control of its borders and the ability to determine who is a \n     member of this national community. And a country that has \n     lost that ability increasingly loses its ability to determine \n     the rules of its society--environmental protections, labor \n     protection, health protections, safety protections.\n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       In fact, a country that cannot keep illegal immigration to \n     a low level quickly ceases to be a real country, or a real \n     community. Rather than being self-governed, such a country \n     begins to have its destiny largely determined by citizens of \n     other countries who manage to move in illegally.\n\n  With that being said, I cannot and I will not stand idly by and watch \nour great Nation collapse under the pressures of uncontrolled illegal \nimmigration. This is a crisis, one that must be addressed aggressively. \nWhile I would not belabor the point, I will chronicle some of illegal \nimmigration's specific threats to our Nation's vitality and how this \nbill will address them.\n  First and foremost, the issue of border security must be addressed. \nMy bill would help ramp up border security by providing a way for \ncivilians and retired law enforcement officers to assist the Border \nPatrol in stopping illegal border crossings. Keep in mind, if you are a \nretired Federal law enforcement officer, they have a mandatory \nretirement age of 57. There are many of these who would work for \nexpenses. What we are advocating is a three-tiered system where you \nhave the Border Patrol who are skilled the way they are today but have \nthem fortified by this army of retired law enforcement officers and \nthen bring in the third tier which are those which we have watched in \nthe past that have been very effective in adding to the numbers on the \nborder.\n  It is already working. It is very similar to the National Border \nNeighborhood Watch. I know in my State of Oklahoma it has been a very \neffective program. It is more eyes to watch and more talent to arrest, \nwhen necessary. A more obscure issue that also warrants reform is the \nlegal status of what has become known as anchor babies.\n  To better their odds of remaining in the United States, illegal \nimmigrants have taken advantage of a constitutional provision granting \nautomatic citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. Unfortunately, by \nproviding citizenship to these ``anchor babies,'' as they are known, \nour Nation rewards the illegal entry of their parents and facilities \nthe further exploitation of our borders and national resources.\n  This trend has contributed to the alarming fact that the illegal \nimmigrant population is growing faster than the birthrate of American \ncitizens. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, based on \nnumbers from the National Center of Health Statistics, in 2002, there \nwere about 8.4 million illegal aliens, which represented about 3.3 \npercent of the total U.S. population. That same year, there were about \n383,000 babies born to illegal aliens, which represents about 9.5 \npercent of all U.S. births in 2002.\n  This problem continues to grow exponentially and serves as a strong \nincentive for more aliens to illegally cross into our country in hopes \nof shortcutting citizenship requirements. Language included in the \nENFORCE Act will put an end to this much exploited practice.\n  Another ``supposed'' obligation we face is the education of illegal \naliens. Some States, such as my State of Oklahoma, allow the illegal \naliens the advantage of receiving in-State tuition at our State \ncolleges and universities. I believe it is inexcusable to give away \nState-subsidized educations to those who do not pay taxes. This act \nwill address this problem by making it unlawful for illegal aliens to \nreceive this particular handout.\n  The ENFORCE Act includes several provisions to halt illegal \nimmigrants' continued exploitation of our tax laws and our Social \nSecurity benefits. One of the greatest problems in this area is illegal \nimmigrants' abuse of the individual tax identification number. That is \nthe ITIN program.\n  Currently, it so closely resembles the Social Security number that \nmany illegal immigrants are able to use it in place of a Social \nSecurity card to bypass our tax laws or receive wrongly awarded \nbenefits. The ENFORCE Act will require a change in the physical \nappearance of this particular document so its identity can no longer be \nmistaken for that of a Social Security number, and it will also \nprohibit that document from being used for identification purposes.\n  Additionally, my bill will require Social Security numbers to expire \nas soon as a person's permission to be in the United States expires. So \nit would expire at the same time that permission expires.\n  It will prohibit illegal immigrants who gain legal status from \ncollecting Social Security benefits for the time they worked illegally \nin the country.\n  Finally, the legality of day-labor centers is a topic that must be \naddressed by any comprehensive immigration reform package. These day-\nlabor centers exist within illegal immigration-friendly ``sanctuary \nsites'' and not just in San Francisco. Day-labor centers are State-\ndesignated and funded sites where illegal aliens congregate and wait \nfor employers to pick them up for a day of illegal work.\n  One such site was approved in 2005 in Fairfax County, VA, to be paid \nfor by taxpayer dollars. Sanctuary cities such as these enable and \nencourage unlawful activity by both illegal aliens and the employers \nwho hire them. The ENFORCE Act will outlaw the creation of those \nparticular centers.\n  Illegal immigrants continue to cause a myriad of problems for our \ncountry and for law-abiding citizens such as you and me. Illegal \nimmigrants not only drain our economy through their exploitation of \npublic services and resources, but we must not forget the national \nsecurity threat posed by would-be terrorists who have entered our \ncountry illegally or remain here unlawfully by overstaying their visas.\n  The Center for Immigration Study says:\n\n       Even though illegal aliens make little use of welfare, from \n     which they are generally barred, the costs of illegal \n     immigration in terms of government expenditures for \n     education, criminal justice, and emergency medical care are \n     significant. Illegal immigration is straining our economy, \n     jeopardizing our security, and burdening our education and \n     health care systems.\n\n  So this ENFORCE Act will provide solid tools to eliminate illegal \nimmigration and strongly enforce the existing U.S. immigration laws. \nThe seriousness of this crisis warrants that Americans of all political \nstripes come together to address this problem.\n  One thing that is not included in this legislation that I think \nshould be included in any kind of reform--and some of my colleagues can \nremember I had on the floor of the Senate the legislation making \nEnglish the official language of the United States--and it is \ninteresting that some 88 percent of the American people want this, and \nsome 70 percent of the Hispanic population want this also. It is also \ninteresting that there are 50 countries around the world that have \nEnglish as their official language, including Ghana in West Africa and \nsome other countries, and yet we do not have it for ourselves. But that \nis going to be handled separately at a different time.\n  History shows us that declaring ``immigration bankruptcy'' does not \nwork. We saw that in the amnesty of 1986. Simply granting citizenship \nto immigrants who are currently in our country illegally is not the \nanswer. We have to enhance our border security, hold those accountable \nwho encourage illegal immigration, and ensure that those who violate \nour laws by entering our country illegally do not remain here and are \nnot easily welcomed back.\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\n  So I am introducing that legislation, and I am going to be bringing \nit up at the appropriate time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Obama, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 1270. A bill to amend title IV of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to require the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, in the case of airline pilots who are required by \nregulation to retire at age 60, to compute the actuarial value of \nmonthly benefits in the form of a life annuity commencing at age 60; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation Pilots Equitable Treatment Act to ensure fair \ntreatment of commercial airline pilot retirees. I thank my cosponsors, \nSenators Kennedy, Inouye, Obama, Durbin, Harkin, and Salazar. I also \nthank Representative George Miller for introducing the companion \nlegislation in the other body.\n  My bill corrects an injustice imposed on pilots whose pensions have \nbeen terminated and handed over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, PBGC. This bill will lower the age requirement to receive \nthe maximum pension benefits allowed by the PBGC to age 60 for pilots, \nwho are mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, to retire \nbefore age 65. With the airline industry experiencing severe financial \ndistress, we need to enact this legislation to assist pilots whose \ncompanies have been or will be unable to continue their defined benefit \npension plans. This bill will require the PBGC to take into account the \nfact that the pilots are required to retire at the age of 60 when \ncalculating their benefits.\n  The FAA requires commercial aviation pilots to retire when they reach \nthe age of 60. Pilots are therefore denied the maximum pension benefit \nadministered by the PBGC because they are required to retire before the \nage of 65. Herein lies the problem. If pilots want to work beyond the \nage of 60, they have to request a waiver from the FAA. It is my \nunderstanding that the FAA has only granted these waivers for pilots \nworking for foreign airlines that fly to and from the United States. \nTherefore, retired pilots whose pensions are administered by the PBGC \ndo not receive the maximum pension guarantee because they are forced to \nretire at age 60.\n  For plans terminated in 2005, the maximum benefit for someone that \nretires at 65 is $45,614 a year. For those who retire at 60, the \nmaximum is $29,649. This significant reduction in benefits puts pilots \nin a difficult position. Their pensions have been reduced significantly \nand they are prohibited from reentering their profession due to the \nmandatory retirement age. They are unable to go back to their former \njobs. My legislation ensures that pilots are able to obtain the maximum \nPBGC benefit without being unfairly penalized for having to retire at \n60. We must pass this bill to provide some relief for United Airlines, \nAloha Airlines, US Airways, Delta, TWA, and other pilots who have had \ntheir pensions terminated and taken over by the PBGC and suffer from \nthis wrongly imposed penalty.\n  In the previous Congress, this legislation was included in the \nSenate-passed version of the Pension Security and Transparency Act of \n2005. However, this provision was not included in the conference \nreport. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that we can \nfinally provide some relief for our pilots who already have suffered \nfinancially due to the termination of their pension plans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1270\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \npermanent look-through treatment of payments between related foreign \ncorporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to make \npermanent a provision of our tax that was enacted in 2006 as part of \nthe Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act, but expires at the end \nof 2008. The controlled-foreign corporation (CFC) look-through \nprovision allows U.S.-based multinational companies to better compete \nwith foreign companies by enabling them to be more flexible in their \noverseas operations. In this age of global competition, I hope my \ncolleagues will agree that the United States needs to maintain a \nbusiness climate that encourages U.S.-based companies to grow and \nsucceed. The CFC look-through provision is an important part of that \neffort.\n  For several years now, I have been encouraging my colleagues to \nrecognize that our tax system puts many of our best U.S. employers at a \ncompetitive disadvantage as compared to foreign-based companies. Many \nforeign countries only impose tax on income earned within their \nborders; the United States taxes U.S. companies on their worldwide \nincome.\n  The general rule is that income from a foreign subsidiary is not \ntaxed by the United States until those earnings are brought back to the \nU.S. parent, usually in the form of a dividend. Subpart F of the \nInternal Revenue Code sets forth a number of exceptions to this general \nrule, imposing current U.S. tax, instead of allowing deferral of \ntaxation, on subsidiary earnings generally when that income is passive \nin nature. One exception to the general deferral rule imposes tax on \nthe U.S. parent when a foreign-based subsidiary receives dividends, \ninterest, rents or royalties from another subsidiary that is located in \na different country. If the two subsidiaries are in the same country, \nhowever, U.S. tax is generally deferred until the income is repatriated \nto the U.S. parent.\n  In 2005, I introduced legislation to extend this ``same-country'' \ntreatment, the CFC look-through provision, to payments between related \nforeign subsidiaries that are located in different countries, and I was \npleased that the 2006 tax reconciliation bill included this provision. \nToday, I am introducing legislation to make the CFC look-through \npermanent.\n  Today's global economy is significantly different from the \nenvironment that existed when the subpart F rules were first introduced \nin 1962. As the global economy has changed, the traditional model for \noperating a global business has changed as well. In today's world, it \nmakes no sense to impose a tax penalty when a company wants to fund the \noperations of a subsidiary in one country from the active business \nearnings of a subsidiary in another country. For example, to operate \nefficiently, a U.S.-based manufacturer could establish specialized \nmanufacturing sites, distribution hubs, and service centers. As a \nresult, multiple related-party entities may be required to fulfill a \nspecific customer order. Before the CFC look-through was enacted last \nyear, U.S. tax law inappropriately increased the cost for these foreign\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nsubsidiaries to serve their customers in a very competitive business \nenvironment by imposing current tax on these related-party payments, \neven though the income continues to be used in active operations in the \nforeign market.\n\n  In another example, financial institutions have established foreign \nsubsidiaries with headquarters in a financial center, such as London, \nand branches in multiple countries in the same geographic region. This \npermits an efficient ``hub and spoke'' form of regional operation; \nhowever, this efficient business model made it difficult for the same-\ncountry exception to be met for payments of dividends and interest.\n  Before the CFC look-through was enacted, American companies were at a \nreal and significant competitive disadvantage as compared to foreign-\nbased companies. U.S.-based multinationals were penalized for \nresponding to market or investment opportunities by redeploying active \nforeign earnings among foreign businesses conducted through multiple \nsubsidiaries. To remove this impediment, Congress amended subpart F to \nprovide a general exception for inter-affiliate payments of dividends, \ninterest, rents or royalties that are generated from an active \nbusiness.\n  Congress was right to apply look-through treatment to payments of \ndividends, interest, rents and royalties between subsidiaries. If the \nunderlying earnings would not have been subject to subpart F, the \npayments should not be subpart F income. Look-through treatment for \npayments of dividends, interest, rents and royalties should be \npermitted as long as the payments are made out of active business, non-\nsubpart F, income. Look-through principles are already well developed \nfor other purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. For example, a look-\nthrough approach to the characterization of foreign income is used for \npurposes of calculating foreign tax credits. A consistent application \nof look-through principles simplifies the interaction between subpart F \nand the foreign tax credit rules.\n  If we want to keep U.S.-based multinational companies, which employ \nmillions of workers here at home headquartered in the United States, we \nmust modernize our tax rules so that our companies can be competitive \naround the globe. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation to \nmake permanent this modest change in the law that will enhance the \nposition of U.S.-based employers trying to succeed in competitive \nforeign markets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1274.

As a result, more applications for \n     generic versions of these products will be filed with the \n     Office of Generic Drugs of the Food and Drug Administration.\n       (2) The staff of the Office of Generic Drugs is backlogged. \n     Approximately 800 generic drug applications are pending \n     review as of April 2007.\n       (3) The workload of the Office of Generic Drugs has \n     increased by 36 percent since 2004, yet the Office has the \n     same budget and the same number of staff.\n       (4) The workload of the Office of Generic Drugs also has \n     increased due to the filing of citizen petitions by brand \n     companies designed to delay generic drug approvals.\n       (5) A modest investment in the Office of Generic Drugs, \n     such as $15,000,000, would help to make more affordable \n     medicines available in a timely manner to consumers and \n     public and private health care purchasers, who would save \n     billions of dollars.\n       (6) Those savings also would enable the Federal Government \n     to reach more Americans through important health care \n     initiatives, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and programs to \n     improve children's health care, assist the chronically ill, \n     and fight HIV/AIDS.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Notwithstanding \n     section 736(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (as amended by section 103(b) of this Act), the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services shall allocate $20,000,000 of the \n     user fees generated by section 736(a) of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as amended by section 103(a) of this \n     Act), for each fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 2009 \n     and ending with fiscal year 2012, to the Office of Generic \n     Drugs of the Food and Drug Administration, for the sole \n     purpose of reviewing and approving abbreviated new drug \n     applications.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1014.
