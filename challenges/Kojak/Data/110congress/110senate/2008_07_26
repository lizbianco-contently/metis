Following my 10 \nminutes of remarks now, the other time is allocated to complete the \ntotal of the Republican time, the time allocated to our side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are engaged in a somewhat rare Saturday \nsession this morning. One might ask, what is the purpose for this \nsession? In addition to voting on important housing legislation, the \nother vote the Senate will cast today is a very important vote. It is \nwhether we are going to end our discussion and our effort to deal with \nAmerica's biggest challenge on the domestic front--namely, the high \nprice of gasoline and high price of fuel, which drives prices of \neverything else--or whether we will move on to other matters, other \nmatters that are, at least in the eyes of the American people, far less \nimportant than dealing with this important energy crisis. There is no \nquestion that the American people believe our biggest challenge right \nnow, a challenge that should be faced up to by Congress, is dealing \nwith high gas prices. The Democratic majority would like to move on.\n  The second vote we have this morning is to move on, to move off of \nthe energy and gas price debate and to move on to another bill. If that \nis unsuccessful, then next week they intend to move on to something \nelse. Republicans will say no. We need to stay here and complete our \nwork on this important gas price reduction legislation, and we should \nnot leave here until we act.\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post had a somewhat critical editorial of \nthe Democratic majority's position in the House and Senate. The title \nof it was ``No Drilling, No Vote.'' It begins:\n\n       Why not have a vote on offshore drilling? There's a serious \n     debate to be had over whether Congress should lift the ban on \n     drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf that has been in \n     place since 1981.\n\n  It concludes:\n\n       If drilling opponents really have the better of the \n     argument, why are they so worried about letting it come to a \n     vote?\n\n  That is our view. Why shouldn't we have a vote?\n  The Republican leader came to the floor earlier this week and asked \nunanimous consent that we consider six or seven amendments, the very \nfirst one of which was to enable us to drill offshore. The majority \nleader objected to that request. It is fairly obvious that the \namendment or something like it would pass because there are Members on \nboth sides of the aisle who appreciate the fact that the first thing we \nshould do to resolve this crisis is to have more American production. \nRepublicans don't believe this is the only solution. Nobody believes \ndrilling solves the problem. But most experts would agree it is the \nbiggest first step, the one thing we could do that would make the most \ndifference. We believe it is important to produce more and use less, \nmeaning, to produce more by offshore drilling in the deep waters off \nthe Gulf of Mexico, to take advantage of oil shale we have available, \nthe vast resources in Alaska, and other resources that are American \nresources that can solve this American problem and get us off \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  There are other sources for electricity. We support increased nuclear \nproduction, wind, solar, and coal gasification and liquefaction. We \nalso support more conservation. That is the ``use less'' component, \nincluding being able to transport ourselves in automobiles that use \nbattery technology. The Democratic bill, on the other hand, deals with \none subject: it puts the blame on so-called speculators and says that \nis where we should solve the problem. Not one drop of oil would be \nproduced, not one bit of natural gas would be produced by the \nDemocratic legislation.\n  Republicans agree that the CFTC, the regulatory body, needs more \nresources. It demonstrated its ability to work by announcing this week \nthat it is going after some people who are trying to manipulate the \nmarket. We agree that they need all of the funding and employees to do \ntheir job as possible, but clearly, it is not the answer to the \nproblem.\n  Here is what is happening. The market looks out a few months and \nsays: What will the supply be; what will demand be? What it has seen is \nthat demand is increasing dramatically, and it sees supply either flat \nor declining. It sets the price accordingly. It sets the price going \nup. My colleague John McCain is right: When the market sees we are \nserious about increasing production, market prices will go down \naccordingly.\n  We have American energy. We need to free it up for the American \npeople. But the Democrats' game here is a very cynical one: Let's just \nhave two amendments. Let's have a face-off between a Democratic \nproposal and a Republican proposal. It is the same old politics. \nNeither side wins, and that is the way it is set up. The American \npeople lose.\n  Republicans have a better idea. Let's work on a bill one bite at a \ntime. If it is too tough to do this in one giant swallow, then let's \nbuild consensus from the bottom up with people on both sides of the \naisle agreeing to the components of the legislation. We can do this in \na bipartisan way, and we can do it within a week. But until we get \nsomewhere on gas prices, we shouldn't quit and move on to something \nless important in the eyes of the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, at the conclusion of my remarks, a \nshort statement be printed in the Record that deals with the \ncontribution of a weak dollar to high oil prices.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. This makes the point that there is a direct connection \nbetween the weak dollar and the high oil prices Americans are having to \npay at the pump. It makes the point that if the dollar were stronger, \nit would take fewer dollars to buy the same amount of gasoline. That is \nsomething additional we can do. That is primarily not a congressional \nmatter but a matter for the Federal Reserve and the Department of the \nTreasury, primarily the Federal Reserve.\n  All of these are ways we can deal with the problem of the high cost \nat the pump. We need to address all of these issues. But until we have \naddressed them, we should not move off of the legislation and take up \nsomething that is less important. The only exception to that is the \nhousing bill we will vote on next. We have complete agreement to do \nthat. Then when that is concluded, we will move back to the energy \ndebate we have been having, the debate on how we can reduce the cost of \ngasoline at the pump. The American people expect us to do that, and we \nshould complete that work before we leave for our August recess.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  S. 3268 ``Stop Oil Speculation Now''\n\n\n              A Weak Dollar Contributes to High Oil Prices\n\n       At $124 a barrel, oil prices are still close to record \n     highs, and the weakness of the American dollar has a lot to \n     do with it.\n       Often the increase in oil prices can be attributed to \n     political turmoil in the Middle East or a significant supply \n     issue (as occurred after Hurricane Katrina). While these are \n     factors today, there is another reason you could see an \n     increase in the price at the pump.\n       Since January 2007, while oil prices have more than \n     doubled, the American dollar's\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\n     value has decreased by approximately 13 percent. As the \n     economy has slowed, the Federal Reserve has dropped the \n     Federal Funds rate numerous times over the past year--a total \n     reduction of 3.25 percentage points since January 2007. \n     Dropping the interest rate is meant to stimulate the U.S. \n     economy, but it also weakens the dollar.\n       The American dollar is the currency used by the \n     Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the \n     conglomerate of oil producing nations that sets global oil \n     prices. Thus, any fluctuations in the value of our dollar are \n     reflected in the price of oil.\n       As our dollar falls in value relative to the euro, yen, or \n     price of gold, the price of oil goes up. Since oil is priced \n     using the American dollar, what Americans pay for oil will \n     increase to compensate for this change.\n       At the same time, however, other nations are shielded from \n     the same oil price increase because their own currencies are \n     more valuable than the dollar. European and Asian countries \n     (among others) are importing their oil for significantly less \n     than what Americans are paying. Europeans pay just 79 euros \n     for a barrel of oil while Americans pay more than $124. \n     Returning the U.S. to a ``strong dollar policy'' would \n     greatly reduce the price U.S. consumers pay for oil.\n       Confidence in the value of the U.S. dollar is also vital to \n     American financial competitiveness. A weak dollar makes \n     investment in foreign markets more attractive, particularly \n     for those who seek to diversify their portfolios as our \n     economy slows. Further dollar weakness could precipitate a \n     dramatic shift of money from domestic to foreign markets.\n       The key idea to understand here is that the value of our \n     American dollar is an important consideration to the investor \n     and consumer confidence. Without this confidence, our economy \n     will have a difficult time avoiding recession.\n       So these are several reasons why it is in our nation's best \n     interest to support a stronger U.S. dollar. Economist David \n     Malpass wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, ``A \n     strong, stable currency is itself one of a country's most \n     valuable fundamentals, not a byproduct of other fundamentals. \n     Our fundamentals haven't been nearly as bad as the dollar's \n     seven year slide. More likely, the weak dollar trend is \n     itself a bad economic fundamental, masking health \n     elsewhere.''\n\n\n         The Federal Reserve Should Focus on Fighting Inflation\n\n       There are two things that can be done to better the dollar. \n     First, the Federal Reserve should switch its focus from \n     maintaining economic stability to fighting inflation. In \n     periods of slower economic growth the Federal Reserve \n     traditionally responds by reducing short-term interest rates, \n     but that can exacerbate inflation, which has increased \n     substantially--growing at 4.9 percent in June from the same \n     time a year ago.\n       Note that while the dollar has fallen, the euro remains \n     relatively strong because the European Central Bank (ECB) has \n     not only refrained from lowering interest rates due to their \n     concerns about global inflation but actually raised their \n     target interest rate to 4.25 percent on July 3rd.\n       The Federal Reserve needs to follow the ECB's lead and \n     resist the political pressure to cut interest rates in order \n     to stabilize the value of the dollar.\n       The second thing would be for Congress to begin to make our \n     current, relatively low, tax rates permanent.\n       Our currency is the foundation for our economy; without a \n     strong dollar our economy will not be able to achieve the \n     stability that is necessary to control oil prices or the \n     economy.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this moment in the U.S. Capitol, there \nare scores, if not hundreds, of employees at work. It is unusual for \nmost of them to be here on a Saturday, but sometimes it is necessary. \nIt is unusual for the Senate to be in session on a Saturday, but \nsometimes it is necessary. One can certainly argue that when the United \nStates is facing a serious issue, we should be at work, whether it \nrequires our being here on Saturday, Sunday, or all the days of the \nweek. That is what we were elected to do.\n  Certainly, the housing bill, which is before us now, is a matter of \ngrave concern to many of us who see across America foreclosures that \nare taking away the homes of many American families and affecting the \nvalue of millions of other homes. But this could have been done \nyesterday. In fact, it could have been done weeks ago.\n  Six different times, the Republicans initiated filibusters to stop \nthis housing bill--six different times. They have set all the records \nin the Senate for filibusters, and they applied six of them to the \nhousing bill.\n  To add insult to injury, they added a day of session, a totally \nunnecessary day of session for which we are meeting this morning. This \ncould have been sent to the President yesterday. He could have signed \nit, bringing some assurance and confidence to consumers across America \nthat maybe this housing crisis can be put behind us and this economy \ncan move forward. But one Senator, the Senator from South Carolina, \ninsisted that the Members of the Senate all stay here today.\n  It is the second time in 2 weeks he has taken away a day of our lives \nwith our families. This time the Senator from South Carolina is going \nto be here for the vote he has asked for, and I think that is good. It \ncertainly is his right to do that.\n  You say to yourself: There must be some matter of great moment that \nwould have him keep the entire Senate here for an extra day, cause us \nto ask scores, if not hundreds, of people to come and work that extra \nday. Well, what is that issue? The issue is whether we are going to put \nsome language in to limit or prohibit two Federal agencies--Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac--from having lobbyists on Capitol Hill. It is a good \nissue. I might even vote with him on this issue. But to think he would \nhold the Senate for another day, make us open this session and bring \nall those people to work for this amendment on a bill which we know \nmust pass, which the President has urged us to pass, is hard to \nunderstand.\n  It is his right to do it. It is any Senator's right to do it. But \nthere comes a point when you step back and say: We can fight this \nbattle another day. This is not a life-or-death issue. This is not an \nissue that has to be decided on this Saturday or else.\n  But we are here. We are here to face this issue, deal with the \nhousing bill, which I hope will pass. President Bush initially opposed \nthis bill. The President said there were provisions in here he could \nnot accept. But then there was a serious concern across America as to \nwhether these critical agencies--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are \ninvolved in standing behind almost half the mortgages in America--were \nbeing threatened.\n  I got a personal call from Secretary Henry Paulson, our Secretary of \nthe Treasury, at home last week. He said: We have to do something. This \nis an emergency. I said to Secretary Paulson: I think you are right. I \nmay not agree exactly with your approach, but there comes a time when \nwe have to rise together, on a bipartisan basis, and deal with a \nserious crisis. This could be a crisis if we do not act.\n  I said to him: Would you urge the Republican Members of the Senate to \nhave the same sense of urgency in passing this housing bill that I hear \nin your voice? He said he would try. Well, he was not very successful. \nSix different times the Republicans have tried to stop this housing \nbill with a filibuster and now have dragged us into a Saturday session \nhere to slow it down again.\n  But today, with any luck, it will pass, and finally we will send it \nto the President's desk. The President said he is prepared to sign it. \nThis is too serious an issue for him to stand in the way. I am glad the \nPresident has made that decision. I do not think it is going to turn \naround the American economy, but we know the housing crisis certainly \nstarted us on the skids that are leading us toward a recession. There \nare much bigger issues in our economy that need to be resolved even \nbeyond housing.\n  The simple fact is, the overwhelming majority of Americans are \nworried and angry--worried about their own financial situation. They \nhave seen the values of their homes plummet. They have seen their \nretirement savings diminished by a stock market that is unpredictable. \nThey know the cost of gasoline is taking more money out of their \nwallets and credit cards every single week. A trip to the food store is \na little more expensive than it used to be. It costs more money to put \nthose kids through school. And if you get stuck with medical bills now, \nit could break the bank and empty your savings account.\n  That is the reality of life in America today. The Bush economic \npolicy has failed. This notion that we can somehow give tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest people in America and prosper as a nation never did make \nsense and has resulted in the mess we have today. This notion that we \ncan wage a war and spend $12 billion to $15 billion a month for almost \n6 years now and not suffer some problems in America as a result never \nmade sense. It does not make sense today. Each month the administration \nadds that money to the deficit,\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\npiling up more debt on America's kids, debt that is currently financed \nby foreign governments that step in and buy America's mortgages. What a \nlegacy: an economy that is so weak that people are worried and even \nangry; a prospect of more of the same, unless there is a real change in \nWashington; and when it comes to the Senate, a slowdown. Let's slow it \ndown with six filibusters when it comes to a housing bill. Let's make \nthe Senate meet on a Saturday. Let's keep them in. Let's try to slow \nthis down even more. That is the Republican approach. It is not a good \napproach.\n  I think there are Republican Senators of good will who understand we \ncan do better. Let me point out one: Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. \nHe stepped up. As the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, he \nand Senator Chris Dodd, our Democratic chairman, worked together to get \nthis bill done. I salute him and all who helped him bring this bill to \nthe floor. That is the kind of bipartisan spirit we need: that sense of \nurgency, that sense of bringing the bill to the floor to do something \nfor our Nation. I wish his voice had prevailed in the Republican \nconference and all those filibusters had not taken place and this \nunnecessary Saturday session had not taken place. But the decision was \nmade by the leadership to allow this to go forward, and that is their \ndecision.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, I will say a word about what Senator Kyl addressed on \nthe energy package. It is hard for me to understand how my friend from \nArizona--and he is my friend--could stand here and suggest we have \nstopped the Republicans from offering their solution to deal with \nAmerica's energy crisis. We did not. Senator Kyl knows we said to them: \nPut together your package and bring it to the floor. We will do the \nsame. Let's have two competing ideas. Let's debate them. Let's give \nthem the same vote. And then let's decide.\n  That is what we are supposed to do, isn't it? We are elected, on a \nbipartisan basis, to try to solve problems. With 51 Democrats and 49 \nRepublicans, things have to be done on a bipartisan basis for most \nimportant issues. But Senator Kyl and Senator McConnell, on the \nRepublican side, rejected that. They said: No, we want to start an \namendment process. Let's see how this unfolds. Let's bring out seven \namendments to start with and you can bring out whatever you want and \nlet's talk it over and let's go through the debate. Unfortunately, that \nwould have led to nothing because we have a deadline facing us. Coming \nin just a few days, we are going to break for our August recess. We \ncould have been mired down in the debate with an endless number of \namendments and nothing would have happened.\n  The American people want something to happen. They want us to deal \nwith this energy crisis, and they understand simply saying we are going \nto drill for more oil, on its face, does not make sense. The United \nStates, in all of its oil reserves we can identify and think of, has \nabout 3 percent of the world's supply of oil. But we are big oil \nconsumers in this country. We consume 25 percent of the oil produced in \nthe world each year. Mr. President, 3 percent available, 25 percent \nconsumption.\n  As T. Boone Pickens, now the patriarch, I guess, of energy policy, \nsaid: We can't drill our way out of this problem. T. Boone Pickens is \nan oilman. He knows we need more. We need responsible exploration and \nproduction. We need to use the land we have already leased. We need to \ntell the oil and gas companies that are reporting record profits: Get \nto work, find those sources of oil that you already think are there in \nthis leased Federal land, and go after them. Do it in a responsible \nway. Do not pollute our beaches and do not pollute our Nation. Do it in \na sensible and responsible way. I think all of us would endorse that. I \nhope that is what the Republicans stand for too.\n  But it is not enough. We need conservation and fuel efficiency. We \nneed cars and trucks that get much better miles per gallon. We need to \nbe thinking about the buildings that are being constructed and the \nlives we lead and how, in small and large ways, we can change our \nenergy consumption without compromising our economy. We need to be \nthinking about renewable, sustainable sources.\n  It breaks my heart that three different times we brought to the floor \nthis energy tax extender, which would create tax incentives for more \nrenewable, sustainable energy--wind power, solar power, the kinds of \nthings that do not pollute, do not create global warming but do create \nelectricity and energy for families and businesses in America's \neconomy--and we lost it. We could not bring enough Republican votes \nforward to vote for it three different times.\n  A major company in my State came to visit me, a man from this company \nthis week, who said: I am facing bankruptcy if you don't accept the \nresponsibility of extending these tax credits. I believed you when the \nCongress said: We need a new American energy policy. I invested my \nhard-earned money in it. I am employing people around the country. We \nare building these wind turbines. Why don't you do your part and extend \nthis tax credit?\n  But, unfortunately, we have not been able to rally the Republican \nvotes that are necessary to do it. We will have another try at it this \nweek. I hope they will reconsider their position and think--forward \nthink--about the energy policy of this country. That is the reality. If \nwe can start bringing down gas prices and stabilize them, if we can \nstart looking ahead to new sources of energy, if we can start creating \nnew companies, new technology, new jobs, new opportunities, then we \nclearly will have a better future in the 21st century.\n  I wish to help--and I am sure everyone in the Senate does--these \nfamilies deal with the reality of energy costs. We can do it.\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. President, we are going to have a LIHEAP bill later today. This \nis a bill for the poorest in our country, the elderly, the disabled, \npeople who cannot afford to pay their utility bills in the summer and \nthe winter, and we give them a helping hand. Let's extend that too.\n  For goodness sakes, these folks are barely getting by at the moment. \nWe ought to give them that helping hand. Today, we will have a chance \nto vote on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry: Who in this Senate has the last word \non when votes are scheduled?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The scheduling is done by the \nleadership, and typically it is done by unanimous consent involving \nboth the majority leader and the minority leader.\n  Mr. DeMINT. But the majority leader has to agree. And further \nparliamentary inquiry: Is it not true that the majority leader \nscheduled two votes today by filing cloture earlier this week when \nthese would ripen today?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the rules of the Senate, the \ncloture motions do ripen today.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator yield for an \ninquiry?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I would like to proceed with my time, if I could. I thank \nyou. Certainly, the majority whip will have his say again when we are \nthrough.\n  The Democratic majority leader announced to all of us about a month \nago that we would be here this weekend because there were some bills he \nwanted to get through. And so those Americans looking in who are not \nthat interested in all our procedures and carrying on here--the \nmajority leader scheduled that there would be two final votes today, \nSaturday. He told us, as Republicans, we could have no amendments on \nthese bills, and then he demanded that we give unanimous agreement that \nwe move those votes he had scheduled back to Friday or even Thursday. \nNow, they are complaining about a Republican who has no authority when \nwe schedule votes, complaining that somehow I scheduled these votes \ntoday. I guess a lot of Members are naive and believe that. But I do \nnot think Americans buy it.\n\n  I know a number of folks are disappointed we are here on Saturday and \nnot somewhere else. But I am not worried about how disappointed Members\n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\nof Congress are. I know Americans are very disappointed, not that we \nare here on Saturday but that we are not working every day of the week, \n24 hours a day, to address the major issues in this country.\n  They are disappointed, and we know they are. In fact, Americans think \nless of this Democratic Congress than Americans ever have of any \nCongress in history. And it is not just the Democrats. I am very \ndisappointed myself. I came here--I came to the House 10 years ago--\nwith great hopes that I could be a part of addressing major issues \nfacing our country and create a generation of opportunity by helping \nAmericans and helping freedom work for everyone.\n  I have been disappointed that it has been increasingly obvious that \nthe Democrats are so controlled by a few interest groups--the union \nbosses, the plaintiffs' lawyers, environmental extremists--that they \nare afraid to allow their Members to take votes that would tell \nAmericans where they stand because they do not want to offend these \ninterest groups.\n  Now, I am equally critical of Republicans because I have been \ndisappointed in them as well because many of them have lost sight of \nwhat we believe, what we came here for, and have lost the courage to \nfight for it. So many times the scenario of bills that are coming \nthrough here is: In order to check the box, Republicans agree to add \nDemocratic policy that continues to expand Government.\n  The Senator from Illinois has complained about these filibusters. \nAgain, it is these mysterious procedures that we have in the Senate \nthat he remarkably calls filibusters: when they put a bill on the floor \nand then they file a motion to cut off debate; and when we do not agree \nto cut off debate, they call that a filibuster.\n  Americans should know, in this Congress, 855 bills have passed in \nsecret--no vote, no amendment, no floor debate. Ninety-four percent of \neverything we have passed in the Senate has gone by what they call \nunanimous consent. Now, some of these are legitimate unanimous consent \nbills--naming a post office and other things.\n  Americans should also know this housing bill has major implications \nnot only for spending but for government taking control of private \nsector businesses, taking ownership of private property, putting the \ntaxpayer on the line for billions and possibly more. They wanted this \nbill passed in secret, by unanimous consent, without anyone knowing \nwhat is in it. I want to talk about what is in it.\n  Last week, we had a $50 billion foreign aid bill that they wanted \npassed by unanimous consent, in secret. When some of us step up and \nsay: No, this is too important; we need to bring it to the floor and \nmaybe have an open debate and allow a few amendments, that is what the \nSenator from Illinois calls a filibuster. This is no way to do \nbusiness, but it is the way this Congress has gotten America in so much \ntrouble today.\n  As I speak about a few issues, I wish to keep one issue in front of \neveryone, because as bills come through here, there is always \njustification: It is a farm bill; we have to vote with the farmers. It \nis a veterans bill; we have to vote for veterans. It is a housing bill; \nwe have to vote for homeowners and homebuilders and realtors. We should \nconsider what our own Congressional Budget Office and the \nadministration is projecting. Beginning right now, in 2008, the \nexpansion of debt in America is going to do more to hurt our economy \nand hurt everyday Americans than anything we are doing here. Yet we \nnever even talk about things we could cut, wasteful programs we could \nfix. What we talk about is basically appealing to interest groups by \npassing one thing after another that is designed to attract \nconstituencies and votes and campaign contributions from different \ngroups.\n  Yes, I am disappointed, and I know Americans are too.\n  As we talk about the energy debate--and again, I will criticize \nRepublicans and Democrats, but when it comes to this one, there is no \nissue clearer in terms of who has restricted the supply of American \nenergy over the last 20 years. This has clearly been a partisan issue: \nthe Democrats responding to extreme environmentalists, going back to \nPresident Carter's years when he cut off the development of nuclear \nenergy, the recycling of nuclear waste. President Clinton vetoed, a \nlittle over 10 years ago, the development of oil reserves in Alaska. \nDemocrats voted almost unanimously to stop us from developing our oil \nand natural gas reserves in this country. Like the old Steve Erkle of \n``Family Matters,'' now they are standing here and saying: Did I do \nthat? They are trying to blame big oil and speculators and George Bush \nand everyone but themselves, but on this issue there is probably \nnothing clearer of how this Congress has caused America a huge problem, \nand now they are saying we are going to save America.\n  The Democrats will not allow an open debate and open amendments, as \nis the tradition of this Senate. They will not allow their Members to \ntake votes on drilling and deep sea exploration in America or a \nseparate vote on developing the oil shale in this country or expediting \nthe development of our nuclear capabilities. They won't allow these \namendments to come to the floor for the reasons I have already \nmentioned. They don't want Americans to know where they stand, and they \nwant to appease the extreme environmentalists. They are trying to have \nit both ways. That is why we are stuck in doing nothing here, because \ninstead of doing what the Senate has done for literally centuries, we \nare here trying to protect Democrat Members so they don't have to take \nthe tough votes.\n  I wish to use one quote from my distinguished colleague from \nIllinois, because he is suggesting that he wants an open debate when, \nin fact, we are not allowed to pick our own amendments. Please be \nclear. The Democrats are not allowing Republicans to offer our own \namendments. They want to select one amendment for us and say that is \nour bill, and now that we want a full debate, they are saying we won't \ntake their generous offer.\n  The Senator from Illinois said in March:\n\n       My good friend, the late Congressman from Oklahoma, Mike \n     Synar, used to say: If you don't want to fight fires, don't \n     be a firefighter. If you don't want to stop crime, don't be a \n     policeman, and if you don't want to vote on tough issues, \n     don't run for Congress.\n       I agree with him.\n\n  States Senator Durbin.\n\n       I don't like facing tough votes, but it is a part of the \n     job. You ought to at least have enough confidence in your \n     beliefs to cast that vote and go home and explain it.\n\n  The Senator has even indicated that the one vote I would like on my \namendment to this housing bill he might support. Yet he won't allow me \na vote--not this week, not next week, not in September. I offered to \nallow the majority to schedule this vote any time, not attach it to the \nHousing bill, not slow it up 1 minute. The housing bill could have gone \nto the President on Thursday, but they are so afraid of voting on an \namendment that would cut off campaign contributions to Democratic \ncolleagues and cut off the lobbying of the organization we are talking \nabout bailing out that they will not allow a straight-up vote so \nAmerica can see where they stand.\n  This Congress is the Steve Erkle Congress. If you go back during the \nCongress and see what we have done even before--well, think of the big \namnesty bill that was pushed through here. Only a few of us looked at \nthe bill. We discovered that how it was promoted was not true. It would \nnot control our borders. It would not create a workable immigration \nsystem. Basically all it did is reward people who came here illegally. \nBut by letting the American people know what was in the bill--putting \nit on the Internet, talking to bloggers, radio talk shows and holding \nthe bill through a debate period--Americans rose up and said: No. We \nfigured you out, Congress, and we are not going to do it. Millions of \nAmericans stopped this Congress from passing that amnesty bill.\n  Millions of Americans are standing up as we make them more aware of \nthe thousands of earmarks to special interests and friends back home \nthat this Congress spends most of the year doing instead of addressing \npriorities. Americans are standing up. They are on to Congress, and we \nare going to keep pushing the Democratic majority to do something about \nthis wasteful spending.\n  In a few years, the same people who had voted time after time to \nspend the\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\nSocial Security surplus on other things--and believe me, it has been \n100 percent on the Democratic side. I have offered an amendment to stop \nthe raid on Social Security and the Democrats have stood up every time \nand voted it down, so there is not one dime of money saved for Social \nSecurity because of Democratic spending. In a few years, those \nDemocrats are going to be standing up blaming someone else. This time \nit might not be big oil or the speculators, but they will be calling \nfor an investigation, because in less than 10 years, the money coming \nin for Social Security is not going to be enough to pay the benefits. \nMy Democratic colleagues will be calling for an investigation: Who \nstole the money from the trust fund? They will be hoping the American \npeople forget how they voted.\n\n  We see the same thing on health care every day. They complain about \nthe uninsured Americans, but when I put a bill on the floor that would \nallow individual Americans to at least do what businesses do and deduct \nthe cost of their health insurance as we allow businesses to do, every \nDemocrat voted against that, because they don't want Americans to own \nhealth insurance. They want the Government to take over health care. So \nat every point we try to expand health insurance, they try to kill it.\n  I could go on and on about this dysfunctional, disappointing \nCongress, but I guess I should move to housing and talk a little bit \nabout the bill that is on the floor today.\n  Could I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina has \n5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Well, I better move quickly here. Again, this is a bill \nthey want to pass in secret with very little debate. I have asked for \none amendment--one amendment to stop the lobbying.\n  This is not a good chart, but hopefully I can make the point. This is \nthe taxpayer at the top. This is Congress. This is Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. Years ago, Congress created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as \nprivate sector organizations that were supposed to help the mortgage \nindustry and help people buy homes. Certainly it did, but Congress was \nsupposed to watch them because we gave them monopoly status. They \nreceived huge tax breaks so no one in the private sector could compete \nwith them, so they grew and grew. The idea was that this Congress would \npass the reforms and provide the oversight so that Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac would not get out of control, because effectively when we \nformed them, we told the markets and the American people the taxpayer \nwas going to guarantee they would not lose money.\n  What happened is they stopped these reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac and over the last 10 years they spent nearly $200 million in \npolitical contributions to Senators and Congressmen, spreading money \nall around Washington. A lot of think tanks that are supposed to be \nwatchdogs are not watchdogs to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because they \nhave spread so much money around.\n  Now as we ask the American people to come in and put their money into \nthe pot to hold up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the one gesture of good \nfaith as a Congress we could ask is: Hey, that is a conflict of \ninterest. We can't have the people who are supposed to watch over these \norganizations getting money from these organizations. At least if we \nare going to ask the American taxpayer to be on the hook for billions, \npossibly trillions of dollars, let's stop this. So I said that is all I \nwant, one amendment, 15 minutes of debate, and then you can have your \nhousing bill, even though it is a terrible bill. They said no. They \nsaid no. We are going to keep Members here Saturday to keep you from \nhaving your amendment.\n  There are a lot of problems with this bill, but it doesn't matter. \nHere it is. It is almost 700 pages. Not one Senator has read it. There \nare lots of little goodies stuck in there. There is one we found, an \nearmark on page 616 that overturns an IRS ruling where low-income \nhousing--which is supposed to be for the general public and not \ndiscriminate--that they can discriminate for social organizations such \nas art colonies. Then we find an organization, Artspace, that develops \nlow-income housing and gives it to these artistic colonies, one of \ntheir board members happens to be the executive director of the Fannie \nMae foundation.\n  Folks, this bill needs to be aired out for weeks, if not months. They \nwant to rush it through. We kept them here on Saturday so the American \npeople could find out a little bit more about what is in it. But no \nmatter what is wrong with it, most of the Members of this Senate are \ngoing to come in and vote for it and check the box and go home and say \nthey did something about housing. I am afraid they may compromise the \nfuture of America as they do it.\n  I am sure I am about to run out of time. I know this is a lost cause \nand I am not going to stop this bill, but I am disappointed, the \nAmerican people are disappointed, and what we have done by keeping the \nDemocrats and the Republicans here today is maybe give Americans a \nlittle more time to see what this Congress is doing to their future.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, after hearing the Senator from South \nCarolina, it is time we initiate an investigation. I think we ought to \ncall the Sergeant at Arms Office. Something terrible has happened here. \nApparently, the pages on the Republican side of the aisle are not \ndistributing the Congressional Record to the Republican Members. The \nSenator from South Carolina says we are about to vote on a secret bill \nthat no one has seen. Clearly, the pages have failed to put the \nCongressional Record of July 23 at the desk of the Senator from South \nCarolina, because if they did, the Senator would find the bill in its \nentirety printed in the Congressional Record.\n  I am sure the Senator knows this is no new bill. This bill has been \naround since April. The Senator has had ample opportunity to read his \nso-called secret bill.\n  This is terrible that they aren't distributing the Congressional \nRecord on the Republican side of the aisle. We have to look into this, \nas the Senator says he has evidence of 855 secret bills--again, a \nfailure to deliver the Congressional Record to the Senator from South \nCarolina. Every single one of those bills, I say to my colleague, is \nprinted in the Congressional Record for him to take home and to read--\nto read on the plane back and forth to South Carolina. It is all there.\n  I am sure the Senator from South Carolina has been overlooked because \nwe have something called hotline. Under the hotline, every Senate \noffice is called before every bill is brought to the floor, and any \nSenator can stop the bill, put a hold on it. Every Senate office is \ncalled. For some reason, on the Republican side, the cloakroom is \nobviously not calling the Senator from South Carolina.\n  They are trying to get something past him, secret bills. It is a \nshame. It should be looked into. The Senator is not getting the \nCongressional Records, the hotline calls, and is being overlooked by \nhis Republican conference. That isn't fair. We need to look into this. \nFor the rest of the Senate--99 other Senators--this is on our desk \nevery day, the Congressional Record, printing out every bill in its \nentirety for us to read, if we want to, or ask our staff to. A hotline \ncall is made over and over every day to let you know a bill might come \nto the floor. It is not a secret process. The Congressional Record is \nnot classified. It is open to the public. It is published so everybody \ncan read it. It is available on the Internet.\n  So I say to the Senator from South Carolina, let's lift the veil of \nsecrecy and let's start delivering the Congressional Record to his desk \nevery day so he can keep up with the Senate and know what is going to \nbe debated and voted on. The Senator has kind of avoided the obvious. \nThe reason we are here today--and we could have been with our \nfamilies--is because the Senator from South Carolina insisted on it. We \ntried to get our work done in a way so Members could get back to their \nfamilies. We could have done it yesterday. The Senator from South \nCarolina objected. He has a right to do\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\nthat. That is why we are here today. Let's not beat around the bush \nabout that.\n  In terms of quoting former Congressman Mike Synar, I stand by that. \nWe didn't tell the Republicans what they had to offer on the Energy \nbill. We said put in your package what you want to put in your package. \nBring your drilling amendment, your oil shale amendment, your amendment \nfor nuclear power, and all of that was refused. That was refused. We \nweren't writing a single word of any Republican amendment. That was \nyour right as a Member of the Republican conference to do that. I \ncertainly hope that, incidentally, the Senator from South Carolina, who \ntalked about his amendment on lobbying, would share a copy with us. \nRight now, it is a secret amendment. The Senator has not shared it with \nus. We asked for copies of it. I hope maybe he will share that with us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I advise the Senator from Illinois that I \nhave been to the floor asking unanimous consent to offer this \namendment, which has been available all week. It is in the cloakroom. \nThe amendment is simple and available. I remind the Senator that when \nbills appear in the Congressional Record, it is after they have passed. \nAs far as the hotlines that come through late at night, I get many \ncalls at the airport from my staff, when we are leaving at the end of \nthe week. That is when these bills go through, and they want to pass \nthem by unanimous consent. Often a copy is only available in the \ncloakroom. Members have not read them. We are all used to doing \nbusiness that way, and it is a problem when we start talking about \nmajor policies and billions of dollars of money that is spent--\ncertainly on a bill such as this. We may make it available for a few \ndays, so it is not to say it wasn't available, but I know not one \nMember of the Senate has read it all and seen the special provisions \nthat have been stuck in it.\n  I ask unanimous consent--to clear up what the Senator from Illinois \nhas said--that next week, when we come back, we have a free and open \ndebate and that the Republicans and all Members be allowed to offer \ntheir amendments, without restriction from the Democratic side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is what I thought. There is so much doublespeak \nhere. They are saying one thing to the cameras and to America and \nanother thing here. We are not allowed to offer our amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the order \non the floor? Have we agreed on time? And I think there is some order \nfor speeches.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican time has been \ndivided. The Senator from New Mexico will be granted 7 minutes. The \nmajority time has not been divided, and there are 32 minutes remaining \non the majority side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Who is to speak next on the rotation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no specific order. It is \nan allocation of time to individual Senators.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator from Maryland wish to speak now?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I plan to speak for about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then I will take our 7 minutes now.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I also have 5 minutes under the \nprevious order, is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, the Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to follow \nSenator Domenici on our side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have some remarks I think are very \npertinent to what is going on in the Senate regarding energy for the \nAmerican people. I wish to have answered a couple of the statements the \nDemocratic whip stated regarding these amendments. I don't have time \nnow, but I will soon.\n  Suffice it to say we don't have a chance to offer amendments. Anybody \nwho says the Republicans are free and open and have an opportunity to \noffer amendments is not reading the Record. The majority leader has \nfixed it so we can't. I rise to speak about a great amendment for the \nAmerican people that will be pushed aside because the majority leader \nhas short-circuited the so-called Energy bill. This amendment gets at \nthe heart of what we have been saying we need to do: Find more, use \nless.\n  Republicans believe we have a supply-and-demand imbalance, and the \namendment I speak about this morning attacks the core of the problem. \nRepublicans want to act on the No. 1 issue facing the American people. \nWe want to act now. We have a great quantity of American resources on \nthe Atlantic and Pacific offshore coasts, and so the first part of the \nColeman-Domenici amendment--which we would have sent to the desk, and \nit could have been pending and we could vote on it, but it is out of \norder because the majority leader has seen to it that it is out of \norder. This Coleman-Domenici amendment would have allowed coastal \nStates in those areas to open the waters within their offshore \nboundaries for leasing 50 miles out. Fifty miles out could not do \ndamage to the sea, the shores, or to the coastal areas the people want \nto use for their daily lives. You could not even see the activity 50 \nmiles out.\n  The States would receive 37.5 percent of the revenues from this \nproduction, which could mean literally billions of dollars. When we \npassed the Gulf of Mexico Security Act of 2006, we opened deep sea \nareas containing more than 1.25 billion barrels of oil and nearly 6 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas. This will provide domestic energy \nfor millions of Americans, and it is roughly estimated to provide up to \n$400 million for the Gulf Coast States over the next 10 years, and tens \nof billions of dollars over the coming decade. When the Atlantic and \nPacific States see this money rolling into these coastal States, they \nwill be clamoring for more energy, more revenues, and for the good-\npaying jobs this great energy enterprise will bring.\n  Our amendment is clearly a positive on several fronts. The American \nresources on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts contain 14 billion \nbarrels, at a minimum. I say ``a minimum'' because we have not been \nprudent enough, I say to fellow Senators, to spend money to inventory \nit in an appropriate way--the coastal planes areas--to see how much is \nthere. We know there is a lot. But the estimates are old estimates and, \nin every case, these old estimates have been very many times wrong. We \nhave had much more in resources than the old estimate would indicate. \nNow, the 14 billion barrels is more than we have imported from the \nPersian Gulf over the last 15 years. If people wonder if there is any \noil, it is 15 years of importation from the Persian Gulf will be found \nin these offshore waters. That is a minimum. That is the old estimate, \nwhich was done decades ago under old technology.\n  That is why I have also filed an amendment that provides $500 million \nin funding to pay for a real inventory of our national resources \noffshore. The American people could hardly believe that we are in 2008 \nwith modern technology and we don't know how much oil and natural gas \nis ours, belongs to our people, which we could use. We don't even know; \nwe haven't bothered to find out.\n  A few months ago, the people of Brazil set out to explore and develop \ntheir own coastal resources. Like us, they knew they had oil offshore. \nLike us, they didn't know exactly how much. Well, in April, one company \nstarted drilling from exploratory wells in a deep water area off of the \ncoast of Rio de Janeiro. To their surprise, they found as much as 33 \nbillion barrels of potentially recoverable oil. Just like that, \novernight, Brazil took control of its energy dependence by finding 33 \nbillion barrels of oil. In the words of one of the great energy \nexperts, Daniel Yergin, who I am proud to say is a friend:\n\n       Five or six years ago, nobody really thought there was a \n     huge supply off of\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\n     Brazil. Now people are saying this could be as big as the \n     North Sea.\n\n  To put that quotation into perspective, the North Sea has provided as \nmuch as 6 million barrels per day at its peak. Perhaps our amendment \ncould do the same for our people. But we may never know because the \nmajority leader refuses to address the most important issue in America \nin a serious way. For some reason I can't understand, there remain a \nnumber of Democrats--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute to finish.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, is there equal distribution of time to be \nadded to the majority?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Surely.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the second part of the amendment \naddresses the issue of using less. We have all heard about electric \ncars, and we know if we can get these batteries up to where they will \ndo 100 miles before they need to be recharged, we will have electric \nbatteries sprouting up all over America. That will save crude oil. \nWithout a doubt, we will have established an excellent approach to \nAmerica's energy future.\n  All we need is for our majority leader--he belongs to the Senate--to \nbe fair and let the Republicans have a vote on behalf of America. Why \ndo they fear votes in this regard?\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nhousing bill that's before the Senate.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I am concerned about the current housing \ncrisis.\n  The American people are anxious that the equity they have paid into \ntheir homes may not provide the financial security that home ownership \nonce guaranteed.\n  Worst of all, many homeowners across the Nation, struggling with \nhigher energy and food costs, are at risk of losing their homes through \nforeclosure.\n  The legislation before us has positive aspects--including modernizing \nthe Federal Housing Administration to provide better, fixed rate \nlending options to those who previously resorted to risky subprime \nloans.\n  This will expand homeownership.\n  I am pleased that the bill also includes assistance for first-time \nhomebuyers and property tax relief for current homeowners.\n  The standard deduction for property taxes, included in this bill, \nwould be $500 for single filers and $1,000 for joint filers and that is \nimportant.\n  I am also pleased that the bill before us provides some reforms for \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  With a new, independent regulator, I hope we can prevent some of the \nirresponsible behavior these enterprises have engaged in over the last \nfew years.\n  But, it is how we are responding to that irresponsible behavior that \nwill ultimately lead me to vote in opposition to this bill.\n  I am troubled by the inclusion of an unlimited U.S. Treasury credit \nline for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including the authority for the \nU.S. Government to purchase stock in these private companies without \nthe necessary intervention in their governance.\n  With our anticipated action today, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will \nhave the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  However, they have demonstrated spending habits that should not be \nunderwritten by American taxpayers.\n  Furthermore, I am concerned that with this new authority we will set \na dangerous precedent and provide incentives for other private \nfinancial institutions to ignore risks in the future.\n  Privatize profits for socialized risk to a slippery slope.\n  This addition to the previous bill we passed will increase the \nstatutory limit of the current national debt to $10.6 trillion, an $800 \nbillion increase.\n  We could improve this bill substantially if individual Senators were \nallowed to offer amendments on which the Senate could vote.\n  But we are being prevented from doing that.\n  Senator DeMint has introduced a commonsense amendment to prevent \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac from lobbying Congress or making political \ncontributions.\n  According to The Politico:\n\n       Over the past decade, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spent \n     nearly $200 million on lobbying and campaign contributions.\n\n  These activities shouldn't be allowed to continue.\n  I would support the DeMint amendment.\n  I also believe that we need checks on executive compensation and \nperks at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with this kind of infusion of \ntaxpayer backing.\n  In 2003, the CEO of Fannie Mae, who left during an investigation of \naccounting irregularities, was paid $20 million.\n  In 2007, the current Chairman of Freddie Mac pocketed nearly $19.8 \nmillion.\n  Considering that this bill permits the Federal Government to become a \nshareholder in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac--and thus, operated with U.S. \ntax dollars--that level of pay is simply unacceptable.\n  The U.S. Senate can, and should, spend time debating these issues and \nimproving the bill instead of rubberstamping additions that pose a \ntaxpayer liability of billions, and maybe trillions.\n  But instead, the bill is being rushed through the Senate without the \ncareful consideration and deliberation it deserves.\n  This is irresponsible.\n  While I think it is important to restore confidence in Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, and alleviate the housing crisis in our country, I think \nwe should do better. I cannot support the housing bill in its current \nform.\n  I have supported this bill twice before when it came through the \nSenate without the keys to the Treasury being handed to Freddie and \nFannie.\n  With this addition and without adequate reforms to protect taxpayers, \nit is a step too far.\n  This bill may ultimately create more problems than it solves.\n  Newspapers across the political spectrum, from the Wall Street \nJournal to the Washington Post, have questioned the desirability of a \nGSE bailout.\n  The Washington Post editorialized that the bill would ``potentially \nincrease the very risks [the] plan is intended to mitigate,'' and asked \n``wouldn't it be wiser to revamp the whole GSE structure, rather than \nconstruct an increasingly elaborate apparatus to address--or conceal--\nthe fact that it no longer works very well?''\n  There are potentially 800 billion reasons why we ought to take our \ntime to consider this bill.\n  I think we should help alleviate the housing crisis, but the American \ntaxpayers have the right to expect a serious, long-term solution rather \nthan a quick fix that puts them on the hook today and keeps them there \ntomorrow.\n  Although I support many of the provisions in this bill, and supported \nprevious versions the Senate considered, I will vote against this bill \ndue in large part to these enormous taxpayer liabilities that this \ninstitution will not have the ability to amend.\n  If this bill does become law, we should not abandon our oversight \nresponsibility to ensure that any actions taken by the Treasury will be \nfair and responsible to America's taxpayers, homeowners, and financial \ninstitutions.\n  We owe the taxpayers our vigilance.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute for both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Reserving the right to object, if the time comes out of \nwhat is allocated to the Republicans, I have no objection. There is \nadditional time to the Republicans already allocated.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will not take from my colleagues' \ntime, but I would like to offer that there be an additional minute for \nthe Democratic side as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as long as it comes out of the Republican \ntime, there is no objection.\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is not what the request is. \nThe Senator from Texas is requesting additional time for herself and \nfor the Democratic side.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I think people are expecting a vote at 11. There is time \non the Republican side, so I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 1 minute \nbe taken from leader time on the Republican side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, newspapers across the political \nspectrum, from the Wall Street Journal to the Washington Post, have \nquestioned the desirability of a GSE bailout. The Washington Post \neditorialized that the bill would ``potentially increase the very risks \nthe plan is intended to mitigate'' and asked: ``Wouldn't it be wiser to \nrevamp the whole GSE structure, rather than construct an increasingly \nelaborate apparatus to address--or conceal--the fact that it no longer \nworks very well?''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this point the Wall Street Journal editorial of July 24.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 24, 2008]\n\n                     Housing Bill Hammers Taxpayers\n\n       Combine a housing meltdown with election-year politics and \n     the results were not going to be pretty. Add a crisis in \n     confidence in Washington's favorite quasipublic companies and \n     what we're getting is a rout for taxpayers, especially those \n     who kept their heads during the housing mania.\n       The House yesterday passed a housing bailout by 272-152. \n     The White House has thrown its reservations overboard and is \n     begging to sign this boondoggle, despite the less-than-veto-\n     proof majority. A few brave souls in the Senate are \n     threatening a filibuster, which is where the last hope lies \n     for stripping the most egregious and expensive provisions \n     from this monster.\n       Even conservative estimates by the Congressional Budget \n     Office say the cost for this bailout will run to $41.7 \n     billion, with $16.8 billion offset by higher taxes. No one \n     has any idea of the real cost. The most expensive provision \n     gives the Treasury temporary authority to pour money into \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The CBO says this could cost $100 \n     billion, or it could cost ``nothing.'' So it threw a dart at \n     the wall and assigned a $25 billion price tag to the Fan and \n     Fred bailout.\n       Likewise, the bill's $300 billion to refinance and insure \n     distressed loans through the Federal Housing Administration \n     will supposedly cost just a few billion dollars. That assumes \n     few homeowners and lenders will sign up for the program \n     because lenders will have to take a 10% haircut to be \n     eligible. If no one needs this program, why is it there? If \n     lenders do take advantage, they're bound to dump their worst \n     loans on the feds. So as with the Fan and Fred bailout, the \n     FHA guarantee will be either superfluous or much more \n     expensive than we're led to believe.\n       Alongside these big-ticket items, we suppose the $4 billion \n     tax credit for first-time home buyers, or the $4 billion in \n     ``community development'' pork grants, or the $180 million \n     for housing counseling are merely routine outrages.\n       On the other hand, the kid-glove treatment of Fannie Mae \n     and Freddie Mac is very much worth worrying about. On the \n     floor of the House yesterday, Democrats argued that this bill \n     was the least Congress could do ``for the people,'' given the \n     way the government had ``helped'' Bear Stearns. The cost \n     borne by Bear Stearns was having its shareholders all but \n     wiped out and half its employees pink-slipped. Countrywide \n     was likewise sold at a fire sale price. Not so these two \n     government-chartered giants.\n       Fannie and Freddie may well be too big to fail, as Treasury \n     Secretary Hank Paulson keeps reminding us. That is true in \n     large part because they were allowed--no, encouraged--to grow \n     like Topsy while Congress shielded them from oversight. At a \n     minimum, the cost of a lifeline ought to include some \n     accountability and assurance they cannot get into such a fix \n     again. Instead what we have is a promise that Fannie and \n     Freddie will pay us Tuesday for an explicit taxpayer \n     guarantee today. The Treasury will get unlimited authority to \n     recapitalize the mortgage giants, effective immediately, \n     while a new regulator will have to run a gauntlet of \n     confirmation and Congressional hazing over the companies' \n     portfolios of mortgage securities the way a Supreme Court \n     nominee has to handle Roe v. Wade.\n       This delay will give Fan and Fred time to consolidate their \n     political position and fend off attempts to shrink them to a \n     less risky size. At the same time, the $600 million \n     ``affordable housing'' fund that the bill would skin off the \n     hide of the two firms gives Washington a permanent stake in \n     preserving their dominant market position. If Fannie and \n     Freddie can't be brought to heel politically now, when weeks \n     ago their very survival was in doubt, not even a newly \n     empowered regulator will have any hope of reducing their \n     claims on the public fisc once the dust settles.\n       Mr. Paulson might have kept an eye on the taxpayer's \n     interest here by insisting that any money put into the \n     companies come with some upside, as the Chrysler bailout in \n     1979 did. Instead we are left to trust that Mr. Paulson or \n     his successor will have the political nerve to resist the \n     companies and their friends on Capitol Hill. Any money given \n     to Fannie and Freddie should have been conditioned on \n     receivership, including clearing out the management and \n     boards that made this mess.\n       Mr. Paulson argues that the new regulator will have the \n     Federal Reserve's clout behind it, adding firepower to its \n     ability to rein in the not-so-dynamic duo. But the Fed is \n     also subject to Congressional sway, and no Fed Chairman is \n     going to risk losing his running room on monetary policy to \n     corral Fan and Fred.\n       For proof of how powerful they remain, even in their \n     straitened circumstances, look no further than Majority \n     Leader Harry Reid's refusal even to allow a vote on an \n     amendment proposed by South Carolina Republican Jim DeMint to \n     bar the two from lobbying in the future. Senator DeMint has \n     threatened to filibuster if his amendment isn't aired. By \n     itself, the antilobbying provision won't save the taxpayer \n     from Fan and Fred, but it's a start.\n       Democrats are rushing this bill through because of the \n     favors for Fan and Fred and new spending for left-wing \n     activists like Acorn. But the reluctance of many Republicans \n     to look out for taxpayers is harder to comprehend. They'll \n     get little credit this year for letting the majority \n     Democrats say they did something for ``housing,'' and GOP \n     voters will blame them for rescuing the irresponsible.\n       Meantime, the White House and Treasury are betting that \n     this bill will put a floor under the housing market and buoy \n     bank stocks, and thus avoid a deeper financial downturn. The \n     rescue will only delay a housing market bottom, and it may or \n     may not help bank stocks. The one certainty is that taxpayers \n     are assuming a huge new risk.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, there are 800 billion reasons why we \nought to take our time to consider this bill. I think we should help \nalleviate the housing crisis, and I think most of this bill is good and \nsolid, but it adds to the regulatory burden.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I hope we will take time to consider \nit better.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I know it is unusual that the Senate would \nbe here on a Saturday, in a voting session, but I am pleased that we \nare here because at last we are going to have a chance to vote on final \npassage of H.R. 3221, the housing legislation that is so important to \nthe people of this country.\n  I first wish to thank Senators Dodd and Shelby for the manner in \nwhich they have handled this legislation. It has been handled in a \nbipartisan manner, the way it should be. They have been extremely \npatient.\n  This bill has been on the floor on numerous occasions. There have \nbeen many opportunities for all of us to offer our suggestions on this \nlegislation. It has been one of the most open bills we have had.\n  I know there are some on the other side of the aisle--my colleague \nfrom South Carolina--who raise certain objections. There are some who \nwould like to see this matter further delayed. I understand that. In \nthe other body, Republicans have decided to vote against this \nlegislation by a 3-1 margin. That is their prerogative. And there are \nsome in this body who believe the status quo is acceptable. They do not \nbelieve we should be aggressively trying to help the people of our \ncommunities in the housing crisis. Well, I disagree with that, and I \nthink the majority of this body disagrees, and it is important for us \nto provide the tools necessary to deal with the housing crisis in this \ncountry. Every day that we wait, 8,500 more foreclosures are here in \nAmerica--8,500 people are in danger of losing their houses every single \nday. So, Mr. President, I am sorry we didn't get this legislation done \nearlier, but I am pleased we are here today to complete this \nlegislation and to send it to the President for his signature.\n  We all know the current status of our economy. We know that people \naround this Nation are having a difficult time dealing with their \neveryday costs--dealing with energy costs, dealing with\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\nhealth care costs, and, yes, dealing with their housing expenses. We \nknow that the trigger to the current downturn in our economy was caused \nby the housing market. So it is important for us to pay special \nattention to the housing market as we try not only to help families who \nare struggling to keep their homes and keep communities strong but also \nto help our economy.\n  This is true in each one of our States. In Maryland, in the second \nquarter of 2008, we saw a 130-percent increase in foreclosures. In my \nown State, 1 out of every 243 households is in some stage of \nforeclosure. This is a crisis affecting millions of people in our \nNation. Maryland now ranks 16th in the Nation on foreclosures. The \nproblem is continuing. There are subprime mortgages that are out there \nwith adjustable rate mortgages that will be coming due during 2008 and \n2009, and we will see more and more foreclosures. So we need to act to \ntry to prevent those foreclosures.\n  I know there have been some who have said: Well, look, this was a \nfree market and people made their own decisions. But I can tell you of \ncommunities in my own State where homeowners were steered into subprime \nmortgages--homeowners who could have qualified for standard mortgages, \nbut because of the way the fees were arranged, they were steered into \nthese subprime products and are now in danger of losing their homes. So \nwe need to do something.\n  I want to first acknowledge that there have been many groups that \nhave stepped forward. Nonprofits in my State and around the Nation have \ntried to do what they can, and I applaud them for their actions. A lot \nof the people involved in the nonprofit housing sector have tried to \nhelp through counseling and other means, and that is laudable. In my \nown State, I applaud the efforts of our Chief Judge Bell, who has \ncalled upon the lawyers of Maryland to attend training sessions to \noffer pro bono services to help homeowners who are in danger of losing \ntheir homes. I think that is what the bar should be doing, what lawyers \nshould be doing, and they are stepping up to try to help. We also see \nState and local governments doing what they can to try to help in the \nhousing market, and even private companies have stepped up to try to \nrestructure loans so that people can stay in their homes. All of that \nis what should be happening, and I applaud the efforts of the private \nsector and local governments. But the Federal Government should be a \nfull partner in this effort, and I think H.R. 3221 moves us in a \ndirection toward accepting that responsibility.\n  The bill helps current homeowners on the brink of foreclosure. It \nwill provide $180 million for financial and legal assistance to \nhomeowners who are in danger of losing their homes, which I think is \nvery important. The legislation provides for counseling services to \nhelp counselors deal with individuals who are in danger of going into \nforeclosure on their properties. It also helps with refinancing. It is \nestimated that 400,000 people in this country will benefit from the \nprovisions of this legislation that allow for refinancing of their \nloans.\n\n  Some have said this is bailout. It is not a bailout. The loans are \ngoing to be bought at market value. Investors are going to lose part of \ntheir investment on these refinancings, as they should. It is not a \nbailout. And the homeowners who take advantage of it, it is to help \nthem stay in their homes. If they sell their homes, part of the profits \nneed to be returned. So it is a fair way to keep people in their homes, \nrecognizing the fact that it is not only the individual homeowner who \nloses but the entire community loses when a house is foreclosed upon.\n  I am particularly pleased with the provision in this legislation \ndealing with first-time homeowners. Several months ago, I talked to \nSenator Baucus about a housing credit for first-time home buyers to \nhelp more people become engaged in buying and selling homes. We know \nthat 40 percent of home buyers are first-time home buyers, and by \nhelping first-time home buyers, we help the housing market and we help \nthe economy. I think the provision in this bill that will provide a \n$7,500 credit or an interest-free loan will help. It is targeted to \nmoderate-income families, and it is temporary. It needs to be used in \nthe next year. It is reasonable from the point of view of helping \npeople get back into the housing market, and I thank the committee for \nincluding that provision.\n  This legislation also deals with the credit crunch--the availability \nof mortgage money for those who need to buy homes. The FHA \nmodernization will help, and the reverse-mortgage provisions that \nseniors use. Seniors who have lived in their home for many years have a \nlot of equity in their home. They need the cash out of their house in \norder to stay there, and reverse mortgages help them obtain the \nresources they need to deal with their health care and to deal with \nquality-of-life issues. This bill modernizes the reverse-mortgage \nprovisions, providing strong consumer protection provisions for our \nseniors.\n  We all know about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provisions and how we \nhave tried to strengthen the regulatory system. I think that is what we \nshould be doing. We are giving the Secretary of the Treasury the \nflexibility and authority that he needs in order to make sure we don't \nhave a crisis in this country by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae not being \nable to carry out their stated mission.\n  I am also pleased that the $11 billion for local mortgage bonding \nauthority remains in this bill to help local governments deal with the \navailability of low-income housing.\n  The legislation also includes improvements to the CDBG funds by $4 \nbillion, of which $89 million will be available to the people of \nMaryland. These are for the communities that are directly affected and \nhave large numbers of foreclosed properties. This provision will allow \nthe local governments to be able to buy foreclosed properties and turn \nthem back and make them available for moderate-income families through \nhome ownership and rental.\n  There is a provision in the bill that deals with veterans, through \nour VA home loan program, to prevent foreclosure and increase home \nownership.\n  Lastly, there are provisions in this bill to help us in the future \nwith better mortgage disclosure rules and nationwide loan originator \nlicensing and registration.\n  The bottom line is, it increases the tools available in our toolbox \nto deal with vulnerable families who are in danger of losing their \nhomes, it provides the financial wherewithal so that we can keep credit \navailable for people to buy and sell homes, and it is a message and \naction to help our economy in these very difficult times. I am pleased \nwe are able, at last, to vote on this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this very important bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to use 5 minutes of the time \nallotted to the Republican leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first, I appreciate particularly the \nwork of my colleague, the senior Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, who \nhas, for quite a number of years, fought to improve oversight of the \nGSE, the Fannie and Freddie agencies that are so dominant in our loan \nmarket.\n  I am pleased, finally, now that we are in a crisis and the warnings \nhe has raised for years, along with Senator Sununu, Senator Allard, and \nsome others, that they now are willing to accept some significant \noversight over these tremendously large institutions while, \nunfortunately, placing the taxpayers at risk.\n  So I think, all in all, with the crisis we are facing, I am inclined \nto support this legislation; although I am not, in general, happy we \nare in this circumstance.\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  I would like now to direct my remarks to the LIHEAP legislation. I \nthink it is a curious thing. I know a lot of Members on our side, who \nare so frustrated about the inability to have a real debate about \nenergy, will vote against the LIHEAP bill and going forward to it \nbecause they want to stay on energy legislation, in general.\n  I would suggest, however, the legislation that has been offered by my \ncolleague from Vermont is bad policy. It is not good. We ought not to \nsupport it. Fundamentally, it does this: It subsidizes the burning of \nmore fossil fuel.\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\nThat is an invariable law of economics, that which you subsidize you \nget more of. We are told, particularly by our green members--so many of \nthem do come from the Northeast--that we ought to reduce fossil fuels. \nYet we have a piece of legislation that subsidizes, to a dramatic \ndegree, fossil fuel use.\n  We had a little debate during the Presidential dustup in which we \ndiscussed cutting taxes on gasoline because the price of gasoline had \ndoubled. People agreed that was bad public policy. This is worse. This \nis collecting tax money from various Americans and is giving it to \nothers so they can buy more fossil fuels. I do not think that is good \npolicy.\n  Second, it is the second LIHEAP bill we have had. The first one was \n$2.5 billion. We have done that one. Now we want to do another $2.5 \nbillion that is unpaid for. It is a $2.5 billion direct increase to the \ndebt of the United States of America. We are spending like drunken \nsailors, and that is unkind to drunken sailors.\n  We have already passed a $150 billion stimulus package to help people \nwith higher costs and difficulties, and we sent out checks for that. We \npassed a $60 billion GI bill expansion. We passed a $50 billion foreign \naid package for disease in Africa. We have added $14 billion to the \nMedicare fix. We are heading to this bill, this housing bill, that is \ngoing to cost and others.\n  We are going to more than double the deficit this year. We have to \nlearn to say no. We cannot do everything we would like to do. The \ndeficit last year was $177 billion. It is going to be $450 to $500 \nbillion this year. That's unbelievable. We have to get serious about \nspending in general.\n  Also, the argument has always been this is for high heating oil \nprices. Well, I would suggest there is probably no more polluting, no \nmore CO2-creating fuel than fuel oil. It is a low-grade \nfuel. It is not the best kind of thing. Maybe we ought to be talking to \nour friends and colleagues who oppose so much drilling and production \nof oil and gas, perhaps we should begin to talk about how solar or wind \ncould deal with their problems.\n  But I suspect, when it comes to their own neighborhood, they know \nsolar and wind are not so easily done and would actually be more \nexpensive than heating oil.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute. I do not see another colleague here.\n  I would note that for these reasons, I think it is bad public policy. \nI ask my colleagues to vote against it on the merits and also because \nwe need to continue to talk about producing more energy for America; \nkeeping American wealth at home and not continue to transmit $700 \nbillion a year of our wealth to nations around the world, often who are \nhostile to our national security interests.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition? The Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 22 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7 \nminutes and that the remaining 15 minutes be reserved for Senator Dodd.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama said that what \nthe LIHEAP legislation is about is subsidizing fossil fuels. No, that \nis not accurate. What the LIHEAP legislation is about is keeping people \nalive in Alabama, in Arizona, in Texas, in Vermont, in Maine, and all \nover this country. The Senator from Alabama should know that people are \ndying this summer, when the heat gets to 110 degrees and when electric \nrates are soaring and they do not have the money to pay those electric \nbills.\n  The Senator from Alabama and others should know the CDC, the Centers \nfor Disease Control, have made it very clear that more people die from \nextreme heat exposure and exposure to the cold than all other natural \ndisasters combined.\n  Let's be clear what we are voting on this morning. When the Senator \nfrom Alabama and others say: Well, we are spending money trying to keep \nthe elderly and the sick and children alive when the weather gets 20 \nbelow zero, we are. I will vote for those proposals, rather than \nhundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 \npercent.\n  I will vote to make sure people in Vermont do not freeze in the \nwinter, while we give tax breaks to ExxonMobil that enjoys \nrecordbreaking profits. That is what we are talking about, priorities. \nDo we keep the old and the sick and kids alive when the weather gets \ncold or when the weather gets very hot or do we spend money on people \nwho make huge campaign contributions? That is part of what this debate \nis about.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I have the floor. I will not yield.\n  Some other people are saying what we should be talking about is \nenergy policy. Well, of course, we should. The energy policy of this \ncountry is way out of whack. We are spending $700 billion a year \nimporting foreign oil. We need to move to sustainable energy. We have \nnot moved to energy efficiency. There is an honest debate about where \nand how much drilling should take place. But that is not what this \ndebate is about.\n  Since 1981, we have had LIHEAP. It has been supported in a bipartisan \nmanner from everybody from President Bush on down. It is a program that \nhas worked. What everybody in this Chamber understands is the price of \nhome heating oil is soaring, the price of electricity is soaring, and \nthe people will become sick and die and be forced to leave their homes \nif we do not significantly expand LIHEAP funding in order to make sure \nthey can pay their bills.\n  Let me reiterate to my friend from Alabama or anybody else: This is \nnot a cold-weather State bill. Am I worried about what is going to \nhappen in Vermont this winter? You can bet on it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Who gets the benefit?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I believe I have the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. In Philadelphia, PA, in June, 17 people died from heat \nexhaustion. In Arizona, over the years, hundreds of people have died \nbecause they lack the ability to stay cool in the summer.\n  This legislation is supported by the AARP because they understand, \nthe largest senior group in America, what will happen to older \nAmericans if it is not passed.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Governors Association \nbecause they know the financial problems facing States and the need for \nthe Federal Government to act. This legislation is supported by the \nSouthern Governors Association because they know what hot weather does \nto peoples' health, especially the old and the sick when they cannot \nstay cool.\n  What we are dealing with is literally a life-and-death situation. \nPeople in the hot-weather States will die when temperatures get to be \n115 degrees, and they cannot afford the electricity to stay cool with \nair-conditioning.\n  People will die in the Northern tier when the weather gets 20 below \nzero, and they cannot afford the high cost of home heating oil or gas.\n  The American people are sick and tired of all the partisanship which \nis going on. Every Member of the Senate can write a press release \ntelling their constituents why they voted no. But you know what, I do \nnot think the people are going to believe you. If we have enough money \nfor tax breaks for ExxonMobil, we have enough money in this country to \nmake sure people do not freeze to death and that people do not die of \nheat exhaustion.\n  I hope we can come together while we disagree about other aspects of \nenergy policy. I hope we can finally come together and go back home, \nwhether it is to the South or the North, and tell the American people, \nwe understand what high energy prices are doing to them. We are going \nto stay with you. We are not going to let the most fragile people in \nour country, the most vulnerable people in our country, suffer \nunnecessarily when we know how to help them.\n\n[[Page S7498]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me commend \nour colleague from Vermont for his eloquence and his passion this \nmorning on a subject that, as he says, ought to unite all of us, \nregardless of geography or political party.\n  I would be remiss if I did not recognize, as well, that the Presiding \nOfficer today has been a champion of this issue during his tenure in \nthe Senate. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his passion about \nthis issue as well.\n  In the quarter of a century that I been here, as the Senator from \nVermont has pointed out, this issue has been an issue that has not \ndivided us along these lines. There have been those who, from time to \ntime, have opposed low-income energy assistance but, by and large, this \nis a matter that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support.\n  While we are in the depths of the summer today, and there are those \nwho are wondering what we are talking about, we talk about home heating \noil and gas for the winter, we are only days away from those \ntemperature changes.\n  Of course, for those who live in our southern States, the issue of \nheat exhaustion is something they live with all the time. And low-\nincome energy assistance, as the Senator from Vermont points out, cuts \nacross all geographical lines. It is the basic necessity. You cannot \nsurvive without it. Over the years, we have been able to do something \nto support it.\n  So I urge our colleagues, when the vote occurs later this morning on \nthis issue, that we join on this matter and support the effort to \nprovide for that low-income energy assistance.\n  I commend my colleague from Vermont, who has been patient about this \nissue over the last number of weeks. My hope is it will be supported. I \nhope we do on low-income energy assistance what we have done on \nhousing.\n  I note the presence of my colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby. I \nwish to begin my remarks by thanking my friend from Alabama. I thank \nhim and our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, on the Banking \nCommittee.\n  The Presiding Officer and others, by a vote of 19 to 2, we came out \nof our committee back in March on a housing proposal. We have worked \nclosely together over these last number of weeks in order to bring us \nto this moment, which I wondered if it would ever occur, given the \nnumber of times we have voted on this matter since March.\n  But in about 30 minutes, we are going to have a chance to finally \ndecide whether this Congress is going to do something about the growing \neconomic problems, basically founded and anchored in the foreclosure \ncrisis of our Nation, that has now spread far beyond residential \nmortgages.\n  It is long overdue that this Congress respond. We are about to do so \nin a bipartisan fashion. Given the vote yesterday of 80 to 13, it is an \nindication of this what this body can do when we are determined to work \ntogether to make a difference.\n  So I wish to thank--I see my colleague from Georgia--Senator Isakson \nand others who have done a terrific job in packaging this proposal. If \neach one of us could write this alone, it would be different. We serve \nin a body of 100 Members. We need to work together to develop final \nproducts. This is an example of what can happen when that occurs.\n\n  I am pleased we are finally ready to pass the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act of 2008 and send it to the President's desk for his \nsignature. This has been a long and arduous process. It started when \nLeader Reid, who has been remarkable and marvelous in this process, \nLeader McConnell, Senator Shelby and I, announced on March 31 that we \nwere going to put together a bipartisan housing stimulus bill that \nwould address the growing housing crisis. Not much more than 24 hours \nlater, Senator Shelby and I, along with Senators Baucus and Grassley, \nbrought the first version of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act to \nthe floor where it received an overwhelming vote of 84 to 12. We \ncontinued to work over subsequent months to expand and improve the \nlegislation so it would more thoroughly address the growing foreclosure \nand financial crisis. This is the product we present to our colleagues \nthis morning.\n  This action is coming none too soon. Earlier this week data was \nreleased showing that home sales hit a 10-year low, falling 2.6 \npercent, over twice as much as what had been expected. Home prices \ncontinue to fall. The Census Bureau reported that foreclosures \ncontributed to a record number of vacant homes in the second quarter. \nMerrill Lynch reports that June numbers show we now have 11 months of \ninventory of single-family homes. That is a 23-year high.\n  RealtyTrac reported yesterday that forecloses in the second quarter \nmore than doubled from a year earlier and jumped nearly 14 percent from \nthe previous 3 months. As you have heard me say over and over, every \nday between 8,000 and 9,000 of our fellow Americans are put into \nforeclosure. There have been a record number of bank seizures as well. \nThis is happening in the United States. It simply ought to be \nunacceptable to every single one of us.\n  Bill Gross, the CIO of PIMCO, one of our largest investment funds, \nestimates our economy will face nearly $1 trillion in mortgage losses \nwhen it is all said and done. Martin Feldstein, who served President \nReagan as chief economist, wrote in the Wall Street Journal in March:\n\n       The 10 percent decline in house prices has cut household \n     wealth by more than $2 trillion, reducing consumer spending \n     and increasing the risk of a deep recession.\n\n  This is a staggering loss of wealth we are seeing, coming at the very \nsame time, as the Senator from Vermont has pointed out, that food \nprices, gas prices, health care, and education costs are rising. We are \nexperiencing the worst of all possible worlds. Wealth is declining, the \nsource of wealth creation, and costs are rising simultaneously. \nMoreover, when we consider the role that home equity has played in \nsupporting consumer spending, we see the danger a vicious downward \ncycle could create, an economic disaster for our country.\n  Don't let yourselves be dulled by nameless and faceless statistics \neither. Behind each one of these numbers I have recited, there is a \nfamily--a mother, a father, children trying to grow up, facing \nunemployment, losing their homes, wondering what the future holds. So \nwhen we talk about the numbers, about how important this data is, pause \nfor a minute, when deciding whether to support this bill, and remember: \nBehind every one of those numbers there is an American family who this \nmorning is wondering whether their Congress can do anything at all \nabout the problems they face.\n  In about 30 minutes, we will have an answer for that, I believe, an \noverwhelming one, that says: We are on your side. We want to make a \ndifference to keep you in your homes and get back on your feet again. \nThat is what this is all about--not the numbers but the faces. Those \nfamilies are counting on us. In the face of these daunting challenges, \nI believe we all have a responsibility to act. That is what we are \ngoing to do this morning by passing this bill.\n  Let me quote again Mr. Gross of PIMCO, who wrote this past Thursday:\n\n        . . . the omnibus housing/GSE bill now placed before the \n     Congress and the President is the best way to begin the long \n     journey back to normalcy [in this country].\n\n  I believe that to be the case. Treasury Secretary Paulson said the \npassing of this legislation is the most important action we can take to \naddress the housing crisis.\n  This legislation will not perform miracles. I want the American \npeople to have a realistic expectation as to what we are about to do. \nBut as others have said, it is a step--I hope and expect an important \nstep--toward putting our Nation on the road to economic recovery. Let \nme sum up the legislation very quickly before turning to my colleague \nfrom Alabama.\n  The bill establishes the HOPE for Homeowners Act to help at least \n400,000 to 500,000 families stay in their homes. It does so after \nasking both lenders and borrowers to make financial sacrifices, and it \ndoes so at absolutely no cost to the American taxpayer.\n  The bill creates a new world-class regulator for Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Recent news makes it clear \nthese entities need a stronger regulator to ensure they are viable and \nhealthy institutions, able to provide credit in times of stress such as \nwe are experiencing today. It also raises loan limits\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\nfrom $417,000 to a high of $625,000 so the government-sponsored \nenterprises can play an even more active role in stabilizing the \nhousing market.\n  At the request of Secretary Paulson, the legislation includes standby \nauthority for the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase the stock or \ndebt of the housing GSEs only if he finds such action is necessary to \nkeep the financial markets stable and mortgage credit flowing. It is \nour strong expectation that creating this authority will make it \nunlikely that it will ever be needed. As I have said, the GSEs have \nsignificantly more capital than is required by law. They continue to \nhave open access to the debt markets, and their holdings consist \nprimarily of 30-year fixed rate mortgages.\n  The bill modernizes the Federal Housing Administration program, \nraising the loan limits from $362,000 to $625,000 so that 98 percent of \nthe counties in the United States and 85 percent of the population will \nhave access to this important program. FHA has proved its value in the \ncurrent crisis, as it has continued to provide a stable source of \nmortgage credit even while many other lenders have failed.\n  The bill includes a permanent, affordable housing fund financed by \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac that will provide tens of thousands of \naffordable housing units. I tip my hat to the Presiding Officer, who \nhas been a tireless champion on behalf of affordable housing. With the \nwork of Senators Shelby and Reed, we have a permanent, affordable \nhousing program, the first time ever in our history. The bill includes \nnew protections for elderly homeowners taking out FHA-insured reverse \nmortgages so they are not deceived, as many have been, into using the \nproceeds from these loans to buy expensive and needless insurance \nproducts. These provisions were incorporated from a bill introduced by \nour colleague from Missouri, Senator McCaskill.\n\n  The bill includes a new mortgage broker and lender licensing \nrequirement added by Senator Martinez, with strong support from Senator \nFeinstein, that will begin to address the many abuses of the mortgage \nprocess perpetrated by brokers. In addition, it includes improved \ndisclosure requirements added by Senators Reed and Bond. Because of the \nefforts of Senators Kerry, Coleman, Akaka, Cornyn, and Sanders, the \nbill expands the availability of the VA housing program and includes a \nnumber of provisions to help returning veterans save their homes from \nforeclosure, and provides new housing benefits to disabled veterans. \nThe legislation includes $3.9 billion in emergency Community \nDevelopment Block Grant funds for areas hard hit by foreclosures, to \nhelp them purchase and rehabilitate these homes and put them into \nproductive use. As the Boston Globe wrote in an editorial earlier this \nmonth:\n\n       The major beneficiaries [of this provision] would be the \n     urban homeowners to pay their mortgages diligently yet face \n     declining property values, crime, and blight associated with \n     a rash of foreclosures near their homes.\n\n  This body has repeatedly provided emergency funds to communities \nravaged by floods, hurricanes, and natural disasters. The foreclosure \ncrisis is every bit as much of a disaster. This is an emergency equally \ndeserving of these funds.\n  Finally, the bill includes $150 million in new counseling money. \nHousing counselors have been our troops on the frontline, working with \ntroubled borrowers and lenders. These funds, which were included at the \nrequest of Senator Murray, along with Senator Schumer, will result in \ntens of thousands of American families being able to keep their homes.\n  Let me close by saying again this legislation is the product of \ntireless collaboration in the Senate and the other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, with the work of Barney Frank and his colleagues on \nthe Financial Services Committee and, of course, the administration, \nparticularly Secretary Paulson and his staff, to help develop solutions \nthat will strengthen our economy, restore confidence in our financial \nmarkets, and provide urgently needed relief to American families \nstruggling to make ends meet. Such an outcome could not be possible \nwithout the full support and leadership of my colleague and ranking \nmember, Senator Shelby. Every vote we have taken on this bill, from the \n19-to-2 vote in committee to yesterday's 80-to-13 vote on cloture, has \nbeen strongly bipartisan. The American people can take some pride in \nthis institution for our willingness to work together through these \ndifficult issues to get such a good outcome.\n  Finally, legislation of this magnitude takes hours and hours of staff \ntime to work out. There is never going to be an adequate expression for \nSenator Shelby and me to thank our staffs on the Banking, Housing and \nUrban Affairs Committee. They have been remarkable, beginning with the \nSenate staff director, Shawn Maher of my office, along with Jonathan \nMiller, Amy Friend, Roger Hollingsworth, Aaron Klein, Julie Chon, Jenn \nFogel-Bublick, Sarah Kline, Kate Szostak, and Drew Colbert; legislative \ncounsel Laura Ayoud and Rob Grant; Senator Shelby's staff--Bill Duhnke, \nMark Oesterle, Peggy Kuhn, Jim Johnson--and from Senator Reed's staff, \nKara Stein.\n  I thank Senator Harry Reid lastly, our majority leader, for his \ndiligence, patience, and determination. We have been through six \ncloture motions, delay after delay after delay by a handful of Senators \nwho were determined to do everything they could procedurally to stop us \nfrom getting to this moment. I thank immensely the majority leader, and \nhis staff as well, for their tireless support of this effort.\n  Again to my colleague from Alabama, I tip my hat. He is a good man to \nwork with, and I thank Senator Shelby.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the final \npassage of H.R. 3221, the legislation before us Senator Dodd and others \nhave been talking about. This legislation contains numerous provisions \nthat address a wide variety of issues associated with the housing \ncrisis. Many of them, in fact, were previously considered and passed by \nthe Senate in earlier versions of this bill right here on the floor. I \nwish to highlight a few of these important provisions now.\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, because he is an important \nplayer in this and a very important member of the Banking Committee, \nthis final package contains the same mortgage refinance program \nincluded in the earlier bills. This is a temporary, voluntary program \nwithin the Federal Housing Administration to back FHA-insured mortgages \nto distressed borrowers. It requires both mortgage lenders and \nborrowers to give up some of their financial interest in order to \nparticipate. The mortgage lender must agree to reduce the principal \nbalance of the loan, which we also call a ``haircut.'' The loan \nrefinancing arrangement must also bring the loan-to-value, LTV, ratio \non the new loan to no greater than 90 percent of the property's current \nappraised value. Borrowers must accept an equity-sharing requirement \nand forgo a percentage of any future profits on the sale of their \nhomes.\n  While I would prefer a completely free market solution, at least this \nprogram is designed to keep the taxpayer from bearing the cost, \nsomething I fought hard for in the Banking Committee. We have included \na separate funding stream that carries on in perpetuity to cover any \ncosts that may arise.\n  This package also includes measures which modernize the FHA program. \nBut by streamlining and expanding it, we hope the program can make \nsafe, fixed-rate mortgages more readily available to home buyers in the \nUnited States.\n  The legislation also includes a first-time home buyer tax credit of \n$7,500. I believe this should serve as an additional incentive to \npotential first-time buyers who may be waiting to purchase a home. The \ntax credit, combined with the greater availability of sustainable \nmortgages, should encourage buyers and help invigorate the housing \nmarket.\n  While I support this bill, there are a number of provisions in it \nwith which I am very concerned. If it had been my decision alone, I \nwould not have included them. While crafting legislation requires a \ngreat deal of give and take, one thing we should not compromise is our \nobligation to conduct continuing oversight of the programs we enact. \nOur responsibility to the taxpayers requires that we continue to \nclosely track the funds we are providing. We\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\nshould not tolerate the waste or misuse of a single tax dollar. It is \nmy hope that my friends who demanded additional spending are as \nenthusiastic about accounting for tax dollars as they are about \nspending them.\n  The bill coming back to us from the House does contain a set of \nentirely new and significant provisions. These provisions were added at \nthe request of Treasury Secretary Paulson, who determined that such \nmeasures were needed immediately as a result of the rapidly \ndeteriorating financial condition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  The legislation provides, as the Presiding Officer knows, the \nSecretary with temporary authority to purchase debt or equity of the \nGSEs when he, the Secretary, determines that such action is required to \nstabilize the financial system, protect taxpayers, and prevent \ndisruptions to the mortgage markets.\n  I recognize the unprecedented nature of the authority this \nlegislation provides to the Secretary of the Treasury. It is not \nsomething I agreed to without a great deal of consideration. In my \nestimation, however, the risks of not providing the authority \nultimately outweigh the risks of extending it. I said recently I feared \nwe were sitting on a financial powder keg. I think a lot of people \nrealize that.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, independently and together, represent \nconsiderable risks to the financial system. They each hold portfolios \nin excess of $700 billion. They each guarantee more than $2.5 trillion \nin mortgages. Their debt is held as regulatory capital by hundreds, if \nnot thousands, of American financial institutions. They serve as \ncounterparties on derivatives contracts with hundreds of firms, located \ndomestically and abroad, in amounts in the trillions of dollars.\n  For years, I have argued on the Banking Committee that these \nentities, due to their size and their reach in the financial markets, \npose a risk to the global financial system. I have also argued that \nsuch systemic risk requires the appropriate regulatory framework to \nprevent total financial calamity should one of the firms face a crisis.\n  Unfortunately, over the years, my calls for regulatory change were \nnot only unheeded but were rebuffed. Consequently, we were denied the \nchance to put a strong regulator in place when it could have made a \ndifference. But we are where we are today.\n  What has happened in the meantime seems to be the inevitable result \nof our failure to act. Indeed, when it became clear that both of the \nGSEs were on dangerous financial ground, it was no surprise to me that \nthe Secretary asked for such a substantial grant of power and \nauthority. Entities of such size and risk can only be helped by the \ncommitment of a massive amount of resources.\n  Upon the passage of this bill, such resources will be available, if \nnecessary. I hope they will not be necessary.\n  It is unfortunate it took the near collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac to convince a number of my colleagues that these entities do indeed \npose a systemic risk to the U.S. and global economies. Nevertheless, I \nam pleased this legislation now acknowledges and addresses that reality \nin statute by giving the Federal Reserve a role in advising the new \nregulator on risks to our financial system.\n  Although the Fed's role, as the Presiding Officer knows, is \ntemporary, it is now well established that the systemic risks the GSEs \npose are permanent. That debate is basically over. The only question \nnow is to whom the Congress assigns that responsibility in 18 months.\n  Since beginning the process of developing this legislation, I have \nbelieved the most important aspect of the bill is that it establishes a \nstrong independent regulator for the GSEs. Intervening events have \nfurther confirmed my belief.\n  We have provided this new regulator with enhanced powers and \nadditional authority so it has the tools necessary to ensure the GSEs \nare properly regulated. In doing so, I believe we are taking a very \nimportant step to prevent a repeat of the crises that enveloped Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac.\n  We find ourselves at the end of a long legislative road. The time for \nthe debate has ended, and it is now time to vote.\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senate has been in session all \nweek and held one vote Tuesday and two votes this morning--all \nprocedural votes. We have considered a bill this week concerning the \nnumber one issue in America today--the price of energy. Instead of \nallowing a full debate on the bill and, most importantly, a full \nopportunity to allow amendments to actually open up supplies and \nprovide Americans with options, the Democratic majority has closed \ndebate and prohibited any opportunity to amend the bill.\n  Now, the Senate Democratic Majority, after wasting an entire week, is \nengaged in a stunt to keep the Senate in session this weekend in some \nfalse demonstration they are serious about now addressing the issues \nthat concern Americans.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate is expected to vote on a massive housing package \nthat continues to grow as it has been amended going back and forth \nbetween the House and Senate. At this point, this bill proposes raising \nthe national debt limit to $10.6 trillion, an $800 billion increase. \nThe bill continues to contain $3.8 billion in community development \nblock grants to allow government entities to purchase foreclosed houses \nand creates an affordable housing fund which simply funnels funds to \ngroups like La Raza and ACORN. The legislation allows the FHA to take \non up to $300 billion in troubled mortgages into the taxpayer-backed \nprogram. In the bill, the value of an eligible loan under the FHA \nbailout is $550,000. The nationwide average value of a home is roughly \n$200,000. Someone with a $550,000 mortgage pays approximately $3,300 a \nmonth on housing alone, assuming a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at a \n6.35 percent interest rate. That comes to $39,600 per year in mortgage \npayments alone. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, average \nper capita income in the U.S. for 2007 was $38,600. Therefore, someone \nwith a $550,000 mortgage will be spending around $1,000 more on their \nhouse alone than an average American makes in an entire year.\n  The Congressional Budget Office warned that 35 percent of the loans \nrefinanced through the program will eventually default anyway. It is \nsimply bad policy to put taxpayers on the hook for borrowers who took \non more than they could afford and lenders who made bad loans to begin \nwith. It's entirely unacceptable to have the government put taxpayers \non the hook for someone who qualified for a loan more than two or three \ntimes what the average American can afford. The American taxpayer, and \ntaxpayers in Oklahoma, should not be put in the position where they are \nultimately responsible for the irresponsible decisions of others, and \nthey certainly should not be put on the hook for relatively well-off \nindividuals not to mention large companies who made poor financial \ndecisions.\n  I have previously opposed holding American taxpayers responsible for \nthe decisions of others, and will not attend the vote tomorrow since I \nwould vote ``no'' and request this statement appear in the Record prior \nto the vote tomorrow morning on the housing message from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nhighlight the tax piece of the housing bill that is before the Senate \ntoday. From the beginning, Chairman Baucus and I had a goal. We wanted \nto develop a bipartisan tax package that responded to the needs of \nAmericans facing difficulty in the housing market. Up until the last \nstage of this journey, in terms of the process, we met that goal. \nUnfortunately, at the last stage of the process, when the last House \namendment was developed, a bipartisan process became a Democrats-only \nprocess. That is unfortunate. It is not the way we have done business \nin the past. Hopefully, it won't become a pattern.\n  Mr. President, this bill, with one exception, complies with the \nSenate Republican conference principles on use of revenue raising \noffsets. This bill contains new tax policy. The new tax policy is \noffset with revenue raisers that a bipartisan majority in the Senate \nconsider improved tax policy. The main one would put in place a \nreporting regime on credit card payments to merchants. It is a Treasury \ntax gap proposal. The other significant revenue\n\n[[Page S7501]]\n\nraiser would clarify the home sale exclusion rules where second homes, \nusually vacation residences, are involved.\n  The one exception deals with a reversal of a sound international tax \npolicy reform. Back in 2004, Congress passed and President Bush signed \na major bipartisan business tax reform bill. The centerpiece proposal \nin the international tax reform area was a restoration of the Finance \nCommittee position from the 1986 Tax Reform Act on the treatment of \ninterest for the purposes of the foreign tax credit. It took us 18 \nyears to get back to the proper treatment of interest. This reform was \ndue to take effect a few months from now.\n  The proposal in the bill before us delays this important reform by 2 \nyears. It also cleverly haircuts the reform by 70 percent in the year \nthe reform would become effective. The House has offered this offset \nfor several bills. It is currently in play on the House extenders bill. \nIt is also in play on the House trade adjustment assistance, TAA, \nproposal. In the prior stages of this legislation, it is the only \noffset on which I have expressed opposition. I offered up other offsets \nwhich, in my view, represented good tax policy. They were rejected by \neither the House or the Senate. I respected the reservations of the \nHouse and Senate Democrats on revenue raisers they could not accept. My \nreservations with this policy were discarded at the final stage in the \nDemocrats-only negotiation.\n  The revenue grab trumps policy in this instance. The tax increase/\nspending increase pay-go imperative is more important than getting the \ntax policy right. The revenue raised is used mostly for new spending on \ncommunity block grants. So here we go again. Propose suspect tax policy \nto feed the insatiable appetite for new social spending.\n\n  Now, why am I so opposed to the worldwide interest revenue raiser? My \nopposition rests in the bad tax policy this proposal represents.\n  Starting in 2009, the interest allocation reform will lower the \nchance of double tax that arises under current law from the artificial \nallocation of interest expense to foreign income, even when the debt is \nincurred to fund domestic investment. The current rules actually \npenalize domestic manufacturers that compete in global markets by \nmaking it more likely they will be double-taxed on their foreign \nincome.\n  Several companies have spoken to my staff about the negative \nramifications this delay will have on them. These companies are just \nstarting to grow their businesses beyond the U.S. borders. The delay of \nthis important international reform will make it more costly for these \ncompanies to expand into these markets. If these companies cannot grow \nbeyond the domestic economy, they will be unable to compete in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  It is long been said that the American dream is to own your home. \nUnfortunately, the subprime crisis has turned that dream into a \nnightmare for many Americans. The tax relief in this bill aims to \nrestore the American dream. This package goes some distance to restore \nthat dream, but in the journey this legislation took a wrong turn. The \nbill goes backward on a bipartisan international tax reform. That is a \nsorry development. It does not bode well for future efforts at \ninternational tax reform. How reliable are proposals from the other \nside if they are reversed a couple of years later when the pay-go beast \ngrowls for more revenue for more spending?\n  Mr President, there are a lot of good proposals in the tax policy \nportion of the bill. Unfortunately, in the late stages of its \ndevelopment, it took on a more partisan character.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, T.S. Eliot wrote: ``Home is where one \nstarts from.''\n  And that is true of the tax provisions of this housing bill, the \nHousing Assistance Tax Act. They start with home. They start with \ntrying to help hardworking American families to stay in their homes. \nThat's where we start.\n  The tax provisions in this bill provide housing relief to homeowners \nand stability to the housing market at a critical time.\n  For most Americans, their home is their biggest asset. Homes \nrepresent about a third of household net worth.\n  But housing is losing its role as a source of family wealth creation. \nNationally, since April of last year, home prices have fallen by more \nthan 15 percent. This decline in home values is the largest that \nAmerica has seen in 20 years.\n  In addition to declining home values, homes sales have slowed, as \nforeclosures have risen. As of May 2008, sales of new single-family \nhouses were about 40 percent below where they were a year before.\n  Foreclosures are at their highest rate in at last three decades. In \nJune, 1 in every 501 households was at some stage in the foreclosure \nprocess. Since January 2005, bank seizures have risen 171 percent. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that 2.8 million foreclosure \nproceedings could be initiated in the next 4 years. About 1.1 million \nof these homeowners will ultimately lose their homes through \nforeclosure.\n  Behind every foreclosed property, there is a family. There is a \nfamily losing its home and there is a community left behind.\n  Another part of our housing story is the crisis in the housing \nfinance system. The Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly \nknown as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, \nknown as Freddie Mac, are government sponsored enterprises, or GSEs. \nThese GSEs provide critical financial support to the housing market.\n  These GSEs are market-makers in America's secondary mortgage market. \nThey help to replenish the money supply for mortgages. They help to \nmake money available for housing purchases. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nown or guarantee about half of America's $12 trillion mortgage market. \nThey support about 70 percent of new mortgages.\n  The subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing home value declines have hit \nthese GSEs particularly hard. Freddie Mac lost 73 percent of its value \nin New York trading this year. Fannie Mae lost 66 percent. Combined \nlosses at the companies could run into the billions of dollars. These \nfinancial troubles have eroded confidence in the housing finance \nsystem. This threatens to destabilize the mortgage market vital to \nordinary homebuyers.\n  These are only some of the housing challenges facing American \nfamilies today. Congress and the Senate Finance Committee, which I \nchair, recognize the importance of these matters. That is why we have \ntaken action to alleviate the negative consequences of the housing \ncrisis.\n  In the bill before us, we curb the rising costs of owning a home by \ncreating a nonitemizer property tax deduction for tax year 2008. \nCurrently, homeowners are allowed to deduct local real estate property \ntaxes from their Federal tax returns only if they itemize. According to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, more than 28 million taxpayers pay \nproperty taxes, but do not itemize. This bill would provide millions of \nhome owners who claim the standard deduction with an additional \nstandard deduction for state and local real property taxes. The maximum \namount that may be claimed under this provision is $500 for an \nindividual, or $1,000 for joint filers.\n  The nonitemizer deduction would benefit people with low incomes. It \nwould benefit those who have already paid off their mortgages and thus \ndo not have a reason to itemize. It would benefit young families just \nstarting out. And it would benefit senior citizens. The Congressional \nResearch Service estimates that about 130,000 property-tax payers could \nbenefit in my home State of Montana alone.\n  This bill would help to reduce the excess supply in the housing \nmarket due to declining home values and rising foreclosures. It would \ndo so with a refundable first-time home buyer credit. The bill would \ngive first-time home buyers a refundable tax credit equivalent to an \ninterest free loan of 10 percent of the purchase price of a home, up to \n$7,500.\n  The provision applies to homes purchased between April 9, 2008, and \nJuly 1, 2009. Taxpayers receiving this tax credit would need to repay \nto the government any amount received under this provision. They could \npay it back in equal installments over 15 years. The credit begins to \nphase out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income in excess of \n$75,000, or $150,000 in the case of a joint return.\n  This first-time home buyer credit will provide significant, immediate\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\nstimulus to get potential homebuyers into the market and into homes. \nAnd it will help to get homebuilders, and the housing industry, back on \ntrack. The short-term nature of this credit is also critical because it \nwould avoid over-subsidizing the housing industry in the long run.\n  This bill would help current homeowners to avoid foreclosures with a \ntemporary increase in mortgage revenue bonds. Under current law, there \nis a national limit on the annual amount of tax-exempt housing bonds \nthat each state may issue. Many States have reached their limit. This \nbill would increase this national limit in 2008 to allow for the \nissuance of an additional $11 billion of tax-exempt bonds to provide \nloans to first-time home buyers and to finance the construction of low-\nincome rental housing.\n  The bill would also temporarily allow qualified mortgage revenue \nbonds to be used to refinance certain subprime loans. Mortgage revenue \nbonds are a form of tax-exempt bond issued by States to help provide \nfinancing to first-time home buyers. These bonds would result in \nmortgages with lower interest rates than conventional loans, making \nthem more affordable for lower income borrowers.\n  This bill would encourage the rebuilding of the low-income housing \nindustry with a temporary increase in low-income housing tax credits. \nThe low-income housing tax credit program helps finance the development \nof affordable rental housing for low-income families. The credit is the \nlargest source of Federal funding for the construction and \nrehabilitation of affordable rental housing.\n  Under current law, there is a State-by-State limit on the annual \namount of Federal low-income housing tax credits. This limitation is \ncurrently set at $2 for each person living in the State. States with \nsmall populations are provided with a special set-aside. Our proposal \nwould increase this limitation in 2008 and 2009 by an additional 20 \ncents for each person residing in the State. And it would increase the \nsmall State set-aside by 10 percent.\n  This low-income housing tax credit enhancement could help to meet the \nneeds of low-income families who have been displaced from their homes \nby foreclosure. More generally, the credit can assist low-income \nneighborhoods that have shortages of moderately priced rental housing. \nIt could provide a boost to some distressed communities.\n  This bill also includes reforms to real estate investment trust, or \nREITs. REITs can be corporations, trusts, or associations. They invest \nin real estate. And they elect to be taxed under a special tax regime, \ninstead of under the tax rules for corporations.\n  REITs are subject to complex rules that can limit the ability of \nthese businesses to adjust to changing market conditions and to manage \nrisk. The bill would liberalize these rules by clarifying that REITs \ncan earn foreign currency income associated with real estate \nactivities. The bill would increase the permissible size of REIT \ninvestments in taxable REIT subsidiaries. The bill would modify the \nREIT safe harbor for dealer sales. And the bill would extend the \nspecial rules for lodging facilities to health care facilities.\n  My colleagues and I have worked long and hard to craft this response \nto our nation's pressing housing woes in a fiscally responsible way. \nThis bill has achieved bipartisan and administration support. I believe \nthat this bill will strengthen homes at a time when help is needed. The \ntax provisions work to bring stability to the housing marketplace for \nevery homeowner. I am proud to be a part of this effort.\n  This bill starts with the American home. It starts with trying to \nhelp hardworking American families to stay in their homes. Let's finish \nthis bill and start helping to protect those homes today.\n  Finally, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rangel and I have asked \nthe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available to the \npublic a technical explanation of the bill. The technical explanation \nexpresses the committee's understanding and legislative intent behind \nthis important legislation. It is available on the joint committee's \nWeb site at www.jct.gov.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of \n2008 will meaningfully address the housing crisis in our country. I \nappreciate the leadership of my friends, Banking Committee Chairman \nDodd, and Ranking Member Shelby, in developing this vital legislation. \nToo many families are losing their homes. Not enough working families \nhave access to affordable housing options or are able to secure credit. \nThis legislation protects homeowners across the country, prevents \nforeclosures, increases the supply of affordable housing, and assists \nour Nation's veterans.\n  This act will modernize and improve the Federal Housing \nAdministration, FHA, to provide homeowners with additional access to \nfixed rate mortgages. Additional resources will be provided by this \nlegislation for housing counseling to assist homeowners in finding \nsolutions to their difficult situations. Mortgage disclosures will be \nmade more meaningful to consumers by this act.\n  My home State of Hawaii has a severe shortage of affordable housing. \nHawaii ranks as the most expensive housing jurisdiction in the country \naccording to the National Low Income Housing Coalition's 2007-2008 Out \nof Reach report. This bill creates an affordable housing trust fund and \na capital magnet fund to increase access to affordable housing. These \nadditional resources help build and preserve affordable housing units \nfor working families.\n  I also appreciate the inclusion of provisions that would assist \nveterans and servicemembers during this housing crisis. I especially \nappreciate the inclusion of a provision that is derived from my \nlegislation, S. 2768. This corrects an oversight in the Economic \nStimulus Act of 2008 and extends the temporary home loan guaranty \nincrease to veterans so that more of them can realize the dream of home \nownership.\n  The VA Home Loan Guaranty was part of the original G.I. bill in 1944. \nIt provided veterans with a federally guaranteed home loan with no down \npayment. This landmark legislation made the dream of home ownership a \nreality for millions of returning veterans. The amount of the home loan \nguaranty was last adjusted by the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of \n2004. The maximum guaranty amount was increased to 25 percent of the \nFreddie Mac conforming loan limit determined under section 305(a)(2) of \nthe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act for a single family \nresidence, as adjusted for the year involved. Using that formula, \nbecause the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit for a single family \nresidence in 2008 is $417,000, VA will guarantee a veteran's loan up to \n$104,250. This guaranty exempts homeowners from having to make a down \npayment or secure private mortgage insurance.\n  The newly enacted Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, however, temporarily \nreset the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA home loan guarantee limits \nto 125 percent of metropolitan-area median home prices, without \nreference to the VA home loan program. This had the effect of raising \nthe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac limits to nearly $730,000, in the \nhighest cost areas, while leaving the VA limit of $417,000 in place. \nThis important group of Americans may benefit from an increased home \nloan guaranty in this time of economic uncertainty. I am hopeful that \nthis increased guaranty limit will assist those veterans and \nservicemembers who are struggling to purchase a home during this time.\n  The bill also authorizes a financial education and prospective \nhomeownership counseling demonstration program, which I helped develop \nwith my colleagues Senators Menendez, Carper, and Dodd. This program \nwill help working families prepare for purchasing a home. We must \nprovide greater financial literacy opportunities to empower families to \nmake better informed financial decisions. I will work with my \ncolleagues to secure the necessary funding so that the Department of \nthe Treasury can effectively implement and evaluate this demonstration \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, this essential legislation helps families remain in \ntheir homes, expands access to credit, creates more affordable housing \nopportunities, provides much needed improvements to veterans' housing \nbenefits, and authorizes a prospective home ownership counseling \nfinancial literacy demonstration program.\n\n[[Page S7503]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today with good news and bad \nnews for the American people. The good news is that the Senate is \npoised to pass legislation providing badly needed relief for millions \nof American families in their darkest days: families who stand on the \nverge of losing their homes. The bad news is that this critical \nassistance will come only after long, needless delay due to obstruction \nand political gamesmanship by some members of the Republican minority \nin this body.\n  For too many people in this country, times are as tough as they have \never been. With millions of Americans mired in the subprime loan \ncrisis, families across the nation stand just one lost job, one medical \nexpense, one credit card penalty fee, or one car accident away from \nlosing the roof over their heads. Last month, over a quarter of a \nmillion homes received a foreclosure notice--that's up over 50 percent \nfrom the same period last year. In my State of Rhode Island alone, a \nState with a population of around 1 million people, over 3,800 homes \nwere in foreclosure in the first quarter of this year alone.\n  The collapse of the subprime mortgage market has left financial \ninstitutions in ruins, left families struggling, and left our economy \nvulnerable to even more widespread damage, especially as the cost of \nenergy rises. For the first time in generations, Americans now face the \nprospect of leaving to their children a life with fewer opportunities \nand greater uncertainty than we inherited from our parents. Our \nchildren deserve better.\n  Democrats in the Senate and the House of Representatives have worked \nwith Republicans to craft a bipartisan measure that will offer the \nassistance millions of families need to weather the housing crisis \ntoday and the reforms necessary to prevent a future housing market \nimplosion. This legislation would authorize the Federal Housing \nAdministration to provide up to $300 billion in mortgages to distressed \nhomeowners. This program will help over a million homeowners replace \ntheir subprime high-rate, low-quality mortgages with quality loans at \nreasonable rates. In addition, our housing rescue measure would \nmodernize the FHA to permit it to insure a greater number of quality \nmortgages. For many homeowners and homebuyers, FHA-backed mortgages are \nthe only alternative to the subprime market.\n  The housing rescue package also includes $150 million for foreclosure \nprevention counseling and $4 billion for communities to buy and restore \nforeclosed and abandoned properties. Moreover, the bill mandates new \ndisclosure requirements to ensure that future homebuyers are not \ntricked into mortgages with rates that can change unexpectedly.\n  This disclosure provision, like so many other elements of this \nlandmark housing bill, was authored by my senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Jack Reed. Senator Reed, who serves on the Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs Committee, has been among the leading voices \nin the Senate on this issue, working to combat predatory lending and \nother tactics that disadvantage consumers. Senator Reed also fought to \nensure that this housing bill includes an affordable housing trust fund \nthat will produce and rehabilitate homes for low-income families, many \nof whom have been priced out of the housing market. It will literally \nbring thousands of families out from the cold, and I congratulate \nSenator Reed for his tireless efforts to see this important assistance \nwritten into the law of the land.\n  I am gratified that we are able to finally pass this critical \nlegislation, and that President Bush has finally come to his senses and \ndropped his longstanding veto threat. This bill represents long-needed \nand long-awaited relief for American homeowners, and I urge President \nBush to sign this legislation without delay as soon as it reaches his \ndesk.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote for this final version of \nthe housing package, but I do so with significant concerns about the \nnew provisions added to the housing bill which bail out the mortgage \ngiants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I certainly agree that these two \nprivate corporations play a critical role in the housing market. \nIndeed, there are powerful arguments that they are too important to let \nfail, but I regret that the proposed bailout failed to include \nprovisions to more adequately protect taxpayers and to better ensure \nthe behavior of Fannie and Freddie will not be repeated.\n  Let's not fool ourselves. Fannie and Freddie are not innocent victims \nin this financial crisis. They were key actors in creating the mess we \nhave been asked to clean up. Instead of bringing their considerable \nhousing expertise to bear by reining in inappropriate home loans, as \neconomist Dean Baker has noted Fannie and Freddie ``continued to make \nloans in bubble-inflated markets, thereby supporting purchases at \nbubble-inflated prices.''\n  Well the bubble has burst and Congress has been handed the mop. \nCertainly there will be imperfections in any package we enact to \naddress the collapse in the housing market. In attempting to help those \nwho truly were innocent victims we are likely to benefit some who we \nwould otherwise prefer to be fully subject to the discipline of the \nmarketplace. That may be unavoidable. But this new Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac bailout provision isn't an example of providing unintended \nbenefits through secondhand financial effects; this is a direct bailout \nof bad actors. The companies' shareholders and the highly paid \nexecutives they employ are being held harmless for their ruinously \ndamaging decisions.\n  The administration and other proponents of these new authorities have \ninsisted that they may not have to be used. I very much hope that will \nbe the case, and that taxpayers will not end up having to bail out \nthese two private corporations.\n  This legislation does create a new, independent regulator for Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. This regulator will be authorized to exercise more \noversight of Fannie and Freddie, modify Fannie and Freddie's capital \nstandards, and take other actions to ensure the safety and soundness of \nFannie and Freddie. I hope this new regulator will ensure additional \nreforms of Fannie and Freddie in order to better protect American \nhomeowners and taxpayers in the future.\n  There are provisions of this bill I strongly support and I am pleased \nthat these provisions will be signed into law shortly. This legislation \ncreates a national housing trust fund which will provide funding to \nproduce, preserve, and rehabilitate affordable housing throughout the \ncountry. I have heard from housing advocates throughout my State of \nWisconsin about the need to create such a housing trust fund and in \nresponse to that feedback, I introduced the Affordable Housing \nExpansion and Public Safety Act of 2007. My legislation called on \nCongress to create a national affordable housing trust fund and the \nbill we are about to pass takes the first steps toward creating such a \ntrust fund. Hundreds of housing trust funds have been created around \nthe country at the State and local level, including recently in the \ncity of Milwaukee. The enactment of this national housing trust fund \nwill help to support the important work of providing affordable housing \nto American families in Wisconsin and throughout the country. Safe and \nsecure affordable housing is becoming harder to obtain for our most \nvulnerable families and this housing trust fund takes a significant \nstep toward making such affordable housing easier to obtain.\n  I also support the provision of almost $4 billion in emergency CDBG \nfunding to states and local governments to help purchase abandoned or \nforeclosed upon homes in our Nation's local communities. This funding, \nwhich is offset, will help local communities improve the quality of \nneighborhoods that have been hard hit by foreclosures. I have heard \nfrom local government officials in communities like Milwaukee, West \nAllis, and Madison about the importance of addressing the increased \nnumber of foreclosed upon homes in Wisconsin's communities. While \nWisconsin has not been as hard hit as other States, foreclosures are on \nthe rise in the State and in some parts of Wisconsin they are \nconcentrated into certain census tracks. One foreclosure in a \nneighborhood is bad enough, but when you start to have four or five \nforeclosures in one neighborhood, this can lead to other negative \nconsequences like increased crime, vandalism, and theft. Providing \nStates and local governments with the resources to buy\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\nand rehabilitate these properties will go a long way to improving our \nNation's neighborhoods and the livelihood of hard working families.\n  This legislation is far from perfect, but in the end I will support \nthis measure despite this new bailout provision. The potential collapse \nof these two mortgage giants poses too great a risk to the housing \nmarket, and with it to millions of families whose home value represents \na significant portion of their life savings. But I regret the authors \nof this provision--both in the administration and here in Congress--did \nnot also include provisions to better protect taxpayers and to ensure \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not repeat their disastrous mistakes of \nthe past few years. I very much hope such reforms will be a high \npriority for a new Congress and a new President next year.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today, the Senate will pass the now-infamous \nhousing package for the last time. Each time this legislation has come \nbefore the Senate, it has been loaded with more taxes, more spending, \nand more liability for American taxpayers. As much as I oppose this \nlegislation, I am relieved it is not headed back to the House so \nMembers could add even more tax-and-spend provisions. This bill is a \nperfect example of how Congress can take a problem and make it worse. \nIf it is worth reacting to, it is worth overreacting to in the Senate. \nUnfortunately, Americans will be paying for this particular \noverreaction for years to come, and the bill's implications will be \nmuch larger than we can even imagine now.\n  The first way Americans will be on the hook is through the HOPE for \nHomeowners Act contained in this bill. This program will create a $300 \nbillion Federal loan guarantee program to bail out bad real estate \ninvestments and banks that made interest-only, no documentation loans. \nHow will they do this? By shifting 100 percent of the liability of \nforeclosure onto the American taxpayer. Taxpayers could be paying for \nthis provision for the next 30 years.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that this $300 \nbillion program will only cost $68 billion. The CBO claims that few \nbanks will use the program because it requires them to take a 10-\npercent cut in the mortgage principal. But to quote a Wall Street \nJournal article from July 24, 2008:\n\n       If no one needs the program, then why is it there? If \n     lenders do take advantage, they are bound to dump their worst \n     loans on the feds . . . the FHA guarantee will either be \n     superfluous or more expensive than we are led to believe.\n\n  I would like to submit the full article for the Record.\n  Second, this legislation taxes the government-sponsored enterprises \nnearly $1 billion per year over the next 10 years to cover initial \nlosses stemming from this bailout, and in later years, to fund liberal \nactivist groups posing as affordable housing advocates. This tax will \nbe levied on companies struggling to stay solvent and keep our markets \noperational. Such a theory could only fly in Washington: tax a company \nin order to save it.\n  While Congress is taxing these companies into insolvency, it is their \ninvestors who are paying the price. Over the past month, concerns about \npassing this bloated bailout and tax bill have contributed to a drop of \n80 percent in the stock price of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Americans' \npension funds, 401(k) accounts, and other investments have taken a huge \nhit because Congress wants to micromanage the housing market. To date, \nCongress's action has only led to more market volatility and stock \nselloffs as investors wait to hear the next bad idea devised by \nCongress to fix our Nation's housing market.\n\n  I, along with several other Senators, have sent a letter to \nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Cox asking him to comment \non the impact this proposal will have on investors. As the agency \ncharged with the mission of investor protection, I am very interested \nto hear the Chairman's opinion about this special tax Congress will \nlevy on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Investors should not have to \ncalculate the risks of Congress taxing their investments to death.\n  Finally, as if American taxpayers weren't squeezed enough, a recent \nproposal by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson would allow the Federal \nGovernment to use taxpayer money to purchase Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae \nstock. This is potentially the biggest threat to taxpayers in the \nentire legislation because no one knows how much this will cost. I \nlistened as Secretary Paulson urged the Senate Banking Committee to \nprovide his agency with an unlimited authorization to buy stock. This \nis a blank check to the Federal Government, written against the \ntaxpayer's account. Shockingly, the House voted for this proposal on \nJuly 23, 2008, and the Senate voted for it today.\n  The same Wall Street Journal article published on July 24 noted that \nthe Paulson proposal:\n\n     could cost $100 billion, or it could cost nothing. So the CBO \n     threw a dart at the wall and assigned a $25 billion price tag \n     to the Freddie and Fannie bailout.\n\n  It is astounding how easily some Members of Congress can vote to give \naway taxpayer's money by the billions, especially when we do not even \nknow how many billions of dollars we are giving away.\n  I continue to urge, in the strongest sense, for Members to vote \nagainst this legislation. Congress had the opportunity to pass sensible \nreform for the government-sponsored enterprises years ago that would \nhave avoided this mess. Unfortunately, some Members have decided \ninstead to fund mortgage bank bailouts, allow taxpayer money giveaways, \nand erode the public's confidence in our markets even more than it \nalready has. A vote against this legislation is a vote to protect \nAmerican taxpayers and to prevent a further erosion of confidence in \nthe American marketplace.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the sluggish national economy and the \nrising cost of housing is a one-two punch that is keeping affordable \nhousing out of the reach of too many Vermont families. It is important \nthat during these times of economic hardship we do more--not less--to \nhelp struggling families make ends meet. I am pleased that today, after \nmonths of delay, the Senate is set to act on final passage of the \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act, H.R. 3221, a responsible bill to \nstrengthen our economy, restore confidence in our financial markets, \nand provide urgently needed relief to American families who are \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  Under the Bush administration's watch, unregulated mortgage \noriginators were given financial incentives to sell risky, \nunaffordable, subprime mortgages to vulnerable borrowers. As these \nadjustable rate mortgages reset to higher rates, the number of families \nunable to afford their payments and threatened with foreclosure is \nskyrocketing.\n  Foreclosures have climbed in my home State of Vermont and, while \nsubprime mortgages are not the largest driver, the mortgage foreclosure \ncrisis will still have severe costs for homeowners, not only in direct \ncosts but in its effect on home values and declining property taxes. \nAccording to the State of Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance, \nSecurities and Health Care Administration, for the first quarter of \n2008, well over 400 new foreclosures have been filed in Vermont, which \nis a 30-percent increase over those filed in last year's first quarter. \nIf the current trend holds, Vermont is facing about 1600 this year.\n  Several urgent housing-related issues have become prominent already \nthis year. The most visible issue is the prevalence of subprime loans \nand growing mortgage default and foreclosure rates, affecting an \nestimated 2 million homeowners. Congress has responded with a reform \npackage to change the way in which the lending and home-buying industry \nis regulated and to assist borrowers who are facing default and \nforeclosure. These proposals address several of the problems spawned by \na housing foreclosure crisis that has threatened America's hard-working \nfamilies, their communities, and our local and national economies.\n  I recognize that this bill is not a perfect solution. However, I also \nbelieve the housing crisis and market instability demand action. Ending \nthe foreclosure crisis is vital to the American economic recovery. This \npackage will help prevent another crisis of this magnitude, stop \nforeclosures before they begin, and preserve for future generations the \nAmerican dream of home ownership.\n  Homes that have been foreclosed upon and are sitting unoccupied lead \nto\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\ndeclines in neighboring house values, increased crime, and significant \ndisinvestment. To ensure that communities can mitigate these harmful \neffects of foreclosures, the package provides $3.92 billion to \ncommunities hit hard by foreclosures and delinquencies. These \nsupplemental community development block grant, or CDBG, funds will be \nused to purchase foreclosed homes, at a discount, and rehabilitate or \nredevelop the homes to stabilize neighborhoods and stem the significant \nlosses in house values of neighboring homes.\n  It has always been a priority of mine to help make housing more \naffordable, and I have worked over the years--as I will do in years to \ncome--to bring the resources into Vermont to make that happen. That is \nwhy I worked with Senators Sanders, Baucus, Snowe, Thune, and \nWhitehouse to successfully include a provision that applies an all-\nState minimum of 0.50 percent to the supplemental CDBG funds provided \nto States to buy up and rehabilitate foreclosed properties to ensure \nsmaller States like Vermont receive a portion of the help. This will \nresult in roughly $20 million coming to Vermont to help with \nforeclosures in our communities.\n  Now that the President has lifted his veto threat and after months of \ndelay tactics by the minority, the Senate is ready to pass a \nresponsible bill to address the worsening foreclosure crisis, which is \nthe root of the broader economic crisis. By helping Americans keep \ntheir homes and their home equity, we are restoring stability to the \nhousing market and helping businesses and communities hurt by this \ncrisis not only recover, but also create new jobs. The Housing and \nEconomic Recovery Act will help prevent another crisis of this \nmagnitude, stop foreclosures before they begin, and preserve home \nownership for future generations.\n  Each day this bill has been stalled, nearly 8,500 new families filed \nfor foreclosure--on top of already accelerating foreclosure filings \nthat were 53 percent higher in June than in the same month last year. \nThe time for delay has passed. It is about time that we send this bill \nto the President for his signature into law so we may begin to deliver \nsolutions that are in the best interest of the American taxpayer and \nthe U.S. economy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the minority has \n2 minutes left; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, do you intend to use \nthat?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will yield it back.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on our side, it is my understanding we have \n1 minute, plus my time; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fifty-four seconds, plus the \nleader's time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer. No, he doesn't want it. OK. That is unusual.\n  I wish I had the words to express adequately my appreciation for the \nwork done by the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of \nthe committee. Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby have done a remarkable \njob under tremendously difficult circumstances to get where we are \ntoday. They were for this piece of legislation before Fannie and \nFreddie got into big trouble because they knew and they could see the \nproblems with the housing industry. The fact that Fannie and Freddie \ngot into trouble only made it more imperative that these two managers \nof this legislation move forward more rapidly. They have overcome \ntremendous obstacles.\n  We have had seven cloture votes on this housing bill. I do not know \nif in the history of this country we have ever had a single piece of \nlegislation with that many cloture votes, but we had them on this bill. \nThese two very fine legislators--one from the State of Connecticut, \nwith a totally different economy, different political base than that of \nthe State of Alabama--worked together for the good of the American \npeople. I so admire and appreciate the work they have done under, I \nrepeat, very difficult circumstances.\n  For most Americans, yesterday, Friday, was an ordinary summer Friday. \nBut for about 8,500 families, it was a terrible day because, when they \ngot their mail, there was a foreclosure notice or, when they opened \ntheir door, they found on their door a notice of foreclosure or, when \nthey opened the door on Friday, there was someone at the door serving \npapers on them, moving the legal process forward--foreclosure notices. \nBut they joined, yesterday, 8,500 who received their notice the day \nbefore and the day before that and the day before that and the day \nbefore that and the day before that.\n  During the process of this legislation moving forward, that we should \nhave passed fairly quickly--within, at the most, a week--hundreds of \nthousands of people received foreclosure notices. Well, 8,500 families \nwill not receive their foreclosure notices today or tomorrow but only \nbecause the courthouses are closed for the weekend. On Monday, the \ndrumbeat of foreclosure will continue.\n  In Nevada, 1 out of every 43 families who have a home now have their \nhome in foreclosure. It is almost the same in Arizona and almost the \nsame in California and almost the same in Florida. There are only two \nStates in the country that do not have the problem, one of which is the \nState of Alabama.\n  But for families who face each day with trepidation because of a \nforeclosure concern they have, hoping a notice has not arrived, in some \nfashion--but knowing it may soon--a foreclosure notice is something \nthat is a terrible day in their lives. But today, this Senate will \ndeliver some rare and much-needed good news for people who own homes \nthroughout America. Not only will it help those people who own homes \nbut neighborhoods, communities, States, local governments and servicers \nand lenders.\n  We are on the verge of passing a bipartisan housing bill that will \nhelp rebuild communities, safeguard future housing meltdowns, and, most \nimportantly, help at-risk families keep their homes. Because of the \nwork in this legislation dealing with Fannie and Freddie, the financial \ncommunity in America will be stabilized.\n  It has taken far too long to reach this point where we are today. We \nhave talked about that. The housing bill was introduced in February and \nwork began in the fall of last year.\n  Now, I have already talked about Senators Dodd and Shelby. During the \nprocess of working to get legislation that they thought was appropriate \nto bring before this body, they both received pressure from their \nrespective caucuses, from editorials: Why aren't they doing something \nmore rapidly? They wanted to bring something to the Senate that would \npass. They wanted to work with the House on something that would pass \nboth bodies and be signed by the President. So, again, I underscore the \ngreat legislative work these two gentlemen did.\n  Not only have we had seven cloture votes but we have had Presidential \nveto threats. Thank goodness those threats have been withdrawn.\n  As some Republicans have continued to stall, families have continued \nto lose their homes. And note I said ``some'' Republicans, not all \nRepublicans in the Senate. But today, at long last, a ray of hope--a \nchance to turn the page on the housing crisis and begin a new chapter \nthat gives more families a chance at the American dream of responsible \nhome ownership.\n  Now, we are going to move--after we complete legislation on this \nhousing bill--to LIHEAP. We would not have the opportunity to vote on \nthis most important measure, this energy legislation, but for one \nSenator, a Senator from the sparsely populated State of Vermont, Mr. \nBernard Sanders. It is because of his advocacy for months and months \nthat we are going to have an opportunity to vote on this. He has worked \non legislation. We have Republicans who support and have agreed to \nsupport his legislation. We are going to move to proceed to that.\n  Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle have expended \ncountless hours of floor time and many barrels of ink talking about the \nneed to do something about energy prices. While they have endlessly \ntalked, the Democrats have been proposing comprehensive solutions.\n  Yesterday, Republicans refused to join us in a bill to stem the \nexcessive\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\nspeculation by Wall Street traders who artificially bid up the price of \noil for their own profit. That was a plan Republicans had claimed to \nsupport previously. It was part of their legislation. When it came time \nto take action, the monied interests of this country backed the \nRepublicans down from doing the right thing.\n  When we offered the Republicans a vote on the very thing they claim \nto want more than anything--offshore drilling--they passed on that. \nThey said no.\n\n  Now, Democrats are proposing improvements to the LIHEAP program. This \nis yet another bipartisan opportunity to help Americans cope with our \nenergy crisis.\n  This is something that is a crisis that has been here for a while. \nListen to what George Bush, the President of the United States, said. \nThis is a quote:\n\n       First and foremost, we've got to make sure we fully fund \n     LIHEAP, which is a way to help low-income folks, particularly \n     here in the East, pay for their high--high--fuel bills.\n\n  A direct quote from President Bush.\n  This legislation assists senior citizens, low-income families, and \nthose who are disabled to afford to heat their homes in winter and cool \nthem during excessive periods of heat in summer.\n  There are not many States like Nevada. In the southern part of the \nState, in Laughlin, NV, it is not unusual for the temperature to hit \n120 degrees. In the northern part of the State, in places such as \nOwyhee, it is the coldest place in the Nation on many occasions. It is \nnot unusual at all for it to be 20 degrees below zero. These ranges in \ntemperature indicate that if you are old, if you are disabled, if you \nare poor, you have trouble paying for the fuel costs to cool your home \nto survive or to heat your home to survive. People who have \ntemperatures above 100 degrees know how important it is to keep their \nhome cool, and people who are freezing know how important it is to keep \ntheir house warm.\n  Since 2001, Americans are paying three times as much for heating oil \nand twice as much for propane. As these energy costs have skyrocketed, \nthese LIHEAP proposals we have talked about have been hamstrung. These \nprograms are not there to provide the necessary assistance. As the \nwinter months are growing near, this problem will exacerbate. It will \ngrow worse.\n  This legislation has rightly earned bipartisan support, as I have \ntalked about, with at least a dozen Republican cosponsors of the \nSenator's legislation. It is regrettable Republicans could force us to \nwaste valuable hours on a cloture vote on proceeding to this \nlegislation--even allowing us to debate the matter. It is unimaginable \nRepublicans might choose to block us from passing this worthy \nlegislation for which President Bush said: ``First and foremost, we've \ngot to make sure we fully fund LIHEAP, which is a way to help low-\nincome folks, particularly here in the East, pay for their high--high--\nfuel [costs].''\n  Well, it is not only folks in the East. It is folks in the West and \nMidwest and all over this country. I hope they will not stall this. \nThey say they want to legislate on energy. They had the chance \nyesterday. They did not take that. They have a chance again today. We \nwill soon see what they choose to do.\n  If Republicans choose to join us in passing LIHEAP, we will welcome \ntheir votes, certainly, with open arms. But if they choose to block \nthis legislation, they will have to shoulder the burden of millions of \nlow-income families, senior citizens, and those with disabilities who \nare struggling and suffering to pay their ever-rising energy bills.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the vote now occur that is \nscheduled for 11 o'clock.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to concur in the amendment of the \nHouse to the Senate amendment to the House amendments to the Senate \namendment to the bill H.R. 3221.\n  Mr. REID.

Within an hour or so after the final vote, all of the \noffices will know what will happen either tomorrow and/or Monday. We \nwill have more definite information after the next vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/26/senate-section/article/S7506-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7506-S7509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WARM IN WINTER AND COOL IN SUMMER ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture----\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know everybody is anxious to leave. \nVery briefly, voting for cloture on this bill will take us off of the \nsingle most important issue in America.\n  The American people are clamoring for legislation that brings down \ngas prices, and our leadership friends on the other side want to \ndismiss this issue instead of taking it head on with bold action.\n  We want to address the issue of gas prices, and the important thing \nis to stay on the subject. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republicans had every opportunity, for \nmore than a month now, to talk about energy and to vote on energy. They \nturned that down. On speculation, they had an opportunity to do that. \nEven though it was part of their proposal, they dropped it. They had an \nopportunity to vote on drilling. They dropped that. They had an \nopportunity to vote on oil shale exploration. They would not do that. \nThey said nuclear power was an immediate need of the\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\nAmerican people. They would not vote on that.\n  Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are being--it is \nbeing recommended by their leader to vote against LIHEAP. This issue is \nimportant to old people, disabled people, and poor people. There are 12 \nor 13 Republican sponsors of the legislation. So I say to my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, go ahead and vote against your best \ninterests, I guess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, of course, none of what the majority \nleader listed has been offered. Not a single consent to allow any of \nthose votes has been offered. That is the point of this vote.\n  In order to deal with energy--the No. 1 issue in America--we need to \nhave an open process, such as on the Energy bills of 2007 and 2005, \nwhere all of the amendments relative and important to this issue have a \nchance to be considered here in the Senate. None of that has been \noffered.\n  The only way it will be offered is to vote ``no'' on getting off this \nsubject and staying on the No. 1 subject in America, open up the \nprocess, and allow amendments on all of the issues the majority leader \nreferred to and move forward. That is the way we legislate in the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend, the Republican leader, has said \nsomething that is not true. On this floor, on numerous occasions, and \nin public meetings on numerous occasions in the past 10 days, I have \nsaid we are willing to vote on drilling, we are willing to vote on oil \nshale, and we are willing to vote on nuclear power. In their package, \nthat is one of their seven amendments, which starts on the road to 28 \namendments. We said we are willing to vote on that. Now everybody over \nthere, all 48 of them--or however many there are--should understand you \nhave had the opportunity to vote on those amendments. I have offered it \non many occasions, many occasions. So any conversation to the contrary \nsimply is without any factual foundation. The record is replete with \nwhat I have said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, everybody wishes to vote. The majority \nleader and I have a central disagreement here as to what has been said \non the floor of the Senate. We will still be on this bill next week. It \nwill be an opportunity to continue the conversation and, hopefully, get \nthe kind of process that will allow all Senators to participate on the \nNo. 1 issue in America.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican minority is being misled on \nthis issue. We have had opportunities to vote on every one of your \namendments, every one of them. They have been stalling for months on \nlots of things but in the last two weeks on energy.\n  Everyone should understand, if you want to vote on drilling, we \noffered that to you on numerous occasions. Oil shale--we offered that \non many occasions. The same on nuclear power. This is an opportunity--\nand American people should understand this--to avoid legislating. It \nhas even gotten so directed that they are going to take out their \nfrustration on what is going on in the country today--mainly that the \nstatus quo is not something that the American people want anymore. They \nare going to take it out on old people, disabled people, and poor \npeople. That is what this LIHEAP vote is all about.\n  Folks, go ahead and vote against LIHEAP. We are going to vote for it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Another thing, Mr. President, I am going to get the last \nword, so we can keep going all day.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I renew the unanimous consent that I \noffered several days ago that allowed us to begin the process of \namendments and listed the first seven amendments that would be offered \non my side.\n  To refresh everyone's memory, the unanimous consent agreement I \nproffered would have allowed us to go forward and rotate from side to \nside, as we have done in the past on major legislation of this type, \nwith one amendment on each side. I listed the first seven amendments \nthat would be offered on our side, and it was objected to.\n  Mr. President, I renew that unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the American \npeople have seen here, in the last few minutes, what is going on in the \ncountry today. No one denies that their big panacea to all of the \nproblems of gas prices--what they have said was the silver bullet--is \nvoting on drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, letting the \nGovernors decide where they want to drill. We said you can vote on \nthat. They don't want to vote on that. It is the same on oil shale and \nnuclear.\n  This is a big stall. They have been stalling for 18 months. That is \nwhy we have had to file almost 90 cloture motions, because of \nfilibusters they have conducted.\n  The final answer to all this stalling is going to come on November 4, \nbecause the American people are going to make sure that next year there \nare not going to be 49 Republicans over there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, was there a formal \nobjection, Mr. President?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I objected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senate has been in session all \nweek and held one vote Tuesday and two votes this morning--all \nprocedural votes. We have considered a bill this week concerning the \nnumber one issue in America today--the price of energy. Instead, of \nallowing a full debate on the bill and, most importantly, a full \nopportunity to allow amendments to actually open up supplies and \nprovide Americans with options, the Democratic majority has closed \ndebate and prohibited any opportunity to amend the bill.\n  Now, the Senate Democratic majority, after wasting an entire week, is \nengaged in a stunt to keep the Senate in session this weekend in some \nfalse demonstration they are serious about now addressing the issues \nthat concern Americans trying to proceed to legislation to add $1.2 \nbillion for the LIHEAP program. LIHEAP is a federally funded grant \nprogram that is implemented by states to give low income people funds \nto pay home energy bills. Generally, the primary beneficiaries of \nLIHEAP are users of natural gas, heating oil, and propane, and most of \nthe assistance is confined to the NE United States.\n  Instead of simply placing more funding into a grant program, we \nshould have used this past week to address increasing energy supplies \nto meet our long term national energy demands. I have previously \nopposed simply providing more funding for a grant program which does \nnot address our energy needs, and will not attend the vote tomorrow \nsince I would vote ``no'' so I request this statement appear in the \nRecord, prior to the cloture vote on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against cloture on the LIHEAP \nbill because the invocation of cloture would displace the bill on oil \nspeculators. I strongly believe the Senate should stay on the oil \nspeculators bill because of the critical importance of that bill in \nlight of the enormously high price of oil and gas at the pump.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, no one has been more supportive of \nLIHEAP than I. I have consistently taken the lead as chairman of the \nLHHS Subcommittee to increase Federal funding for LIHEAP. The Senate \nwill have an opportunity to act on the Sanders bill in this session to \nincrease LIHEAP.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, by now, all Americans are well aware of the \nrecord-high gas prices that have reverberated through our economy, \nhitting pocketbooks and inflating the price of everything from food to \nmanufactured goods. An issue that receives far less attention, however, \nis the ever-increasing price of utilities for home heating and cooling. \nDuring the next 2 years alone, the Energy Information Administration, \nEIA, estimates that utility costs will increase substantially. In 2008 \nand 2009, average residential electricity prices are projected to \nincrease by 5.2 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively, while natural \ngas will increase by 16 percent and 34 percent. Home heating oil is \nprojected to soar by an astounding 63 percent in 2009 alone.\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\n  During these difficult economic times, no one has been more adversely \naffected by high energy prices than low-income households and the \nunemployed, who have been hit with the double whammy of paying for \nskyrocketing gas prices and increased home heating and cooling bills at \nthe same time. Since President Bush took office, the average price of a \ngallon of gasoline has nearly tripled, and residential energy prices \nhave shot upward by astounding amounts, financially crippling lower \nincome households, forcing many of them to choose whether to pay for \nessential food and medicine, or to keep the heat on during the dead of \nwinter. In my home State of Michigan, my constituents are worried about \nhow they will pay for natural gas, home heating oil and propane for the \nupcoming winter.\n  That is why increased funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, LIHEAP, is critical. LIHEAP was created in 1981 to \nhelp low-income families, elderly individuals on a fixed income and the \nunemployed pay their energy bills. Even before recent and projected \nincreases in energy prices, my home State of Michigan--like other \nStates--started off with less funding in this fiscal year than was \nrequired to meet the need. There have been significant efforts over the \nlast couple of years to provide full funding for the LIHEAP program--\nconsistent with that authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005--but \nthese efforts have been thwarted by an administration unwilling to \nsupport this program at the necessary level.\n  The bill before the Senate--the Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer \nAct, S. 3186--would significantly strengthen LIHEAP. These additional \nemergency funds would go a long way toward providing households with \nthe necessary assistance in dealing with soaring energy costs. I am an \noriginal cosponsor of this critical legislation, and I am pleased to \nsupport it. I look forward to its swift enactment into law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 3186, the Warm in \nWinter and Cool in Summer Act. As an original cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation that nearly doubles funding for the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, I urge my colleagues to support \nthe motion to invoke cloture.\n  While we are currently in the middle of summer, every Vermonter knows \nthat winter isn't far off. Families in cold-weather States, like \nVermont, who were able to pay this past winter's bill, are already \npreparing for next winter and they are finding the costs of home \nheating to be out of reach.\n  In its most recent ``Short-Term Energy Outlook,'' the Department of \nEnergy predicted that the cost of home heating oil will increase more \nthan 41 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter \nof 2008. This increase comes on top of the 162-percent increase in \nheating oil prices that has occurred since President Bush took office.\n  Many of our neediest neighbors will need Federal and State assistance \nin order to fill their fuel tanks. There is currently $120 million in \nLIHEAP emergency funds that Congress has appropriated and the President \ncould release tomorrow. Unfortunately, so far he has refused to do so.\n  I have passed an amendment that would require the President to \nrelease the $120 million in emergency LIHEAP funding. Yet clearly more \nfunding is needed.\n  The skyrocketing price of home heating oil, propane, kerosene, \nnatural gas and electricity is stretching the household budgets of \nmillions of families with children, senior citizens on fixed incomes \nand persons with disabilities beyond the breaking point.\n  More LIHEAP assistance is urgently needed. This legislation will \nprovide an additional $2.5 billion for LIHEAP. With the current oil \nprices, the average LIHEAP grant only pays for 18 percent of the total \ncost of heating a home with heating oil in the winter; 21 percent of \nresidential propane costs; 41 percent of natural gas costs; and 43 \npercent of electricity costs.\n  This legislation is a moral imperative. People without adequate heat \nare vulnerable to illness. And people struggling to pay the heating \nbills may be tempted to skimp on medicines and even food. No one should \nhave to choose between heating and eating.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join us in supporting this \nbill immediately and the President will sign it as soon as possible.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 835, S. 3186, a bill to provide for \n     the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n         Harry Reid, Bernard Sanders, Barbara A.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 894, S. 3297, the Advancing America's \n     Priorities Act.\n         Harry Reid, Jon Tester, Carl Levin, Christopher J. Dodd, \n           Maria Cantwell, Benjamin L. Cardin, Daniel K. Inouye, \n           Hillary Rodham Clinton, Kent Conrad, Bernard Sanders, \n           Patty Murray, Debbie Stabenow, Ron Wyden, Patrick J. \n           Leahy, Max Baucus, Dianne Feinstein, Richard Durbin, \n           Robert Menendez, Sherrod Brown.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, pursuant to rule XLIV of the Standing Rules \nof the Senate, I hereby certify that, to the best of my knowledge and \nbelief based upon information provided to me by the committees of \njurisdiction, S. 3297 does not contain any congressionally directed \nspending item, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit, as those \nterms are defined in rule XLIV.\n  There are no tax or tariff provisions in the bill whatsoever. Nor do \nI believe the bill contains any ``congressionally directed spending \nitems'' which rule XLIV defines as ``a provision or report language \nincluded primarily at the request of a Senator providing, authorizing, \nor recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, \ncredit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, \nloan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to \nan entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional \ndistrict, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-\ndriven or competitive award process.''\n  To clear up any misconceptions, the bill provides only \nauthorizations--enactment of the bills would have no effect on the \nFederal budget deficit or debt. As the nonpartisan CBO stated in a \nletter regarding S. 3297, ``By themselves--that is, in the absence of \nsubsequent legislation--those authorizations [in S. 3297] do not cause \nchanges in Federal spending or revenues.'' I wish to ask that a copy of \nthis and a related CBO letter be printed in the Record.\n  As a formal matter, no provision of S. 3297 could qualify as a \ncongressionally directed spending item under rule XLIV because no \nprovision was added ``primarily at the request of a Senator.'' S. 3297 \nis a compilation of bills identified by my staff as meeting the \nfollowing criteria: No. 1. the other Chamber has approved companion \nlegislation; No. 2. the Senate committee of jurisdiction supports the \nbill, e.g., by approving it in Committee, by assenting to a \n``hotline,'' et cetera; No. 3. the bill has broad bipartisan support, \nand No. 4, to the best of our knowledge the only impediment to enacting \nthe bill was the obstruction of a single Member of the Senate. Bills \nwere included in the package because they met these criteria, not \n``primarily at the request of a Senator.'' That is, with one exception \nnoted below, if a bill satisfied these criteria, it was included in the \npackage regardless of whether a Senator requested its inclusion, and if \nit did not satisfy these criteria, it was not included regardless of \nwhether a Senator requested its inclusion.\n  The only item in the package that does not meet all of these criteria \nis the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act, \nS. 1810, introduced by Senator Brownback and cosponsored by Senator \nKennedy, because it has not yet been passed by the House. Senator \nBrownback requested inclusion of the provision in the package, Senator \nKennedy supported the bill, and it apparently has broad bipartisan \nsupport. No provision of that act could be considered a congressionally \ndirected spending item, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit.\n  But because the spirit of transparency underlying rule XLIV is not \nserved by such a formal approach, my staff asked the committees of \njurisdiction to identify any item that might be considered a \ncongressionally directed spending item in the respective bills as \nconsidered by committee. Each committee indicated that it did not \nbelieve any item included in S. 3297 within its respective jurisdiction \nmeets the definition of a congressionally directed spending item.\n  The Advancing America's Priorities Act includes many important bills, \nincluding the following: a bill to promote research into and better \ncare for those suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease; a bill to promote \nresearch into and better care for Americans suffering paralysis, a \nhealthcare problem all too prevalent among our brave veterans; a bill \nto promote research into and better care for individuals who suffer \nstrokes; a bill to promote research into and awareness of postpartum \ndepression; several bills to protect children from exploitation and to \ncrack down on child pornography; several bills to reauthorize \nsuccessful U.S. foreign policy programs; a bill to promote the safety \nof families enjoying America's beaches; a bill to help increase the \navailability of broadband throughout the United States; several bills \nto improve our understanding of the oceans; and a bill to promote \ninvestments in mitigating risks before a disaster strikes, saving the \nFederal and State governments money in the long run.\n  To avoid specious arguments that distract from the substance of these \nimportant bills, and in the interest of the broadest possible \ntransparency, I provide here information about each of the items that \neven might be alleged to be a congressionally directed spending item.\n  One subtitle in the bill, title VI, subtitle A, authorizes $1.5 \nbillion in funding for capital investments and preventive maintenance \nprojects for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, an \nauthority established pursuant to a compact provided for under Federal \nlaw. Over 40 percent of the Washington Metro ridership consists of \nFederal employees. The Government relies upon Metro for transporting \nthe millions of tourists who visit the Nation's Capital each year, for \nspecial events, and for evacuation planning. Since the Metro was first \nbuilt, the Federal Government has made capital investments in the Metro \non three separate occasions: 1969, 1980, and 1990. Apparently, a \nRepublican Senator is claiming this subtitle constitutes an \n``earmark.'' Assuming that the term ``earmark'' is intended to be \nsynonymous with ``congressionally directed spending item,'' this claim \nappears to be inaccurate. Under this theory of what constitutes a \n``congressionally directed spending item,'' nearly every authorization \nor appropriation relating to an entity within the government of \nWashington, DC, would be considered an earmark. The House did not \nconsider the legislation to contain an earmark under equivalent House \nrules. Senators Mikulski, Warner, Cardin, and Webb sent a letter \nsupporting inclusion of this provision in the package. It was included \nbecause it satisfied the criteria noted above.\n  Another item in the bill, title VII, authorizes $12 million for the \nSmithsonian Institution to construct a greenhouse facility at its \nmuseum support facility in Suitland, MD. The lease on the greenhouse \ncurrently used by the Smithsonian Institution expires next May. If the \nSmithsonian Institution does not obtain a new greenhouse facility, it \nwill have to find a way to dispose of the scientifically important \nNational Orchid Collection, over 11,000 orchids, many of which are \nextinct or threatened in the wild. Further, the greenhouse is important \nto the historic gardens surrounding the Smithsonian Museums. The \nprovision would not appear to meet the definition of a congressionally \ndirected spending item in any event because it is a House-originated \nitem, the House committee noted that the legislation was requested by \nthe Smithsonian Institution--the authorization is directed to a Federal \ntrust instrumentality, and money appropriated under the provision would \nbe spent under a competitive bidding process. The House committee of \njurisdiction stated that it was unclear whether the provision met the \ndefinition of a ``congressional earmark''\n\n[[Page S7510]]\n\nunder equivalent House rules. Senators Dodd and Leahy expressed their \nsupport for including the provision in the package. It was included \nbecause it satisfied the criteria noted above.\n  One bill in the package--title V, subtitle B, part II, subpart B--\nauthorizes funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, to advance undersea technology through the \nNational Institute for Undersea Science and Technology. This technology \nsupports NOAA's Undersea Research Program's, NURP's, regional centers. \nThe National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology was \nestablished in 2002 at the University of Mississippi--Oxford, MS--and \nthe University of Southern Mississippi--Stennis Space Center, MS--in \npartnership with NURP's. The National Technology Institute and undersea \nregional centers undergo periodic external review. According to the \nbest information available to me, funds under the provision would be \nadministered through a competitive award process, and therefore this \nprovision would not appear to constitute a congressionally directed \nspending item. A similar provision in a House companion bill was not \ntreated as an earmark under equivalent House rules. According to the \nbest information available to me, Senator Cochran requested inclusion \nof the provision in the original committee-passed bill. The part of the \nbill in which the provision is located was not included in the package \nat the request of a Senator; it was included because it satisfied the \ncriteria noted above.\n  Finally, another item in the bill authorizes $5 million in funding \nfor the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Title IV, subtitle F. \nThis provision would not appear to meet the Rule XLIV definition of \n``congressionally directed spending item'' as it is a House-originated \nitem, there is no indication that the House treated it as containing an \nearmark under equivalent House rules, and it is clear that support for \nthe provision is based on widespread agreement with the policy \nunderlying it, not parochial interests--the House bill passed the House \nof Representatives by a vote of 407 to 13. The provision was not \nincluded at the request of a Senator; it was included because it \nsatisfied the criteria noted above.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the two letters to \nwhich I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed S. 3297, a bill to advance America's priorities, as \n     introduced on July 22, 2008. The bill includes numerous \n     provisions that would affect health care, criminal statutes, \n     laws to protect wildlife and the environment, international \n     aid programs, efforts to promote commerce, ocean research, \n     and other government programs.\n       Most of the bill's provisions would specifically or \n     implicitly authorize increased appropriations for purposes \n     specified in the bill. By themselves--that is, in the absence \n     of subsequent legislation--those authorizations do not cause \n     changes in federal spending or revenues.\n       Although CBO has not completed a comprehensive review of S. \n     3297, we have previously prepared cost estimates for numerous \n     pieces of legislation that are similar or identical to most \n     of the major provisions in this bill. Based on those previous \n     estimates and on a preliminary review of S. 3297, CBO \n     estimates that, in total, the bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of approximately $10 billion over the 2009-2013 \n     period. CBO estimates that, if those sums are appropriated in \n     future legislation, implementing the bill would cost about $8 \n     billion over the 2009-2013 period.\n       Some provisions of S. 3297 would establish new federal \n     crimes. Because those prosecuted and convicted under S. 3297 \n     could be subject to criminal fines, the federal government \n     might collect additional fines if the legislation is enacted. \n     Criminal fines are recorded as revenues, then deposited in \n     the Crime Victims Fund, and later spent. CBO expects that any \n     additional revenues and direct spending would not be \n     significant because of the relatively small number of cases \n     affected.\n       S. 3297 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would \n     impose a private-sector mandate on certain entities that \n     handle nonhuman primates, but CBO expects that the cost of \n     the mandate would fall well below the annual threshold \n     established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($136 million \n     in 2008, adjusted for inflation).\n       If you wish any further details, we will be pleased to \n     provide them. The CBO staff contact is Kim Cawley.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter R. Orszag,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2008.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter responds to the questions \n     you posed on July 17, 2008, about the impact on the federal \n     budget from enacting legislation that authorizes future \n     appropriations but does not affect direct spending or \n     revenues. Consequently, this letter does not address \n     legislation that would permit agencies to incur obligations \n     in advance of appropriations (for example, legislation \n     providing new contract authority).\n       Question #1: Does an authorization of future appropriations \n     provide the authority for federal programs or agencies to \n     incur obligations and make payments from the Treasury?\n       Answer: No. A simple authorization of appropriations does \n     not provide an agency with the authority to incur obligations \n     or make payments from the Treasury.\n       Question #2: Can an agency or program spend money without \n     the authority from Congress to incur obligations and make \n     payments from the Treasury?\n       Answer: No. An agency is not allowed to spend money without \n     the proper authority from Congress to incur obligations. (See \n     31 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, which outlines limitations on expending \n     and obligating funds by officers and employees of the United \n     States Government.)\n       Question #3: Even if legislation authorizes appropriations \n     for a program, isn't it the case that a subsequent act of \n     Congress is required before an agency can spend money \n     pursuant to the authorization?\n       Answer: Yes. For discretionary programs created through an \n     authorization, the authority to incur obligations is usually \n     provided in a subsequent appropriations act. An agency must \n     have such an appropriation before it can incur obligations. \n     (Legislation other than appropriation acts that provides such \n     authority is shown as increasing direct spending.)\n       Question #4: If no new spending can occur under the \n     authorizing legislation, does it have the effect of \n     increasing the federal deficit and/or reducing the federal \n     surplus?\n       Answer: No. An authorization of appropriations, by itself, \n     does not increase federal deficits or decrease surpluses. \n     However, any subsequent appropriation to fund the authorized \n     activity would affect the federal budget.\n       Question #5: Would CBO's projection of federal debt change \n     as a result of enacting legislation that only authorizes \n     future appropriations? Is it not correct that the agency's \n     projection of future debt would be identical both before and \n     after the enactment of such legislation?\n       Answer: Enacting legislation that only authorizes future \n     appropriations would not result in an increase in CBO's \n     projection of federal debt under its baseline assumptions.\n       I hope this information is useful to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter R. Orszag,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I do not believe that the provisions of \ntitle VI, subtitle A of S. 3297 corresponding to the National Capital \nTransportation Amendments Act constitute a ``congressionally directed \nspending item.'' However, out of an abundance of caution and after \ndiscussions with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, and pursuant to \nmy best of understanding of Senate rule XLIV, I certify that neither I \nnor my immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the provisions of \ntitle VI, subtitle A of S. 3297, consistent with the requirements of \nparagraph 9 of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I do not believe that the provisions of \ntitle VI, subtitle A of S. 3297, corresponding to the National Capital \nTransportation Amendments Act of 2007, constitute a ``congressionally \ndirected spending item,'' but out of an abundance of caution, I certify \nthat neither I nor my immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the \nprovisions of title VI, subtitle A of S. 3297, consistent with the \nrequirements of paragraph 9 of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nAdvancing America's Priorities Act. I do not believe that the \nprovisions of title VI, subtitle A of this bill, corresponding to the \nNational Capital Transportation Amendments Act, constitute a \n``congressionally directed spending item,'' but out of an abundance of \ncaution, I certify that neither I nor my immediate family has a \npecuniary interest\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\nin the provisions of title VI, subtitle A of this bill, consistent with \nthe requirements of paragraph 9 of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not believe that the provisions of \ntitle VII of the Advancing America's Priorities Act, S. 3297, \nconstitute a ``congressionally directed spending item,'' as defined by \nPublic Law 110-81, but out of an abundance of caution I certify that \nneither I nor my immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the \nprovisions of title VII of S. 3297, consistent with the requirements of \nparagraph 9 of Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, for including in S. 3297, the Advancing America's \nPriorities Act, an important initiative to support the horticulture \noperations of the Smithsonian Institution. Without this needed support, \nthe Smithsonian Institution would not be able to maintain or continue \nthe same level of horticulture services it currently provides.\n  I additionally want to thank Senator Feinstein, chair of the Senate \nCommittee on Rules and Administration, for her support of this \nimportant initiative. I would also like to note the support for this \neffort of Senators Leahy and Cochran and thank them for their work to \npreserve the Smithsonian's many valuable contributions.\n  I do not believe that the provisions of title VII of S. 3297 \nconstitute a ``congressionally directed spending item,'' but out of an \nabundance of caution I certify that neither I nor my immediate family \nhas a pecuniary interest in the provisions of title VII of S. 3297, \nconsistent with the requirements of paragraph 9 of rule XLIV of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important and \nneeded initiative to support the horticulture operations of the \nSmithsonian Institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/26/senate-section/article/S7511-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 294\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with gas prices soaring, the effects are \nbeing felt all across my State of Ohio. In the last year and a half, I \nhave held 110 roundtables, talking to people in 75 of Ohio's 88 \ncounties, listening to what they are telling me about gas prices and \nabout other challenges: food prices, the cost of energy to heat their \nhomes--all of those. School districts in Appalachia are contemplating \ngoing to 4-day school weeks just to cut down on the amount of gas the \nbuses will use. The bicycle police academy in Columbus is being forced \nto turn applicants away, as community after community is looking to put \npolice on bicycles in order to keep fuel costs down. Police and fire \ndepartments across Ohio are struggling to keep community services going \nwhile facing crippling gas prices. Our truckers, our farmers, and our \nbusinesses are struggling and are often forced to raise the prices of \ntheir goods and services.\n  This price increase is devastating to our poorest populations, who, \ncome winter, will be facing a double whammy: trying to pay for gasoline \nto get to work and for either natural gas or heating oil to heat their \nhomes. We are deep into this energy crisis, and while Americans are \ncurrently most affected at the pump, we cannot forget that winter is \naround the corner. Fuel prices are still on the rise. We have witnessed \na nearly 40 percent rise in heating oil already this year. That means \nAmericans are going to need all the relief they can get this winter.\n  When pocketbooks are drained to pay heating bills, families are \nforced too often to make very difficult decisions. It is money families \ncan use to put food on the table, pay for transportation, buy winter \ncoats or other necessities for their children. That is why we have \nLIHEAP, which we just voted on and which, on basically a party-line \nvote, Republicans oppose. The LIHEAP program is geared toward \npreventing families from facing this heat-or-eat dilemma. But despite \nits success, current funding levels do not meet its demands. That is \nwhy LIHEAP is so crucial. It would assist the elderly, assist \nmoderately low-income families, and other low-income individuals who \nalready experience financial strain as their wages remain stagnant but \nthey have higher gas prices to get to work, higher food prices, and \nnow, when winter comes, higher prices to heat their homes. The lack of \nfunds to invest in solutions with upfront costs and long-term savings \nkeeps too many low-income individuals in poverty.\n  An increase in LIHEAP funding would also increase the Weatherization \nAssistance Program, which prevents families from wasting energy while \nalso providing good-paying jobs.\n  In Marietta, a few weeks ago, I met a crew of four young men who were \nlearning a skill and assisting the elderly. They were paid $12, $13 an \nhour, fixing up homes, weatherizing them, cutting energy bills for the \nelderly, for low-income elderly residents of Washington County. They \nwere saving on energy for all of us as energy prices keep going up, and \nthey were learning this trade and making a difference for all of us.\n  Given current energy strains and current financial strains Americans \nhave already experienced, the time for Congress to act on LIHEAP is \nnow, before Americans get left out in the cold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/26/senate-section/article/S7511-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7511-S7512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                HOUSING\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for bringing \nthe housing bill to the Senate today. It was met in the past by a \nfilibuster, but the good work of Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member \nShelby and the majority leader means we finally have housing \nlegislation that will matter to Ohioans and matter to Americans. In \nOhio's Morgan County, for instance, a small rural county in southeast \nOhio, foreclosures were up 60 percent over last year, and the year, \nobviously, is only half over. More than 200 families in my State lose \ntheir homes every day.\n  This housing legislation will make a difference in helping people \nstay in their homes. It will help communities deal with the costs they \nbear in fixing up abandoned homes, sometimes knocking down those homes \nbecause homes that are blighted homes in any community cause the value \nof homes in the neighborhood owned by people who are paying and keeping \nup, keeping their houses looking good and paying their mortgages--their \nhomes decline in value because of the foreclosures in their \nneighborhoods.\n  This legislation, in addition to all the other things it does, \nprovides help\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\nto communities to fix up those blighted homes, to knock down those that \nare beyond repair, and provides money--as has been cosponsored, worked \non assiduously by the Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nPennsylvania--provides money for neighborhood counselors so they can \nwork out these loans and stay in their homes, people who might be \ndelinquent but, if they can get a 30-year fixed mortgage, are able to \nstay in their homes.\n  This is particularly good news this week, moving forward on housing \nlegislation to deal with this crucial problem that afflicts so many in \nour community.\n  Every day we delayed has meant more families who were not able to \nrefinance their homes through the HOPE for Homeowners program. Every \nday we spent slogging through procedural hoops meant more communities \nthat were unable to keep up with the flood of foreclosures they are \nfacing. And every day of delay denied help to homebuyers that might \nhelp stem the slide that is hurting everyone.\n  This legislation was adopted in the Banking Committee by a vote of 19 \nto 2, thanks to the leadership of Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby. It \nhas the support of the overwhelming majority of the Senate.\n  The bill before us would provide critical relief to homeowners and \ncommunities across the country. By no means will it help everyone. Some \npeople just took on too big a mortgage. Even with a reasonable \nmortgage, they would be unable the home they purchased. Other people \nhave encountered trouble--like job loss or a divorce--that this \nlegislation cannot cure. Still others got caught speculating on \nendlessly rising prices.\n  But hundreds of thousands of families could afford to stay in their \nhomes if they had a fair and stable mortgage, one with a reasonable \ninterest rate rather than a predatory one, without hidden strings or \ntraps that make it impossible to pay off.\n  These are the families that need our help. They may be a minority of \nthe people who face foreclosure in the next two or three years, but \ntheir numbers are substantial.\n  And every home we do save makes this effort worthwhile. Every home we \nsave spares a family from the trauma of foreclosure. It saves their \nneighbors from the drag that foreclosures have on the price of \nsurrounding homes. And it saves their towns and cities from the \nincreased costs that often stem from abandoned buildings.\n  Up until this week, President Bush planned to veto this legislation. \nHe argued that cities whose neighborhoods are being hollowed out by \nforeclosures do not need help from the Federal Government. I strongly \ndisagree.\n  This legislation contains close to $4 billion that will be allocated \nto the States and towns that have been hardest hit by the foreclosure \ncrisis. Ohio is certainly one of these States. By most measures it is \nin the top three to five States based on foreclosures, subprime loans, \nand defaults.\n  The $4 billion in this legislation would be used to provide grants to \ncities and towns across the country to deal with vacant properties--\nrenovating some and tearing down others.\n  Ironically, years ago many cities in my home State tried to block \npredatory lending in their communities since the Federal and State \ngovernments were standing on the sidelines. They were prevented from \ndoing so.\n  Many are now taking these lenders to court, to try to get some help \nin cleaning up the damage from a decade of irresponsible lending. Does \nthe President really think that the mayors of Ohio are going to bail \nout these very same lenders?\n  Of course they won't. What they will do is try to reclaim and rebuild \ntheir neighborhoods.\n  In addition to helping Ohio's cities, this legislation will provide \nvital help to homeowners. The HOPE for Homeowners Act we are adopting \nwill provide hundreds of thousands of families the opportunity to \nrefinance their current, unaffordable loans into a fixed rate loan at \nan affordable interest rate.\n  This is a voluntary program. It will only work if lenders are willing \nto recognize a significant loss on these loans. But I hope it will be \nin the interest of many lenders to take a partial loss rather than \nforce people needlessly into foreclosure.\n  This legislation will also modernize the FHA loan program so that \nhomeowners will have a good alternative to the subprime loans that have \nled to so much trouble for so many.\n  It will provide some $15 billion in tax benefits to help families and \nshore up the housing market. First-time homebuyers will be eligible for \na refundable tax credit to help finance the purchase of a home.\n  People who do not itemize their taxes will be able to claim an \nadditional deduction for property taxes this year.\n  And housing agencies will be given increased authority to issue tax-\nexempt bonds to refinance subprime loans, help first-time homebuyers, \nand build low-income rental housing.\n  This legislation also provides an additional $180 million in funds \nfor counseling to help people figure out how to stay in their homes.\n  This is so important. The changes in mortgage finance have been \neffective in spreading risks around the globe, but responsibility has \nfollowed.\n  Very rarely these days can you go downtown to your local bank and \nrework your mortgage. Borrowers are understandably confused and \nfrustrated in their efforts to rework their loans. The nonprofit \ncounseling agencies in Ohio and around the country have performed a \nvital service in saving home after home.\n  Finally, this legislation will strengthen the regulation and \noversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They play a critical role in \nour economy. Today they hold or guarantee some $5 trillion in \nmortgages. With the weakness in the credit markets, they are providing \nimportant liquidity to the housing market.\n  Treasury Secretary Paulson came before the Banking Committee a week \nand a half ago and made the case for providing extraordinary power to \nthe executive branch to backstop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This \nlegislation provides it to him and his successor for the next 18 \nmonths.\n  I hope the market stabilizes over the months ahead and the regulatory \nchanges we have put in place will ensure that the Treasury Secretary \nnever has to utilize the power given to him. It can only be exercised \nif taxpayers are first in line to be paid back and the financial \nconsequences of inaction would be worse than intervention.\n  We don't know what the months ahead will bring, but we do know that \nwe cannot stand by and watch any longer.\n  I regret that it has taken so long for the Government to act--\nregulators, State government, and Congress. But at long last we are \nabout to take action, and for that I am grateful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/26/senate-section/article/S7512-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7512-S7513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING DAVE NIEHAUS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know many of my colleagues are here to \ntalk about important issues of the day we are voting on here on the \nSenate floor. But I rise with a point of pride and personal privilege \nto talk about a great moment for the Pacific Northwest; that is \ntomorrow's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame of Dave Niehaus, \nour broadcaster.\n  For 32 years, Dave has been the voice of the Seattle Mariners and he \nhas been broadcasting in that broadcast booth from the team's first \ngame in 1977. Next year will be his 5,000th Mariners game, which in and \nof itself is an incredible milestone.\n  I know everybody who is a baseball fan, not only in the Northwest but \nall throughout the country, knows that when someone has that unique \nposition of calling a baseball game he does breathe life into each \ninning regardless of the score.\n  Many people new to the Northwest may not realize that in the late \n1990s, up until that period, most of the Mariner games were only on the \nradio. For a good part of the team's history, let's say our team was \nstruggling.\n  It took the Mariners 15 seasons to break .500 baseball. But yet the \nradio ratings were always strong and people kept tuning in, and that is \nbecause the voice of Dave Niehaus and his approach to the game kept the \nfans listening.\n  Like so many of the 33 broadcasters who are enshrined before him in \nCooperstown, he found a way to make each game a treat for the fans to \nlisten to. In 2007, the Seattle Times called him\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\n``the voice of summer in Seattle.'' I could not agree more.\n  Dave also made a brief bit of history by doing the first play by play \nof a baseball game live on the Internet in September of 1995 when the \nMariners and the Yankees played. So baseball came into cyberspace and \neverybody around the world got to hear some of Dave Niehaus's great \nphrases such as ``swung and belted'' and ``get the mustard and rye \nbread, grandma, because it's grand salami time.''\n  And for the fans, we do consider Dave part of the team. In fact, in \n1999 the Mariners chose to honor Dave Niehaus by having him throw out \nthe ceremonial first pitch at the opening of our new stadium, something \nthat is the pride of the Northwest, Safeco Field which was opened in \n1999.\n  Dave was there behind the microphone in the 1995 season, the ``refuse \nto lose season.'' It was an exciting time in the Northwest. He called \nthe exciting one-game playoff with the Angels. After the game, many of \nthe fans cheered him as much as they cheered the players.\n  Dave was also behind the microphone for what is called the ``famous \ndouble,'' the most memorable moment in Seattle Mariners sports history. \nIt was the deciding game of the 1995 playoffs against the Yankees, and \nin the bottom of the 11th inning, Edgar Martinez hit a double that \nbecame Dave's favorite call of his entire career, as Ken Griffey, Jr. \nscored from first base, winning the series.\n  Once again, I congratulate Dave Niehaus in winning the 2008 Ford C. \nFrick Award for excellence in baseball broadcasting and his \nintroduction into Cooperstown. Dave's signature call of ``my, oh, my,'' \nnow will join the ranks of Harry Caray's ``holy cow,'' Mel Allen's \n``going, going, gone'' and Vin Scully's ``I can't believe it.''\n  Finally I wish to say, because this is a point of personal privilege \nfor me, that I hope somewhere in 2010, I might be standing in this very \nsame spot with the opportunity to congratulate Edgar Martinez in being \nenshrined in the Hall of Fame.\n  Edgar's achievements are many: He is a two-time American League \nbatting champion, a seven-time All-Star, a career .312 hitter, \nincluding seven consecutive seasons of hitting above .300 from 1995 to \n2001. And of the 164 hitters in the Hall of Fame, Edgar's on-base \npercentage of .418 would rank him 13th.\n  I say this because in the Northwest, sometimes we do not get all the \nattention. Being in a different time zone, people do not see all of the \naccomplishments. But we are here to congratulate Dave Niehaus and hope \nfor the best, that another Seattle Mariner will be added to the ranks \nof Cooperstown sometime soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a week ago yesterday the Democratic \nleader brought to the floor an energy bill. It was limited to \nspeculation. But we welcomed that, we on the Republican side. I think \nthe American people welcomed it, because the most important issue \nfacing our country is $4 gasoline.\n  We are sending billions of dollars overseas to people, many of whom \nare trying to kill us by bankrolling terrorists. We are emptying our \npockets to buy gasoline. I have e-mails and letters, as all Senators \ndo--in my case from Tennesseans--from Marines who come home and do not \nhave the money to take a family vacation, and from moms who are losing \ntheir jobs because they cannot afford to commute.\n  So we welcomed the Democratic leader's bringing to the floor a week \nfrom yesterday the speculation bill. What we want to do in this 30 \nminutes is let the American people know what we could have accomplished \nin this last week if only the Democratic leader would have allowed a \nfull and open debate on gas prices, including proposals to both find \nmore and use less.\n  You hear a lot of words here on the floor. I couldn't believe what I \nwas hearing a few minutes ago. I thought I must be in the United \nNations without translators, because, I mean, what the Democratic \nleader says he said is not what any of us heard him say.\n  What we heard him say, when we asked to say: Let us bring up gas \nprices, let us talk about the real problems, let us talk about \nspeculation, let us talk about supply, let us talk about demand, let us \ndebate, let us vote, we have said: Let's come to some agreement about a \nnumber of amendments on each side. Limit them to energy, limit the \namount of time, vote on them, see if we can take a serious step toward \ndealing with $4 gasoline.\n  What we have said is we want to find more and use less. Now, why do \nwe say that? Because the whole problem of $4 gasoline boils down to a \ncouple of things: the expected increased demand for gasoline worldwide, \nespecially in places like China and India where people are becoming \nricher and driving more cars; and the decreased supply.\n  The United States can make a significant contribution to both demand \nand supply. Finding more is the way you deal with supply; using less is \nthe way you deal with demand. So we offered one amendment that 44 \nsenators agreed with that said: Let us do offshore drilling for oil and \ngas. Now, 85\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\npercent of the area that should be available to offshore drilling is \nnot available because of a congressional law. We said: Let's give \nStates the option to do that.\n  Secondly, we said: Let's take off the moratorium on oil shale in the \nwestern States, and proceed in an environmentally sound way to find \nmore oil. Doing those two things over time, the Department of Interior \nhas said, would increase by one-third United States oil production.\n  On the other side, we said: Let's use less by making commonplace \nplug-in electric cars and trucks. We have 240 million cars and trucks \nin America. We use gasoline to run almost all of them. That comes from \noil. If we instead began to use electricity to run those cars and \ntrucks, we could cut in half the amount of oil we import and we could \ndo it without building any new powerplants because we have so much \nelectricity available at night when we are asleep. The powerplants rev \ndown and they have got a lot of unused electricity. So you could \nliterally, with a plug-in electric car, plug it in at night for 60 \ncents--that is your fill-up--and drive 30 or 40 miles on your electric \nbattery before the gasoline engine kicks in, in your hybrid car.\n  This is no far-fetched idea. Nissan, General Motors, Ford, Toyota--\nall will have these cars on the markets. Half of our electric power is \nunused at night. So we have got the cars coming, we have got the power, \nall we need is the cord. In the Congress we have substantial agreement \nacross party lines to do that.\n  We have a variety of other ideas that could help us find more and use \nless. For example, we would like to make it easier for more nuclear \npowerplants. But on the other side they say no.\n  But what we are trying to say is, Mr. Democratic Leader, let us come \nto the floor and do what we could have been doing for the last 8 days \nand try to fashion a serious effort at lowering gasoline prices. Start \nsaying yes, we can, instead of no, we cannot.\n  I see the Senator from Alaska here, who is one of the ranking \nSenators on the Energy Committee and one of the most knowledgeable on \nthis issue. I would ask her: What do you think we might have \naccomplished in these last 8 days, and what could we still accomplish?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I say to my friend, the Senator from Tennessee, in \nterms of what is out there, the options are enormous. You mentioned a \nfew that are part of our legislation, whether it is the advancement of \nnuclear or coal to liquids or oil shale or offshore.\n  One of the issues we in Alaska believe in very strongly, and have \ngreat public support, not only in the State but growing across the \ncountry, is the recognition, up in an area called ANWR, a section of \nthe North Slope that is very lucrative in terms of reserves, we have an \nopportunity to provide for this Nation more of a resource it \ndesperately needs.\n  We need the permission of the Congress to go ahead and allow for \nthat. So we kind of get nailed on the Republican side by our colleagues \nwho say: Well, all you want to do is drill, drill, drill. And ANWR is \none example of that.\n  I remind my colleagues--and perhaps many do not know--I do not know \nif you actually know as well in terms of what our legislation or what \nour amendment on opening ANWR would provide in terms of not only the \nresource, 10.5 billion barrels of oil is the mean estimate, but what we \nare looking to do then with our amendment is not take those revenues \nthat come to the Federal Treasury, put them in the black hole of the \nTreasury, but we want to direct those toward the development of \nrenewable resources, for solar power and wind. Eighteen billion dollars \ncould be directed toward the advancements of those areas.\n  Carbon capture and storage technology, $30 billion could be directed \nin that area; $50 billion for cellulosic biofuels; $15 billion for \nsmart grid electrical technology. What we are doing is, we are taking a \nresource that we desperately need, using those revenues to direct them \nto the next generation of energy technology that will allow for a level \nof independence for this Nation. We know we can't get from where we are \nnow to where we need to be with renewables only by wishful thinking. It \nis going to take a strong economy and revenues. Let's help with the \nrevenues from a resource like ANWR. Let's stop sending overseas, to \ncountries that are not our friends today and will likely not be our \nfriends in the future, let's stop sending this incredible transfer of \nwealth. Let's try to do more here and build in a direction where we \nhave technologies working for us for the future energy needs of this \ncountry.\n  We have not been given the opportunity to advance such an amendment. \nThat is unfortunate for us, unfortunate that we are not having a full-\nfledged debate, and unfortunate for the people who have been denied \nthis resource for some 30 years.\n  We opened it. We passed legislation once through the Congress, and it \nwas vetoed 10 years ago by President Clinton. If he had not vetoed \nthat, we would be seeing a million barrels a day coming into this \ncountry from the north. We want to be able to provide that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. I see the Senator from South \nDakota. No one more vigorously advocates for the type alternative \nenergy that the Senator from Alaska was talking about funding research \nfor. The Senator from Alaska talked about the importance of research \nfor advanced biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol. I have heard you talk \nabout that before. It is a very promising area in addition to the \nethanol we already produce.\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator has correctly identified the problem. We use \ntoo much energy, and we don't produce enough. The solution to that \nproblem is to find more and use less. That is exactly what we want to \nbe discussing in the Senate, how do we increase supply and reduce \ndemand in a way that will help lower fuel prices for Americans who are \nfeeling the brunt of rising gasoline prices and rising oil prices.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee noted, we have had great success in my \nState with biofuels. We are going to eclipse the 1 billion gallon mark \nthis year in terms of ethanol production. If you couple that with next \ngeneration biofuels, cellulosic ethanol, there is enormous promise and \npotential for us to lessen our dangerous dependence upon foreign \nsources of energy by converting to biofuels. But having said that, I am \nfor ANWR. I have voted for ANWR. I have actually been to ANWR with the \nSenator from Alaska. I am absolutely convinced that we ought to be \naccessing the incredible reserves we have there that could lessen our \ndependence on foreign energy.\n  I am for more domestic supply, whether it is oil and gas, biofuels, \nnuclear, coal to liquid, oil shale. There are a lot of good options, \nnone of which we are having an opportunity to talk about in the Senate \nbecause the Democratic leader has decided that no amendments are going \nto be allowed.\n  We are stuck in the Senate on a Saturday. The American people are \ncrying out for a solution to a big problem. Big problems require \nleadership. We are not providing leadership. We are not doing what the \nSenate should be doing, and that is working its will for the American \npeople. The people I represent deserve a vote. They deserve a vote on \nenergy issues that are important to South Dakota, as do the people in \nAlaska, Tennessee, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Utah, constituents of the \nSenators who are here in the Chamber now and want to see this issue \ndebated. They want to see solutions. The only way we will get to a \nsolution is by allowing an open process where we can debate finding \nmore and using less. I am for all the things I have just mentioned.\n  In the energy debate we had in the summer of 2005, we actually \nadopted 57 amendments. We stayed on the bill for 10 days. We had a \nfull-throated debate on energy. In 2007, we debated energy again. We \nadopted 49 amendments, and we spent 15 days on the floor talking about \nit. But we had an opportunity to discuss amendments that would do \nsomething about the energy crisis. What we have instead now is a \nDemocratic leadership that has drawn a line in the sand and said: We \nwill not vote on any of these things. We will not debate any of these \nthings. You take our way or the highway.\n  Their way does nothing to add to our energy supply or to reduce \ndependence upon foreign sources. I appreciate the leadership of the \nSenator from Tennessee. I, along with him and my colleagues, urge the \nDemocratic leadership to open the process and give us a fair \nopportunity to debate amendments\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\nand find meaningful solutions to America's serious energy problems.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the Senator sits down, might I ask a question.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 16 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Would the Chair please let me know when 5 minutes \nremains.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wanted to ask the Senator from South Dakota about his \nspeech. You just got finished telling the American people what you \nwould like to do on the bill, if that bill were present now and we were \ndebating it, the bill they have been talking about, the speculation \nbill. You have been saying this is what you would do. A little while \nago, the majority leader told the American people: You all could offer \namendments on nuclear, on offshore. It seems to me he said that, and \nyou are talking as if that is wrong, that we couldn't offer amendments.\n  Could you explain why you feel the way you do and why it would appear \nthat what he said is not true when compared with the way you are \nreacting? You are a good Senator. The way you are reacting, it seems as \nif what the majority leader said is untrue.\n  Mr. THUNE. With respect to what the Senator from Nevada said earlier \ntoday, indicating that we had an opportunity to offer amendments, that \nis flatly not the case. He has filled the amendment tree, which in \nWashington parlance means he has essentially prevented or blocked other \nMembers from offering amendments. We are paralyzed because we can't \nhave the debate we need to on all the amendments and solutions that \nMembers are here to offer, all of which would add to the debate and \nmost of which would actually address the fundamental problem the \nSenator from Tennessee has identified. We don't produce enough energy \nin this country, and we use too much. We need to find more and use \nless.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Utah is here. He has served in the \nSenate for a while. We only have about 10 more minutes, and several \ncolleagues are here who would like to speak. Doesn't the Senator from \nUtah think it is a great disappointment that we have not been able, \ninstead of just talking about gas prices, to do something about gas \nprices? Can he help some of us who have been here a little less longer \nin the Senate understand how that could have happened?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to the Senator from Tennessee, the one thing we \nshould remember about markets is that markets hate uncertainty. \nWhenever markets are not certain as to what is going to happen, the \nprice of commodities always goes up because people want those \ncommodities. They want to hold them, and they are afraid, in an area of \nuncertainty, that they might not be able to get them, so they will bid \nthe price up.\n  Our inability to bring certainty to the energy debate by virtue of \nthe parliamentary maneuvers that have occurred contributes to the high \nprice of gasoline. An airline, a truck line, an energy company dealing \nwith gasoline at the pump has to have gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, \nor they will be unable to function. When they cannot see any end to the \npresent uncertainty of world supply, that is when they bid for long-\nterm contracts. As they bid for the long-term contracts, others who \nsay, we are not sure what is going to happen in the housing market or \nwhat is going to happen in the stock market, the one place where we are \nsure the price is going to go up is oil. They will come in and bid for \nthe futures as well.\n  We have had a bill on the floor that tries to deal with speculation \nas if it were a mystery. Speculation is not a mystery. The word \n``speculator,'' as Bernard Baruch said, comes from the Latin phrase \n``speculari,'' to observe. A speculator is one who observes what is \ngoing on and tries to make sense out of it.\n  If we could say to the world market, we are serious about looking at \noil shale, we are serious about looking at the Outer Continental Shelf, \nwe are serious about doing things with respect to American automobile \nusage of oil, that would bring a degree of certainty to the \nmarketplace. People would say: I don't need to buy that long-term oil \ncontract because now there is a path of certainty that will mean prices \nwill be stable. As prices become stable, they begin to come down. That \nis what we are trying to do. The parliamentary maneuvers entered into \nprevent us from bringing that certainty to the market and contribute to \nthe constantly rising price of oil.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is here. He has been actively involved in a \nvariety of energy issues and a member of the Energy Committee. He has \nbeen an active participant in the energy debate in this Chamber. Has \nthe Senator not heard the Republican leader repeatedly say to the \nDemocratic leader: We are ready to talk about supply and demand. We are \nready to deal with, say, seven amendments from the Republican side and \nseven from the Democratic side and to vote on them and to have a time \nlimited debate, and our whole purpose is a serious purpose to try to \nget a result; so can we not do that? Has he not heard that time and \ntime again. And, if so, why does he suppose we are not doing that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I have heard it time and time again. We are ready to \nvote and to offer amendments. Clearly, we need to deal with this issue \nof supply and demand. We need to find more and use less. The people of \nWyoming get it. The people of my neighbors to the east in South Dakota \nknow it. The people from Utah understand it completely. The people at \nhome get it.\n  There is a story in the Wall Street Journal from Thursday, ``Want to \nSee Inflation Pressures? Try Wyoming.'' People drive great distances in \nthese Western States, but they are also paying not just the price at \nthe pump but also at the grocery store when they have to buy things \nshipped in because of transportation costs. They say: Hey, you are \nsending all of this money overseas to foreign countries, people who are \nnot our friends. We need to be energy self-sufficient. We need to do it \nat home, which is exactly what we are trying to do with these seven \namendments. Wyoming is an energy State--oil, natural gas, uranium for \nnuclear, and coal. The technology now with coal is there for clean coal \ntechnology, coal to liquids. That is energy that can be used for our \nmilitary airplanes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Is it not true that one of the leading environmental \ngroups has said that if we can find a way to capture carbon from coal \nplants, that is the best long-term solution to climate change?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. They have said that because it is the most available, \naffordable, secure, reliable source of energy we have. We have enough \ncoal to last this country hundreds of years. We have ways to capture \nthe carbon and pump it into the ground of old oil wells and get more \noil and leave some of the carbon down below.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I assume that during the last 8 days, instead of just \ndebating or speaking in languages that we don't seem to understand from \neach side, we could have actually considered an amendment to have \naggressive research in carbon capture to accelerate the possibility \nthat we could deal with climate change, clean air, energy independence, \nand have plenty more electricity for plug-in cars and trucks that \neveryone seems to favor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. And we could do it all with an environmental safety \nnet. The opportunity has been blocked step by step.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I see the Senator from Tennessee, a member of the \nEnergy Committee. He is one of the newer Members of the Senate. He has \nhis feet pretty firmly on the ground. I am sure he is here to try to \naccomplish something. I wondered if he has any reflection about these \nlast 8 days and our ability to try to deal with the No. 1 issue facing \nthe American people, $4 gasoline.\n  Mr. CORKER. The senior Senator from Tennessee provides tremendous \nleadership and certainly has done that on the issue of energy. He has \nspent time on the Energy Committee and knows of the great things \nhappening in the State of Tennessee in this regard. What I would say to \nthe Senator from Tennessee, someone who is a great friend, I worked \nhard to come to this body. You saw the tremendous effort I put in place \nto come to this body.\n  This is the biggest issue the American people are dealing with today. \nI\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\ndid a townhall meeting the other night on the phone, which had about \n1,200 people, and almost every question people called in about was: Are \nwe going to do anything as it relates to energy? So I know this is a \nmajor issue. I know it affects people.\n  I go into retail stores, for instance, where somebody is working \nbehind the counter, and I know they are not making a very high wage. \nThey tell me: Please, is there something you can do to solve this \nproblem? In my family, we are having to make decisions I thought we \nwould never have to make, and I am concerned about what is going to \nhappen this winter.\n  So, yes, to get back to the Senator and sharing reflections, it is \nhard for me to believe we have a body of 100 adults, we have the \nbiggest issue our country is dealing with, and one Senator--one \nSenator--has decided no one can offer amendments. I think it is a lack \nof responsibility to the American people. I do feel remiss that you and \nI both are not able to represent the people of Tennessee to do \nsomething they know makes sense; and that is, produce more and use \nless.\n  I thank the Senator for this time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, Senator Domenici from New Mexico has served in the \nSenate for 36 years. He is the ranking member on the Energy Committee. \nI ask him, can you help us understand why, with so many Senators \nwilling today--and for the last 8 days--to deal with this issue, we are \nnot dealing with it? And why the Democratic leader seems to be \ndetermined to avoid doing any single thing that would produce more \nAmerican energy?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, Mr. President, let me say to my good friend from \nTennessee, first, what a pleasure it is to serve with him. I am sorry \nwe have not served together the last 2 years on the Energy Committee \nbecause the Senator moved--after we got the big Energy bill through, \nand to his State's benefit--to the Appropriations Committee. I still \nget to work with the Senator there.\n  I say to the Senator, let's see if we can put it into focus. American \npeople, I hope you have been watching for about 30 minutes or 40. \nBecause if you go back about 40 minutes or 45 minutes, you will see \nsomebody standing over there. His name is Harry Reid. He is from \nNevada. He is the majority leader.\n  You would have heard him say: Well, I have offered to you that you \ncould have offered an amendment for the offshore. You could have \noffered an amendment for nuclear. He went on through five or six. You \ncould have offered them, but you didn't.\n  Isn't it strange that he stands there and tells the American people \nand the Senate that, and here, today, there are five Senators talking \nwith you, all who, it seems to me, have good brains, who seem to be \ninterested in their State and our country. What are they saying? They \nare saying: We wish we could offer an amendment. So that means they \ncould not. Right?\n  I will tell you, here is how I approach it. I am going to look at the \nParliamentarian and say to the Parliamentarian: You might know, Mr. \nParliamentarian, because I asked. I will tell you, and I hope you will \naccept what I say is true. The Parliamentarian has told me the two \namendments Majority Leader Reid put on the so-called speculation bill--\nhe added them to it to fill the tree--are called amendments Nos. 5098 \nand 5099.\n  So, Mr. Parliamentarian, let's assume we are talking about the so-\ncalled speculation bill. Let's further assume--because it is true--\nthere are two amendments that have been offered to it, amendments Nos. \n5098 and 5099.\n  With that, I will ask: Is it in order for the Senators from \nTennessee--either of them--or the Senator from New Mexico, with that \nsituation, to offer an amendment that would permit the opening of the \noffshore resources of America? Would that amendment be in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All slots are filled and the amendment would \nnot be in order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, you asked me, \ncould I help you. I think I have helped you, right there. I think I \nhave helped those who are listening.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, what about the \namendment by Senator Domenici to make it easier to build five or six \nnuclear plants a year, so we could have more clean energy; would that \nbe in order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, that amendment \nwould not be in order.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Why would it not be in order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Because in the Senate, we run on parliamentary rules. \nThere is a rule that if an amendment has been filled, the tree has been \nfilled, you cannot offer any more.\n  Now, we have a majority leader who has used that rule more than any \nother leader in the history of America. That means he has offered two \namendments to an amendment so you could not offer any other amendments. \nThat is the way he runs the Senate. He does it not only to us, he does \nit to everybody because he does not want to have a vote on what you \nwant, which you have so eloquently spoken to, or what the Senator from \nAlaska wants or what I would like. He does not want any of those. Why? \nBecause maybe he will lose and maybe we will open this big parcel of \nland to the American people, open it so we can use it.\n  Somehow or other, Democrats do not want more energy. I do not know \nwhy. It is incredible to me that with the American people clamoring for \nit, they do not want it. But they have a leader who is acting so no \namendments can be offered. He stands and tells the American people any \namendment they want can be offered.\n  Frankly, I tell you, you can put those things up beside each other, \nand one is true and one is not true. I think I have established the \nreality that if I wanted to offer any amendments he was talking about, \nthey would be out of order.\n  I have lived in the Senate for 36 years. I have never had a Senate \nsuch as this. This Senate is run by one person. It is worse than the \nHouse Rules Committee. The House Rules Committee establishes the rules \nby which you work. But we do not have that. We have one person. He \ndecides because he is entitled to the floor, he offers two amendments, \nand that equals a denial of the rights for either Republicans or \nDemocrats to offer an amendment. That is where we are.\n  Look at the good we could have done. Look at the issues we could have \nresolved. Look at what we could have told the American people: We have \nopened your property which contains billions of barrels of oil and God \nknows how many trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It is going to be \nopen so we can use it. Well, we cannot tell them that. It is kind of \nstrange, but I think it is true.\n  I am very glad you asked me to explain it. I am glad we have the \nnumber. Maybe next week we can ask the majority leader, when he is \nhere, if he would withdraw those two amendments so we could have \namendments. I think if he were here, I would ask him that. I would ask \nhim: How about a unanimous consent agreement, Mr. Leader, that we will \nremove your two amendments. They stand in the way of all our \namendments. How about removing them? I would get some mumbo jumbo, and \nhe would say he wants to leave them there.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say to Senator Domenici, thank you so \nmuch for clarifying this. It is like we are hearing two different \nconversations utterly unconnected to one another. But I notice Senator \nMcConnell, the Republican leader, had offered a consent request. He \noffered and asked that we be allowed to offer seven amendments--just \nseven amendments. There was some confusion about it. But did you hear \nwhat the majority leader said to that offer?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did. Surely, I did.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What did he say? And what power did he have to carry \nout what he said?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He said no. And he had the power to do it because, I \ntold\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\nyou, if our leader would have taken any one of those seven--say, he \nwould have given you one of them and said to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama: Why don't you offer this one? If you would have offered \nit, somebody would have said that meant that amendment is out of order, \nand the Parliamentarian would have said that is out of order. You \ncannot offer amendments because those two amendments have been offered \nto fill the tree. That is a nice word. We have to understand it.\n  What he has done is put those up there, which equals no one has a \nright to offer an amendment: I have done it. I have had all the \namendments that this institution is going to have. I have the right to, \nsays the leader. I put them. That is the end of the amendments.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think that is a sad event.\n  I ask the Senator, would you not say that this body we take so much \npride in as being the greatest deliberative body in the world--maybe in \nthe history of the world--on an issue that is as important to the \nfamily budget and the entire Nation's economy that is shaky now because \nof surges in gas prices--isn't it bad policy--I say to Senator \nDomenici, you have been here 36 years, you have chaired the Energy \nCommittee, you have written energy bills that have made the country \nbetter. Isn't it critically important right now for America that we \nstart talking about and debating openly, not trying to manipulate it \nbut openly to see what we can do to produce more and use less energy?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe it is absolutely what our \ndistinguished chairman of our conference--who is on the floor, who was \nthe leader of the colloquy that took place--has so eloquently said. It \nis right here in our hands that offshore contains more oil and gas than \nany other property of the United States, and it not only should be the \nsubject matter of debate but there should be an amendment offered and \nwe should vote on it and say yes or no to opening it for drilling.\n  Can you imagine how happy the American people, who have followed this \nissue, would be if one of these mornings they could read: Senate votes \non offshore drilling and says yes. I do not know why the Democrats do \nnot want to do that. I would think they would be in favor of it because \nmost Americans are. So I do not know where they are getting the \nmessages.\n  But you cannot stand here any longer, after what we have established \ntoday, and say you can vote on any of these. Somebody is going to be \nhere with the name of these amendments, and anytime he says that, we \nare going to ask: Can we remove these two amendments that stand in the \nway of us doing that? I don't know what his excuse is going to be, but \nthere will have to be one. Right?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will ask this too.\n  I say to the Senator, you have watched this so closely, and we have \nthe question of oil shale in the West.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Two years ago, when your Energy bill passed, we had an \nopportunity to begin to see if we could make that be successful. I \nthink we can. We had testimony in the Energy Committee that indicated \nit would come in below the world price of oil.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. But what happened? Wasn't it when the Democrats got the \nmajority in the Congress, Speaker Pelosi put in language that barred \nany utilization of Federal lands to produce oil from shale?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, actually, when we did our big Energy bill--that \nis when the good Senator from Tennessee was on our committee--one of \nthe things we wrote in--it went by rather easily, nobody knew it; I \nknew it because I worked on it and I put it in there--we decided that \nthe Bureau of Land Management property up there in those three States \nbelongs to the Government--that property. So it belongs to the people. \nThere was not any provision to let the leases out so they could use it \nfor research on how to develop it. We permitted that in our bill.\n  Sure enough, it worked. Within 6 months after the bill was passed, \nthere was interest. The interest was evidenced by one of the major \ncompanies taking out a lease. They wanted to spend $4 billion \ndeveloping a technology. They were ready to move and see if it was \ngoing to work. Well, that is a lot of money, and it means that is going \nto take a lot of money.\n  Well, you know what happened. Similar to all these other things \naround here, in the dead of night, on the Interior appropriations bill, \nan amendment was put on, a rider, you call it. It said: You cannot \nproceed to write the final regulations for the research and \ndevelopment--not for the production--for the research and development \nso people will know what they are getting into and what they can spend \nmoney on.\n  They passed that at night, put it on there. We know where it came \nfrom. It came from those who want no development in the State of \nColorado. And there we are, similar to all these other amendments that \nhave been put on that take away property rights from our American \npeople. That was done there. We are asking that be lifted. We have an \namendment to do that. We cannot vote on it. Right?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. But it was a very recent act in the Interior \nappropriations bill, not fully debated anywhere.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Nowhere.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Slipped in, as we say, in the dead of night. It \nreversed the option to going forward and basically denied the Interior \nDepartment the ability to write the regulations that would allow it to \ngo forward.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. Whenever I talked about the regulations, I want to \nclarify that the first commercial rigs couldn't be developed because of \nwhat they did.\n  Senator, I just wish to say before I sit down--and I am ready to--how \npleased I am that you are going to stay after I leave and apparently \nstay on the Energy Committee and apparently work on something very dear \nto my heart: nuclear energy. I worked for 8 to 10 years on that, with \nmarvelous staff help. I think we had a lot to do with going from no \nnuclear power in America to a very live activity where many companies \nare standing in line to offer their licenses at the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission to produce nuclear power.\n  We need to finish with a recycling provision. I understand you are \ninterested in that and you will probably work on that in the years to \ncome, and I commend you. I will be gone.\n  I think my good friend from Tennessee who is here knows we have to do \nrecycling, the second phase of this activity. Right in his State, we \nhave taken the lead. TVA has taken the lead in nuclear power because \nthey were ready, and before anybody else they were building one, \nbuilding a half one, turning it into a whole, and that has been a \ntremendous experience for the nuclear industry. He is to be praised \nbecause that happened with people being heard and all and with no \nserious complaints, and it is on its way, just like the rest of them. \nThey are going to build them right next door to existing ones, and that \nis going to be a pretty good approach. Remember that when you start \nworking at it, they are not building them in new places, they are \nbuilding right next door to ones that have been there for 30 years. \nPeople say: Of course, build another one. You might hear some anti's, \nbut they are not anti's around the existing plants because it has been \nnothing but good, and you will find that when you start to take the \nlead in that.\n  I want to say I think the time is up for me, and if it isn't, \nwhatever it is up here tells me I am about finished for the day. I am. \nI do want to say to both of you that it has been tremendous to talk \nhere today. I think, somehow or another, we have made the point that \nthere just cannot be one set of truths for the Democrats, one set of \ntruths that apply to the majority leader, and another set of truths \nthat apply to us. It is either true or its not true, and the issue of \nwhether we have been able to offer amendments in the true way, to amend \nthem and to debate them, to be amended themselves, whether we have been \nin that position is clear, clear, clear as the clearest water on Earth, \nit is that clear that we have not been able to because it has been \ndenied to us.\n  Anybody standing up saying: You could have offered amendments--how \ncould we? I don't know how we can. Maybe next week we can offer six or \neight or more. Senator, maybe you can stand up and offer them and let \nthe Parliamentarian say they are not in order; say, why not; and we \nwill get the\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nanswer. Maybe somebody who put those two amendments on there to close \neverything up, maybe they would consider taking them off. I mean, if he \nsays you can have an amendment, well, can we have an amendment by \ntaking down your two amendments and then we will have our amendment? I \nam sure the answer would be no. Why wouldn't it be? Because they don't \nwant you to offer an amendment, right? That must be it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator for giving me time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, do we have a time agreement now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement in effect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/26/senate-section/article/S7518-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would just say what an honor it has \nbeen to serve with Senator Domenici. There is no more effective \nadvocate, no more courageous Senator in terms of speaking the truth \nabout complex matters in words that Americans can understand, and no \nstronger Senator in committing to a sound economic policy than Senator \nDomenici. We are going to miss him in this body, there is no doubt \nabout it.\n  I wish to briefly share a few thoughts about the LIHEAP legislation \nthat was offered.\n  First, I would note that the Democratic leadership has proposed two \npieces of legislation at this point in time over the last few weeks \nthat would deal with energy. One is speculation, which I am open to in \nseeing what we can do to tighten that up, but it produces not one \nbarrel of energy. They also tried to move today a $2.5 billion energy \nsubsidy to subsidize the purchase of fuel oil for people in America, \nand they want to spend it. There is no money whatsoever to pay for it, \nso it is going to be treated as an emergency, adding to the debt this \nNation already has. I would just suggest that if you are looking at \nsound energy policy, it seems to me that Senator Alexander has it \nright: We should find more and use less.\n  I would suggest it is crystal clear that the LIHEAP legislation that \nis designed to use $2.5 billion of the taxpayers' money--actually, \nmoney we don't have because we are already in debt--to subsidize the \nutilization of more energy--really some of the dirtiest energy we have \nin America; burning dirty fuel oil in private home furnaces--that is \nnot consistent with a sound energy policy.\n\n  So I reject the LIHEAP bill first and foremost because it is unpaid \nfor, it adds another $2.5 billion to the national debt, and it is on \ntop of an already $2.5 billion LIHEAP piece of legislation. This is not \ngood leadership from the Democratic side on matters important to \nAmerica.\n  You remember the dispute we had over automobile gasoline. The prices \nwent up, and some suggested we should cut the tax. We said no, that is \nnot good policy. Why would you want to encourage the utilization of \nmore gasoline by cutting this tax? It is just not good policy.\n  We need to do something fundamental about energy. It is an even worse \npolicy to tax the American people or add debt to our grandchildren to \nsubsidize the utilization of some of the Nation's most dirty energy.\n  The very people from that area of the country--the Northeast \nprimarily--are the ones who have consistently objected to the \nproduction of more energy. Time and time--I have been here 12 years, \nalmost. I know where the votes have come from. The very people pushing \nfor this subsidy to burn more dirty fuel oil are the people who had \nobjected and successfully blocked attempts to produce more, cleaner \nenergy in America, and it is not good.\n  We need to talk about this. We need to get serious about America's \nenergy policy. I know my fine colleague, the great advocate from \nVermont, tried to argue that this is a fair allocation of money and \nthat it is not regionally biased in favor of Vermont or some of our \nNortheastern States, that it helps rural Southern States with air-\nconditioning. Well, I am just looking at the numbers in the bills. I \nhave the numbers State by State right here. In Vermont, they have one \nCongressman. They got $17 million. I guess that is less than--$17 \nmillion under this program. Alabama, with seven Congressmen--seven \ntimes the population--got a total of $18 million.\n  Look, this is a gimmick. It is a transfer of wealth to a certain \ngroup of people for political reasons, and we are going to send the \ndebt to our grandchildren. It is not good policy.\n  We ought not to go to the LIHEAP bill because we need to be talking \nabout how to produce more energy. If we produce more energy and we \nproduce cleaner alternative energy sources, if we build nuclear plants \nthat some of these same people have opposed, if we were building \nanother 100 nuclear plants instead of the 100 we have--and we haven't \nbuilt one in 30 years--if we had been building them the way France has, \nwhere 80 percent of their energy is from nuclear power, we wouldn't be \nin the crisis we are in today, but they blocked that. So I just protest \na little bit. Count me as saying no on that question.\n  I see some of my other colleagues are here, and I yield the floor at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few minutes. I have \nbeen a Senator for almost 4 years. I think my life experiences I bring \nto the body are somewhat different than a lot of others. I have some \nobservations on what is happening to us. I hope the American people \nwill pay attention because this week the Senate has failed--miserably \nfailed. We just passed a housing bill that fixes only short-term \nproblems and doesn't fix the long-term problems associated with housing \nand Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We just did that because we are in a \ncrisis. You have to do it. The Secretary of the Treasury came to the \nPresiding Officer's conference, he came to ours, and he talked about \nwhy this is important for them to have the flexibility to establish \nconfidence in the mortgage markets. We had a great opportunity to not \nonly address that confidence and make sure it was there so people have \nthe proper expectations that they can get a mortgage--and a reasonable \none--but we did other things that failed to fix the ultimate problem.\n  As you play out this bill, if you look at the negative long-run end \nof it, the\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\nAmerican taxpayers have the potential to be on the hook for $3.9 \ntrillion. There are some Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reforms in there. \nThis body has known for 15 years they needed to be there. We didn't do \nanything about putting those reforms in there until it became a crisis.\n  The point I am making is, why are we waiting for crises? Once the \ncrises get here, why do we bend to the political wills of the short \nterm rather than address the long-term structural problems that are out \nthere?\n  So there is no question we have helped a lot of people with the bill \nwe passed, but you have to ask the question, What is this going to do \nto everybody else who pays their mortgage and anybody who wants to get \na mortgage in the future and continues to keep their commitments? What \nwe have done is raise the interest rates. We have raised the cost on \nanybody who purchases a home in this country for the next 15 years.\n  What else have we done? We have put $3.9 billion out in CDBG funds to \nbuy homes that have already been foreclosed from the banks--from the \nbanks--the very people who created part of this mess we just bailed out \nwith $3.9 billion of our grandchildren's money.\n  So here we go, we are saying we are fixing the problem, but we are \nworking on it only when it is in crisis. Then, when we have the \npolitical momentum to do what is right and fix the long term and the \nshort term, what do we do? We run because we are more interested in our \npolitical futures, in our political careers than we are the \nopportunities and potential employment opportunities and lifestyles for \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Just as my colleagues have been talking about energy, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee very well knows that the time to address the problems we \nare talking about right now in terms of more production was 15 years \nago. Now the Senate sits stuck because we are worried about the \npolitical fallout of perhaps having amendments to drill where the oil \nis and that might not fit one political party's agenda. But I will tell \nyou what, it fits the American people's agenda. So we have this debate \nand this division that is becoming partisan. It is all on the basis of \nhow do we look good in November. I want to tell you, none of us look \ngood to the American people, because we are not fixing the problems on \na timely basis. We are not allowing the historical precedents of this \nbody, which is debate and amendments, to mold and create legislation \nthat adequately reflects the risks and problems that future generations \nare going to encounter.\n\n  We are working on energy here, and the big cloud hanging over the \nroom that nobody wants to talk about is carbon and global warming. \nLet's take a minute and say I am wrong and that global warming and \ncarbon is a tremendous problem for this country. Everybody who believes \nthat--and I don't dishonor their belief--knows if we started today \ndoing everything we could do, it will take us 30 years to get off of \ncarbon-based fuels. Everybody agrees with that. What are we going to do \nbetween now and the next 30 years? How are we going to address the \nproblem?\n  This year, American taxpayers sent $700 billion of their money--a \nlarge portion of it--to countries that would like to see us done in. We \nare going to continue to do that until such time as we have a cogent \nenergy policy, regardless of global warming or carbon problems. It is \nat least going to take 30 years. So we ought to take that out of the \nrealm and say: How do we quit giving away our fortune, our future, and \nour assets to other people? Even if we all agreed on global warming, we \ncan all agree it will take a long time to transition away from carbon-\nbased fuels. Why would we not have a debate on every possible way in \nwhich we can find more American energy, American resources, American \nsecurity, and use less foreign resources?\n  I noted on the floor on Monday that our national security is at \nextreme risk today. There is a historical precedent. When the Egyptians \ntook over the Suez Canal, the British and French had a great amount of \ndebt. We owned most of it. We were adamantly opposed to them attacking \nEgypt to bring back the Suez Canal under their control. We didn't fire \nthe first shot against the French and English. Do you know what we told \nthem? We said: If you do this, we are going to put your debt onto the \nmarket. We will wreck your economy. We will create inflation and create \na decreased standard of living. So you dare not do this. Do you know \nwhat. They knew it would happen and that we would do that. \nConsequently, a war was averted.\n  Think now, with China owning a trillion dollars of our debt, and \nanother trillion dollars in the Middle East. What happens if they don't \nlike our foreign policy and they decide to dump our debt onto the \nmarket? How much national security do we have?\n  So the debate about energy is not just about the $2,400 that is \nkilling every American family, which represents the amount of money \nthey are paying additionally this year that they didn't have to pay \nlast year for energy. It is making them make choices they have never \nhad to make before, making them make sacrifices they have never had to \nmake before; and it is because of us, because we failed them, because \nwe didn't solve this problem 15 years ago. But it also puts at risk the \nsecurity--not just financial but the national security and freedom and \nliberty for them, their children, and the generations that follow.\n  So the idea that we would not utilize every potential resource \nAmerica has to solve this energy crisis, the fact we will not be \nallowed and are not allowed to have a true debate with true amendments \nthat bring that forth to the American public, says we are highly \ndysfunctional, and that it is all about the next election, and it is \nnever about the good and long-term interests of the country.\n  That has to stop in this body. It has to stop. It doesn't matter if \nit is a Democrat or a Republican. It has to stop for future generations \nof this country. We need to quit worrying about whether we get \nreelected and start working on what is in the best long-term interests \nof this country.\n  Finally, I want to make a comment about this. The majority leader \nfiled cloture on a motion to proceed to a bill he calls--I don't \nremember what it is called. It is 8 percent of the bills we have passed \nby unanimous consent, which he wrapped up into one bill, and on which \nhe is not going to allow amendments. Again, it is the same procedure. \nWe are going to grow the Government, create 36 new programs, and spend \n$11.3 billion. We are going to do that without the ability to amend \nthose bills.\n  Half of those bills, I agree, we ought to do. What I don't agree \nwith--which is part of the problem in terms of our future--is we should \nnot get rid of the waste in the rest of the Federal Government so we \nare able to pay to do good things. Documented by the GAO, the \nCongressional Research Service, the various inspectors general, and the \nCongressional Budget Office is that we have $300 billion worth of waste \nor fraud in the Federal Government every year. Now we are going to put \na bill on the floor that is going to grow the Government more, and not \none of them attacks any of that waste.\n  That is wrong procedurally, but let me tell you what is really wrong \nwith it. It ignores the very process every family in this country has \nto go through. If they want to do something new, they don't have the \nability to charge it to somebody else. They have to make a discernible, \nvery careful calculation about what their priorities are, and they have \nto decide what they are going to give up if they are going to do \nsomething new. It is amazing to me that this body is so averse to \ngetting rid of waste. I understand it, and I know what it is about. \nPoliticians are averse to offending anybody. What we better have is \npoliticians who are willing to offend this generation so that the next \ntwo generations can inhabit and receive and welcome the liberty our \nFounders intended for us to have.\n  So we are going to have $11 billion on the floor sometime next week, \nand we are going to talk about subhuman primate transfer and the War of \n1812 Commission, but we are not going to work to solve the energy \nproblems of the people in this country. We are going to talk about \ndoing things the CDC and the NIH already have the power to do, but it \ndoesn't look good because we cannot have a press release or press \nconference and say we didn't do something for a lobbyist's special \ninterest.\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\nWe are not going to create nuclear generation or go after the oil \nshale, and we are not going to go off the coast to find, in an \nenvironmentally friendly way, resources that will lessen that $700 \nbillion of our Treasury we ship out of the country every year. Instead, \nwe are going to do things that politically look good. If you oppose \nthem, you might politically look bad. But we are not going to address \nthe real issues in front of the country, as a whole.\n  It is an amazement to me that when the figures were released, they \nreflected 9 percent of the people have confidence in the Senate. I \nwonder where those people are. If they are paying attention to this \nplace, they could not have any confidence in it, because we are not \naddressing the real issues that are, in fact, impacting America today, \nAmerican families today but, more importantly, national security today \nand tomorrow, and the wealth, health, and well-being of future \ngenerations.\n  When I heard the majority leader today say he had, in fact, made an \noffer to where we could offer amendments of any type on the Energy \nbill, I felt sorry for him, because what happened is he put himself in \na hole because of politics. You see, there is a group of people in this \ncountry--and they are in the minority now--who don't think we ought to \ndrill anywhere; that we should not explore on land or off land; that we \nshould not use coal at all, even if we can do it cleanly; and that we \nshould not expand wind or solar. And to address that political \ncomponent, the majority leader has put himself in a box. He won't be \nhurt by it. He has the toughest job in this body, so my hat is off to \nhim because it is difficult. Who is going to be hurt is every American. \nEvery American. The stubborn resistance to not allow amendments to \nallow us to get rid of this $700 billion we are paying out, to create a \ntransformed platform where we can become at least somewhat more energy \nindependent, that we, in fact, lower the risk for our national security \nthrough some increased energy independence, is a tragedy we will all \npay a great deal for.\n  It is time for a rethink in this country. It is time for a rethink in \nthis body. It is time for the partisanship to go out. It is time to \nthink not about our next election, not about who is going to be \nPresident, not how you position a political party, but how in fact you \ndo the work the American people need us to do to secure their future, \nand do it in a way that says I am willing to give up my Senate seat to \ndo what is best for this country in the long run. Anything less than \nthat from us is cowardice.\n  I will paraphrase Martin Luther King, when he talked about how people \nmake decisions. He said vanity asks the question, ``Is it popular?'' \nCowardice asks the question, ``Is it expedient?'' But conscience asks \nthe question, ``Is it right?''\n  We are asking the wrong questions in this body. We are putting the \nwrong questions before the American people. We need to get back to \nconscience--not expediency, not vanity, and not popularity. We need to \nbe about the country's business. My great regret is we are about \npoliticians' business and not about this country's business.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my deep appreciation to \nSenator Coburn. I believe that is one of the most important speeches I \nhave heard in the 12 years I have been in this Senate. We are going to \nhave a test. This body will be tested in the days to come, it appears, \nbecause some Members who run the railroad are unhappy that one Member \nof this Senate--the hardest working Member of the Senate and one of the \nmost intelligent Members of the Senate and one of the most principled \nMembers of the Senate--has an odd view about legislation.\n  Senator Coburn believes we ought to read legislation and, if there is \nsomething wrong with it, before we pass it, we should try to fix it. He \nbelieves we are spending too much money--and we are.\n  I will note that, according to the conservative way of figuring debt, \nlast year our deficit was $177 billion. Already this year, we have done \na $150 billion stimulus package. We have done other things. The economy \nis slowing down. Our deficit this fiscal year, ending September 30, is \nlikely to be $450 billion, maybe $500 billion. If you figure it another \nway, it can be another $150 billion more.\n  So isn't it good that we have a Senator who will stand up here and \nfight to try to contain the recklessness we have ongoing in this \nbody? He would actually read legislation and spot the weaknesses \nbecause I have watched him. I don't know how he possibly has the time \nto do all that he does. And it is for America.\n\n  One of the oddest things about this body I have observed--and I have \nbeen one, on occasion, to hold legislation also and object to certain \nparts in it. I am sure Senator Coburn has seen this. If you object to \nsomething because it adversely affects Oklahoma or Alabama or \nTennessee, some special interest in your State, why, that is fine. That \nis quite acceptable. Every Senator has to protect their own special \ninterest in their State. That is why you are here. But if you actually \nprotest a piece of legislation because it is bad policy, because it \ndoes not further America's legitimate national interest, because it \ndumps wealth and debt on our grandchildren, then that is ridiculous. \nWhat is the matter? You are just a crank. You are just trying to slow \ndown the machine. You are stopping the train.\n  I am telling you, this is a big deal that is coming up. This body is \nfamous for unlimited debate. On a number of pieces of legislation they \nwill ask the question--the majority leader and others frequently ask a \nquestion, and this is what they say: I ask unanimous consent that this \npiece of legislation pass--maybe 100, 200, 500 pages--without an \namendment, without any debate, and we go straight to a vote and just \npass it.\n  How many Members of this body actually read it? Very few, if any. \nSenator Coburn tries to read them. He tries to analyze them. He does \nthe right thing that every Senator should do. If he sees something that \nneeds to be debated or corrected, he objects because he is not ready to \nconsent. Isn't that fundamentally it? He is not prepared to consent \nbecause he thinks there is something bad in it for America. He is one \nof the most principled people I know in committing to what is best for \nAmerica--not just Oklahoma but for America.\n  So the majority leader has gotten his back up. He just wants all \nthese bills to go through, and he doesn't want to have them brought up.\n  Senator Coburn has repeatedly improved pieces of legislation. I hope \nif we proceed with this debate--and I don't know if Senator Coburn \npossibly has time--but I would like to see brought out on the floor of \nthis Senate some of the corrections and improvements to hundreds of \npieces of legislation that he has achieved by standing up and saying: I \nam not going to consent until you fix this problem. You know it is bad, \ngo on and agree to it. And frequently they will agree. They will say \npolitics made us do it. We really didn't favor that anyway, Tom. But \nmaybe if it is the only way we can pass it, we will just do it and do \nthe right thing. So legislation is improved time and time and time \nagain as a result of his work.\n  I know with regard to this African AIDS piece of legislation, I met \nwith a group from Africa--a grandmother whose daughter died from AIDS \nand who had her grandchild with her who has AIDS--and they objected to \nseveral different things in that bill. They said they would rather have \nno bill than if we pass it the way it was originally written.\n  Senator Coburn--Dr. Coburn--understands this, and he put his foot \ndown. He made them improve that bill before he would agree to have it \ncome up for a vote or support it, which he did eventually.\n  I am just saying the good government crowd is being spun around, and \nmany in the media are being spun around that good government is on the \nside of those who don't like people who put holds on legislation. I \nwould say it is crystal clear that anybody who loves this country, who \nworries about reckless spending, who wants integrity in government \nshould be on the side of a Senator who will stand up and read the \nlegislation, who is prepared to come to the floor and debate the \nproblems he\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\nsees in it, and who will offer amendments to make it better. That is \nwhat a Senator ought to do.\n  That is what this Senate should be. It will be a dark day, it will be \na day of shame in this Senate if we cobble all these pieces of \nlegislation together and ram it through without any opportunity to \namend it. That is what the plan is, as I understand it, to just cobble \nup 36 pieces of legislation that people have concerns about and just \nfile for cloture, shut off debate, and pass them all. That is not good \npolicy. It will be a dark day for this Senate.\n  I am so proud I had the opportunity to be here and hear Senator \nCoburn's speech. He is doing the right thing for this country. I am \nproud of him and I will be supporting him and I think a lot of others \nwill too.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator for \nhis remarks. I stayed also to hear Senator Coburn, and I am glad I did. \nIt was an important speech for this body in a whole variety of ways.\n  The Senator from Alabama spoke about one of the ways, but another way \nis that he reminded us that we are here not to advance our own \npolitical interests. I don't think most of us feel as if we are. We \ncome here from a variety of different directions. For most of us, it is \nan accident we are here. We don't take ourselves all that seriously. We \nknow it is just a set of circumstances that put us here, and we work \nhard. I think most of us get up every day hoping by the end of the day \nthat we will think of something constructive to do that will help the \ncountry. But the functioning of the Senate has failed us in our ability \nto do that.\n  I have tried to put my finger on it over the last 6 years. I am not \nsure I have all the answers. I came here 40 years ago, with Howard \nBaker, in 1967. I was very young, just out of law school, and I watched \nthings. It is never very easy--in a big complex country like this--to \nresolve things, and so many of the tougher issues get thrown here. We \nare supposed to have big issues and fierce debates and big arguments \nand differences of opinion. That is what we are for. But the tradition \nhas always been that when they come here, we not only bring them up and \ndiscuss them, but we resolve them; that we come to some conclusion. \nThat is a part of what Senator Coburn says as well.\n  We are not able to do that when the structure of the Senate keeps us \nfor 9 days, as an example, from dealing with the single most important \nissue facing our country--high gas prices.\n  Senator Coburn spoke about another equally important issue to our \ncountry--our fiscal condition in the country. So we need to think about \nwhat we need to do to change the structure of our Senate. I know many \non the other side must feel the same way. I served with some of them \nwhen we were Governors and we were of different parties. I know they \nare well intentioned. We have our private conversations. We all express \nto each other our disappointment that we are not able to focus on a \nmajor issue and show respect for our opinions and then come to a \nresult. We must do that.\n  Our country faces many serious challenges. The fiscal condition of \nour country has to be dealt with in the next 6 years. It has to be \ndealt with. The challenge of energy independence has to be dealt with. \nOur health care system has to be dealt with. We can't do that with a \ndysfunctional Senate. We simply can't do that. So we need to dedicate \nourselves to working across party lines and to putting the country \nfirst and partisan considerations second.\n  I think most of us would rather do that. But there are a few here who \nprevent that, and perhaps we just need to overcome it. Maybe we are \nspending all our spare time in too many partisan meetings. Maybe we \nneed to spend more together.\n  But I stayed to listen to Senator Coburn because I respect him. There \nare very few Senators who are more valuable in our Senate than he. He \nis obviously here not for some partisan purpose. He has a sense of \npurpose about our country and about our Senate. I commend him for it, \nand I am glad I had the privilege of hearing him speak this afternoon.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/26/senate-section/article/S7521-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7521-S7523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been watching the debate over the \nintervening time this week and, frankly, I am appalled that we cannot \naddress energy prices at this time, because we cannot get together from \na bipartisan standpoint.\n  Today the Senate voted on a motion to proceed to S. 3186, a bill to \nprovide funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or \nwhat is commonly referred to as LIHEAP. I have a long history of \nsupporting the LIHEAP program and have voted for almost every increase \nin the program that has been proposed in Congress. But today's vote is \ndifferent. It is not a vote about making sure our low-income citizens \nhave the heating and cooling assistance they need, because they already \ndo under the existing program. There is $100 million still left in the \nprogram. Most of that money was for heating last winter, but we had \nthat much left over.\n  So what is the emergency here? On top of the existing surplus in the \nprogram, the program will also be fully funded for the coming winter \nwhen we pass a continuing resolution which will keep all the Government \nprograms running at the level they were funded at last year. So let's \nnot pretend the LIHEAP program is not in place or that it will not be \nfunded for the coming year.\n  As you well know, each year the Congress appropriates the Government \nfunding needs through 13 appropriations bills. Each bill is handled by \nseparate subcommittees of the full Senate Committee on Appropriations. \nI applaud the Appropriations Committee and its subcommittees because \nthey have done a good job of preparing and marking up their various \nappropriation bills.\n  But there is one problem. Our majority leader has announced we will \nnot be passing any of these bills this year. Instead, we will be \npassing a continuing resolution that I referred to. Why this \nannouncement? Why can't we pass any appropriations bills this year? \nThere is still plenty of time. I can tell you that Republicans have \nmany amendments prepared for those bills that would allow our Nation to \nproduce more domestic oil. But the anti-oil extremists calling the \nshots in the Democratic Party cannot allow votes on finding more oil \nbecause they know those votes would succeed. That is what this is all \nabout here. That is why we have had a very difficult time and have had \nto vote against cloture.\n  If we could do what is normally done in this great legislative body, \nand that is bring up our amendments and vote them up or down or move to \ntable them if they want to, we could get this matter over in a very \nshort period of time. But our friends on the other side know it would \nbe a considerably different bill than the Band-Aid bill they have had \non the floor, the speculation bill.\n  We need a comprehensive approach to it and, as Members on both sides, \nwe need to vote on these important amendments.\n  Unfortunately for the Democratic Party, the poor are beginning to \nwake up that the liberals who they have always looked to are behind the \nwar on the poor. By the ``war on the poor,'' I refer to the movement by \nthe extremists to close off every good domestic oil resource, which is \nthe direct cause of the high energy prices we Americans face. We have \nheard of the $700 billion we are spending overseas when we have oil \nright here in America that would alleviate this type of expenditure and \nkeep the money home.\n  Democrats have begun to recognize the position they are in and are \ntrying to have it both ways with today's vote.\n  Earlier this month a group of protesters came to Capitol Hill, \ncalling on Congress to stop the war on the poor--some of that is \nobscured by signs, by\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\ngroups, and Congressmen--who are closing off America's energy \nresources. Included in this group were pastors and civil rights \nleaders, calling on this body to unlock America's oil resources for the \nbenefit of Americans, and especially for the benefit of lower income \nAmericans.\n  One of the participants was Bishop Harry Jackson. I wish to quote \nsome of his remarks for the Record. These are his words:\n\n       I am a registered Democrat but this has nothing to do with \n     partisan politics. Unless the public understands that there \n     are specific people and organizations that are fueling this \n     war against the poor, nothing will change and the poor will \n     continue to suffer. We will unmask those behind this war, \n     regardless of their political party or ideology. Party labels \n     and partisan ideologies are meaningless when it comes to \n     protecting the lives of America's most vulnerable citizens.\n\n  That is Bishop Harry Jackson, a Democrat, who has been calling the \nbluff here.\n  By the way, you can see more about the ``stop the war on the poor'' \nmovement on the Web at www.stopwaronpoor.org.\n  Democrats in Congress must choose between the very well-funded \nextreme anti-oil interests or the poor, because on energy prices there \nis no compromise between the two. To be honest, I believe Americans \nhave put their finger on this conflict even before their \nRepresentatives in Congress have fully begun to understand it.\n  However, the fact that this vote was scheduled today when it was not \neven necessary is an indication that they are beginning to catch on.\n  Look at this photo of the protesters:\n\n       My Family Needs Affordable Energy.\n       Food or Fuel, Don't Make Me Choose.\n       Congress Needs To Act.\n\n  I think Congress does need to act. These are folks who are being hit \nhard.\n  This next chart has a couple of examples of the Democrats' war on the \npoor. Both these examples were referred to during the war on poor \nprotest. Here we see that Representative Henry Waxman--great friend of \nmine, no question, I care a great deal for him--but he passed a bill \nthat bans the Federal Government from purchasing oil sands from Canada, \nunless he can prove it has a lesser greenhouse gas footprint than \ngasoline. In other words, we would be turning away 1.5 million barrels \nof oil a day from a friendly neighbor in favor of oil from the Middle \nEast and Russia. What about the greenhouse gas footprint of shipping \nthat oil all the way across the world and all the way over here?\n\n  Representative Waxman's section 526, 2007 Defense bill bans the \nFederal procurement of oil shale, oil sands, and coal to liquids. It \nturns away 1.5 million barrels a day from Canada, our neighbors to the \nNorth, our friends to the North, in favor of oil from the Middle East \nand Venezuela.\n  Let me go further here. Last year, Representative Mark Udall, who \nrepresents Aspen, CO, passed a 1-year moratorium on commercial oil \nshale leasing.\n  Keep in mind, Estonia has been developing oil from oil shale for over \n90 years--Estonia. I might add that Brazil has been developing oil from \noil shale for decades. It can be done. We know how to do it. We have \nthe companies willing to do it. We have people willing to put up the \ncapital to do it. Oil shale has plenty of oil, and we can develop it, \nbut instead we say no.\n  Last year Representative Mark Udall, who represents Aspen, CO, passed \na 1-year moratorium on commercial oil shale leasing. At first I thought \nhe was seeking a little extra time for comments, but a year moratorium \non leases is a very long time. But believe it or not, after the solid \nyear that will expire this September, he is now trying to extend the \nmoratorium for another year when we are sending $700 billion every year \noverseas to some who are not our friends, with not a dime of that \ncoming back to benefit us.\n  I guess there are not too many poor in Aspen. I love Aspen and the \npeople there. It is a beautiful place, but it is no secret that it is \nhome to very many wealthy elites and environmentalists. I have no \nproblem with Representative Udall in choosing the elite and anti-oil \ncrowd over the poor. That is his constituency. But let's be honest \nabout the choices we are making around here. Ironically, the local \ngovernments in Colorado's oil shale areas support oil shale \ndevelopment. But it is the wealthy environmentally minded citizens like \nthe good people of the not so nearby Aspen who are opposing it.\n  I addressed the environmental benefits of oil shale production \nearlier in my remarks, but extreme views are sometimes extremely hard \nto change.\n  The American people are not asking for a big appropriation or some \ndifficult action by Congress. They are not asking us to give oil \ncompanies subsidies or environmental loopholes. All they ask is they \nare asking this Congress to stop locking up our domestic oil resources. \nThey are asking us to stop relying on foreign governments who are much \nsmarter than we are about developing their own oil resources. They are \nasking us to find more oil and use less oil, and that is our theme over \nhere because it is true, it is right, and it should be followed.\n  Let's be honest about why the Senate has brought up this amendment \ntoday, this LIHEAP amendment. It is because the Democrats are trying to \nplease the anti-oil extremists by not allowing any votes on oil \ndrilling or on appropriations bills or on development of our oil shale \nlands where we have at least 3 trillion barrels of oil--about 2 \ntrillion of which, most experts say, are recoverable.\n  At the same time, the Democrats must pretend they have not sold out \nthe poor by their policies that force high gas prices. I am not \ninclined to play their political game and support their effort to shift \nthe debate away from unlocking our Nation's energy potential and I am \nparticularly not inclined to support this vote, because this proposal \nbusts the budget while not providing any additional benefit to the \nLIHEAP program.\n  As I have said before, the LIHEAP program has a $100 million surplus \nright now. And when we pass the continuing resolution either in \nSeptember or October, it will carry the same program over for the next \nyear. There is no problem at all with regard to the LIHEAP or the low-\nincome energy proposal we already have in law that has a $100 million \nsurplus.\n  So this is a sham. And it was a shame today to see that happening on \nthe floor of the Senate, when we could be addressing the fact that we \nhave it within our own power to develop our own resources to bring down \nthe price of gas so the poor will not be spending up to 50 percent of \ntheir income on gas just to stay alive.\n  This is a joke. I hear the lamentations over there like they really \ncare about solving the energy crisis. Come on. They are dominated by \nthe anti-oil extreme environmentalists whom they are afraid to buck. If \nyou look at the facts and if you look at what is going on and you look \nat what we can do if we were allowed to, it is embarrassing. Some of \nour good Democratic friends would vote for offshore oil drilling. I \nthink a number of them would vote to develop our oil shale knowing that \ncould mean a great future for our people. And literally, with the high \nprice of oil today, it could very well be the answer. I know some of \nthem really would like to develop our oil resources in our country \ntoday. There may even be some who, having thought it through, are \nwilling to develop ANWR. Now we find that there are 98 billion \npotential barrels of oil up there in the Northwest. Are we going to \ncontinue to sit on our hands and spend $700 billion of our Treasury for \noverseas oil when we have it within our means to alleviate that?\n  That is what they are arguing. I care for every Democrat on the \nfloor, every Democrat on the other side. I work with them all the time. \nI try to bring us together. But on this issue, they plain cannot break \nthrough the stranglehold these extreme environmentalists have on them \nand allow us to develop our own resources so that the poor are not left \nholding the bag, which is where they are right now. It is not just the \npoor, it is everybody in America who is paying $4-plus per gallon of \ngas. Look at this woman's poster on this chart: ``My family needs \naffordable energy.'' They should have the word on there ``now.''\n  ``Food or fuel, do not make me choose.''\n  ``Congress needs to act.'' There ought to be a word ``now'' there.\n  Frankly, while we develop the oil resources, if we are permitted to \ndo it, if our colleagues will wake up on the other side, and let us go \nforward and\n\n[[Page S7523]]\n\nget this done, we will develop wind, solar, geothermal, solar thermal, \nwe will develop not only hybrids but plug-in hybrid cars. No one on \nthis side has said no to that. We've been promoting alternatives over \nhere.\n  In our Utah papers today was a little company in Utah called Raser \nTechnologies that will have a truck, and they are talking about fleets \nof trucks that can get up to 140 miles per gallon. These would be plug-\nin trucks with up to 140 miles a gallon. Tesla Motors has developed a \ncar that gets 120 miles per gallon. My Clear Act that we passed in the \n2005 Energy bill provides for an accentuation of hybrid vehicles. It \ngives incentives to do that--not just hybrid vehicles but alternative \nfuel vehicles and alternative fuel infrastructure. You have seen the \nads, you have seen the Honda ad talking about a fuel-cell vehicle they \nhave already developed. What does that mean? It is a hydrogen vehicle. \nNuclear power is one of the ways we can produce a lot of hydrogen in \nthis country. But we have stopped nuclear development for so long now \nthat we do not have the hydrogen to be able to service those. We can \nput those vehicles out within the next 5 to 10 years, and Americans \ncould be driving them. There is not one drop of pollution, not one \nounce of pollution in all of those vehicles. But we cannot get the \nhydrogen because we do not have nuclear power and some of the other \npower we have to have. It is going take time to get us there. In the \ninterim, meantime, we have to have oil.\n  The last time I heard, as I have said many times on this floor and \notherwise, our cars, our trains, our planes, our ships, our trucks--\nthey run on oil. Until we can get all of these other things going, we \nneed to have oil. And we have it within our power to be able to have \noil domestically so that we are not throwing $700 billion away every \nyear and funding some people who are our enemies.\n  That is what is amazing to me, that some are so locked up with these \nextremists that they cannot--they know it is true, but they cannot do \nanything to promote any oil development. There is something terribly \nsick about that in a body this important. Should not this body be brave \nenough to do its best in the interests of our country to create more \nenergy and use less as we develop all of these other alternative forms?\n  They have even distorted T. Boone Pickens' words when he said we \ncannot drill ourselves out of this problem. He did not mean we should \nnot be drilling; he said we need to do all of these things. That is his \npitch. That is his energy program. He happens to be right. But until we \nget all of those other alternative forms going, and these alternative \nvehicles, we have to have oil, and we will continue to need oil. \nWithout it, the people who are left the most poor, the people who are \nleft without, the people who will struggle the most are the poor. I do \nnot understand why my colleagues cannot see that. I do not understand \nit because they claim to be for the poor. But these extremists take \nprecedence over the poor.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 18th anniversary of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. We have much to celebrate on this \noccasion. Signed into law 18 years ago, the ADA has fundamentally \nstrengthened our Nation with its promise of equal rights and \nopportunity for individuals with disabilities.\n  We can see the ADA's transformative effects on society, with our \npublic facilities, services, transportation, and telecommunications now \naccessible to millions who were excluded in the past. Even though the \nresults are easy for most of us to take for granted, they can mean the \ndifference between exclusion and full participation for a person with a \ndisability. The ADA has ushered in a new era of opportunity in the \nworkplace as well. After all, this legislation was intended to prohibit \ndiscriminatory job decisions in the same spirit of the other great \ncivil rights laws of our country.\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\n  The ADA both reflects and reinforces our commitment to the inclusion, \nunderstanding, and acceptance of all people--no matter their ability or \ndisability.\n  I have met countless Nevadans with disabilities over the years whose \nstories breathe life into the ideals set forth by the ADA. They want to \nlive, work, and pursue the American dream on equal footing with \neveryone else, and the ADA has paved the way for them to do so.\n  Nonetheless, the struggles that people with disabilities continue to \nface show that we still have a long way to go before the ADA's promise \nis fully realized. Economic independence, affordable health care, and \nthe dignity of equal treatment are still beyond the reach of too many, \nand poverty and isolation still afflict the majority of people with \ndisabilities. Unfortunately, court rulings in recent years have \nexacerbated these challenges by narrowing the ADA's coverage contrary \ncongressional intent. It is time to restore the ADA to the law it was \nmeant to be.\n  So let us renew our efforts to build upon the founding principles of \nthis landmark civil rights law. I look forward to continuing this vital \nwork in honor of all those who fought for its passage and on behalf of \neveryone today who cherishes the equality of opportunity promised by \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/26/senate-section/article/S7524-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7524-S7526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TOOLS OF PERSUASION AND INSPIRATION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues a speech on July 15 by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \nbefore the U.S. Global Leadership Campaign here in Washington, DC. In \nthis remarkable speech, Secretary Gates makes the case for the \nimprovement of the Nation's diplomatic and developmental capabilities--\nwhat he calls the ``tools of persuasion and inspiration''--that are as \n``indispensible'' to our security and prosperity as are our Armed \nForces.\n  If we have learned anything over the last 7 years it is that turning \nto our capable and proven military cannot be our only or dominant way \nof dealing with the challenges of a dangerous world. Secretary Gates \nwarns us of the ``creeping militarization'' of our Nation's foreign \npolicy.\n  Too often, and especially in a crisis, we turn to the military as the \nonly agency with the capacity and resources necessary and available for \nmeaningful action. Secretary Gates acknowledges this reality but \nchallenges us to make the changes that will improve the capacity, \nreadiness and availability of the Nation's nonmilitary agencies.\n  Secretary Gates calls for increasing the Nation's investment in the \ncapacity and capability of the Department of State and other \ndevelopment agencies. I agree; we have undermanned and underfunded them \nfor too long and we realize today more than ever the unwelcome \nconsequences of that neglect. This is a striking observation coming \nfrom the Secretary of Defense and should demand our attention.\n  More money alone, however, is not enough to bring our diplomatic and \ndevelopment agencies up to the capability and capacity levels needed \nfor the complexities and scope of the dangers around us. Secretary \nGates also calls for a greater integration of diplomatic and \ndevelopmental agencies with the military, international partners, and \nprivate groups. Current operations have demonstrated the disappointing \nresults of the lack of a fully integrated planning and execution system \nthat takes appropriate advantage of all the tools--diplomatic, \ndevelopmental, military, international, and private--necessary to \nresolve conflict.\n  Secretary Gates has laid before the Nation a very thoughtful and \nconvincing assessment of where we are and where we need to go in \nachieving the right balance of diplomatic, economic, and military \ncapability to deal with an uncertain and threatening world. I commend \nhis remarks to all Senators and ask unanimous consent that the July 15, \n2008, speech of Secretary Gates before the U.S. Global Leadership \nCampaign in Washington, DC, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSpeech to the U.S. Global Leadership Campaign as Delivered by Secretary \n               of Defense Robert M. Gates, July 15, 2008\n\n       Thank you very much for the introductions.\n       Thank you Condi Rice for the kind words, and above all, for \n     your principled and visionary leadership of the Department of \n     State.\n       One of the reasons I have rarely been invited to lecture in \n     political science departments--including at Texas A \n     because faculty correctly suspect that I would tell the \n     students that what their textbooks say about government does \n     not describe the reality I have experienced in working for \n     seven presidents. Organization charts, institutions, \n     statistics, structures, regulations, policies, committees, \n     and all the rest--the bureaucracy, if you will--are the \n     necessary pre-condition for effective government. But whether \n     or not it really works depends upon the people and their \n     relationships. For significant periods since I entered \n     government 42 years ago, the Secretary of State and Secretary \n     of Defense were not on speaking terms. The fact that Condi \n     and I actually get along means that our respective \n     bureaucracies understand that trying to provoke us to fight \n     with one another is not career-enhancing. Such efforts still \n     occur, of course. After all, this is Washington. But the \n     bureaucratic battles are a good deal more covert.\n       Of course, the human side of government is always a source \n     of both humor and embarrassment. Will Rogers once said, ``I \n     don't make jokes. I just watch the government and report the \n     facts.'' And the conduct of diplomacy, where--as Secretary \n     Rice can attest--protocol and propriety are so very \n     important, provides an especially fertile ground for \n     amusement.\n       For example, there was the time that President Nixon met \n     with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, shortly after Nixon \n     had appointed Henry Kissinger as Secretary of State. With \n     Golda Meir in that meeting was her very erudite foreign \n     minister, Abba Eban, a graduate of Cambridge. At one point in \n     the meeting, Nixon turned to Golda Meir and said, ``Just \n     think, we now both have Jewish foreign ministers.'' And \n     without missing a beat Golda Meir said, ``Yes, but mine \n     speaks English.''\n       Then there was the time that President Nixon visited Italy \n     and had a meeting with the Pope. Kissinger and Nixon had \n     along with them Secretary of Defense Mel Laird, but they \n     decided that Laird as, in effect, secretary of war shouldn't \n     be invited to meeting with the Pope. So, Nixon the next \n     morning went in for his private audience with the Pope, and \n     the other Americans waited outside for the general audience. \n     And who should come striding down the hall of the papal \n     apartments but Mel Laird smoking an enormous cigar; he had \n     decided he wanted in on the meeting. Kissinger was beside \n     himself, but finally said, ``Well, Mel, at least extinguish \n     the cigar.'' And so Laird stubbed out his cigar and put it in \n     his pocket.\n       The rest of the American party a few minutes later went in \n     to their meeting with the Pope, everyone took a seat. A \n     couple of minutes into the Pope's remarks, Kissinger heard \n     this little patting sound going on, he was in the second row \n     with Laird on the end, there was a wisp of smoke coming out \n     of Laird's pocket. Everything seemed under control. A couple \n     of minutes later, Kissinger heard this loud slapping noise. \n     He looked over smoke was billowing out of Laird's pocket. The \n     Secretary of Defense was on fire. Now the rest of the \n     delegation heard this slapping noise, and they thought they \n     were being cued to applaud the Pope. And so they did. And \n     Henry later told us, ``God only knows what his Holiness \n     thought, seeing the American secretary of defense immolating \n     himself, and the entire American party applauding the fact.''\n       I am honored to receive this award, and I consider it a \n     privilege to be associated with the United States Global \n     Leadership Campaign. It is a truly remarkable collection of \n     ``strange bedfellows''--from Save the Children to \n     Caterpillar, from Catholic Relief Services to AIPAC, and even \n     Boeing and Northrop Grumman. This organization has been a \n     prescient, and often lonely, advocate for the importance of \n     diplomacy and international development to America's vital \n     national interests--and I commend you for that.\n       Though my views on these subjects have become better known \n     through recent speeches, in many ways they originated and \n     were reinforced by my prior experience in government during \n     the Cold War. Looking back, it is clear that the strength of \n     America's military forces and intelligence capabilities--\n     along with the willingness to use them--held the Soviets at \n     bay for more than four decades. But there was another side to \n     that story and to that struggle. There was the Agency for \n     International Development overseeing development and \n     humanitarian assistance programs that improved--if not \n     saved--the lives of millions of people from disease, \n     starvation, and poverty. Our diplomats forged relationships \n     and bonds of trust, and built up reservoirs of expertise and \n     goodwill that proved invaluable over time. Countless people \n     in foreign countries wandered into a United States \n     Information Agency library, or heard from a visiting speaker \n     and had their opinions about America transformed by learning \n     about our history and culture and values. Others behind the \n     Iron Curtain were inspired to resist by what they heard on \n     Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America.\n\n[[Page S7525]]\n\n       In all, these non-military efforts--these tools of \n     persuasion and inspiration--were indispensable to the outcome \n     of the defining ideological struggle of the 20th century. I \n     believe that they are just as indispensable in the 21st \n     century--and maybe more so.\n       Just last month I approved a new National Defense Strategy \n     that calls upon us to ``Tap the full strength of America and \n     its people''--military and civilian, public and private--to \n     deal with the challenges to our freedom, prosperity, and \n     security around the globe.\n       In the campaign against terrorist networks and other \n     extremists, we know that direct military force will continue \n     to have a role. But over the long term, we cannot kill or \n     capture our way to victory. What the Pentagon calls \n     ``kinetic'' operations should be subordinate to measures to \n     promote participation in government, economic programs to \n     spur development, and efforts to address the grievances that \n     often lie at the heart of insurgencies and among the \n     discontented from which the terrorists recruit. It will \n     take the patient accumulation of quiet successes over time \n     to discredit and defeat extremist movements and their \n     ideology.\n       We also know that over the next 20 years and more certain \n     pressures--population, resource, energy, climate, economic, \n     and environmental--could combine with rapid cultural, social, \n     and technological change to produce new sources of \n     deprivation, rage, and instability. We face now, and will \n     inevitably face in the future, rising powers discontented \n     with the international status quo, possessing new wealth and \n     ambition, and seeking new and more powerful weapons. But, \n     overall, looking ahead, I believe the most persistent and \n     potentially dangerous threats will come less from ambitious \n     states, than failing ones that cannot meet the basic needs--\n     much less the aspirations--of their people.\n       In my travels to foreign capitals, I have been struck by \n     the eagerness of so many foreign governments to forge closer \n     diplomatic and security ties with the United States--ranging \n     from old enemies like Vietnam to new partners like India. \n     Nonetheless, regard for the United States is low among the \n     populations of many key nations--especially those of our \n     moderate Muslim allies.\n       This is important because much of our national security \n     strategy depends upon securing the cooperation of other \n     nations, which will depend heavily on the extent to which our \n     efforts abroad are viewed as legitimate by their publics. The \n     solution is not to be found in some slick PR campaign or by \n     trying to out-propagandize al-Qaeda, but rather through the \n     steady accumulation of actions and results that build trust \n     and credibility over time.\n       To do all these things, to truly harness the ``full \n     strength of America,'' as I said in the National Defense \n     Strategy, requires having civilian institutions of diplomacy \n     and development that are adequately staffed and properly \n     funded. Due to the leadership of Secretary Rice and before \n     her Secretary Powell, and with the continuing strong support \n     of the President, we have made significant progress towards \n     pulling ourselves out of the hole created not only by the \n     steep cutbacks in the wake of the Cold War--but also by the \n     lack of adequate resources for the State Department and the \n     entire foreign affairs account going back decades.\n       Since 2001, international affairs spending has about \n     doubled, State has begun hiring again, billions have been \n     spent to fight AIDS and malaria in Africa, the Millennium \n     Challenge Corporation is rewarding better governance in the \n     developing world, and Secretary Rice has launched a program \n     of transformational diplomacy to better posture the \n     diplomatic corps for the realities of this century. The \n     President's budget request this year, as Condi said, includes \n     more than 1,100 new Foreign Service officers, as well as a \n     response corps of civilian experts that can deploy on short \n     notice. And, for the first time in a long time, I sense real \n     bipartisan support in Congress for strengthening the civilian \n     foreign affairs budget.\n       Shortfalls nonetheless remain. Much of the total increase \n     in the international affairs budget has been taken up by \n     security costs and offset by the declining dollar, leaving \n     little left over for core diplomatic operations. These \n     programs are not well understood or appreciated by the \n     wider American public, and do not have a ready-made \n     political constituency that major weapons systems or \n     public works projects enjoy. As a result, the slashing of \n     the President's international affairs budget request has \n     too often become an annual Washington ritual--right up \n     there with the blooming of the cherry blossoms and the \n     Redskin's opening game.\n       As someone who once led an agency with a thin domestic \n     constituency, I am familiar with this dilemma. Since arriving \n     at the Pentagon I've discovered a markedly different budget \n     dynamic--not just in scale but the reception one gets on the \n     Hill. Congress often asks the military services for lists of \n     things that they need, but that the Defense Secretary and the \n     President were too stingy to request. As you can imagine, \n     this is one congressional tasking that prompts an immediate \n     and enthusiastic response.\n       It has become clear that America's civilian institutions of \n     diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned \n     and underfunded for far too long--relative to what we spend \n     on the military, and more important, relative to the \n     responsibilities and challenges our nation has around the \n     world. I cannot pretend to know the right dollar amount--I \n     know it's a good deal more than the one percent of the \n     federal budget that it is right now. But the budgets we are \n     talking about are relatively small compared to the rest of \n     government, a steep increase of these capabilities is well \n     within reach--as long as there is the political will and \n     wisdom to do it.\n       But even as we agree that more resources are needed, I \n     believe that there is more to this problem than how much \n     money is in the 150 Account. The challenge we face is how \n     best to integrate these tools of statecraft with the \n     military, international partners, and the private sector.\n       Where our government has been able to bring America's \n     civilian and the military assets together to support local \n     partners, there have been incredibly promising results. One \n     unheralded example, one you will not read about in the \n     newspapers, is in the Philippines. There the U.S. \n     Ambassador--Kristie Kenney--has overseen a campaign involving \n     multiple agencies working closely together with their \n     Philippine counterparts in a synchronized effort that has \n     delegitimized and rolled back extremists in Mindanao. Having \n     a strong, well-supported chief of mission has been crucial to \n     success.\n       The vastly larger, more complex international effort in \n     Afghanistan presents a different set of challenges. There are \n     dozens of nations, hundreds of NGOs, universities, \n     development banks, the United Nations, the European Union, \n     NATO--all working to help a nation beset by crushing poverty, \n     a bumper opium crop, and a ruthless and resilient insurgency. \n     Getting all these different elements to coordinate operations \n     and share best practices has been a colossal--and often all \n     too often unsuccessful--undertaking. The appointment this \n     spring of a UN special representative to coordinate civilian \n     reconstruction in Afghanistan is an important step forward. \n     And at the last NATO defense ministerial, I proposed a \n     civilian-military planning cell for Regional Command South \n     to bring unity to our efforts in that critically important \n     part of the country. And I asked Kai Eide, when I met with \n     him last week, to appoint a representative to participate \n     in this cell.\n       Repeating an Afghanistan or an Iraq--forced regime change \n     followed by nation-building under fire--probably is unlikely \n     in the foreseeable future. What is likely though, even a \n     certainty, is the need to work with and through local \n     governments to avoid the next insurgency, to rescue the next \n     failing state, or to head off the next humanitarian disaster.\n       Correspondingly, the overall posture and thinking of the \n     United States armed forces has shifted--away from solely \n     focusing on direct American military action, and towards new \n     capabilities to shape the security environment in ways that \n     obviate the need for military intervention in the future. \n     This approach forms the basis of our near-term planning and \n     influences the way we develop capabilities for the future. \n     This perspective also informed the creation of Africa \n     Command, with its unique interagency structure, a deputy \n     commander who is an ambassador not a general, as well as \n     Southern Command's new orientation and priorities in Latin \n     America.\n       Overall, even outside Iraq and Afghanistan, the United \n     States military has become more involved in a range of \n     activities that in the past were perceived to be the \n     exclusive province of civilian agencies and organizations. \n     This has led to concern among many organizations--perhaps \n     including many represented here tonight about what's seen as \n     a creeping ``militarization'' of some aspects of America's \n     foreign policy.\n       This is not an entirely unreasonable sentiment. As a career \n     CIA officer I watched with some dismay the increasing \n     dominance of the defense 800 pound gorilla in the \n     intelligence arena over the years. But that scenario can be \n     avoided if--as is the case with the intelligence community \n     today--there is the right leadership, adequate funding of \n     civilian agencies, effective coordination on the ground, and \n     a clear understanding of the authorities, roles, and \n     understandings of military versus civilian efforts, and how \n     they fit, or in some cases don't fit, together.\n       We know that at least in the early phases of any conflict, \n     contingency, or natural disaster, the U.S. military--as has \n     been the case throughout our history--will be responsible for \n     security, reconstruction, and providing basic sustenance and \n     public services. I make it a point to reinforce this message \n     before military audiences, to ensure that the lessons learned \n     and re-learned in recent years are not forgotten or again \n     pushed to the margins. Building the security capacity of \n     other nations through training and equipping programs has \n     emerged as a core and enduring military requirement, though \n     none of these programs go forward without the approval of the \n     Secretary of State.\n       In recent years the lines separating war, peace, diplomacy, \n     and development have become more blurred, and no longer fit \n     the neat organizational charts of the 20th century. All the \n     various elements and stakeholders working in the \n     international arena-- military and civilian, government and \n     private--have learned to stretch outside their comfort \n     zone to work together and achieve results.\n       For example, many humanitarian and international \n     organizations have long prided themselves on not taking sides \n     and avoiding any association with the military. But as we've \n     seen in the vicious attacks on Doctors Without Borders in \n     Afghanistan, and the\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\n     U.N. Mission in Iraq, violent extremists care little about \n     these distinctions.\n       To provide clearer rules of the road for our efforts, the \n     Defense Department and ``InterAction''--the umbrella \n     organization for many U.S.-based NGOs--have, for the first \n     time, jointly developed guidelines for how the military and \n     NGOs should relate to one another in a hostile environment. \n     The Pentagon has also refined its guidance for humanitarian \n     assistance to ensure that military projects are aligned with \n     wider U.S. foreign policy objectives and do not duplicate or \n     replace the work of civilian organizations.\n       Broadly speaking, when it comes to America's engagement \n     with the rest of the world, you probably don't hear this \n     often from a Secretary of Defense, it is important that the \n     military is--and is clearly seen to be--in a supporting role \n     to civilian agencies. Our diplomatic leaders--be they in \n     ambassadors' suites or on the seventh floor of the State \n     Department--must have the resources and political support \n     needed to fully exercise their statutory responsibilities in \n     leading American foreign policy.\n       The challenge facing our institutions is to adapt to new \n     realities while preserving those core competencies and \n     institutional traits that have made them so successful in the \n     past. The Foreign Service is not the Foreign Legion, and the \n     United States military should never be mistaken for the Peace \n     Corps with guns. We will always need professional Foreign \n     Service officers to conduct diplomacy in all its dimensions, \n     to master local customs and culture, to negotiate treaties, \n     and advance American interests and strengthen our \n     international partnerships. And unless the fundamental nature \n     of humankind and of nations radically changes, the need--and \n     will to use--the full range of military capabilities to \n     deter, and if necessary defeat, aggression from hostile \n     states and forces will remain.\n       In closing, I am convinced, irrespective of what is \n     reported in global opinion surveys, or recounted in the \n     latest speculation about American decline, that around the \n     world, men and women seeking freedom from despotism, want, \n     and fear will continue to look to the United States for \n     leadership.\n       As a nation, we have, over the last two centuries, made our \n     share of mistakes. From time to time, we have strayed from \n     our values; on occasion, we have become arrogant in our \n     dealings with other countries. But we have always corrected \n     our course. And that is why today, as throughout our history, \n     this country remains the world's most powerful force for \n     good--the ultimate protector of what Vaclav Havel once called \n     ``civilization's thin veneer.'' A nation Abraham Lincoln \n     described as mankind's ``last, best hope.''\n       For any given cause or crisis, if America does not lead, \n     then more often than not, what needs to be done simply won't \n     get done. In the final analysis, our global responsibilities \n     are not a burden on the people or on the soul of this nation. \n     They are, rather, a blessing.\n       Thank you for this award and I salute you for all that you \n     do--for America, and for humanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/26/senate-section/article/S7526-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 3344.

A bill to reauthorize and improve the Federal Financial \nAssistance Management Improvement Act of 1999; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nFinancial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 2008 with Senator \nLieberman.\n  In 1999, I introduced the Federal Financial Assistance Management \nImprovement Act of 1999 with Senators Lieberman, Thompson and Durbin. \nMy good friend from Ohio, Congressman Portman, introduced companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives, and working together we \nwere able to enact that legislation to improve the effectiveness and \nperformance of Federal financial assistance programs, simplify Federal \nfinancial assistance application and reporting requirements, improve \nthe delivery of services to the public and coordinate the delivery of \nsuch services.\n  Progress was made under the provisions of the Federal Financial \nAssistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, commonly known as ``PL \n106-107.'' A 2005 Government Accountability Office, GAO, report noted \nthat ``[m]ore than 5 years after passage of P.L. 106-107, cross-agency \nwork groups have made some progress in streamlining aspects of the \nearly phases of the grants life cycle and in some specific aspects of \noverall grants management . . .'' However, GAO noted that work remained \nto be done, and in 2006 suggested that Congress consider reauthorizing \nthe Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999. \nThe Act expired in November, and I believe Congress should heed GAO's \nadvice and reauthorize this important law.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senator Lieberman reauthorizes \nthe Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act and makes \nimprovements to that Act based on the 2005 and 2006 recommendations of \nGAO. The bill requires the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, OMB, to develop a public Web site that allows grant applicants \nto search and\n\n[[Page S7527]]\n\napply for grants, report on the use of grants, and provide required \ncertifications and assurances for grants. I believe such a Web site \nwill enhance the transparency required by the Federal Funding \nAccountability and Transparency Act that Congress enacted last year.\n  The bill also requires the Director of OMB to develop a strategic \nplan for an end-to-end electronic capability that allows non-Federal \nentities to manage Federal financial assistance and requires each \nFederal agency to plan actions to implement that strategic plan. Each \nFederal agency would be required to report to OMB on progress made in \nachieving its objectives under the OMB strategic plan, and the Director \nof OMB would be required to report to Congress biennially on progress \nmade in implementing the Federal Financial Assistance Management \nImprovement Act.\n  In 1999 I said the Federal Financial Assistance Management \nImprovement Act was an important step toward detangling the web of \nduplicative Federal grants available to States, localities and \ncommunity organizations. While some progress has been made to detangle \nthat web, work remains to be done, and I hope that Congress will \nquickly reauthorize this law so that OMB and Federal agencies continue \nthose efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3341\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve access to technology by and increase \nentrepreneurship among small businesses located in rural communities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on \nbehalf of small businesses in the rural areas of my State, as well as \nrural small businesses nationwide. This is because small businesses are \ncrucial to rural communities as they account for 90 percent of all \nrural establishments. In 1998, small firms employed 60 percent of rural \nworkers and over 1.2 million small firms were located in rural areas. \nWhile Louisiana has major metropolitan areas such as New Orleans, Baton \nRouge, Shreveport, and Lafayette, my State has countless rural \ncommunities which are vital to our State's economy. In fact, Louisiana \nhas 13.8 million acres of hardwood and softwood forests, in addition to \nthe fact that the State is one of the 10 largest producers of \nagricultural products. These include cotton, sugar cane, rice, pecans, \nsoybeans, strawberries, and cattle. We are proud of our natural and \nagricultural resources, just as Louisianans are proud of our culture \nand cuisine.\n  As I mentioned, rural small businesses are key to the economy in my \nState, just as they are in other States. While the Department of \nAgriculture has various programs to help rural communities, the Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA, remains the primary Federal agency \nfocused on promoting small businesses. From my positions on the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship as well as the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General \nGovernment, I have focused on improving SBA's ability to serve small \nbusinesses in Louisiana. One area that I believe this Congress can \ntruly make a difference in addressing the main challenges facing rural \nsmall businesses. In talking to various stakeholders, I have repeatedly \nheard that two of the traditional obstacles to small business expansion \nin rural areas are lack of access to technology and capital.\n  For my part, I would like to offer some commonsense solutions to help \naddress these and other challenges facing our rural small businesses. \nThese businesses are the backbone of our economy so we should give them \nevery opportunity to succeed. In particular, I am proud to introduce \ntoday the, ``Rural Small Business Enhancement Act of 2008.'' This bill \nprovides necessary improvements to SBA programs to help the agency \nbetter assist rural small businesses.\n  First, as you may know, in 1982 Congress established a 5-year \ngovernment-wide Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, program. This \nprogram has been extended three times, most recently by Public Law 106-\n554, which continues the SBIR program through September 30, 2008. The \nSBIR program was created to help meet the Federal Government's research \nand development needs. Among other things, the SBIR program was \nestablished to stimulate technological innovation related to each \nparticipating agency's goals and missions, to encourage agencies to use \nsmall businesses to meet Federal research and development needs, and to \nincrease private sector commercialization of innovation derived from \nFederal research and development. The SBIR program had awarded over $17 \nbillion to more than 82,000 projects from its inception to 2004.\n  In addition to the SBIR program, Congress also created the Small \nBusiness Technology Transfer, STTR, program. STTR is another important \nsmall business program that expands funding opportunities for small \nbusiness in the area of Federal research and development. This program \nexpands the public/private sector partnership to include joint venture \nopportunities for small businesses and nonprofit research institutions. \nFor example, our university labs are important to the country in that \nthey provide the engine for high-technology innovation. However, if \ninnovation cannot be translated from the classroom or the lab to the \nmarketplace, it cannot benefit the lives of everyday people. STTR \ncombines the strengths of small businesses and universities to transfer \ntechnology/products from the lab to the marketplace. The small \nbusinesses in particular benefit from commercialization, which supports \njobs and the U.S. economy.\n\n  As part of the 2000 Reauthorization of the SBIR program, Congress \nalso created the Federal and State Technology Partnership Program, or \nFAST. FAST was created to strengthen the technological competitiveness \nof small business concerns by providing competitive grants to States to \nhelp support the SBIR program. These grants are traditionally used to \nassist technology transfers by universities to small businesses, \nprovide technical assistance to firms participating in the SBIR \nprogram, and encourage commercialization of technology developed \nthrough SBIR funding. The FAST program has proven vital to States like \nLouisiana, which have traditionally been in the lower tier of States in \nterms of SBIR/STTR awards and total dollars. For example, in fiscal \nyear 2003, Louisiana ranked 44 in terms of total SBIR award dollars out \nof the other 50 States, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. That \nyear Louisiana had 14 Phase I and II awards for a total of $2,373,062. \nCompare that to the 3 ranked State of Maryland which had 325 awards for \n$96,533,591. For this reason, technical assistance provided under FAST \ngrants is extremely important to businesses in my State. In general, \nthe more SBIR\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\napplications that are submitted by small businesses in a State, the \nmore SBIR awards are made in that State.\n  The FAST program has allowed the Louisiana Business and Technology \nCenter, LBTC, located at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, to \nestablish the Louisiana SBIR/STTR Phase Zero Program. This program \nallows LBTC to grant up to $3,000 to companies needed help in writing \nSBIR Phase One grant applications and up to $5,000 for Phase Two \nproposals. One of the companies that benefitted from FAST and the Phase \nZero Program was Mezzo Systems. Mezzo Systems is a provider of design \nanalysis and prototyping services for micro fluidic, optic, magneto, \nand electronic devices. The company was an incubator tenant of the LBTC \nat LSU and I was able to visit with them at the center in 2003. With \nthe support of my office and the LBTC, Mezzo won five SBIR awards \ntotalling $1.3 million. One of these awards was an SBIR grant from the \nDepartment of Defense Missile Defense Agency totalling $750,000.\n  Through the FAST program, several spinoff companies at Louisiana \nTechnical University in Ruston, Louisiana have also received SBIR \nfunding to support research and development related to commercial \napplication of their innovations. This is because Louisiana Tech \nrecognizes the value of expanding the local service network for \ntechnology-based, small and rural businesses through programs like \nFAST.\n  While my State has utilized the FAST program successfully in the \npast, I believe that rural areas, such as Louisiana, need additional \ntechnical assistance to help our small businesses compete in the SBIR \nprogram. In particular, I am concerned about the non-Federal match that \nis required for this program. Currently, each participating State that \nreceives FAST awards is required to match each Federal dollar that is \nprovided with their own funds. I do not oppose this approach as each \nrecipient should put up funds as the Federal Government is putting up \nthe majority of funds for these activities. However, as currently \nstructured, each State in the bottom 18 States receiving the fewest \nSBIR Phase I awards is required to put up 50 cents for each Federal \ndollar. This makes sense as the lower tier of States need additional \ntechnical assistance so they should have an incentive to apply for \nthese grants. Next, each State in 1 of the 16 States receiving the \ngreatest number of Phase I awards are required to match dollar for \ndollar each Federal dollar awarded. States not included in either of \nthese two categories, those in the middle tier, are required to match \n75 cents for each Federal dollar. There was also included a special \nmatch requirement for low-income areas, which is 50 cents for each \nFederal dollar.\n\n  In reviewing this current structure, it is clear that rural areas and \nrural small businesses could benefit from a reduced match requirement \nfor the FAST program. Just as low-income areas and States which are the \nbottom 18 States for SBIR awards are provided a 50-cent match \nrequirement, FAST award recipients in rural areas should be provided a \nreduced match requirement. My bill would make this important revision \nand would also further reduce the match requirement, to 35 cents, for \nFAST grants from rural areas which are also in the bottom 18 States. \nThis increased technical assistance would go a long way and really \nprovide assistance where it is most needed--our rural small businesses \nand universities. Furthermore, this change does not affect the \nallocation of SBIR program awards but does provide rural areas with a \nlevel playing field when competing for these awards.\n  As I mentioned, the SBIR program is set to expire on September 30, \n2008. It is important that we reauthorize this program given its \nimportance to our country, universities and small businesses. Almost as \nimportant as reauthorizing this program is ensuring that the necessary \ntechnical assistance programs are also extended. Small business owners \noften lack the resources and expertise necessary to improve the quality \nof their proposals. That is where programs such as FAST come in to \nhelp. For SBIR/STTR, Congress also created a program which was \nparticularly helpful to rural small businesses. In particular, the \nRural Outreach Program was created by Senator Kit Bond in 1997 to help \nthe lower tier SBIR/STTR States increase their participation and \nsuccess in both programs. Funds under this program helped these 25 \nunderrepresented States establish or expand programs to assist small \nhigh technology businesses through training, counselling, and outreach. \nActivities included workshops, one-on-one counselling for small \nbusinesses, and the expansion of the base of high-technology/economic \ndevelopment service providers.\n  While this program was extremely helpful to rural States like \nLouisiana, President Bush each year tried to cut the program in his \nbudget. Along with Senator John Kerry and six other Senators, in 2004 I \nsent a letter to then SBA Administrator Hector Barreto urging him to \nrestore Rural Outreach Program funds in his fiscal year 2005 budget. \nUnfortunately, it is my understanding that no additional funding was \nprovided and the program was not reauthorized. In my bill I include a \nreauthorization of the Rural Outreach Program. It is my hope to work \nclosely with Senators Bond and Kerry to reauthorize this important \nprogram when we reauthorize the overall SBIR program. I would also note \nthat I believe the Rural Outreach program, which I understand may have \nbeen intended to phase out as the FAST program ramped up, can coexist \nwith the FAST program. With the change included in this bill for the \nFAST program, along with reauthorizing the Rural Outreach Program, the \nStates at the lower tier of SBIR awards would receive the help needed \nmost--technical assistance. Rural States and those at the bottom of the \nrankings in SBIR awards deserve more, not less, technical assistance \ndollars. That is so that they can provide the help necessary to foster \ninnovation and commercialization in their States.\n\n  Next, both the SBIR and STTR programs are administered by the SBA \nOffice of Technology. Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program \nand five agencies participate in the $2 billion STTR program, yet I \nhave repeatedly heard concerns from stakeholders that the Office of \nTechnology is understaffed and overwhelmed. The employees in this \noffice deserve tremendous credit for their service in running these \nvital programs but they also deserve additional help. Groups in my \nState have told me about calling the office for assistance with \nunderstanding SBIR/STTR rules. They indicated that the office was \nhelpful, but slow. For example, when an award is granted, the agency \nadministering the award provides the names of numerous staff members \nthat may be contacted for SBIR reporting, funds management, technical \nassistance, and other needs. There does not appear to be the same \ncapacity for assistance or outreach in the Office of Technology. If one \nconsiders that both SBIR/STTR provide hundreds of awards worth hundreds \nof millions of dollars each year, additional funds for staff to oversee \nthese programs is a wise investment of taxpayer funds. The bill I am \nintroducing today would require SBA to hire five additional employees \nand provide the agency with the funds to hire them.\n  While the Rural Small Business Enhancement Act includes these \nprovisions which focus on existing SBA programs, there also is a need \nfor new programs to help our rural small businesses. The Federal \nGovernment disposes of or sells thousands of unused computers each \nyear. Some of this technology could be better utilized in the hands of \nentrepreneurs in rural communities. Recently, the SBA Office of \nAdvocacy worked with U.S. Department of Agriculture to donate a \nwarehouse of used Department of Health and Human Services computers to \nrural communities. Given that the SBA is charged with promoting \nentrepreneurship in low-income and rural communities, it is a natural \nagency to spearhead an initiative to donate/discount used Federal \ncomputers to rural/low-income areas. According to information provided \nto my office by SBA, the agency currently has about 7,000 desktop \npersonal computers and 2,700 laptops. Some estimates say that perhaps \nas many as 10 percent of these computers are targeted for disposal \nevery month or so. When SBA disposes of these computers, they follow \nGeneral Services Administration guidelines to either dispose of them \nthrough excess property auctions or through contractors. I would like \nto see SBA\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\nhelp address the technology challenges of rural small businesses by \ndonating these used computers to these businesses or offering them at \ndiscounted prices. As such, my bill creates a 3 year pilot program at \nSBA where the agency would provide not less than 1,000 excess \ngovernment computers each year to small businesses in rural areas.\n  Lastly, rural small businesses, just as with businesses in \nmetropolitan areas, need capital to expand or survive. Unfortunately, \nmany smaller lenders which have served rural areas have merged with \nlarger banks in recent years. These local banks are traditionally the \nonly source of capital in the community. To address this issue, my bill \ndirects the Administrator to establish a rural lending outreach \nprogram. This program would provide not more than an 85 percent \nguaranty for loans of $250,000 or less. Since the program is targeted \nfor rural areas, there is a requirement that the program be carried out \nonly through lenders in rural areas. I would note that this particular \nprovision is also included in a bill which I have cosponsored, S. 2920, \nthe ``SBA Reauthorization and Improvement Act'' which was introduced by \nSenators Kerry, Snowe, and Levin.\n\n  In the coming 2 months, both the House and Senate will be working to \nreauthorize the SBIR program. As we reauthorize the SBIR program, \nCongress should not forget the role that rural small businesses and \nuniversities play in fostering innovation and development. For example, \nin Louisiana, we have multiple universities participating in these \nprograms and collaborating with local small businesses. I have already \nmentioned LSU and Louisiana Tech. Louisiana Tech in particular has \nsteadily increased its activity in the SBIR program at a key time for \nthe region. This is because the Barksdale Air Force base located in \nShreveport, which is 70 miles from Ruston, is looking to secure the \npermanent Cyber Command. This command would protect the United States \nfrom cyber warfare. All of the universities, colleges, and parishes in \nthis area are collaborating on securing this command, which could mean \nthousands of jobs for the region. As they look to attract additional \ntechnology-based businesses, the SBIR/STTR program has proven to be an \nimportant economic development tool for local businesses and \ncommunities. For my part, I want to ensure that universities like \nLouisiana Tech in rural areas have every opportunity to compete on a \nlevel playing field for SBIR dollars. I also would like to provide our \nrural small businesses with the tools necessary to partner with these \ninstitutions to commercialize the products of their research. The bill \nI introduce today would accomplish both of these goals and, in the \nprocess, it would improve the ability of SBA to assist rural small \nbusinesses. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \nlegislation as we must foster development in our rural small \nbusinesses. Without these businesses, our country cannot truly compete \non the international stage.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a disclosure requirement under the Medicare program for \nphysicians referring for imaging services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nMedicare Imaging Disclosure Sunshine Act of 2008.\n  I agreed to a short-term Medicare extension bill last December with \nthe understanding that this would give us the opportunity to include \nother priorities in a bipartisan Medicare package this year. One of the \nsignificant issues I had hoped to address was the lack of transparency \nin physician self-referrals for imaging services in the Medicare \nprogram.\n  The recently-enacted Medicare bill requires accreditation for \nproviders of the technical component of advanced diagnostic imaging \nservices such as magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, computed tomography, \nCT, scans, and positron emission tomography, PET, and it establishes a \ndemonstration project to assess appropriate physician use of these \nservices. However, Mr. President, the legislation regrettably fails to \naddress an issue that has contributed significantly to the rapid growth \nin Medicare spending for imaging services: physician self-referrals for \nimaging services in their offices and in facilities where they own or \nlease advanced imaging equipment. According to a June 2008 report of \nthe Government Accountability Office, Medicare Part B spending for \nimaging services more than doubled in 6 years, growing from $6.89 \nbillion in 2000 to $14.11 billion in 2006. During this time, the \npercentage of Medicare spending on imaging services provided in \nphysician offices grew from 58 percent, about $4 billion, in 2000 to 64 \npercent, about $9 billion, in 2006. Spending on advanced imaging \nservices, such as MRIs, CT scans, and nuclear medicine, also grew \nsubstantially faster than other imaging services.\n  Beneficiaries need more transparency and disclosure of potential \nconflicts of interest when physicians write referrals for imaging \nservices. An imaging disclosure provision was included in the Medicare \nbill that I introduced in June, and it was included in the agreement \nthat Senator Baucus and I reached for this year's Medicare bill. The \nprovision was not onerous nor was it overly proscriptive: it merely \nrequired referring physicians to disclose any conflict of interest \nrelated to their ownership of advanced imaging facilities or equipment. \nPatients still would be free to choose their physicians' imaging \nfacility or equipment or to go elsewhere. Unfortunately, the imaging \ndisclosure provision was dropped from the Medicare bill that Congress \nenacted once the process became partisan.\n  It is for this reason that I am introducing this bill. The Medicare \nImaging Disclosure Sunshine Act does just what the name implies: it \nrequires referring physicians to shed some light on their relationship \nto imaging facilities and equipment they own by disclosing that \nownership interest and providing beneficiaries with a list of \nalternative providers. The referring physician is required to inform \nthe individual in writing at the time of referral that he or she can \nobtain imaging services elsewhere if they choose to do so and to \nprovide a list of imaging suppliers located where the individual \nresides. The imaging services covered by the requirement include MRIs, \nCT scans, PET, and other radiology services specified as designated \nhealth services that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ndetermines appropriate. The requirement would be effective in January \n2010.\n  Technology has made great advances in imaging services in recent \nyears, and improvements in imaging hold much promise for earlier and \nmore accurate diagnoses of life-threatening diseases which often may \nlead to improved outcomes for patients. But we must do more to help \ncontrol the potential for overutilization of imaging services. The \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, and others have \nexpressed serious concerns that the sizeable growth in the volume of \nimaging services needs to be addressed. In March 2005, MedPAC \nrecommended that the Secretary of HHS establish standards for providers \nof diagnostic imaging services and measure physicians' use of imaging \nservices with their peers. Those recommendations were addressed to some \ndegree in the Medicare bill that Congress enacted. However, another key \nMedPAC recommendation--that the Secretary of HHS strengthen the rules \nlimiting physicians' financial incentives to order imaging services--\nunfortunately was ignored.\n  The June 2008 GAO Report noted that physicians in specialties other \nthan radiology generated an increasing share of revenue from in-office \nimaging services from 2000 to 2006. They also found that in-office \nimaging spending per beneficiary, like other Medicare spending, varied \nwidely across geographic regions of the country. By 2006, in-office \nimaging spending per beneficiary varied from $62 in Vermont to $472 in \nFlorida, nearly eight times as much. This raises additional concerns \nabout overuse since research on geographic variations on health care \nspending shows that, generally, providing more services does not lead \nto improved health care outcomes. In GAO's view, the shift in imaging \nservices from hospital settings to physician offices has the potential \nto encourage overuse in light of the financial incentives that exist \nfor physicians to supplement lower professional fees for interpreting \nimaging tests with relatively higher fees for performing the tests. \nThey concluded that physician ownership of imaging equipment is a way \nto generate additional revenue for a practice.\n  The Medicare Imaging Disclosure Sunshine Act will provide another \nnecessary tool to address the significant increase in Medicare spending \nfor in-office imaging services by providing more transparency and \nshedding some light on physician referrals to facilities and medical \nimaging equipment they own. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 3345. A bill to promote the capture and sequestration of carbon \ndioxide, to promote the use of energy produced from coal, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Future Fuels \nAct of 2008. Put simply, I think coal--especially clean coal--is a \ncritical part of the solution to America's energy independence and to \nour national security. The bill I will describe this morning presents \nseveral technological options that will help put us on a path toward \nachieving greater energy independence, while also tackling the grave \nthreat to human health, property, and the world's economy that is \nglobal climate change.\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\n  I know that there are some, in this chamber and around the country, \nwho would demonize coal. But the reality is that coal is what we have--\nin abundance. We just can't ignore this resource or the incredible \npotential that it has not just to generate electricity, but as a \npotential transportation fuel source. The challenges that we face \ntoday--and they are challenges which I firmly believe can be overcome \nwith the right combination of resources and American know-how--is how \nto use coal to produce energy in cleaner ways than we do now, and to \naccelerate development of carbon capture and sequestration, CCS, \ntechnologies to see to it that we don't make our current climate \nproblems worse.\n  In addition to the bill I am introducing today, in West Virginia we \nhave been working with major companies and our coal industry to promote \nsome exciting next generation projects that will produce a range of \nvalue-added products out of coal--electricity, chemical feedstocks, \nfertilizer, diesel and aviation fuels. If we can pull off what we are \ntrying to do, it will be, in a word, transformational.\n  My colleagues know that from Maine to California, West Virginia to \nWashington State, our constituents are paying more at the gasoline \npump, in the supermarket aisles, and for virtually everything else. \nAmerican families are being crushed by the weight of the rising cost of \nliving--especially our seniors, veterans, and low-income families, who \noften live on fixed incomes. They are looking for solutions, not \nlengthy and circular debates on how this energy crisis came about and \nwho is to blame for not fixing it. They are looking for the people they \nsent to Washington to examine all the options, work together for the \ncommon good, and to stop playing partisan or parochial games.\n  As a Senator from West Virginia, I can tell you that the people of my \nState know a thing or two about coal. They know that from small towns \nto major cities, from the Capitol building to the Vegas strip, coal \ngenerates nearly 50 percent of the Nation's electricity. It lights our \nhomes, schools, and workplaces, and while the summer sun beats down, \ncoal-burning power plants keep us cool. West Virginians, like so many \nothers in this country who have considered our energy options, \nunderstand that coal also has the potential to run our cars and trucks \nand keep our planes flying. West Virginians--like the relatively few of \nus who are proud to call ourselves Coal State Senators--understand that \nthe only thing keeping us from turning this promise into a reality is a \nlaser-focused commitment from our government and the Nation's \nindustries to unleash good old American ingenuity.\n  The Future Fuels Act can be the foundation for our efforts. In a way \nnot seen since the Manhattan Project helped us win World War II, and at \nleast not since we fulfilled President Kennedy's promise to put a man \non the Moon and bring him safely back to Earth, the Future Fuels Act \nwould bring together the best minds in government and the private \nsector to figure out commercially viable solutions to carbon capture \nand sequestration. In achieving what is undoubtedly the greatest \nenvironmental challenge of this century, the best minds throughout the \nworld, working together, will renew the promise of a better standard of \nliving that coal showed the world at the dawn of the industrial age. \nFor Americans blessed with abundant reserves of this resource, the \nFuture Fuels Act can allow coal to be the source of most of the clean \nenergy we must have in the coming decades.\n\n  I understand there are those who believe that coal can never be part \nof the solution, because its detractors have made it such a poster \nchild of the problem. Let's be honest. No energy policy choice can be \nmade that does not have an environmental consequence. Oil drilling \nobviously does--and mining coal does, as well.\n  But it is not just the use of fossil fuels that has consequences. \nWind power probably has more than its fair share of detractors, due to \nperceived threats to migratory birds and bats, and what some consider \nan unacceptable disruption of scenic vistas. Ethanol has been blamed \nfor rising food prices and for the minimal value of the energy it \nproduces relative to its production costs. Nuclear energy is touted by \nits proponents as a carbon-free option that should have its share of \nthe nation's electricity generation expanded. Yet we have never figured \nout what to do about the permanent storage of, and human health and \nsafety concerns regarding, highly radioactive waste with a half-life \nmeasured in tens of thousands of years. It is clear to me, at least, \nthat the fundamentally flawed Yucca Mountain plan is not the answer. \nNatural gas-powered plants emit somewhat less than coal-fired plants, \nbut are still not clean. In any event, installing new gas pipelines or \ntrying to open a liquefied natural gas terminal inevitably runs \nutilities into the classic problem of ``not in my backyard,'' or NIMBY. \nThe point is we need to find energy alternatives that are accessible, \ncan be used wisely, preserve our standard of living, and make positive \nstrides to heal our broken world.\n  Anyone who has watched the nightly news lately or who has read a \nnewsmagazine in the last several years knows that global climate change \nis no longer cloaked in uncertainty or shrouded in doubt. The sheer \nrepetition of major meteorological calamities renders discussion of \n``storms of the century'' mute. Meanwhile, all too frequently floods, \nhurricanes, and typhoons are characterized as ``500-year events.'' \nWe've watched the floodwaters rise in the heartland of America, forest \nfires rage out West, and both our Atlantic and Pacific coastlines \nbattered by more common storms. The permafrost in the Arctic Tundra is \nthawing and releasing methane, and the polar ice caps are melting. \nGrowing seasons are changing, and temperate zones are shifting. The \ndamaging effects of global climate change are not suffered only by \nhumanity; an increasing number of plant and animal species are facing \nextinction.\n  Whether you believe that climate change is happening or not; whether \nyou accept the science of it all, or not, is beside the point. One \nthing is clear--we can't afford to be wrong, and doing nothing is not \nan option any longer. Our national policy can not be to merely clean up \nafter more and more terrible weather affects more and more parts of the \ncountry--we'll go steadily more bankrupt if we do. We need to start \naddressing the root cause of it all--and that means fundamental changes \nin the ways we harness the immense power of fossil fuels, like coal, \nand permanent solutions for the carbon produced.\n  To do this, my legislation will expand incentives for clean coal \ntechnologies, establish an incentive to capture a potent greenhouse gas \ncurrently being vented into the atmosphere, create a low-cost program \nto promote responsible conversion of coal to transportation fuels, help \ndevelop new pipeline networks connecting the coalfields to the gas \npump, and devote substantial resources to enable government and private \nsector scientists to turn the corner on commercially viable CCS.\n  The United States has more than a 250-year supply of coal stored \nbeneath the hills of Appalachia and in several places around the \ncountry. To use this abundance in a responsible and environmentally \nappropriate way, the Future Fuels Act will do the following:\n  It will expand tax incentive and clean coal energy bond programs in \ncurrent law designed to defray costs incurred by investor-owned \nutilities and public power providers when they choose advanced clean \ncoal technologies to replace and supplement our current fleet of \nelectricity generating plants. We have provided money for this purpose \nover the last decade, but given the scope of the challenge, we have up \nuntil now provided pennies on the dollar. The Future Fuels Act will \nprovide $10.3 billion--$8.3 billion in expanded clean coal tax \nincentives and an additional $2 billion for municipal and cooperative \nenergy providers in clean coal energy bonds.\n  It will establish a new incentive available to companies that mine \ncoal underground to capture and sequester methane. Methane is more than \n20 times as potent a heat-trapping greenhouse gas as an equal volume of \ncarbon dioxide. It is liberated as a natural byproduct of the \nexcavation of coal, and is currently vented to prevent explosions and \nto purify the air coal miners breathe. This incentive would allow coal \ncompanies that voluntarily capture methane and prevent it from being\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\nreleased into the atmosphere to offset some of the costs of that \ncapture.\n  It will create a ``stand-by'' loan program for development of \nenvironmentally responsible coal conversion facilities. Coal-based fuel \ndevelopers would receive no Federal funds to build or operate their \nfacilities, but would be able to tap into a loan program with strict \nrepayment terms when the world price of oil drops below a figure to be \nset in statute. As a frustrating summer of high gasoline prices and \nairlines teetering on the edge of collapse because of high jet fuel \ncosts makes clear, we need a new set of solutions to meet our energy \ndemand. The Future Fuels Act will move us toward a time when we can run \nour cars, trucks, planes, and trains with domestic coal-derived fuel.\n  It will establish a tax incentive for the construction of pipeline \ninfrastructure to bring coal-based fuels to the marketplace. Because \nour current network of oil and gas pipelines serves, naturally, where \noil and gas is found, it may not be adequate or geographically able to \nserve new sources of fuels in the coalfields of Appalachia and other \nregions of the country where coal conversion facilities might be built. \nThis incentive would encourage pipeline companies to build out to new \nlocations with untapped potential in coal reserves.\n  But the Future Fuels Act is not just about using coal. It is about \nmeeting the challenge of using coal in the carbon-constrained future we \nknow is coming. The Future Fuels Act does this by harnessing the \nwisdom, scientific knowledge, and creativity of both government \nscientists and their private sector counterparts.\n  First, it would put into motion the kind of massive research, \ndevelopment, demonstration, and technology deployment program we should \nhave seen from the current Administration, which had promised to be a \nfriend to coal, only to walk away from ongoing coal initiatives in our \nFederal laboratories. Instead of doing the work that would establish a \nsustainable future for coal, the Administration first denied climate \nchange was a problem, and then cut the fossil fuel R Consequently, \nwe have lost eight years' worth of serious efforts to develop \ncommercial-scale carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS, options. \nThis is utterly inexcusable, but by increasing the size and investment \nin government CCS R, my legislation attempts to make up for that lost \ntime. Our national labs have done groundbreaking work, especially West \nVirginia, but they have not been given the resources they need to truly \naccelerate their research and make it commercially available. In \ncontrast, this legislation would authorize $650 million over the next 5 \nfiscal years to develop commercial-scale carbon sequestration \ndemonstrations in multiple geological and terrestrial formations, with \nthe goal of storing 1 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.\n\n  Finally, my bill would create the Future Fuels Corporation, FFC, a \npublicly funded but privately operated institution with two primary \ngoals. First, the FFC accelerate research--and more importantly, \ncommercial deployment--of CCS technologies. Without the combination of \nbrainpower and private sector dedication to deadlines and results we \nmay never get CCS technologies off the drawing board and on to power \nplants and other industrial emitting facilities.\n  Second, the FFC will work to create new technologies and new \nproduction processes to enable the production of coal-based \ntransportation fuels that are not only cleaner than petroleum-based \nfuels in use today, but which are made in plants that are cleaner, and \nwhich cause less environmental disruption than drilling for oil.\n  Like so many of the other legislative responses to the current energy \nand economic crisis, my legislation is not a ``silver bullet.'' It is, \nhowever, a sincere attempt to offer American solutions to what is both \nan American and a global problem.\n  We can never be truly energy ``independent,'' but we must resolve to \nbe more energy ``resilient.'' We can do that when we tap into coal's \nstill unbound potential. Likewise, we cannot expect the serious problem \nof global climate change to fix itself. The combination of our abundant \ncoal and the innovative potential of the greatest scientists, \ntechnicians, and researchers in American business, academia, and \ngovernment can make the energy resources of Saudi Arabia seem like a \ndrop in the bucket. We need to foster policies to unleash these \nbrilliant men and women to find and prove a range of carbon storage \nsolutions, and then watch a waiting world beat a path to our doorstep.\n  Known American coal reserves can produce electricity at current \nrates--and be converted to transportation fuels in sufficient amounts \nto supplant more than the petroleum we import from the Persian Gulf and \nelsewhere--for two centuries or more. No American president will have \nto call up the Guard and Reserve to secure the coalfields, and no \nAmerican parent will have trouble falling asleep because they're \nconcerned about the safety of their son or daughter in uniform because \nthe people who own the energy don't much like the American presence \nnear the energy.\n  That is why the Future Fuels Act is so important, and why I commend \nit to my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3345\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
